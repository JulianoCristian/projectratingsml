Some lessons learned included: both the\n            federal and local restructuring components provided support\n            to develop or amend federal and municipal reforms in housing\n            and utility services management as an integral part of\n            increased management capacity of the federal and municipal\n            level. The comprehensive approach to voluntary out-migration\n            was essential in the effective demonstration of the\n            cost-effective interventions supported by the project. The\n            out-migration supported included essential elements such as\n            voluntary outmigration, choice of recipient location, local\n            restructuring plans, comprehensive information, and public\n            relations campaigns. Projects' design should build\n            flexibility to adjust on the basis of experience during\n            implementation; project legal documentation should reflect\n            this flexibility and implementation particularities should\n            be included in the operational manual. Selection of a\n            limited number of participating municipalities and using a\n            pilot as the vehicle was the right instrument to test\n            measures to support and expand

These actions include: 1) voluntary\n            out-migration assistance schemes for people whose economic\n            prospects are limited; and 2) measures that will allow\n            municipalities to realize potential economic benefits\n            resulting from a decreased population. Beside a project\n            management component, there are four main components: 1) The\n            Migration Assistance Component facilitates the out-migration\n            of specific groups of population in the participating\n            regions. Allowances are given for housing and transport of\n            household belongings and plane/train tickets. 2) The Local\n            Restructuring Support Component provides technical\n            assistance to help participating municipalities to reduce\n            their dilapidated and unused housing stock, and implements\n            reforms in housing and utility services management. 3) The\n            Monitoring and Evaluation Component monitors the process,\n            and evaluates the economic outcomes of restructuring, social\n            aspects of out-migration, and the evaluation and\n            dissemination of project outcomes. 4) The Federal Component\n            helps introduce regulatory procedures aimed at gradually\n            deregulating the Northern economy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation - Northern Restructuring Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Russian Federation - Northern\n            Restructuring
