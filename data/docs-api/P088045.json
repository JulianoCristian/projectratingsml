Some lessons learned includes: when there are\n            strong uncertainties, political volatilities and\n            institutional weaknesses, project should be as focused as\n            possible, avoiding disparate components. The project\n            financed only the very initial steps of licensing\n            harmonization. A much longer term agenda should have been\n            anticipated. Intensified efforts, carried out in the field\n            by the Bank Team are extremely crucial when the country and\n            institutions are still weak. Task managing the project from\n            Albania was a major advantage in the last stage of the\n            project and proved to be very positive.
