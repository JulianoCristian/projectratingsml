Lessons\n            learned centered on the subproject selection process\n            (inadequate preparation, lobbying by local governments and\n            pressures on consultants to manipulate analysis). In future\n            programmatic projects, particular attention has to be given\n            to avoid \"scaling up\" the original project design\n            when government capacity and commitment are weak. Second,\n            the Bank team was originally supposed to supervise the\n            supervisors. This was an ineffective strategy because of the\n            weak staffing of Provincial Project Management Units and\n            poorly performing consultants, largely hired locally. In\n            future projects, project management staffing at different\n            levels should be screened and approved by the Bank.\n            Similarly, the consulting firms shortlisted for bidding\n            should be screened more closely regarding their competence\n            and previous performance record. Other lessons for the Bank\n            regarded more systematic follow-up, the need for early Bank\n            management involvement and prompt action on suspected\n            corruption, timely use of Bank remedies, the importance of\n            paying attention to cultural factors. Particular lessons for\n            the Government related to the need for using suitable\n            intermediaries, defining clearly the responsibilities\n            (including fiscal)of the central, provincial and local\n            governments, defining the government's responsibility\n            for supervision, the need to improve the incentive system,\n            giving priority to the training program, the need for close\n            monitoring and supervision, following a systematic process\n            of consultant screening and evaluation, lack of attention to\n            bank-recommended tools such as the preparation and regular\n            updating of the Revenue Improvement Action Plan (RIAP) and\n            the use of the Performance-Oriented Maintenance Management\n            Systems (POMMS), and the lack of attention to operation and\n            maintenance. Shared lessons comprised strengthening\n            financial management oversight, consultant selection and\n            professional management, strengthening the  procurement\n            system, and technical audits and completion certification. A\n            major lesson is that it is necessary to make communities\n            aware of the project scope and objectives through an active\n            socialization process based on meetings, workshops and focus\n            group discussions using local facilitators when needed. An\n            important part of the socialization process should be to let\n            people know where to go if they are not satisfied with the\n            project's outcome. Thus the project preparation period\n            should include the project socialization process as well.\n            This requires more active focus on the public information\n            function by making, if necessary, translations of relevant\n            Bank documents for local use."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Second Sulawesi Urban\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Second Sulawesi Urban\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/03/3169312/indonesia-second-sulawesi-urban-development-project","projn":"ID-Second Sulawesi Urban Development Project\n            -- P036053","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Municipal Financial Management,Urban Services to the Poor,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20040415120627"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways,Other social services,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting,assets,auditing,Bank\n            Performance,Bank supervision,banks,basic services,capacity\n            building,capitals,communities,decentralization,economic\n            development,economic growth,employment,financial\n            management,financial management systems,financing\n            sources,FISCAL YEAR,garbage collection,infrastructure\n            services,Institutional Development,large cities,Local\n            Government,local government revenue,local governments,local\n            regulations,local revenue,municipal\n            management,municipalities,neighborhood,neighborhoods,provincial\n            governments,public infrastructure,Public Works,road\n            construction,Roads,sanitation,slums,social services,solid\n            waste disposal,technical assistance,town\n            planning,transport,Treasury,urban areas,Urban\n            Development,urban environmental conditions,Urban\n            Infrastructure,Urban Management,urban management tools,Urban\n            Planning,urban policies,urban projects,Urban Roads,urban\n            sector,urban services,Waste,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounting,assets,auditing,Bank\n            Performance,Bank supervision,banks,basic services,capacity\n            building,capitals,communities,decentralization,economic\n            development,economic growth,employment,financial\n            management,financial management systems,financing\n            sources,FISCAL YEAR,garbage collection,infrastructure\n            services,Institutional Development,large cities,Local\n            Government,local government revenue,local governments,local\n            regulations,local revenue,municipal\n            management,municipalities,neighborhood,neighborhoods,provincial\n            governments,public infrastructure,Public Works,road\n            construction,Roads,sanitation,slums,social services,solid\n            waste disposal,technical assistance,town\n            planning,transport,Treasury,urban areas,Urban\n            Development,urban environmental conditions,Urban\n            Infrastructure,Urban Management,urban management tools,Urban\n            Planning,urban policies,urban projects,Urban Roads,urban\n            sector,urban services,Waste,Water Supply"}},"owner":"Urban Development Sector Unit (EASUR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF032155-INDONESIA - SULAWESI TOWNS\n            ASST. & DEV.
