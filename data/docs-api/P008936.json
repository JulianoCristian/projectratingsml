of experts to help TPAO in specialized areas of\n            carbonategeology, reservoir geology, geophysical data\n            control and interpretation and training of TPAO and Ministry\n            of Energy staff, in the fields of geology, geochemistry and\n            geophysics and provision of experts to help GDPA play an\n            effective role in attracting foreign participation in\n            exploration; (iii) seismic geophysical surveys including\n            data interpretation in southeastern Turkey, by two seismic\n            crews each for two years; (iv) exploratory drilling of four\n            to six medium-depth wells about 3000 meters deep, based on\n            the results of geophysical and geological studies and\n            seismic surveys; (v) a progam of energy audits in the power\n            generating sub-sector and a group of selected industrial\n            sub-sectors, with a view to improve energy efficiency and\n            promote energy conservation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Petroleum Exploration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Petroleum Exploration
