The Project was the second International\n            Development Association (IDA) credit to the health,\n            nutrition, and population sector in Ghana. The objectives of\n            the project were to: (a) improve the quality and coverage of\n            health services; and (b) increase the availability and\n            accessibility of family planning services. The project was\n            originally divided into six components: (a) drug supplies\n            and drug infrastructure rehabilitation; (b) strengthening\n            the Ministry of Health ; (c) regional and district\n            hospitals; (d) primary health care (PHC) ; (e) population\n            and family planning; and (f) a prizes fund to provide\n            incentives to health workers and communities. As a means of\n            improving equity, the project emphasized PHC services in\n            three under-served, northern regions of the country. The\n            Borrower's performance was, on the whole, satisfactory.\n            The overall performance of IDA was satisfactory. Key lessons\n            learned from the project experience are as follows: (a) an\n            overly prescriptive design, having the nature of a\n            multiple-year blueprint, was not appropriate for the type of\n            complex institutional changes that were being addressed; b)\n            moving the management of the project more directly into the\n            mainstream of the MOH was important; (c) the use of the\n            mid-term review was critical to resuscitating the project;\n            and (d) supervision of civil works in the Ghana health\n            sector needs to change."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Second Health and Population Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Second Health and\n            Population Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/06/726986/ghana-second-health-population-project","count":"Ghana","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accessibility,architects,clinics,communicable\n            diseases,communities,contraceptives,deaths,decentralization,districts,economic\n            growth,engineers,family planning,financial management,health\n            centers,health expenditures,health policy,health\n            sector,health services,health system,health systems,hospital\n            equipment,hospitals,housing,infant mortality,infant\n            mortality rate,managers,medical\n            equipment,meningitis,mortality,NGOs,Nutrition,outpatient\n            services,partnership,performance\n            indicators,pharmacists,pharmacy,physicians,primary\n            care,primary health care,Rehabilitation,research\n            projects,rural areas,supervision,SUSTAINABILITY,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"accessibility,architects,clinics,communicable\n            diseases,communities,contraceptives,deaths,decentralization,districts,economic\n            growth,engineers,family planning,financial management,health\n            centers,health expenditures,health policy,health\n            sector,health services,health system,health systems,hospital\n            equipment,hospitals,housing,infant mortality,infant\n            mortality rate,managers,medical\n            equipment,meningitis,mortality,NGOs,Nutrition,outpatient\n            services,partnership,performance\n            indicators,pharmacists,pharmacy,physicians,primary\n            care,primary health care,Rehabilitation,research\n            projects,rural areas,supervision,SUSTAINABILITY,workers"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Human development,Public sector governance","projn":"GH-Health & Pop.
