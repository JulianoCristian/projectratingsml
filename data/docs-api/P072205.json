Some lessons learned included: EMTA\n            ownership waxed and waned over the course of the loan and\n            was especially weak at the end of the project when turnover\n            and inability to provide final output data were especially\n            problematic. The relatively slow start-up and lack of\n            disbursement might have been mitigated by preparing\n            procurement processes as part of credit preparation and\n            providing training to the project implementers. Additional\n            supervision resources are likely to be needed. There is no\n            indication this was done. The Bank and Government should\n            work to minimize team turnover. Client turnover at the\n            beginning and end of the project were problems otherwise the\n            situation was stable. Having long serving Task Managers\n            residing in country for such a difficult project/country\n            situation is highly desirable. Building relationships,\n            working through problems, maintaining close contact\n            -something that would not have been possible from outside\n            the country proved essential. Lessons Learned are important\n            and are ignored at the team's risk. A number of the\n            lessons above if taken more seriously would have benefited\n            EMTA. Operationally, investments in procurement capacity are\n            important. Preparing procurement processes prior to approval\n            can also help."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Angola - Economic Management Technical\n            Assistance

The team considers the\n            reallocation: 1) as a project change within the meaning of\n            OP/BP 13.05 (project supervision); 2) does not involve the\n            use of cost of project savings, specifically as per footnote\n            three to OP 13.25; and 3) does not involve any new change to\n            the original project description. Further, the team\n            considers the reallocation to be a minor one within the\n            meaning of OP/PB 13.05. Finally, the reallocation will not\n            result in significant changes to the project's\n            description, objectives, or associated outcome targets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Angola - Economic Management\n            Technical Assistance Project : restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/02/13848853/angola-economic-management-technical-assistance-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"AO-Econ Mgmt Ta (Fy03) -- P072205","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Debt Markets,Housing & Human Habitats,Emerging Markets,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Angola","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20110301225018"},"subsc":"Banking,Sub-national government administration,Payments, settlements, and remittance systems,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Audits, borrower, CURRENCY, description,\n            Equipment, Exchange Rate, expenditure, expenditures,\n            financial management, financial management requirements,\n            financial policies, financial report, IP, original amount,\n            performance indicators, portfolio, public investment,\n            result, Results, savings, Supervision, targets, TECHNICAL\n            ASSISTANCE, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT, transparency"}},"owner":"Public Sector Reform & Capacity (AFTPR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Technical Assistance Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF092213-ANGOLA - STRENGTHENING PUBLIC\n            SECTOR GOVERNANCE CAPACITY IN THE WORLD B","repnb":"59909"},"13312728":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2010/12/13312728/angola-economic-management-technical-assistance-project-restructuring-vol-1-2-main-report","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2010/12/13312728/angola-economic-management-technical-assistance-project-restructuring-vol-1-2-main-report","new_url":"2010/12/13312728/angola-economic-management-technical-assistance-project-restructuring-vol-1-2-main-report","disclosure_date":"2011-01-03T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2011/01/03/000333037_20110103234234/Rendered/INDEX/587650PJPR00P011as0revised0by0AFTOS.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2011/01/03/000333037_20110103234234/Rendered/PDF/587650PJPR00P011as0revised0by0AFTOS.pdf","credit_no":"3744;Q262","docdt":"2010-12-30T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2011-01-03T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"2","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Angola - Economic Management Technical\n            Assistance Project : restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Economic Management Technical\n            Assistance Project (EMTA) supports Government of Angola\n            (GoA) efforts to improve efficiency and transparency of\n            public resource management, by improving the institutional\n            framework and building capacity in relevant public\n            institutions to articulate and implement public investment\n            and financial policies and processes.

With a reformulation of the\n            project development objectives (DO), the changes are meant\n            to: (a) clarify the DO and results that EMTA is supporting,\n            (b) modify the project performance indicators to ensure\n            alignment with results by dropping some and adding new\n            performance indicators, (c) adapt activities planned to the\n            current situation by dropping activities and adding a few\n            ones, (d) reallocate the Credit, and (e) provide an adequate\n            time frame for seeking clearly defined sustainable results\n            by extending the closing date by 24 months from December\n            31,2007 to December 31,2009. The main reasons for\n            restructuring are the following. a) Design. Project\n            preparation was accelerated after the April 2002 Peace\n            Accords to ensure Bank's support through this operation\n            would be swiftly available. At that time, the need to speed\n            up preparation led to some design issues, essentially an\n            over-ambitious project in scope with very optimistic\n            disbursements projections, a large number of activities and\n            low cost estimates; b) Implementation. The project suffered\n            from a lack of stable leadership on both the Bank's and\n            Government side. This situation led to a slowdown in the\n            first months and low initial disbursement. This initial\n            delay makes it necessary to adjust the timeline; c) Changing\n            environment.
