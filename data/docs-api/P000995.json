The original main project objective was to\n            build up, over a three-year period, the capacity within the\n            Ministry of Rural Development and Fisheries (MDRP) which was\n            divided in two separate ministries: Ministry of Rural\n            Development and Agriculture(MDRA) and Ministry of Fisheries\n            (MP) to: i) manage its human resources with particular\n            attention to technical assistance; (ii) plan activities in\n            the agricultural sector and coordinate external aid; (iii)\n            fulfill its technical role in the different agriculture\n            subsectors; and (iv) ensure monitoring of sectoral\n            implementation and impact of the Government's\n            Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) of 1987 - 1988. The\n            overall project outcome is judged unsatisfactory because\n            there was a large disproportion between project costs and\n            benefits. Bank performance was rated as satisfactory.\n            Overall, the performance of the borrower was rated as\n            deficient. Key Lessons Learned were as follows:(a)better\n            project design and preparation;(b)borrower's\n            ownership;(c) better monitoring of the human resources\n            capacity building and performance;(d)upfront training in\n            important aspects of proiect management and bank\n            guidelines;and(e)sharpening the research and extension linkages."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea Bissau - Agricultural Services Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea Bissau - Agricultural\n            Services Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/06/733765/guinea-bissau-agricultural-services-project","projn":"GW-Agr Services -- P000995","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,ICT Policy and Strategies,Agricultural Research,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Development Economics & Aid Effectiveness","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Information and Communication Technologies,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Guinea-Bissau","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!West Africa"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961029215329"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Information and Communication Technologies,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adaptability,adaptation,agricultural\n            development,Agricultural Research,Agriculture,Aide\n            Memoire,audit reports,Capacity Building,crops,data\n            collection,development,development cooperation,development\n            objectives,development policy,development\n            strategy,employment,equipment,exports,extension,FAO,Farmers,financial\n            management,Fisheries,food crops,food crops\n            research,Forestry,fruits,Gender,human resource\n            management,human resources\n            management,internalization,Irrigation,lands,livestock,management,Managers,National\n            Agricultural Research,natural resource\n            management,NGOs,Poverty reduction,priorities,Private\n            sector,Public sector,rice,Rural Development,Structural\n            Adjustment,Sustainability,technical\n            assistance,technicians,training seminars,UNDP,United Nations,USAID"},"1":{"cdata!":"adaptability,adaptation,agricultural\n            development,Agricultural Research,Agriculture,Aide\n            Memoire,audit reports,Capacity Building,crops,data\n            collection,development,development cooperation,development\n            objectives,development policy,development\n            strategy,employment,equipment,exports,extension,FAO,Farmers,financial\n            management,Fisheries,food crops,food crops\n            research,Forestry,fruits,Gender,human resource\n            management,human resources\n            management,internalization,Irrigation,lands,livestock,management,Managers,National\n            Agricultural Research,natural resource\n            management,NGOs,Poverty reduction,priorities,Private\n            sector,Public sector,rice,Rural Development,Structural\n            Adjustment,Sustainability,technical\n            assistance,technicians,training seminars,UNDP,United Nations,USAID"}},"owner":"WB:Dakar-FmcAFR1:SN/CV/CM/GW/MR (AFCF1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Technical Assistance Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF024970-GUINEA-BISSAU AGRICULTURE SERV.
