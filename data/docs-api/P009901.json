Some lessons learned\n            included: for most of the project components engineering and\n            preparation of bid documents, part of which was to be\n            financed under the first Karnataka Power Project loan had\n            not been completed and the necessary government clearances\n            had not been obtained. Submission of the project to the\n            Board was therefore premature. When determining the most\n            suitable options for the repair of the Talakalale dam\n            technical as well as cost factors should have been given\n            equal consideration. Too much time was and money was lost in\n            discussing a technically controversial and expensive\n            solution, while other technically acceptable, lower cost\n            options were also being proposed. The withdrawal of the\n            environmental clearance for the STRS shows that changing\n            public attitudes on issues such as the environment could\n            adversely affect the construction progress of a project at\n            any stage. A more rigorous risk analysis should have been\n            carried out since not all mediatory studies had been\n            completed by the time the project went to the Board."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
