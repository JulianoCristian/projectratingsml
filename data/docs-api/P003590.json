Lessons\n            learned: Strong support and a high degree of commitment from\n            government at all levels is a precondition of the\n            project's successful implementation. A strong and\n            adequately supported central Project Management Office (PMO)\n            is essential for the success of the project. Active\n            participation of beneficiaries throughout the project life\n            is essential for effective implementation and a better sense\n            of ownership. Effective institution building, including an\n            emphasis on PMO's stability and continuity, is the\n            foundation for successfully implementing a highly complex\n            project. Putting rural infrastructure first will ensure that\n            benefits of activities under other components can be\n            maximized. Building flexibility into the project design will\n            empower the project to accommodate a changing environment.\n            Promoting farmers' human capital development will\n            strengthen the project's sustainability. Ensuring the\n            independence of micro-finance institutions in its business\n            operation is one of key conditions for achieving its\n            financial sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Qinba Mountains Poverty Reduction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Qinba Mountains Poverty\n            Reduction Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6105758/china-qinba-mountains-poverty-reduction-project","projn":"CN-Qinba Mountains Poverty Reduction Project\n            -- P003590","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20050728104600"},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,General transportation sector,General education sector,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Transportation,Education,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"absolute poverty, accountability,\n            accounting, agricultural production, annual growth rate,\n            auditing, average growth rate, Bank Performance,\n            beneficiaries, capacity building, capital base, capital\n            loans, CAS, cash income, commercial loans, community\n            participation, Currency Unit, data quality, debt,\n            development planning, drinking water, economic activities,\n            economic conditions, economic development, employment,\n            environmental degradation, environmental protection, Ethnic\n            Minorities, Exchange Rate, expenditures, farm households,\n            field surveys, financial sector, financial sustainability,\n            FISCAL YEAR, fishing, flexibility, food consumption, food\n            production, food security, forestry, government\n            intervention, housing, human capital, ICR, impact\n            evaluation, IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT, improved\n            access, incidence of poverty, income generation, independent\n            monitoring, Indigenous Peoples, Institutional Development,\n            interest rates, internal monitoring, intervention, key\n            performance indicators, living conditions, living standard,\n            living standards, local government, local governments, local\n            levels, medical care, micro-finance institutions,\n            micro-finance programs, migration, monitoring system, moral\n            hazard, moral hazard problems, mulch, national average,\n            national level, Natural Resources, Pacific Region,\n            participatory approach, participatory evaluation,\n            participatory monitoring, per capita income, performance\n            indicators, policy impact, poor areas, poor households,\n            Poverty Alleviation, Poverty Eradication, poverty\n            monitoring, poverty profile, POVERTY REDUCTION, Poverty\n            Reduction Projects, Poverty strategy, Present Value,\n            productivity, profitability, programs, project\n            beneficiaries, project evaluation, Project Management,\n            project objectives, public goods, resource allocations,\n            resources management, risk management, sample households,\n            sample surveys, sampling method, Social Development, social\n            protection, social services, social status, targeting, Task\n            Team Leader, tax revenue, Technical quality, urban areas,\n            water supply, working capital"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF029450-PHRD-QINBA MOUNTAINS POVERTY REDUCT.(REC-EXEC),TF029544-PHRD-QINBA MOUNTAINS POVERTY\n            REDUCTION (BANK-EXEC),TF030399-NEW ZEALAND CTF FY03 - EAST\n            ASIA AND PACIFIC,TF032832-ASIA- ENVIRONMENT(EAST &\n            SOUTH ASIA),TF037568-EAST ASIA REGION-N.MOUNTAINS\n            AND MALUKU REG.
