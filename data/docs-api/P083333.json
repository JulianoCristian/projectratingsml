Some\n            negative and low significant impacts associated to the land\n            movement during construction phase will occur mainly in the\n            infrastructure subprojects. Subprojects concerning the first\n            objective have mainly positive and significan impacts\n            because they promote conditions against desertification of\n            agricultural lands and for fixing rural populations.\n            Negative impacts will probably result from various\n            subprojects mainly during construction phase, from land\n            movements and vehicle circulation, but also locally during\n            operation phase.
