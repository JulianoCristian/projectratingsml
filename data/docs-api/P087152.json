Some lessons learned\n            includes: a technical assistance effort focused on improving\n            a hitherto unregulated and unsupervised rural financial\n            sector has to be a medium-to-long term initiative to produce\n            solid institutions. Governments should allow for a longer\n            lead time for the entities to get certified and encompassed\n            under a regulatory framework. Where the sector consists of a\n            large number of initially poorly performing entities, which\n            most likely need to be merged or liquidated, the political\n            ramifications emanating from liquidation could easily\n            jeopardize the sector consolidation process. The complexity\n            of designing and implementing a technology platform that\n            serves a heterogeneous industry and generates sufficient\n            revenue to be sustainable cannot be underestimated. In order\n            to reach low-income households where literacy rates are low\n            and functional literacy is practically nonexistent, efforts\n            need to be made in the area of social intermediation. The\n            three Bansefi projects, which overlap over time and have\n            similar objectives, are good examples of projects that would\n            benefit from a holistic evaluation,

The project is essentially a technical\n            assistance project. No negative impact is foreseen; rather\n            the project is expected to benefit some of the savings and\n            credit sector entities operating in marginal areas (which\n            are identical to the ones in the ongoing project) where\n            indigenous population is high. The project will continue to\n            assist about 195 entities, some of which are in the marginal\n            areas, and for which indigenous population aspects are\n            already being addressed under the on-going project. It will\n            assist about 45 new entities, very few of which may be\n            situated in the identified marginal areas. No indirect or\n            long-term negative impacts are expected as a result of\n            project activities. The technical assistance is expected to\n            deepen the outreach of the assisted entities, and will\n            improve access to financial services in the underserved\n            areas in Mexico, benefiting all categories of populations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chiapas (2)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico -
