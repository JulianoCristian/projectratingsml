Some lessons\n            learned included: Before a loan is negotiated it is vital to\n            secure the implementing agency\u2019s agreement to project\n            components and implementation procedures. Investment\n            projects need to be sufficiently flexible to allow for rapid\n            and often unanticipated changes in the economy and the\n            external environment. Changes in financial sector conditions\n            during project implementation may make it difficult to\n            forecast the demand for Bank-financed credit lines. Before\n            governments enter into an agency relationship with\n            microfinance institutions (MFIs) the possible consequences\n            for overall investment flow need to be fully

development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: increasingly, as liquidity of the financial sector\n            expands, more and more funds are potentially available for\n            lending to agriculture. To take advantage of this situation,\n            considerably more needs to be done to reduce the risks\n            related to the sector's activities. The focus\n            therefore, especially in light of evident climate change\n            moving toward a more complex, agricultural finance and risk\n            management instruments such as warehouse receipts, weather\n            index-based crop insurance or partial risk guarantees.\n            Although some of these issues were expected to be dealt with\n            during the second phase of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL),\n            they can have been more effectively dealt with at the same\n            time as the credit line, to make sure these risk mitigating\n            systems are in place by the time the credit line closes. A\n            lack of specific bank-wide guidance on acceptable commercial\n            practices and their supervision needs made it difficult for\n            the Government and the Bank team to properly assess the\n            procurement activities under the credit line if needed. For\n            projects that are operating in a rapidly changing\n            environment and are demand-based, the funding mechanisms\n            need to be kept as streamlined and flexible as possible. The\n            Government and the Bank were able to be flexible to\n            compensate for cumbersome arrangements, but flexible\n            mechanisms should be included at the design stage."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Rural Finance Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Rural Finance Program

objective, the project assists in\n            accelerating the economic transformation of the rural\n            economy by increasing the flow of investment capital to the\n            sector; augmenting the private sector's role in the\n            rural economy; facilitating accession to the European Union;\n            and alleviating rural poverty by financing farm and off-farm\n            investments for poor segments of the rural population which\n            currently have no access to credit. There are two main\n            project components beside the project management component.\n            The first component finances sub-loans on-lent through\n            private intermediary banks (PIBs) to eligible private sector\n            borrowers; micro-loans disbursed through participating\n            non-governmental and/or private Service Providers (SPs) to\n            rural entrepreneurs; and leasing of depreciable capital\n            assets by PIBs and leasing companies to final beneficiaries.\n            The second component finances incremental expenditures\n            incurred in 1) developing suitable technologies to provide\n            retail financial services to medium, small, and micro\n            enterprises and entrepreneurs in rural localities through\n            participating private retail banks (PRBs) and microcredit\n            service providers; 2) establishing and operating a network\n            of pilot retail banking offices; 3) operating, by SPs, a\n            network of microcredit retail points; and 4) training and\n            technical assistance in retail banking and micro-lending to\n            PRBs and SPs,
