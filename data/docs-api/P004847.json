Both the Bank\n            and the borrower performances were satisfactory.  Findings\n            of the project include:  A study is needed to better\n            understand all the implicit subsidies throughout the system.\n            The Bank also needs to consider a more proactive approach to\n            closed projects with loan funds that are being relent within\n            the same fund, particularly with respect to loan size caps.\n            Both the Bank and the borrower were very slow to resolve the\n            Vietnam Bank for the Poor (VBP) involvement issue and could\n            also have made better analytical use of available data on\n            costs per job created.  The three main lessons learned from\n            the project are: A) Training programs should be designed\n            with the objective of not only making delivery more\n            efficient but of creating a national capacity in financial\n            services. B) The Bank needs to revisit the impact of\n            conditionality on project implementation through the life of\n            the credit not simply the life of the project and to design\n            conditionality to adapt to change. C) The Bank should\n            establish achievable participating financial institution\n            (PFI) participation criteria at appraisal and ensure that at\n            least a significant number of PFIs can meet them prior to appraisal."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Rural Finance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Rural Finance

The lessons learned indicate that the criteria\n            of the participating financial institutions need to be\n            periodically reviewed and adjusted to market conditions.\n            More attention should be given to diversification of the\n            Rural Development Fund (RDF) lending.

Vietnam households. Almost a third of the\n            borrowers were women. The loans, averaging $360 each and\n            provided through seven participating banks, were used to\n            expand farm production, agricultural processing, and\n            trading. Without the project, most of these borrowers would\n            have reportedly turned to money lenders, whose costs are\n            much higher. The total credit provided by the Bank for this\n            project was $110 million. The project has supported several\n            financing initiatives, one of them being mobile banking,\n            which provides services to remote areas without bank\n            branches.
