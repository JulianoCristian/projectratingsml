Component 1 - Regional\n            Laboratory and contingencies, will support the establishment\n            of a regional laboratory to implement highly-specialized\n            functions, as a single regional institution. These functions\n            include: a) acting as a regional reference diagnostic; b)\n            becoming a specialized regional training center on HIV/AIDS\n            related technologies for laboratory workers; c) developing\n            information systems for laboratories specialized in HIV/AIDS\n            tests; d) carrying out specialized research on technologies\n            for testing HIV/AIDS viruses; e) becoming the regional\n            center for quality control of HIV/AIDS national\n            laboratories; and f) assessing and transferring technologies\n            to national laboratories. Component 2 - Epidemiological\n            Surveillance - will support the implementation of a regional\n            second-generation epidemiological surveillance system, to\n            enable improved characterization of the nature of the\n            HIV/AIDS epidemic in Central America. The system will\n            include an integrated information system with country\n            information, and, will disseminate information throughout\n            the region, periodic HIV surveillance in high-risk groups,\n            behavioral risk factor surveillance, and a training program.\n            Data would be disaggregated, at least, by age, gender, and\n            ethnicity, and as possible, by population mobility.\n            Component 3 - Strengthening the Regional Response Capacity\n            will increase the harmonization of legal and institutional\n            frameworks needed to scale-up strategic interventions, in\n            response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It will also strengthen\n            leadership and political commitment leading to a Regional\n            Action Plan with common policies and strategies, addressing\n            the epidemic in a coordinated way. This component will\n            support shared best practices on prevention and\n            comprehensive care, including desk reviews, and workshops at\n            the regional level with health and non-health institutions,\n            and civil society representatives, to examine the HIVIAIDS\n            legal framework for civil rights, integrated treatment\n            access, and drug and lab supplies regulations. Component 4 -\n            Prevention in Mobile Populations - will focus on the\n            particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, i.e., mobile\n            populations, considered to be a key factor in the\n            epidemic's spread. Prevention programs focusing on\n            these populations are still few, and work at a small scale.\n            The main actions are: a) strengthening coordination across\n            sectors, both at the country and regional levels, organizing\n            periodic meetings and workshops of key actors and agencies;\n            (b) providing continuity to successful prevention\n            subprojects, and supporting the development of new\n            preventive interventions, through a competitive process\n            among sponsors, mainly nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)\n            or a group of NGOs working in more than one country; and, c)\n            strengthening human resources capacity involved in the\n            sector, through the provision of training programs. Finally,\n            Component 5 - Project Management will support project\n            administration, structure and practices. Moreover, it will\n            finance computer and office equipment, and furniture, and,\n            technical assistance of long-term technical consultants in\n            the Project Coordination Unit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latin America and the Caribbean -

Regional HIV/AIDS Project\n            : indigenous peoples plan"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"In light of the presence of indigenous\n            populations, and afro-descendent groups within the Regional\n            HIV/AIDS Project in Central America, it is necessary the\n            project comprises an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP). The IPP\n            will ensure that these groups benefit from project\n            implementation in an equitable, and culturally adequate\n            manner, and ensure as well their active participation,\n            including that of nongovernmental organizations, and\n            community groups - in particular, health providers - for a\n            successful project implementation. The IPP consists of two\n            stages: the first, is a review of demographic,\n            anthropological, legal and institutional aspects, as well as\n            the HIV/AIDS epidemiological incidence among those groups,\n            supported by the participating countries' ministries of\n            health; the second stage complements the first, through\n            consultations with affected populations. The study concludes\n            there is no official data on the epidemic's incidence\n            among these groups, given statistics do not register ethnic\n            variables. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this project,\n            the incidence of HIV/AIDS was mapped geographically. Given\n            the increasing numbers of the epidemic in Central America,\n            it is suggested to include ethnic and gender variables in\n            the epidemic's prevention systems (financed by the\n            project under the second component). Furthermore, given the\n            current traditional health methods among indigenous\n            populations, and ethnic groups in health prevention, it is\n            recommended to review traditional networks, so as to build\n            capacities, to be able to collaborate in the prevention,\n            care, and assistance to HIV/AIDS affected people. It is\n            important to educate health workers, and community networks\n            on the rights and duties of affected people, because, as\n            certain rights are being questioned (e.g., confidentiality)\n            conducing to a negative reaction, the right precautions are\n            not being considered, but the fact remains that people\n            should be informed and educated on the use of their\n            obligations. Two major obstacles hamper the distribution and\n            marketing of condoms: the Church opposition, maintaining its\n            use engenders sexual promiscuity, and, the\n            (\"Machista\" male) idiosyncrasy that its use\n            promotes infidelity. In addition, two major groups\n            identified, particularly in Honduras, are HIV/AIDS affected\n            orphans - who need epidemiological monitoring, as well as\n            social protection - and house wifes infected by their own\n            husbands. Workshops are recommended (to be included under\n            the third component) where epidemic diagnoses within\n            indigenous populations, and afro-descendant groups, should\n            be discussed as part of current strategies (lessons learned,\n            and success stories), supported by regional partnerships\n            with nongovernmental organizations (to be financed under the\n            fourth component)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central America -
