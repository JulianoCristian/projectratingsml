Lessons largely reinforce the importance\n            of Government dialogue, ensuring budgetary and logistical\n            support, through an autonomous Project Unit for more\n            effective project implementation. In addition, it is\n            stipulated that training would be more effective if combined\n            with classroom, and on-the-job experience, especially in the\n            case of sophisticated geo-science database management\n            systems. Also, ensuring continued work flow and program\n            development is necessary. Greater care could have been\n            exercised in the choice of trainees on these sophisticated\n            systems to ensure they are line employees of the relevant\n            agencies, rather than contract hires. In line with this,\n            capacity building is a slow process, and requires long-term\n            commitment from the government, and the Bank in order to put\n            sufficient capacity in place. For example, for certain\n            specialties it would be helpful for the Bank to fund long\n            term academic training. Notwithstanding, the project\n            demonstrated that the private sector will respond well to\n            invest in the country, and engage in mining sector, provided\n            the government establishes the right framework, and\n            strengthens adequate institutional capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso -

A credit for the Project, of SDR14.8 million, was\n            approved on June 30, 1997 and became effective on April 28,\n            1998. The original closing date, December 31,2002 has been\n            extended to June 30,2004. The reallocation of funds will\n            allow the project to enhance the achievement in two of its\n            principal development objectives: improving the living and\n            working conditions of persons involved in small scale and\n            artisanal mining, and building capacity to improve\n            management of the environment.

Environmental Management Project are\n            to help: (i) establish an enabling environment to both\n            promote private investment in mining and to ensure real and\n            sustainable contribution to economic growth; (ii) strengthen\n            public and private sector capacity to effectively administer\n            regulations and to monitor sector developments; and (iii)\n            establish capacity in the country for environmental\n            management.  Additionally, the project aims to: (i)\n            stimulate private sector response to the growing need for a\n            variety of mining and environment related technical goods\n            and services; and (ii) identify and adopt appropriate\n            mechanisms to facilitate the development of small scale\n            mines and to improve the social, health and environmental\n            conditions of artisanal miners.  The project will comprise\n            four main components: 1) regulatory and fiscal framework and\n            training; 2) institutional strengthening and resources\n            management; 3) environmental management; and 4) small scale\n            and artisanal mining."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Mining Sector Capacity\n            Building and Environmental Management
