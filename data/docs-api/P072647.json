The lessons learned included:\n            1) Project implementation periods (project duration) should\n            be realistically set to support accurate estimates of the\n            time required to fully implement all the activities planned\n            for the project; 2) When projects fail to make adequate\n            progress, it is important that both the Bank and the\n            Borrower/Grantee quickly understand and agree that the\n            project has a problem; 3) The introduction of a new language\n            of instruction to a national school system requires careful\n            review and attention before policies are established and\n            implemented; 4) Nationally employed consultants should be\n            carefully selected through a vetted process with at least\n            three qualified candidates; 5) In the education sector, the\n            use of an independent Project Management Unit (PMU) that\n            operate outside the authority of the Ministry of Education\n            is often problematic; 6) In the interests of efficiency and\n            the establishing of an immediate capacity for a project to\n            have an impact, it is better if facility designs,\n            construction programs and associated procurement concerns\n            can be reviewed, evaluated and agreed in advance of project\n            effectiveness; 7) Where large numbers of similar schools are\n            to be built or rehabilitated by an inexperienced Ministry in\n            association with inexperienced contractors, there is a\n            strong case for the development of a 'universal'\n            (but adaptable) building design; and 8) The introduction of\n            new language(s) must be carefully planned, monitored and\n            evaluated to ensure that the transition is being effectively\n            introduced and implemented - quality of instruction is\n            critical as the timely provision of appropriate learning\n            materials. Teachers must be trained to use new materials and\n            to deliver the new language."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor-Leste - Fundamental School Quality
