Under stable macroeconomic conditions,\n            policy-based operations supporting a well defined set of\n            reforms can be effective tools in promoting structural\n            adjustment at the sub-national level. Provincial operations\n            can be effective complements of sector reforms and\n            operations at the national level. For reforms to be\n            successful, they have to follow the right sequence, take\n            into consideration interrelationship of intermediate steps,\n            and be supported by a sound incentive system. The\n            Bank's continuous engagement during critical periods\n            can help sustain ongoing reforms and protect previous\n            achievements. Uncertain macroeconomic conditions can\n            undermine reforms focusing on privatization and concession,\n            even when they have the full commitment of the authorities.\n            The success of any Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) depends\n            on a combination of factors, the most important of which is\n            strong political support. The scope and complexity of policy\n            conditionality needs to be in line with the implementation\n            capacity of the borrower. Cross-sector operations at the\n            provincial level require strong coordination during both\n            preparation and implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Santa Fe Provincial

Adjustment Loan (Ln 4634-AR) for US$330 million was approved\n            by the Board in August 2001 and became effective in\n            September 2001. The loan comprises three tranches, payable\n            at the Bank's standard interest rate for LIBOR-based\n            dollar loan, with a grace period of 5 years, a final\n            maturity in 15 years, and a level repayment of principal.\n            The first tranche in the amount of US$153.3 million was\n            released on September 20, 2001. The accompanying Tranche\n            Release Document for the second tranche of US$50 million\n            sets forth the description of tranche conditions, status of\n            compliance of the Borrower, and proposed amendment/waivers\n            to both the second and third tranches. The Loan is designed\n            to support the implementation of a program by the Borrower\n            Santa Fe Province aimed at reforming its government so as to\n            ensure an efficient and responsive delivery of public\n            services within fiscally sound policies. While the Province\n            has largely been able to successfully implement the program,\n            due to the impact of the severe macroeconomic developments\n            in Argentina and the resulting deterioration in social\n            conditions, the Loan is being reformulated in terms of\n            waivers/amendments to individual conditions. In keeping with\n            the original development objective, the reformulated loan\n            would continue to support the Province of Santa Fe's\n            reform efforts to achieve fiscal stability at the provincial\n            level and promote structural reforms to improve the\n            efficiency, quality and equity of public spending,\n            particularly in the social sectors.      This Supplemental\n            Credit will be used to return the investment program for the\n            Road Maintenance Project for Albania to its original size,\n            improving about 1,000 km of the national road network and\n            about 1,000 km o f the rural road network. No changes to the\n            originally negotiated Credit are proposed. The Project is\n            expected to be completed by the original Closing Date."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Santa Fe Provincial Reform\n            Adjustment Loan : Proposed Amendment and
