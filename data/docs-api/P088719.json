Some lessons learned included:\n            Afghanistan's environment is challenging for Foreign\n            Direct Investment (FDI), in particular the worsening\n            security environment and governance. Availability of\n            political risk guarantee is not enough to mitigate the\n            concerns of foreign investors. Without minimum peace and\n            security, long-term investments are difficult to attract.\n            The Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility (AIGF)\n            marketing activities will have been further improved by\n            hiring a local marketing representative, familiar with local\n            investment and business environment as well as political\n            risk insurance products. The previous operation of\n            Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in Bosnia\n            and Herzegovina highlighted the importance of having a\n            full-time representative working on the ground to increase\n            awareness and liaise with investors on a continuing basis;\n            once a special representative was placed in-country, there\n            was a steady flow of inquiries from foreign investors for\n            guarantees. In addition, local representative can help MIGA\n            staff in headquarters to better understand the risks\n            involved in the country since more detailed information can\n            be provided. This greatly helps in the management of risks\n            in a high-risk environment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Investment Guarantee Facility

assist Afghanistan in its reconstruction\n            efforts by stimulating foreign investment through a program\n            of political risk insurance - in an environment where the\n            perception of political risk (risks of war and civil\n            disturbance, expropriation, transfer restriction and breach\n            of contract) by foreign investors remains high. Under this\n            project, IDA will provide a credit to the Government of\n            Afghanistan for an Investment Guarantee Facility which will\n            be administered and implemented by MIGA. The Facility '\n            s capital base will be made up of cash contributions from\n            IDA and others to be disbursed into an interest bearing\n            Trust Fund. Investors will pay premiums and MIGA, as\n            Administrator, will issue contracts of guarantee on behalf\n            of the Facility. All guarantees supported by the Guarantee\n            Facility will follow MIGA's regular underwriting\n            procedures and methodologies, and will be able to offer\n            coverage against the following risks: transfer restriction\n            and inconvertibility, expropriation, war and civil\n            disturbance and breach of contract. The guarantees will be\n            priced to risk, in accordance with MIGA's pricing\n            methodology and guarantee contracts will have a maximum\n            duration of seven years. In view of the need for flexibility\n            in Afghanistan's conflict-effected environment, it is\n            proposed that the Guarantee Facility be able to support the\n            following transactions generally ineligible under\n            MIGA's regular policies: a) foreign loans without\n            equity, to be used to finance a local equity investment or\n            the
