The project achieved its main objectives, its\n            impact on the forestry sector and institutional\n            strengthening has been substantial, sustainability is\n            likely, and both the Bank and Borrower performed\n            satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, the appraisal team should have anticipated\n            the development of new investment opportunities and provided\n            flexibility in site selection subject to agreed investment\n            criteria. Second, most of the public criticism of the Master\n            Plan could have been avoided if a transparent planning\n            process had been maintained. The Government of Sri Lanka\n            should have involved the public at various stages of the\n            plan's formulation. Lastly, introduction of a\n            computerized database and decision making system has proven\n            to be a remarkably successful method for introducing\n            dynamism and professionalism into a previously dormant\n            Forest Department. However, maintenance of high tech\n            management systems requires a longer technical assistance\n            effort than was actually provided."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Forest
