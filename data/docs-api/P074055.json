   sector will be strengthened, and restructured, namely\n            through the financial sector reform, which includes reform\n            of the pension system. Private sector competitiveness will\n            be enhanced by supporting reforms within the legal system,\n            as well as tax reforms, and alleviating the administrative\n            barriers. The focus will be on capacity building of selected\n            Government ministries, and agencies that interact with\n            private firms, namely to improve institutional capabilities,\n            and business delivery.
