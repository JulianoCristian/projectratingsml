Some lessons\n            learned included: The strong, demonstrated commitment of\n            government at various levels, and effective mechanisms to\n            sustain that commitment, are vital for success and essential\n            to embark on a scaling up phase. Close implementation\n            support by the Bank and sector was invaluable for resolving\n            implementation challenges. The marshland investment model\n            developed in RSSP offers a basic framework for replication\n            throughout Rwanda. The model has been the basis for new\n            policies and institutions throughout the sector. Approaches\n            that enhance farmers' business skills, promote value\n            chains, and link farmers to financial institutions provide\n            inclusive, sustainable benefits. RSSP 2 demonstrates the\n            wisdom of continuity in the financing mechanism and\n            implementation teams. A programmatic approach (financing\n            mechanism) is advantageous to consolidate, scale up, and\n            sustain project benefits from a previous phase, while\n            ensuring clear criteria and initiatives for new\n            interventions. Water User Associations (WUAs) should be\n            established and strengthened at the start of irrigation\n            works. Instead of working with multiple hillside\n            cooperatives spread throughout the country, RSSP 3 is\n            adopting a more targeted and approach of establishing and\n            strengthening cooperatives on the hillsides that surround\n            RSSP 3 marshlands."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Second Rural Sector Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda

These subproject\n            impacts include loss of marshland ecosystems and the\n            functions, loss of avifauna habitat, agro chemical pollution\n            of soil and water resources, reduced water flow downstream,\n            water wastage through increased evaporation, loss of\n            domestic water sources, loss of marshland services and\n            products, increased incidences of water borne diseases\n            especially malaria, safety hazards posed by the reservoirs,\n            flooding, emergence of pests and agricultural diseases,\n            reduced production of subsistence crops .All these impacts\n            can be mitigated through a design, management, agronomic\n            practices, policy, capacity building and proper planning.\n            These measures include adopting water saving technologies\n            and management systems, construction of adequate drainage\n            system in the farm, canalization of the drains,  training in\n            efficient irrigation water management, training on\n            precautionary measures required for the handling, labeling\n            and application of agro-chemicals under field conditions,\n            conserving buffer zones to filter pollutant loads from\n            upstream and those leaching from irrigated farms, regulating\n            water abstraction for irrigation and other uses, catchment\n            management especially upstream to control the intensity of\n            the floods, need for a full inventory and assessment of\n            Rwanda wetlands, provision of water points for domestic use,\n            measures to control pathogens and vectors, incorporation of\n            safety measures around the dams, among other measures as\n            described in the Environmental Management Plans of the\n            subprojects. The RSSP subprojects considered in this study\n            are environmentally feasible due to the fact that it targets\n            marshlands that have been traditional developed and degraded\n            aims at rehabilitating these areas.

The objective is to provide additional\n            assistance which may be necessary to restore pre-project\n            living standards. The Rwandan Land Policy ensures equal\n            right to land use for all Rwandan citizens. In order to\n            achieve the objective of the Land Policy, Rwanda is\n            undergoing a land reform process targeting three main\n            objectives: (1) Use of the Land for economic growth and\n            poverty reduction, (2) Ensuring equal rights to land for all\n            Rwandans and (3) Protecting environment and land resources.\n            A number of organic laws, decrees and orders have been and\n            are still being prepared and promulgated to facilitate the\n            implementation of the Rwandan Land Policy.
