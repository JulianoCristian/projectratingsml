Some lessons learned\n            included: the project involved a flexible approach in\n            subproject proposal review. Quality at entry is essential\n            for maintaining high implementation quality. To ensure\n            quality at entry, it is important to have a strong and\n            competent task manager and task team; well thought out\n            interventions; clearly defined project activities; and close\n            relations between the requested inputs and the expected\n            outcomes. It is also important to provide timely trainings\n            to Subproject Implementing Agencies (SIA) staffs and the new\n            SIAs in particular, especially in areas of procurement and\n            disbursement. Formulate multiple procurement methods, in\n            view of the importance of procurement and disbursement in\n            ensuring timely implementation completion. Needs assessment\n            of project funds should be carried out seriously and\n            carefully to avoid cancellation of large volumes of project\n            funds.
