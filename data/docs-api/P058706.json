Some lessons\n            learned included:  a reform agenda that depends on the\n            buy-in of key individuals can be stalled unless there is:\n            (a) a contingency plan for the loss of political will and\n            (b) sufficient flexibility in project design to enable\n            adjustments to changes in the level of ownership. The use of\n            demand-driven approaches for forestry or natural resources\n            management activities may be constrained by insufficient\n            demand, as communities often have other priorities. Small\n            grant monitoring that narrowly focuses on ensuring that\n            grant monies were used for their intended purpose is\n            insufficient to demonstrate outcome level results and is a\n            lost opportunity for learning.

Some lessons learned\n            included: sustainable forest sector reforms require strong\n            political and technical leadership. Reforms also need to be\n            in line with government priorities. Transparency in the\n            consultative process ensures that staff/employees, at all\n            levels, feel ownership and consider change as an opportunity\n            rather than a threat to their livelihood. Projects\n            implemented during times of significant policy change\n            require enhanced, constant engagement and supervision. This\n            includes utilizing outside expertise with strong in-country\n            experience, mobilizing senior Bank management, and ensuring\n            flexibility in the design to respond to changes in\n            priorities while retaining the overall goals. Forest sector\n            projects tend to be overly ambitious, aiming to address\n            multiple challenges (e.g. sector reform, sustainable\n            management, governance, community participation, etc.) in a\n            single operation. Recipient implementation capacity is often\n            insufficient to address existing complexities within the\n            given timeframe and limited resources are spread too thinly.\n            As a consequence, restructuring is often required to adjust\n            ambitious project designs to realities on the ground,\n            helping to achieve a few tangible results. So as to yield\n            sustainable project outcomes, project designs should be more\n            focused, allocating sufficient and targeted financial resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania -

Through its\n            components, the project will support forest management\n            institutional change, and improve service delivery, by\n            providing resources to strengthen the capacity for\n            administration, and management of the Tanzania Forest\n            Service, which will be established, and supported (in part)\n            by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and, by improving\n            as well revenue collection from forests and woodlands,\n            including service delivery mechanisms for a participatory\n            forest management. A framework will be developed, and\n            implemented to involve the private sector in the management\n            of existing industrial plantations by enabling an\n            institutional, and market environment, based on the\n            implementation of a communication strategy, and capacity\n            strengthening within the Ministry of Natural Resources and\n            Tourism. Additionally, the project will finance aerial\n            photography, mapping, and indicative inventories of\n            state-owned plantations, to improve the plantation resource\n            information base, and management planning capacity.\n            Alternative management of selected industrial plantations\n            will be piloted, emphasizing on the monitoring and\n            evaluation of operational performance indicators.
