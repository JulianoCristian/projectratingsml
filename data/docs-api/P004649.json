Montreal Protocol Ozone\n            Depleting Substances Phase-Out Multi-Component Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The overall outcome rating of Montreal\n            Protocol ozone depleting substances phase-out\n            multi-component Project for Thailand was judged to be\n            satisfactory.  The Bank and borrower performance were\n            satisfactory. The risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible. Significant changes included extension of\n            closing dates and a change in the project implementation\n            modality of Halon Management Programme, Halon Recovery,\n            Recycling and Banking Sub-project.  Several lessons were\n            learned. Commitment from the government and related\n            stakeholders to the phase-out obligations was critical to\n            ensure compliance with all obligations in a smooth and\n            sustainable manner. A project management unit (PMU) was\n            established to be responsible for the operation of the\n            multi-year project. Due to a number of activities to be\n            carried out under the multi-year project, PMU should be\n            staffed with competent and skilled personnel to ensure\n            effective implementation and delivery of the multi-year\n            project in the future. The disbanding of the Department of\n            Industrial Works (DIW) led to severe disruptions because the\n            National Ozone Unit (NOU) did not have the capacity and\n            experience to implement the remaining tasks. In hindsight,\n            the Bank could have required the DIW to have an adequate\n            transitional plan in place before disbanding the PMU and\n            transferring its functions to the understaffed NOU.\n            Implementation in the service sectors was more complicated\n            than in the manufacturing sector. To deal more successfully\n            with small enterprises, incentives should be provided to\n            these workshops to urge them to participate in the program.\n            The Bank should have updated the Results Framework\n            continuously in the implementation and status reports for\n            both Bank management and client. This operation lasted\n            almost 19 years from start to finish, but it demonstrates\n            that older projects can be successful by rolling through\n            different aspects of Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS)\n            phase-out sequentially. Not having to prepare a new PAD each\n            time a new ODS was introduced for phase-out meant that the\n            team was not distracted by administrative tasks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Montreal Protocol Ozone Depleting\n            Substances Phase-Out Multi-Component Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand - Montreal Protocol\n            Ozone Depleting Substances Phase-Out Multi-Component Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2014/06/19882402/thailand-montreal-protocol-ozone-depleting-substances-phase-out-multi-component-project","count":"Thailand","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, Actual cost, aerosol, Air,\n            appropriate technology, aqueous cleaning, auditing,\n            auditors, audits, Bank Ratings, Carbon Dioxide, Carbon\n            Tetrachloride, CFC, CFCs, chemicals, Chlorofluorocarbon,\n            chlorofluorocarbons, cleaning agent, cleaning process,\n            climate, climate change, CO2, comparative advantage, Cost\n            Effectiveness, deforestation, developed countries, dose,\n            Economic analysis, economic development, economic growth,\n            ecosystem, ecosystem health, electronic banking, Employment,\n            Environmental, environmental issues, Environmental policies,\n            expenditures, Financial Management, Flexible polyurethane,\n            flood, foam, Freeze, fumigant, fumigants, gas, Gender,\n            global climate change, Global Warming, Global Warming\n            Potential, greenhouse, greenhouse gases, GWP, halon, halon\n            bank, halons, HCFC, HFC, Hydrochlorofluorocarbon, import\n            quotas, incremental costs, industrial expansion,\n            insecticide, inventory, legislation, local enterprises,\n            Methyl Bromide, methyl chloroform, MONTREAL, MONTREAL\n            PROTOCOL, Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the\n            Ozone Layer, ODS, ODSs, OZONE, Ozone Depleting Potential,\n            Ozone Depleting Substance, OZONE DEPLETING SUBSTANCES, Ozone\n            layer, peer review, pesticide, pesticides, Pollution,\n            Present Value, public good, public goods, Quality\n            Assessment, Recycling, refrigeration, refrigerator,\n            refrigerators, resource management, safety, Savings,\n            scattering, shops, solvents, Sustainable Development,\n            Technical Assistance, transaction costs, Transport,\n            trichloroethane, ultraviolet radiation, UNEP, United Nations\n            Environment Programme"}},"majtheme":"Environment and natural resource management","projn":"TH-Ozone Depleting Subs -- P004649","topic":"Air Pollution m1327122 1791,Environmental Laws and Regulations\n            m1326889 849,Environmental Management and Mitigation\n            Plans m1327126 2307,Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) m1327596 1795,Pollution Management m1326210 601","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Climate Change Mitigation and Green House Gases,Environmental Economics & Policies,Housing & Human Habitats,Montreal Protocol,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Environment","entityids":{"entityid":"000016351_20140723093359"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"Other industry","theme":"Pollution management and environmental health","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Environment","prdln":"Montreal Protocol","topicv3":"Air Pollution m1327122 1791,Environmental Laws and Regulations\n            m1326889 849,Environmental Management and Mitigation\n            Plans m1327126 2307,Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) m1327596 1795,Pollution Management m1326210 601","owner":"Envir & Nat.

The most important impact\n            of current practices is ozone layer depletion caused by MB.\n            For phosphine, no evidence of impact, except the trouble\n            when collecting phosphine tablets that are not completely\n            decomposed since it is easy to generate flames and\n            potentially explosions. Moreover, phosphine may corrode\n            copper and electronic equipments and cause pest resistance.\n            High efficacy to control pests for durable commodities.
