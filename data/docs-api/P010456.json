The project achieved\n            many of its objectives, institutional development was\n            partially achieved, sustainability is likely, and the\n            performance of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First, it\n            is possible to bring about improvements in a dire situation\n            but it takes time, patience, and persistence. Second, in an\n            environment subject to extreme political abuse, a\n            prerequisite for delivering an adequate quality of basic\n            services is improving governance. Third, it is necessary,\n            from the start, to discuss a program with all levels of\n            government that are involved in carrying it out. Fourth,\n            Governments need to strengthen their financial management in\n            order to give priority to social services or any other\n            sectors. Fifth, provincial governments need to generate more\n            continuity of senior social sector staff at all levels to\n            improve basic social services. Sixth, sector investment\n            credits worked well to establish a policy dialogue,\n            influence expenditure programs, and exercise leverage.\n            Seventh, supervision of SAPP is very demanding and expensive\n            but the payoff justifies the effort and expense. Finally,\n            when following a sector approach, IDA must be willing to\n            deal with unexpected and difficult government policy initiatives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Social Action Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Social Action Program Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/06/10223441/pakistan-social-action-program-project","projn":"PK-Social Action Progra -- P010456","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,m,Housing & Human Habitats,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Population Policies","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20090204024923"},"subsc":"General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,Central government administration,Primary education,Health,Other social services","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Social Protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Basic services;
