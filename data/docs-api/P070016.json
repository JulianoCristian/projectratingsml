Some of the\n            key lessons learned during project implementation were: (1)\n            Cluster organizations can be an effective mechanism to\n            improve public-private dialogue and bring private sector\n            concerns to bear on public policy. The\n            \"intangible\" benefits of the cluster approach are\n            important: greater awareness of constraints to private\n            sector development, better linkages, more confidence and\n            cooperation among private and public stakeholders, and\n            changes in business attitudes. At the same time, concerns\n            raised by the private sector should represent the broad\n            interests of the sector rather than specific benefits to\n            individual firms. (2) The competitiveness agenda needs\n            high-level political support and coordination across the\n            many public sector agencies involved. (3) Initiatives taken\n            by cluster organizations should be focused, guided by a\n            conceptual framework, and proactive rather than reactive.\n            Cluster activities should be integrated with efforts to\n            improve the investment climate. Particularly with a limited\n            budget, there is a risk of dispersion of effort across many\n            small initiatives, with the end result of low impact. (4)\n            Reforms in the policy and institutional environment require\n            engagement with the legislative branch early in the process,\n            not just at the end of the process when a draft bill is\n            presented.
