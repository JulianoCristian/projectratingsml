Several lessons are drawn from the project,\n            first, that project management, in the context of weak\n            institutional capacity, requires continuous technical\n            support, particularly in the early stages of the project,\n            while management continuity, provides the stability for\n            implementation, in line with appropriate project design.\n            Conflicting rules, and regulations on the release of\n            Government funding led to delays in fund transfers, thus,\n            release procedures should be specified early, during\n            appraisal, timing the Government's budget approval, to\n            project initiation, preventing lack of funds. Furthermore,\n            when financing of social programs becomes almost fiscally\n            independent from budgetary transfers, payroll tax rates may\n            be very high, risking distortions in the labor market, and\n            slowing economic growth. Instead, social programs design\n            should incorporate aspects of equity, and affordability, and\n            social policies should be consistent to the country's\n            institutional capacity. Thus, training of staff, responsible\n            of social programs becomes paramount."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Social Safety Net Development

systems and to make\n            them compatible with a market oriented economy. The\n            objectives of the project are to: develop policy to\n            consolidate basic social insurance and social assistance\n            programs reform; strengthen institutions responsible for\n            planning and management of cash benefits; and strengthen\n            training, research and statistical institutions to support\n            social policy formation and implementation. Albania's\n            transition from a command economy towards a market economy\n            started with a less developed social safety net than other\n            countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Currently, the most\n            pressing social problems involve price increases after\n            liberalization, fall in real wages, and unemployment growth\n            after employment guarantees were withdrawn. The government\n            is attempting to restructure the social safety net and bring\n            social policies in line with a decentralized democratic\n            society and a transitional economy. The proposed project is\n            poverty related and comprises two components: social\n            insurance reform and social assistance development. The\n            social assistance component will concentrate on organizing a\n            system of income support. The social insurance component\n            will contribute to poverty reduction by safeguarding the\n            minimum benefits of those in the social insurance scheme."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Technical Assistance Project for\n            Social Safety Net Development"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Technical Assistance\n            Project for Social Safety Net Development"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/08/735161/albania-technical-assistance-project-social-safety-net-development","projn":"AL-Social Safety Net Project-116634 -- P008265","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Gender and Law,Health Economics & Finance,National Governance","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Albania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961005045602"},"subsc":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance,Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Social Protection,(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"administrative capacity,Administrative\n            procedures,alimony,autonomy,budget constraints,budget\n            expenditures,budget financing,Cash benefits,central\n            government,centralization,centrally planned\n            economies,commodities,compensation,cost\n            savings,debt,democracy,disability,division of labor,economic\n            problems,expenditure,Expenditures,families,farms,financial\n            management,financial sustainability,Fiscal,Fiscal\n            Year,Governmental Organization,Human\n            Resources,income,institutional capacity,Insurance,labor\n            force,Labor Market,Labor Market\n            Development,laws,layoffs,legal framework,legislation,living\n            standards,lobbying,local government,maternity leave,Ministry\n            of Finance,municipalities,Nations,pensions,preferential\n            treatment,prisoners,private sector,privatization,public\n            enterprises,real wages,retirement,Savings,Social\n            Assistance,social assistance program,social assistance\n            system,social costs,Social Insurance,social insurance\n            system,social policies,Social Policy,Social\n            Protection,Social Safety,Social Safety Net,Social\n            welfare,socialism,State budget,State budgets,state\n            enterprises,State revenues,Technical Assistance,unemployment,wages"},"1":{"cdata!":"administrative capacity,Administrative\n            procedures,alimony,autonomy,budget constraints,budget\n            expenditures,budget financing,Cash benefits,central\n            government,centralization,centrally planned\n            economies,commodities,compensation,cost\n            savings,debt,democracy,disability,division of labor,economic\n            problems,expenditure,Expenditures,families,farms,financial\n            management,financial sustainability,Fiscal,Fiscal\n            Year,Governmental Organization,Human\n            Resources,income,institutional capacity,Insurance,labor\n            force,Labor Market,Labor Market\n            Development,laws,layoffs,legal framework,legislation,living\n            standards,lobbying,local government,maternity leave,Ministry\n            of Finance,municipalities,Nations,pensions,preferential\n            treatment,prisoners,private sector,privatization,public\n            enterprises,real wages,retirement,Savings,Social\n            Assistance,social assistance program,social assistance\n            system,social costs,Social Insurance,social insurance\n            system,social policies,Social Policy,Social\n            Protection,Social Safety,Social Safety Net,Social\n            welfare,socialism,State budget,State budgets,state\n            enterprises,State revenues,Technical Assistance,unemployment,wages"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Unit (ECSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF027981-TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CTF FOR ALBANIA,TF035767-ALBANIA - SOCIAL SAFETY NET,TF021392-HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT","repnb":"11443"},"facets":{}}}
