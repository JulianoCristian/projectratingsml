Instead of growing wheat or barley,\n            thousands of the country's small farmers have been\n            planting crops that need more water but ultimately yield\n            more cash. The transformation comes thanks to investments\n            supported by the World Bank over many years in the\n            country's irrigation and water rights systems.\n            Investments have also been made in building new, gravity-fed\n            irrigation systems that do not need pumps and save a lot of\n            money on fuel, almost $ 35 million. As the global financial\n            crisis hit, the World Bank invested emergency funds for\n            renovation of around 90 km of sections of the main Armavir\n            and Talin, helping to create 12,000 temporary jobs. As a\n            result, water losses in two important main canals have\n            reduced from almost 23 percent to 7 percent. That allows\n            7,000 more hectares to be irrigated. A follow-up project has\n            already been topped up so that more canals in six provinces\n            can be repaired, encouraging further agricultural\n            development and the possibility of increased incomes for\n            Armenia's farmers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"The new landscape of Armenia's agriculture"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"The new landscape of\n            Armenia's agriculture"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/05/24428494/new-landscape-armenias-agriculture","count":"Armenia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Transportation,Information and communications,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"wells, water users associations, pumping,\n            water management, irrigation systems, water projects, water\n            needs, irrigation, wua, water user, transparency, irrigation\n            networks, meters, orchards, water users, water resource\n            management, irrigation rehabilitation, dams, irrigation\n            infrastructure, pumps, access to irrigation, agricultural\n            development, water, canals, programs, water resource,\n            irrigation development, reservoirs, water fees, irrigation\n            water, farmers, irrigation canals, water losses, bilateral\n            agreement, pumping stations, water rights, gravity, artesian wells"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"majtheme":"Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Environment and natural resource management,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Financial and private sector development","projn":"AM-Irrigation Rehabilitation Emergency\n            Project -- P116681,AM-Additional Financing To Irep -- P126509,AM-Irrigation Development Additional\n            Financing -- P105171,AM-Irrigation Dam Safety 2 Project -- P088499,AM-Irrigation Development Project -- P055022,AM-Irrigation Dam Safety -- P064879,AM-Irrigation Rehabilitation Project -- P008277","topic":"Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Agricultural Innovation Systems m1327588 196,Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171,Agricultural Credit m1327605 1962","docty":"Working Paper","subtopic":"Water Use,Irrigation and Drainage,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water Supply and Systems","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b082e1d99d_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","theme":"Rural policies and institutions,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural policies and institutions,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Natural disaster management,Rural services and infrastructure,Water resource management,Rural policies and institutions,Other social protection and risk management,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Natural disaster management,Rural services and infrastructure,Infrastructure services for private sector development,Water resource management,Rural services and infrastructure,Water resource management","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Agricultural Innovation Systems m1327588 196,Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171,Agricultural Credit m1327605 1962","owner":"Water - GP (GWADR)","trustfund":"TF025793-PHRD-IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT,BBFAO-BB FAO,TF029549-PHRD-AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT\n            SERVICES PROJ.(BANK-EXEC.),TF036016-ECA REGION - WATER AND\n            AGRICULTURE (ARMENIA, UZBEKISTAN),BBFAO-BB FAO,TF032683-ARMENIA - IRRIGATION\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF031092-ARMENIA IRRIGATION REHABILITATION,TF033283-ECA REGION (LITHUANIA AND\n            LATVIA) AGRICULTURE DEV.
