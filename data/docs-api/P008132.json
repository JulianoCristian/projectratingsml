The project objective was to reduce the overall\n            economic cost of supply of petroleum products in Uruguay to\n            levels comparable to international prices. This important\n            objective was compatible with national energy and\n            development policies, and was consistent with the\n            Bank's lending strategy. As for project lessons, there\n            are four: (1) To minimize the riskof surprise during\n            implementation, it is important that during the planning\n            stagethe scope of key studies (such as the feasibility\n            study) not be reduced forbudgetary reasons; (2) The delays\n            associated with Phase II underscore the wisdomof the\n            Bank's current policy of substantially completing\n            preliminary or finaldesign before scheduling Board\n            presentation; (3) Instead of buying an accountingsystem, the\n            financial systems study should have embraced a total\n            modernizationof management's internal information\n            system; (4) The \"half-a-loaf\" results onprice\n            deregulation and crude-oil procurement show why the Bank\n            hasdecided to \"delink\" investment loans and the\n            resolution of sector issues. The latter are now to be\n            addressed in the Bank's ESW program and their\n            resolution is expected to preceed Bank investment lending"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay - Refinery Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uruguay -
