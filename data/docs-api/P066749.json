Several lessons were drawn from the\n            project's experience, which featured how to align\n            research with national priorities, and the needs of\n            indigenous people and the poor. Lessons however, highlight\n            that the initial proposal should have contained a plan for\n            the transition to regular activities, given that support for\n            Centers and Nuclei should only be provided based on a clear\n            strategy of how activities will be continued after the end\n            of the grant period. Expecting a follow-up on the project,\n            the Institute of Fluid Mechanics used grants to finance\n            recurrent expenditures on a non-declining basis. As a\n            consequence, the Center faces the challenge of sustaining\n            the investment in the training of highly-skilled\n            researchers. In addition, extra efforts are needed for human\n            resource formation in countries with no critical mass, but\n            faced with university graduates willing to undergo a career\n            in sciences, but where most researchers do not have adequate\n            qualifications. The project however showed that provision of\n            research staff can be attained through adequate training\n            programs. Nonetheless, further lessons outline that\n            investigator autonomy is key to research success, while\n            supporting network and dissemination activities should not\n            be underestimated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Venezuela -

The project has two\n            phases, the first being financed by a Learning and\n            Innovation Loan (LIL). The project has two components. The\n            first builds the capacity of the new Ministry of science and\n            Technology, with technical support to set up national\n            science and technology policies; establishes and operates\n            the Board of directors, Program Committee, and an\n            Implementation and Management Unit; develops a proposal to\n            scale-up and institutionalize the project; and supports\n            monitoring and evaluation studies. The second component sets\n            up a competitive fund for scientific excellence which\n            conducts scientific research, expands doctoral and\n            post-doctoral training programs; and supports networking and\n            outreach as well as special activities to promote scientific\n            excellence. Networking activities include research visits to\n            establish formal and informal connections to high level\n            institutions; coordinates appropriate Initiative-wide\n            activities; supports exchange programs for researchers and\n            students; and designs and delivers international, advanced courses."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Venezuela -
