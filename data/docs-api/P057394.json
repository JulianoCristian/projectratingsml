Some\n            lessons learned included: the fact that the Government of\n            The Gambia (GoG) changed its commitment towards the DP\n            became a problem. The component was later dropped from the\n            Project without any meaningful impact. It is therefore\n            critical to examine the support for the program in a country\n            prior to incorporating such activities in a project. This\n            leads to the next lesson. Despite the indications of strong\n            commitment by GoG during project preparation robust analysis\n            should have been undertaken on the social impact f its\n            stakeholders. Resistance during implementation emerged from\n            other stakeholders including management of the enterprises\n            to be divested. The Gateway Project had two Project\n            Coordinating Units (PCUs) (Gambia Investment Promotion and\n            Free Zones Agency (GIPFZA) and Gambia Divestiture Agency\n            (GDA)) which did not work and reverted to one PCU (GIPFZA).\n            While a PCU can often be inserted into an institution,\n            project coordination should not distract the agency from its\n            other functions. The head of the PCU can therefore be in an\n            agency but should not be the head of the agency. Field based\n            task teams (including Task Team Leaders (TTLs)) are an\n            effective way for the Bank to provide continuous support to\n            the Borrower. There were five task team leaders over the\n            life of the project. This high rotation resulted in a\n            slowdown in the project implementation pace. It was when the\n            task TTL was field-based and available over a few years,\n            that the project consistently accelerated deliverance of\n            Project Development Objective (PDO) Key Performance\n            Indicators (KPI) results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Gambia - Gateway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Gambia - Gateway

TThe project will be implemented in two phases--this\n            being the first phase--using an Adaptable Program Lending\n            (APL) instrument. There are five components.

It includes common\n            users facilities and utilities and consulting services for\n            supervising works.

It includes operational\n            support, technical assistance, and consulting services.

During construction, water\n            spraying surfaces should prevent dusting; preventive\n            measures will be specified to reduce accidental spills,\n            and/or negative impacts on groundwater quality, reducing as\n            well adversity on soil quality, in addition to runoff water\n            contamination; and, a buffer zone of at least 200 meters,\n            should border industrial vs. residential areas, while\n            vegetation propagation should reduce noise, and air\n            pollution. During operation, emission standards, and\n            regulation enforcement should be developed, including\n            monitoring criteria; similarly, effluent discharge\n            standards, and quality control should be developed, to\n            include monitoring of groundwater quality. Further\n            mitigation measures address preventive actions for flora,\n            and fauna protection, cultural heritage protection, and\n            precautions to safeguard marine, and coastal resources.

environmental, and social adversity.\n            However, as detailed engineering designs of the Free Zone\n            development plans were not yet available, it was not\n            possible to obtain a full description of each element, thus\n            this environmental assessment (EA), and social management\n            plan (SMP) focus on the construction, and operation phases\n

During construction, water\n            spraying surfaces should prevent dusting; preventive\n            measures will be specified to reduce accidental spills,\n            and/or negative impacts on groundwater quality, reducing as\n            well adversity on soil quality, in addition to runoff water\n            contamination; and, a buffer zone of at least 200 meters,\n            should border industrial vs. residential areas, while\n            vegetation propagation should reduce noise, and air\n            pollution. During operation, emission standards, and\n            regulation enforcement should be developed, including\n            monitoring criteria; similarly, effluent discharge\n            standards, and quality control should be developed, to\n            include monitoring of groundwater quality.
