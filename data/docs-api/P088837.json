     From 2002 to 2006, Turkey undertook wide -ranging financial,\n            economic, and public sector reforms. As a result, growth\n            accelerated and public finances improved, with public debt\n            in 2006 at 48 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), down\n            from 78 percent. Poverty rates declined sharply. Yet,\n            sustained progress was threatened by challenges in reforming\n            public finances, and outdated regulations hindered\n            investments. Unemployment remained high, and the labor\n            market was largely unskilled. The sharp  deterioration in\n            the global economy in 2008 added to these challenges. The\n            first Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment Development\n            Policy Loan (REGE DPL 1) in 2010 streamlined World Bank\n            support to Turkey at a critical time when unemployment was\n            16 percent and GDP had contracted by 4.7 percent. The second\n            Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment Development Policy\n            Loan (REGE DPL 2) supports ongoing reforms of public\n            finances, commercial law, and civil procedures. Turkey has\n            reached almost universal health insurance coverage, enrolled\n            more children in pre-school, and dramatically increased\n            vocational training. These ongoing reforms are expected to\n            reduce poverty and inequality in Turkey over the long run."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sustaining growth with jobs and better\n            services in

Programmatic Public Sector\n            Development Policy Loan (PPDPL 2) Project for Turkey\n            supports a sustained medium-term process of legal,\n            institutional, and structural development that promotes\n            growth, improves public governance and service delivery and\n            strengthens social conditions by: (a) maintaining an\n            enabling macroeconomic framework; (b) reforming the\n            country's social protection system; (c) continuing the\n            ongoing process of upgrading financial controls and public\n            expenditure management; and (d) improving the administration\n            and governance of the public sector. The government's\n            program supported by the loan contains actions, milestones,\n            and expected results in each of the above four broad areas\n            of public policy. This reform program supports a substantial\n            portion of the authorities' strategy to improve public\n            service delivery and public institutions. There are four\n            components of the project. The first component of PPDPL 2\n            supports the macroeconomic framework that has underpinned\n            Turkey's recovery and strong growth after the 2001\n            crisis, with an aim to ensure sustainability of growth and\n            mitigate risks arising from a complex and dynamic external\n            environment. The second component focuses on improving the\n            quality of fiscal adjustment as well as social protection\n            through parametric pension reform, implementation of\n            administrative reforms intended to strengthen administrative\n            capacity, and supporting efficiency increasing and\n            cost-saving measures in the health system in order to\n            contain pressures in health expenditures. The third\n            component supports sustained implementation of the Public\n            Financial Management and Control (PFMC) Law that has\n            underpinned the outstanding improvements in the public\n            expenditure management system in Turkey. The areas supported\n            focus on establishing strategy development units in all\n            government institutions, introducing accrual basis\n            accounting for the government, and improving the link\n            between policy objectives, resources allocation process and\n            the public investment. The fourth component supports\n            improvements in the administration and governance of the\n            public sector through actions intended to reduce regional\n            disparities, improve quality of public delivery at local\n            level, and improve the justice system. The areas supported\n            focus on increasing the efficiency and the quality of\n            judicial services, including increasing resources available\n            to the judiciary, institutional and structural changes (such\n            as the establishment of Regional Courts of Appeal) and\n            modernization of the judiciary through upgrading of\n            infrastructure and automation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -
