Besides analyzing each project, the\n            cluster audit identifies constraints and recipes for success\n            that could apply to the entire Indonesian water supply and\n            sewerage sector. The performance audit report demonstrates\n            that the focus of future assistance should aim at creating\n            appropriate sector legislation, regulation, and policies.\n            Such a policy-based assistance strategy would improve the\n            development and impact of future lending and reach the\n            smaller municipalities where the needs are the greatest.

through the provision of Technical Assistance (TA)\n            and training; and (c) agencies that cannot submit timely\n            audit reports by Government auditors should be requested to\n
