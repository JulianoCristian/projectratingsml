Some lessons learned\n            included: beneficial impact of multi-sectoral training teams\n            working at the local level. These teams are not formed\n            organically and it is important to be able to overcome\n            sectoral resistance in fostering such collaborations. It is\n            important to build into a locally implemented project some\n            resources and mechanisms for dissemination of results and\n            policy dialogue with the national government. Otherwise, the\n            effects of the project, even when significant, may not be\n            fully understood at the national level, which is likely to\n            hinder policy implications and replication. Institution\n            building for public participation and control of the\n            activities of local government is an important aspect of\n            effective decentralization. In a top-down post-socialist\n            environment, it takes time to build these skills. Different\n            temporality of capacity building and investment activities\n            should be adequately factored into project design so that\n            the clients are not frustrated by the unrealistic\n            expectation of fast and sustainable institution building.\n            When sufficient attention is given to capacity building,\n            there is a greater possibility that the created structures\n            be institutionalized and used by the communities in other\n            similar contexts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Rural Development

There are two main project components beside the\n            project management component. The first component finances\n            technical assistance and training activities to build the\n            capacity of local stakeholders, primarily communes and their\n            constituents (including likely project beneficiaries), but\n            also private service providers, county council technical\n            staff, and other stakeholders. The second component provides\n            funding for demand-driven investments prepared for communes\n            and community-based organizations. The component will also\n            finance a public environmental health promotion campaign,\n            and a rural water/sanitation strategy study. In connection\n            with roads, the component will fund studies aimed at\n            improving the broader legal, institutional, and regulatory\n            framework for rural transport and
