Pakistan has borne the brunt of the earthquake,\n            especially 5 northeastern districts of the North West\n            Frontier Province (NWFP) and three districts covering most\n            of had Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), with enormous loss of life\n            and devastation of infrastructure and property.  In response\n            to the earthquake, the Bank announced that US$20 million\n            would be available to the Government of Pakistan through\n            reallocations from existing projects. This amount was\n            doubled to US$ 40 million on October 11, through additional\n            identified reallocations.  The Bank is preparing a proposed\n            package of US$ 470 million to help Pakistan deal with the\n            reconstruction effort and safeguard the on-going reform and\n            poverty reduction program. This package will include: (1)\n            Supplemental Financing of US$ 150 million under the Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 1) and of US$ 50 million\n            under NWFP SAC 2; (2)additional financing for existing\n            projects (AJK Community Infrastructure and Services Project,\n            Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund Project, and Highways\n            Rehabilitation Project); and (3) reallocation of part of the\n            proceeds of AJK Community Infrastructure and Services\n            Project, Second NWFP Community Infrastructure and Services\n            Project, and the NWFP On-Farm Water Management Project. In\n            addition to this immediate response, if the Damage and Needs\n            Assessment identifies unmet needs, and if the Government\n            requests it, the Bank could prepare an Emergency Recovery\n            Program. Even without a formal Damage and Needs\n            Assessment--expected in mid-November-- it is clear that the\n            economic impact of the earthquake is sizeable. Early\n            estimates suggest that the reconstruction costs of the lost\n            infrastructure will run into several billions of US dollars\n            and thus will have a sizeable impact on the overall\n            financing needs of the Government of Pakistan (as well as\n            the Government of the NWFP). The report covers the proposed\n            Supplemental Financing of US$ 150 million, which will\n            support the sustained implementation of the PRSC reform\n            program, and help finance part of the gap in resources\n            incurred as a result of the earthquake This is consistent\n            with Bank policy as reflected in OP 8.60, according to which\n            supplemental financing may be provided for a development\n            policy operation for which an anticipated gap in financing\n            jeopardizes a reform program that is otherwise proceeding on\n            schedule and in compliance with the agreed policy agenda."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Poverty Reduction Support Credit\n            Project : supplemental

Among\n            the findings and implications for subsequent operations were\n            the following: 1) Future Poverty Reduction Support Credits\n            (PRSCs) should focus on key policy reforms that are within\n            the domain of the federal government. PRSCs would therefore\n            continue to need to be complemented with provincial\n            adjustment operations, such as those in Punjab and NWFP,\n            which could focus more heavily on service delivery\n            improvements. 2) The approach of using a one-tranche\n            operation as advocated in the Country Assistance Strategy,\n            appears to be working well. 3) Since Pakistan's\n            three-year arrangement under the IMF's Poverty\n            Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) ended in December 2004,\n            future PRSC's will need to pay greater attention to the\n            monitoring of key macroeconomic indicators, and will also\n            need to be informed by a number of analytical activities\n            currently underway (on labor markets, safety nets, disease\n            surveillance, civil service pensions, and on gender). 4)\n            Subsequent PRSCs will also need to support, and be informed\n            by, development of timely and reliable sources of data, such\n            as the two major surveys --- the Core Welfare Indicators\n            Questionnaire (CWIQ) and a Household Income and Expenditure\n            Survey (HIES), which will provide social sector and poverty\n            data by July 2005 and December 2005 respectively."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -

The PRSC program will support accelerated\n            progress in human capital, by focusing on measures that are\n            the responsibility of the federal government, namely,\n            strengthening national sector policy in health and\n            education; improving the public expenditure framework for\n            health and education; and, promoting increased data\n            generation, monitoring of outcomes, and program evaluation.\n            The PRSC will further support improvements in\n            Pakistan's safety nets, so as to improve targeting, and\n            ensure that the poor and vulnerable are covered. While risks\n            exist, the project's sustained, and deepened policy\n            dialogue, and the support to capacity building of key\n            government institutions, will far outweigh those risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/08/5129876/pakistan-poverty-reduction-support-credit-project","projn":"PK-Pakistan Prsc I -- P078806","docty":"Program Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Poverty Assessment,Governance Indicators,Achieving Shared Growth","teratopic":"Environment,Poverty Reduction,Governance,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20040915141826"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,General public administration sector,General industry and trade sector,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Poverty Reduction,Governance,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Industry and trade,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accountability, aged, Agriculture, air,\n            Auditing, balance sheet, Banking Sector, banking system,\n            base year, capacity building, central bank, child mortality,\n            Civil Service, consolidation, consumers, credit culture,\n            Debt, debt restructuring, deficits, deregulation,\n            Devolution, economic activity, economic growth, employment,\n            Expenditures, exports, Financial Management, financial\n            performance, Financial Sector, fiscal deficits, FISCAL YEAR,\n            GDP, government reform, Gross National Savings, growth rate,\n            health services, housing, Human Capital, human development,\n            human resource management, Immunization, Immunodeficiency,\n            Income, Infant mortality, Inflation, Interest, Interest\n            Rate, interest rates, international supervisory standards,\n            Land Reclamation, laws, Legal Framework, legislation,\n            lessons learned, liquidity,"}},"owner":"Econ.
