Some lessons\n            learned includes: a fundamental lesson is not to ignore\n            downstream impacts when large infrastructure or hydropower\n            projects are undertaken in sensitive ecosystems. It is good\n            practice for the Bank to support development of improved\n            Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) legislation and\n            capacity as part of implementation of infrastructure or\n            hydropower projects. Preventing the potential extinction of\n            an endangered species is an exceedingly complex task; it is\n            costly because of the scientific uncertainty regarding the\n            processes involved. Considerable time is needed to respond\n            to unexpected events such as diseases, mortality, and\n            predators, which can wipe out whole populations even in\n            captivity. When environmental impacts involving scientific\n            uncertainty need to be addressed, it is prudent to involve\n            partners from the scientific community early in the project\n            cycle. Internalization of environmental management plans\n            within the developer's operating principles and\n            framework is good practice."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Lower Kihansi

The project will, at the national\n            level, support the development of a coordinated and\n            consistent legal and institutional framework for\n            environmental and water resources management. The project\n            comprises of four components, namely: habitat and species\n            conservation and management; establishment of final water\n            rights; implementation of an updated environmental\n            management plan; and institutional strengthening. While the\n            project will improve the Government's capacity to\n            manage a threatened ecosystem, major risks are associated\n            with increased power demands in Tanzania, which may limit\n            the Tanzania Electric Supply Company's ability to\n            provide sufficient bypass water flows necessary to conserve\n            the Gorge ecosystem, as well as long-term risks associated\n            with drought management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania -
