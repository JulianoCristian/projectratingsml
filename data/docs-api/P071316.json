Some lessons\n            learned includes: select Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n            that accurately reflect project objectives and are\n            measurable and monitoring and evaluation methods that allow\n            for continuous feedback on project performance and\n            discrimination of project effects. Supporting organizational\n            structure and reinforcing institutional arrangements at all\n            levels of government and strong ownership by local\n            stakeholders are key to decentralized collaborative\n            management. The project was able to instill a strong sense\n            of ownership to local governments and other stakeholders,\n            particularly local communities. COREMAP-II's\n            comprehensive approach using awareness, training, education,\n            economic and social welfare, and research and monitoring,\n            and proactive management led to its success in accomplishing\n            the objectives. Project design must realistically\n            incorporate logistical, financial, and capacity factors that\n            may present challenges in the field. Streamlining Government\n            and Bank financial administrative and disbursement system is\n            absolutely critical for project success/failure. Although\n            this project succeeded in spite of the central\n            government's rigid, complex, and cumbersome financial\n            and administrative system, delays and disproportionate\n            attention and effort by the project team toward\n            administration led to frustration and mistrust by local\n            stakeholders. Awareness raising and education can be a\n            low-risk, cost effective way to strengthen support and\n            ownership of project objectives and improve outcomes. The\n            realization by community members of the connection between\n            coral reef health and human welfare is a revelatory event.\n            Revolving funds may not be the best mechanism to channel\n            needed financing for livelihood transformation. Although\n            intensive efforts to train and socialize community members\n            in the concept of revolving loan funds, there was\n            misunderstanding and misuse of the funds in some cases, and\n            poor overall rate of repayment (60 percent)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Second Coral Reef Rehabilitation\n            and Management
