Some lessons learned\n            included: in countries with very limited public sector\n            capacity, a major overhaul of public sector management\n            systems on multiple fronts simultaneously is likely to\n            require a programmatic approach to lending rather than a\n            single investment loan. The downscaling of initiatives\n            during CBEMP implementation, the additional financing and\n            the extension of the closing date for the project indicate\n            that the full implementation of the project initiatives\n            under a single credit was unrealistic from the beginning.\n            Fundamental reforms in the Government's way of doing\n            business require a long term perspective. When such reforms\n            are attempted under a single project, inevitably it leads to\n            implementation delays and significant risks to\n            sustainability due to the lack of time for the reforms to\n            become entrenched. For this reason, a second CBEMP is\n            currently under preparation in order to sustain and deepen\n            implementation of key initiatives under the first CBEMP.\n            Commitment to the project at the top levels of Government is\n            a necessary but not sufficient condition for timely project\n            implementation. A fully satisfactory outcome ultimately must\n            have the backing of the line managers in charge of\n            implementing the project's components. For CBEMP, it\n            was not until there was a change in the relevant management,\n            several years after the start of the project that\n            substantial work on the Integrated Financial Management\n            Information System (IFMIS) began in earnest. It is\n            recommended that a clear and transparent mechanism be\n            established in advance on how best to address instances of\n            protracted lack of commitment by a beneficiary, including\n            triggers for the removal of the beneficiary through project restructuring."},"docna":{"cdata!":"The Gambia - Capacity Building for Economic\n            Management

Project components\n            aim at: 1) strengthening macroeconomic analysis, and policy\n            formulation, through the provision of technical advice to\n            the Department of State for Finance and Economic Affairs\n            (DOSFEA) on economic, and social policies, oversee the\n            economic planning design, participate in the preparation of\n            the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and expenditure\n            reviews, and, promote consistent social, and economic\n            policies, including assistance for budget implementation. To\n            this end, reliable statistics are needed, based on a\n            strengthened data collection on national accounts,\n            employment, expenditure, and social aspects, factors which\n            will be improved by building the Central Statistics\n            Department's capacity, and upgrading statistical\n            analysis to meet international standards; 2) strengthening\n            public resource management, by restructuring the Central\n            Revenue Department (CRD), to improve accountability, and\n            management, and, by setting up a tax payers unit to control\n            revenue collection. CRD's processes will be\n            reengineered, computerization will improve tax assessments,\n            while consulting services, and training will support the\n            review of legal frameworks, public expenditure, and\n            financial management; and, 3) facilitating private sector\n            development, by building capacity, primarily on the legal,\n
