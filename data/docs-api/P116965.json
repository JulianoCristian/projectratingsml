The\n            project's procurement risk was considered to be\n            substantial, based mostly on the risk posed by the lack of\n            experience of staff in the Directorate of Operations in\n            carrying out procurement processes in accordance with Bank\n            Guidelines, compounded by the emergency nature of the\n            Project. The Bank and Borrower\u2019s performances were both\n            rated moderately satisfactory.
