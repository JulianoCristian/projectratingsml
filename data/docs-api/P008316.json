The improvement in the power system's\n            stability and safety, the turn in Bulgaria's dependence\n            on foreign supplies and reserve capacity, the positive\n            trends in the sector's finances, and the\n            government's continuing commitment to develop the\n            sector indicate that the benefits of the project are\n            sustainable. Both the World Bank's and the\n            Borrower's performances were overall satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned include the following: Adhere to long-term\n            development goals. In the case of Bulgaria, the economic\n            crisis and hyperinflation fueled the government with\n            numerous reasons for which they did not want to meet the\n            tariff covenant. The Bank's project team held strong to\n            the commitment to encouraging the government to meet the\n            financial covenants of the loan and showed the government\n            that it could be met and that benefits could be derived. A\n            second lesson is to assess implementation capacity. The\n            national electric company's (NEK) lack of capacity to\n            deal with external financiers such as the Bank could have\n            been addressed through specific technical assistance.\n            Addressing implementation capacity up front may have also\n            mitigated the problem of high staff turnover. A detailed\n            assessment of implementation capacity, including\n            procurement, would have helped to avoid delays. Third,\n            remain flexible to adapt to emerging trends/opportunities.\n            The Bank's flexibility in allowing changes in the\n            project's scope expanded the project's benefits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Energy Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bulgaria - Energy Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/06/1719810/bulgaria-energy-project","projn":"BG-Energy I -- P008316","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Business in Development,Banks & Banking Reform,Business Environment","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Bulgaria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02031010371440"},"subsc":"Power","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accidents,account,Accounting,accounting,aging,auditing,auditors,audits,balance\n            sheets,Bank performance,Bank procedures,banking\n            system,billing,budget management,capital\n            flows,coal,commercial operations,contractors,cost\n            accounting,Cost savings,decision making,EIB,electricity\n            generation,Energy Efficiency,environmental impacts,Exchange\n            Rate,Expenditure,financial,financial accounting,financial\n            covenants,financial management,financial performance,FISCAL\n            YEAR,imports,indexation,Institutional\n            Development,International Accounting Standards,life line\n            rates,local government,managers,Net Profit,operating\n            costs,operating efficiency,penalties,policy\n            decisions,pollution,power plants,Present Value,private\n            sector,procurement,producers,Radio,regulatory\n            framework,reserve requirements,safety,selling,technical assistance,Transport"},"1":{"cdata!":"accidents,account,Accounting,accounting,aging,auditing,auditors,audits,balance\n            sheets,Bank performance,Bank procedures,banking\n            system,billing,budget management,capital\n            flows,coal,commercial operations,contractors,cost\n            accounting,Cost savings,decision making,EIB,electricity\n            generation,Energy Efficiency,environmental impacts,Exchange\n            Rate,Expenditure,financial,financial accounting,financial\n            covenants,financial management,financial performance,FISCAL\n            YEAR,imports,indexation,Institutional\n            Development,International Accounting Standards,life line\n            rates,local government,managers,Net Profit,operating\n            costs,operating efficiency,penalties,policy\n            decisions,pollution,power plants,Present Value,private\n            sector,procurement,producers,Radio,regulatory\n            framework,reserve requirements,safety,selling,technical assistance,Transport"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF026081-USTDA CTF,TF020855-AUSTRIAN CONSULTANT TRUST FUND\n            FOR E & C EUROPE","repnb":"22202"},"733210":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1993/02/733210/bulgaria-energy-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1993/02/733210/bulgaria-energy-project","new_url":"1993/02/733210/bulgaria-energy-project","disclosure_date":"2013-04-10T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2013-04-10T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2013-04-10T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1993/02/03/000009265_3961003140238/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1993/02/03/000009265_3961003140238/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"3563","datestored":"1993-02-03T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1993-02-03T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Energy Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project's objectives are to:\n            (a) improve the operating efficiency and reliability of the\n            power system, thus reducing supply disruptions;
