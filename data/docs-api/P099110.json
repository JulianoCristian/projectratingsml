Flash floods triggered by the monsoon rain\n            caused severe damage to infrastructure in the affected\n            areas. Entire villages and urban centers have been flooded,\n            homes have been destroyed, and over a million acres of crops\n            and agricultural lands have been damaged. A Damage and Needs\n            Assessment (DNA) has been commissioned in the wake of the\n            floods. The DNA assesses the extent of the damage and the\n            needs for rehabilitation and reconstruction of the damaged\n            assets and infrastructure, and restoration of livelihoods\n            and economic productivity.

 outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the project showed the value of\n            incorporating preparedness and Disaster Risk Management\n            (DRM) related elements in a recovery and reconstruction\n            efforts. Not only did the project focus on reconstruction\n            and livelihoods support, but also supported creation of a\n            culture of preparedness in the earthquake affected areas\n            that were later replicated in the entire country.\n            Construction of more earthquake resistant houses and roll\n            out of DRM trainings are among two of the tangible\n            achievements in the aftermath of the disaster. A robust\n            Grievance Redressal Mechanisms (GRM) was designed into the\n            project to ensure that any grievances were recorded,\n            compiled and acted upon in a seamless manner without wasting\n            time. The GRM enhanced accountability by providing the\n            beneficiaries with a framework through which to resolve\n            their complaints. The houses reconstructed under the project\n            needed to comply with very strict construction standards to\n            make them resilient to the impacts of future earthquakes. To\n            ensure adherence to the minimum standards, a robust\n            framework in the form of a Non-Compliance Referral and\n            Response System (NCRRS) was provided. This system was\n            established at the grass root level in place to identify,\n            document, analyze and resolve issues of non-compliance\n            leading to higher levels of compliance in problematic areas.\n            This enabled the project to cover a greater proportion of\n            beneficiaries which might not have been able to benefit from\n            the project due to non-compliance with the standards of reconstruction."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Earthquake Emergency Recovery\n            Credit

The\n            additional financing and restructuring will support the\n            Government of Pakistan (GoP) efforts to respond to the loss\n            of life and destruction wrought by the recent floods,\n            helping to finance some of the critical imports necessitated\n            by the disaster. The credit is part of the first phase of\n            the World Bank's strategy to assist in the floods\n            recovery in Pakistan, helping to ensure the availability of\n            adequate fuel supplies essential for relieving suffering and\n            beginning the restoration of the productive capacity of the\n            economy. The financing will cover expenditures incurred by\n            the GoP on motor gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel imports\n            needed for recovery efforts, which will be determined on the\n

        earthquake occurred in Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. In\n            Pakistan, the earthquake left widespread destruction,\n            killing and injuring people, leaving 2.8 million people\n            displaced. Pakistan-administered Kashmir, known as Azad\n            Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and the eastern Districts of the\n            North West Frontier Province (NWFP) were dealt the most\n            serious blow and have suffered extensive damage to economic\n            assets, and infrastructure, with social service delivery,\n            governance, commerce and communications either debilitated,\n            or destroyed. This Earthquake Emergency Recovery Credit\n            (ERC) Project will support emergency recovery efforts over a\n            three year period, to mitigate the negative impact of the\n            earthquake, and restore livelihoods, rebuild houses,\n            purchase critical imports, and strengthen capacity for\n            implementation and hazard risk management. The housing\n            component will support the Government's\n            homeowner-driven housing reconstruction program that was\n            recently launched through: housing grants for reconstruction\n            with new seismic resistant core units, and the restoration\n            of damaged homes to seismically acceptable standards; and,\n            technical assistance and capacity building to support the\n            Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority\n            (ERRA), and provincial and local governments in overall\n            project management, reporting, monitoring and evaluation.\n            The strategy for the livelihood component is geared towards\n            the dual objectives of protecting the most vulnerable\n            households in the short-term, through cash grants, and\n            rejuvenating economic activity by reviving small businesses\n            and replacing assets lost in agriculture and livestock. The\n            import financing component will reimburse funds on the basis\n            of expenditures incurred by the Government on\n            reconstruction-related imports, which will be determined on\n            the basis of import Bills of Entry, and will provide foreign\n            exchange for private sector imports. The activities financed\n            under the capacity building component include: a) provision\n            of human resources and consultancy inputs at the federal,\n            provincial, and district levels; b) continuous social impact\n            assessments, and third party evaluations; c) design and\n            delivery of training programs on financial management, and\n            streamlined implementation processes; d) provision of\n            information technology connectivity, and the establishment\n            and/or improvement of management information systems (MIS);\n            and, e) facilities upgrade, including infrastructure, office\n            supplies and needed vehicles; and, development of a\n            communications strategy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Earthquake Emergency Recovery\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Earthquake Emergency\n            Recovery Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/12/6460087/pakistan-earthquake-emergency-recovery-credit-project","projn":"PK-Pakistan Earthquake Erc -- P099110","docty":"Technical Annex","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Housing & Human Habitats,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population,Rural Development,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20051207101404"},"subsc":"General education sector,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,Housing construction,General transportation sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population,Rural Development,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Industry and trade,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accountability, accounting, ADB,\n            Agriculture, Auditing, banks, book value, communities,\n            disaster prevention, disasters, district governments,\n            Districts, education, employment, Environmental,\n            environmental impacts, environmental management,\n            Environmental Protection, environmental risk, equipment,\n            expenditures, exploitation, extension, farmers, federal\n            governments, feed, Financial Management, fiscal deficits,\n            foreign exchange, head injuries, health, homes, hospitals,\n            households, houses, Housing, housing units, Impact\n            Assessments, imports, improved livelihoods, income,\n            injuries, international organizations, inventory, Islamic\n            Development Bank, laboratories, livelihoods, livestock,\n            Local Government, local governments, management, management\n            information systems, microfinance, Needs Assessment, NGOs,\n            Poverty Alleviation, Primary Health Care, private housing,\n            private sector, public buildings, Public Health, purchasing\n            power, Resettlement, risk management, Rural Development,\n            rural settlements, safety, Screening, shelter, single\n            parents, social services, social support, technical\n            assistance, timber, transport, victims, Water Supply, Workers"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"repnb":"T7664"},"facets":{}}}
