Some lessons\n            learned included: project designs should be simple when they\n            have short implementation periods. The ECE project\n            implementation period was shorter than the normal three year\n            period for most GPE-supported projects. The preparation team\n            designed a project that was simple and fit into the two year\n            time constraints. Although the project design was simple and\n            the approval process for the new wood framed construction\n            had begun prior to effectiveness, the 15 month delay in\n            approving the kindergarten designs was a key contributor to\n            the implementation delays. A strong project implementation\n            team must remain in place throughout project implementation.\n            Key positions were replaced shortly after implementation due\n            to changes in the government which also contributed to\n            project implementation delays. These delays along with the\n            short implementation period, contributed to the project\n            implementation challenges. Surveys included in project\n            designs are valuable tools for assessing impact of project\n            interventions. The parent satisfaction survey was important\n            for understanding the significant role that mobile\n            kindergartens play in preparing children ages 2-5 for\n            primary school."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mongolia - Global Partnership for Education\n            Early Childhood Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mongolia - Global Partnership for\n

the results framework indicators and targets to facilitate\n            measuring progress towards achieving the Project Development\n            Objective (PDO). The first change is made in response to a\n            request to reallocate grant proceeds received from the\n            Mongolian Ministry of Finance. The recent depreciation of\n            the local currency, the Tugrik, has resulted in significant\n            project savings.

Reallocations of the\n            savings in Category 1 (Civil Works) will be made to Category\n            2 (Goods), Category 3 (Consultants\u0092 Services) and Category 4\n            (Operating Costs) to realize these positive spillovers and\n            to facilitate additional project management expenses\n            required due to the one-year extension of the closing date.\n            The proposed changes to the reallocations across expenditure\n            categories have been discussed and agreed with the\n            responsible implementing agency during the course of project\n            supervision. The second and third changes listed above are\n            made in response to a request received from the Ministry of\n            Finance.
