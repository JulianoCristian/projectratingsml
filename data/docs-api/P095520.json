The creation of a single agency\n            responsible for the implementation of science, technology,\n            and innovation (STI) programs improves coordination,\n            efficacy, and efficiency of the STI policy. It is a good\n            practice for STI projects to address and integrate different\n            pillars of the STI system, by including actions that affect\n            both demand and supply of knowledge and innovation. The\n            project design should envisage early proactive action by the\n            implementing agency to develop a partnership culture and\n            demand, especially among the private sector. In designing a\n            results matrix for STI projects, teams should consider the\n            long term usually associated with the development of\n            innovation outcomes, as well as the country-specific context\n            that is likely to have a direct impact on STI through\n            different channels - the education system, the level of\n            international integration, and the industrial strategy. It\n            may be especially important for the task team and the\n            implementing agency to rapidly incorporate early lessons and\n            changed
