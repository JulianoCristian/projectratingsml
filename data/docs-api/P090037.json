Some lessons learned included: complex\n            clean-up operations inherently involve a certain amount of\n            risk or uncertainty, especially in situations where data are\n            scarce. Maintaining a robust set of alternatives/remediation\n            options catering to different situations will help minimize\n            the cost of surprise. The project was able to benefit from\n            cofferdam technology being piloted simultaneously at\n            implementation for the temporary remediation of 3,075 tons\n            of Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB)-contaminated soil. In\n            relatively small countries like Moldova it is more\n            productive to apply a comprehensive approach to Persistent\n            Organic Pollutants (POPs) management including: cleanup;\n            inventorying and monitoring; policy, regulatory and\n            institutional issues; capacity building and technical\n            strengthening; and public awareness activities. All of these\n            contributed to Moldova's ability in meeting\n            requirements under the Stockholm Convention. Significant\n            capacity was built during the development of the National\n            Implementation Plan (NIP) for POPs and which the GEF wisely\n            continues to sponsor in countries preparing POPs projects.\n            By maintaining the original composition of the PMT from the\n            NIP's preparation, and capitalizing on the information\n            collected; the project benefitted from this tremendously.\n            Local stakeholder involvement was necessary for receiving\n            feedback on local site conditions and safety
