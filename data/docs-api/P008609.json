The objective of this operation was to\n            support the DDSR agreement reached between Poland and its\n            commercial creditors. Bank's performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was highly\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            since the debtor country will incur high up-front costs, it\n            makes more sense for DDSR operations to follow rather than\n            lead the country's economic reform process; (ii) DDSR\n            operations provide significant indirect benefits by\n            restoring the country's access to international capital\n            markets; (iii) voluntary market-based solutions to the debt\n            crisis are strictly preferred to mandatory solutions, strong\n            signals from the international community regarding the\n            expected level of debt and debt service reduction can be\n            beneficial to ensure an operation that strengthens the\n            country's growth prospects. Finally, to reduce the\n            sensitivity of options to short-term market conditions, it\n            could be worthwhile to design more flexible instruments that\n            would help maintain a balance among them at the time the\n            final selection is made."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Debt and Debt Service Reduction\n            Loan
