management of the biodiversity of the\n            Caatinga in the states of Bahia and Ceara, while improving\n            the quality of life of its inhabitants, through the\n            introduction of sustainable development practices. This\n            restructuring paper is to extend the closing date of the\n            poject from October 31, 2012 until October 31, 2013, and to\n            reallocate disbursement categories. The reason for this\n            extension will be to allow more time for: a) consolidation\n            of project results and achievements especially with respect\n            to further mainstreaming the project's policy work on\n            Integrated Ecosystems Management (IEM) approaches into the\n            programs and public policies of Bahia and Ceara for the\n            Caatinga (semi-arid biome), and concluding approximately 40\n            percent of community subprojects which suffered delays this\n            year due to a major drought; b) provide a longer time\n            horizon for ongoing environmental and socioeconomic\n            monitoring and evaluation to better document impacts and\n            extract lessons learned; and c) continue
