Partners should\n            anticipate that implementation of these reforms will be\n            difficult and political, and will not necessarily run\n            smoothly or consistently. More attention to understanding\n            the interests at play in health policy and its\n            implementation during the HSSP design phase may have helped\n            address implementation risks; 2) given that the Health SWA\n            program focused on strengthening systems and processes as\n            part of a long-term agenda, it would have been important to\n            measure results in these areas, and not just focus on health\n            outcome measures. Despite efforts from the Bank and other\n            Development Partners, program monitoring under the HSSP\n            remained very weak and there was limited progress to improve\n            these systems, despite substantial financial and technical\n            resource investments. In retrospect, one means by which this\n            implementation challenge could have been mitigated would\n            have been to place greater focus on minimum performance\n            targets that would need to be achieved during each year of\n            implementation. In this regard, it is notable that programs\n            with earmarked funding from non-SWA program sources tended\n            to achieve higher levels of performance, over the duration\n            of the HSSP; and 3) The health problems in Malawi cannot be\n            addressed by \"quick-fix\" measures that focus only\n            on health services delivered. There is a need for\n            cross-sectoral programs involving nutrition and food\n            security, education especially of women and adults, water\n            and sanitation, and community mobilization. The potential\n            for further innovative partnerships between Government and\n            other providers (mission facilities, secular nongovernmental\n            organization, work-based health services, social marketing\n            programs, community-based organization, and the private\n            sector), using novel financing and contracting mechanisms\n            would be important to examine. Implementation models that\n            shift financial reporting to a more output based approach\n            (linking financial inputs and program outputs), could be\n            examined as a means of enabling greater technical and\n            financial efficiency in health service delivery."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Health Sector Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malawi
