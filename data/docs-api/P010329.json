The\n            project achieved its main objective, sustainability is\n            likely with the development of adequate maintenance\n            arrangements, and the performance of both the Bank and\n            Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, the provision of retroactive\n            financing greatly assisted the GOP. Second, \"emergency\n            response\" projects should be supervised more frequently\n            by staff specializing in the appropriate disciplines. Third,\n            borrower personnel should be given short courses in the\n            operation of special accounts, IDA procurement, and\n            disbursement procedures. Fourth, supervisory consultants\n            should be allowed additional staff-months so that a more\n            detailed inspection of civil works under construction is\n            possible. Fifth, field teams in charge of civil works may\n            require training by supervisory consultants or RMP to\n            enhance their competence in checking construction\n            techniques. Finally, the scattered nature of restoration\n            works, which involves different engineering jurisdictions\n            and capabilities, should be taken into account in designing\n            special funding arrangements and reimbursement procedures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -
