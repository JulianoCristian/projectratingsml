Yet, both\n            performances by the Bank, and Borrower are rated\n            unsatisfactory, because the shortcomings due to inadequate\n            project preparation, cannot compensate the strong Bank\n            implementation supervision, and, because the lack of support\n            by the Government, the Government of Himachal Pradesh, and\n            the Corporation's owners, led to subsequent\n            decision-making failures, respectively. Lessons mostly\n            concentrate on the related environmental and social impacts,\n            and to those related to project preparation and\n            implementation. Although run-of-the-river hydro projects,\n            can have minor environmental impacts, and limited\n            resettlement needs, safeguard issues need to be in place\n            before implementation. In this case, during the first eight\n            years, no special supervisory attention was given to\n            affected people, however limited their number may have been.\n            Only in the last five years were the socioeconomic surveys,\n            resettlement action plan, and adoption of a corporate policy\n            statement established to support issues such as\n            compensation, reallocation, and income generation activities\n            to mitigate adversity. Pre-conditions for project appraisal\n            should include commitment by all agencies, and the\n            establishment of a framework for resolution of interagency\n            issues. Moreover, a good preparation should anticipate\n            communication needs, including roads and telecommunications\n            links, while project ownership remains essential in\n            efficient decision-making, to avoid unnecessary delays. A\n            financial and economic model of the project should have been\n            in place at the early stages, which could have avoided those\n            delays, particularly so that calculation of the \"true\n            cost\" of implementation, could have been reached faster."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
