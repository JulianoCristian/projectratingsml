Other lessons can be learned from\n            this project implementation experience, namely the\n            following: The deterioration of ONAS' financial\n            situation shows that the Tunisian model in the water supply\n            and sewerage sector is under strain and that further and\n            faster reforms may be required to preserve the achievements\n            of the past and face the challenges of the future. The Bank\n            was not forceful enough during the early years of sewerage\n            tariff freeze in raising awareness with the Government and\n            ONAS on the predictable negative impacts of the absence of\n            sewerage tariff adjustments over a long period. This issue\n            should have been raised earlier to Ministerial or Government\n            level. It should be noted that ONAS and SONEDE's past\n            good performance, as reflected in many of today's\n            performance indicators, also made it hard for the Bank to\n            justify the need or to promote more ambitious or\n            comprehensive sector reforms. Tunisia's gradualist\n            approach to its macroeconomic and development policy agenda\n            has generally maintained stability and brought about steady\n            quality of life improvements. Sector policy dialogue and\n            reform proposals need accordingly to be well adapted to this\n            context, and be very respectful of local circumstances.\n            Adding a policy reform component at the ministerial level to\n            the original project could have helped in accelerating\n            sector analysis and in introducing adequate reforms. SONEDE\n            is still reluctant to hire consultants and contract out\n            operations more broadly. The completion report of the\n            Seventh Water Supply Project, dated August 1994, already\n            mentioned that the long and successful dialogue with SONEDE\n            had made the Bank staff too flexible and lenient towards\n            this reluctance. These two actions could however help SONEDE\n            make considerable cost savings as it could strengthen its\n            technical capacity. Lessons should be drawn from the rural\n            sanitation pilot project undertaken by ONAS. ONAS should\n            establish, in close cooperation with the Government, a clear\n            institutional and financial framework to ensure the\n            sustainability of any rural sanitation investments.\n            Finalizing technical studies before project effectiveness is\n            critical in order to avoid delays in works and project\n            implementation.
