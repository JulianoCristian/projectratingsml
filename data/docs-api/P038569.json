Relevance of the project objectives was high,\n            adopting policies, regulations, and structural improvements\n            to modernized the Pension Fund and reduce its deficits was\n            key to help the Government improve its fiscal performance\n            and in establishing a system consistent with a market\n            economy. In the area of Social Assistance (SA), a study\n            performed under SOSAC aimed to assess the extent to which\n            the means testing formula for SA benefits was effective in\n            reaching its intended beneficiaries, and develop\n            recommendations on how to improve benefits reaching the\n            poor. Lessons learned a) difficulties of the SOSAC Technical\n            Assistance (TA) Program played a part in the decision to\n            establish a full TA investment operation to support\n            implementation of the Consolidated Structural Adjustment\n            Credit; b) performance of the implementing agency was\n            satisfactory, however the agency had many other\n            responsibilities, and limited capabilities, e.g., for\n            procurement and donor coordination, which somewhat reduced\n            its effectiveness. The SOSAC was not a politically popular\n            project in the Kyrgyz Republic."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Social Sector Adjustment\n            Credit (SOSAC)

    pension scheme that will provide a stronger linkage between\n            contributions and benefits, while providing a minimum level\n            of guaranteed support to prevent poverty; 2) improve the\n            effectiveness of labor market interventions under conditions\n            of high unemployment; and 3) implement well-targeted and\n            fiscally sustainable programs to alleviate poverty. The\n            credit will be released in two tranches. If successfully\n            implemented, the program is expected to result in reductions\n            in the payroll contribution rate, alleviating the\n            significant burden on enterprises and on employment, and\n            opening the way for a transition to a partially funded\n            system. The primary risk of the project is that policy\n            reversals could undermine the medium term fiscal\n            sustainability of the pension system. Other risks include\n            lower than expected collections and weak institutional\n            capacity within the Social Fund. To mitigate this risk, the\n            Social Fund is undertaking an aggressive contributor\n            registration drive and has agreed on a comprehensive plan of\n            coordination with the Tax Inspectorate."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Social Sector Adjustment\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kyrgyz Republic - Social Sector\n
