Some lessons learned included: the project\n            design should match the country context and the capacity\n            available in-country. Using a template model that may work\n            well in other countries creates implementation delays and\n            unrealistic expectations. This applies especially to\n            commitment by all stakeholders, especially Civil Society\n            Organization (CSO) and to establishing the appropriate\n            institutional framework for program implementation.\n            Technical and fiduciary teams struggle to cope with\n            responsibilities at inception in a health sector that is a\n            first time borrower and where collaboration between more\n            than one ministry is key to successful implementation.\n            Therefore, ensuring that the operations manual is simple to\n            use and clearly outlines institutional and project team\n            roles and responsibilities as well as\n            authority/responsibility relationships is essential to the\n            success of the project. The project fell short of\n            accomplishing all its objectives. The timeframe needs to be\n            realistic, especially if working in countries where\n            implementing agencies have weak executing capacity and no\n            history of involvement in complex multi-sector programs and\n            where the leading sector is a first time borrower. The World\n            Bank needs to be strongly involved from the beginning\n            insisting on a quality operational manual that spells out\n            roles and responsibility of implementing agencies, which is\n            to be held accountable, fiduciary capabilities and proper\n            procedures for engaging line ministries and contracting with\n            civil society; and supervision missions staffed with\n            experienced professionals able to provide technical assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Grenada - HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control

There\n            are four project components. The first component identifies\n            areas of systematic discrimination, introduces measures\n            prohibiting discrimination and human rights denial, promotes\n            behavioral change, maintains people's awareness of\n            HIV/AIDS risks and protection measures as well as safe sex\n            practices, and launches a major schools initiative, resorts\n            to non-traditional practices, wages mass media campaigns,\n            and conducts special presentations. The second component\n            supports clinical preventive interactions for reducing and\n            controlling HIV/AIDS; clinical management of sexually\n            transmitted diseases, prevention of mother-to-child\n            transmission, tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment, and\n            blood bank and laboratories quality control. The third\n            component upgrades current services available for providing\n            care to PLWA, and for treatment, including introducing\n            triple anti-retroviral therapy; and finances manuals and\n            staff training.

- HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control\n            Project : environmental assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The report audits biomedical waste\n            management practices in Grenada, based on the most relevant\n            law, the Waste Management Act (2001), only recently\n            enforced. Regrettably, except for some general requirements,\n            specific biomedical waste regulations are non-existent, and\n            likewise, the policies in health facilities regarding\n            comprehensive waste management, with little or no training\n            for biomedical waste management. The recommendations this\n            report provides to minimize biomedical wastes, include\n            stipulations that new biomedical waste treatment\n            technologies, will be presented in another report. It does\n            nevertheless review practices, the most usual being\n            incineration of wastes. However, this practice for regular\n            wastes - which include plastics - as well as biomedical\n            wastes, and which does not segregate wastes, poses fire\n            hazards to surrounding vegetation, including threats from\n            other combustible materials, in addition to releasing air\n            pollutants - toxic dioxins, acid gases, particulates and\n            heavy metals. It is thus recommended the use of incinerators\n            be minimized, and, that halogenated plastics, heavy metals,\n            pressurized containers, and organic solvents be not burned\n            under any circumstance. Instead, biomedical waste should be\n            encapsulated, and buried in selected landfills, under\n            special arrangement with the Solid Waste Management\n            Authority. Specific short-term recommendations are provided\n            for each facility, and include the treatment of chemical\n            waste as hazardous materials, not to be drained, but rather\n            disposed of at selected landfills as well. General long-term\n            recommendations suggest strengthened laws and regulations;\n            institutional policy; administration and organization;\n            occupational safety and health; waste segregation and\n            classification; and, adequate handling and transportation\n            procedures, while contingency planning, should also include\n            training and education. Above all, stakeholder awareness and\n            participation, should lay the foundation for the development\n            of a national biomedical waste management plan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Grenada
