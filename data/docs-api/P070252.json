Some lessons learned included: in\n            complex regional projects, it may be more difficult for the\n            implementation and supervision process to fix design flaws.\n            To increase the likelihood of achieving project objectives,\n            design flaws need to be fixed early in project\n            implementation, at minimum during the Mid-term Review (MTR).\n            The full endorsement and commitment of all the riparian\n            countries of a shared basin is desirable for successful\n            Global Environmental Facility- International Waters (GEF-IW)\n            project implementation, but not necessary if adequate action\n            plans are incorporated in the project design. Country\n            management units' and country offices' increased\n            involvement in project supervision is critical for the\n            regional projects' success. In the absence of a strong\n            regional institution, development assistance should focus on\n            capacity building and institutional strengthening of the\n            recipient, rather than attempting to resolve or bypass the\n            institution's shortcomings by introducing outside\n            agencies for project management and execution. The Bank\n            should be realistic regarding project implementation\n            planning, the time it takes to complete a project of this\n            challenging nature, and the outcome targets to be achieved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa Region - Reversal of Land and Water\n            Degradation Trends in Lake Chad Basin Ecosystem Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Africa

six\n            surrounding countries), is protected by integrated\n            management of the basin's resources, by building\n            capacity among riparians and stakeholders, completing a\n            trans-boundary diagnostic analysis, and preparing a\n            strategic action program. However, the degradation of the\n            natural resource base, with the consequent impacts on local\n            populations, requires an environmental, and social\n            assessment. To this end, this environmental assessment,\n            based on the appraisals of the Cameroon, and Nigeria Dams\n            (v. 1 and 2), and on integrated environmental and social\n            assessments (v.3), proposes mitigation measures as follows.\n            The rehabilitation, and construction of a wildlife pond in\n            Waza, will adversely impact natural habitats, forcing\n            wildlife concentrations and an increased localized grazing\n            to build pressure around the water point; thus, water points\n            should be spread over a greater area, and grazing practices\n            limited. Additionally, new water points should avoid upland\n            forest areas, to prevent vegetation degradation. Floodplain\n            connecting channels will be enlarged and blockages cleared,\n            but river flows may be either reduced or increased, thereby\n            disturbing ecosystems; engineering/environmental consultants\n            should monitor river flows, taking remedial action as\n            needed. The identification of critical wetlands for\n            conservation will increase pressure on floodplain resources;\n            an environmental consultant should monitor soil erosion, and\n            review the impacts of conservation on threatened cultivars.\n            A process framework for mitigation of social impacts (v. 5)\n            provides measures to assist affected populations,
