The project achieved most of its objectives,\n            its impact on institutional development was partially\n            successful, sustainability is likely, and the performance of\n            both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, the future\n            development activities of the rubber smallholder growers\n            should be based on a clear identification of the specific\n            development roles played by the public and private sector.\n            Second, the under-pricing of planting material produced in\n            RDD nurseries is a deterrent to the expansion of private\n            nursery activities. Third, research conducted by RRI is\n            mostly focused on large rubber holdings, resulting in a\n            relative neglect of smallholder needs. Fourth, past analysis\n            of the viability of RRF is based on limited data and\n            short-term projections. Project experience suggests that the\n            continuation of the replanting/new planting\n            \"subsidy\" program in its current form and\n            intensity without an extension of the cess to domestically\n            used rubber is unsustainable. Fifth, the success of a\n            project, to a large extent, is influenced by the level of\n            involvement and sense of ownership of beneficiaries and\n            other stakeholders from its inception. Finally, there is a\n            need for wider dissemination and discussion of the ICR findings."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Second Smallholder Rubber\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka -
