Some lessons\n            learned included: a legal framework governing land\n            transactions by itself is insufficient in promoting land\n            consolidation. In the absence of a complementary law on land\n            consolidation, an exclusively market-driven approach to land\n            consolidation as was adopted by the project is unlikely to\n            succeed in promoting land consolidation in a transition\n            context. Wholesale markets should probably be initiated at\n            the lower end of their feasibility spectrum, with room to\n            grow as demand is demonstrated. Wholesale markets with Bank\n            financing have often failed commercially, and even more\n            commonly in other donors' programs. This may be due in\n            part to excessive optimism at the feasibility stage, leading\n            to excessive capacity and investment at their opening, and\n            excessive debt for the market company to bear later on.\n            Under the project, stakeholder working groups and detailed\n            feasibility studies provided a sound base for decisions\n            concerning the size, design, location and fee structure of\n            the four first markets. This allowed the markets to start at\n            an appropriate level and grow as demand increased,\n            predominantly with the markets' own funds. This in\n            turn, contributed significantly to the high occupancy rates,\n            and hence financial viability. Successful interventions in\n            seed development and supply require a careful balance of\n            public and private domains, tailored to the country's situation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Agriculture Services Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Agriculture Services Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/09/9838835/albania-agriculture-services-project","projn":"AL-Agriculture Services Project -- P054736","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Markets and Market Access,Housing & Human Habitats,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Debt Markets","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Rural Development,Agriculture,Communities and Human Settlements,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Albania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20080910234805"},"theme":"Regulation and competition policy,Rural markets,Rural services and infrastructure","subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Central government administration,Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Rural Development,Agriculture,Communities and Human Settlements,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to market, Agricultural extension,\n            Agricultural marketing, agricultural production,\n            agricultural products, agricultural research, Agricultural\n            Technology, Agricultural Technology Transfer, AGRICULTURE,\n            average price, Bank financing, Beneficiaries, beneficiary,\n            bid, Borrower, Cadastre, capacity building, capital\n            formation, commercial law, communes, communities, community\n            groups, Competitive Grants, competitiveness, Consumer\n            Protection, credit associations, credit program, crops,\n            CURRENCY, debt, deeds, description, development projects,\n            Disbursement, Disbursements, districts, drainage, East\n            Europe, enabling environment, equipment, Exchange Rate,\n            expenditures, extension services, fairs, farmers, farms,\n            feasibility studies, female, financial management, financial\n            structure, financial sustainability, fisheries, food\n            production, free market, Gender, governance issues,\n            Government investments, holdings, Human Resources, Immovable\n            Property, income growth, incomes, information technology,\n            institutional capacity, intellectual property, Internal Rate\n            of Return, International Development, international\n            standards, interventions, investment projects, laboratories,\n            laboratory equipment, land ownership, land reform, legal\n            framework, legal right, Lending Instrument, livestock, local\n            government, market demand, Market Development, market\n            distortions, market information, Market infrastructure,\n            market profits, market size, market transactions,\n            micro-credit, mortgages, new technologies, NGOs, notary,\n            occupancy, occupancy rates, open market, opportunity cost,\n            plant diseases, plant production, Price Contingencies, Price\n            transparency, printers, private sector, real property,\n            registration fees, registration process, Registration\n            System, regulatory framework, regulatory systems, relevant\n            market, rural areas, rural communities, rural development,\n            Rural markets, safety, sales, seed development, shareholder,\n            shareholders, social capital, spread, structural problems,\n            substitution, supermarkets, Tax, trade balance, trainings,\n            transaction, transaction cost, transaction costs,\n            transparency, turnover, valuation, village level, villages"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF025124-PHRD-AGRICULTURAL SERVICES\n            PROJ.

A truck driver in the\n            Albanian army, he used to transport sacks of produce on the\n            sly, hiding the weights for his scales inside the cavity of\n            peppers. He continued selling vegetables when communism\n            collapsed and eventually dropped his low-paying army job to\n            trade full-time. Verga would mount one sack of produce on\n            the handlebar of his bicycle, load two on the back and cycle\n            down dirt paths selling tomatoes and squash to his\n            neighbors. Today Verga, 39, shares two minivans with his\n            brothers. He brings the bountiful Mediterranean produce of\n            Lushnje, neatly packed in plastic cases, to the market of\n            Korca, 250 km away in eastern Albania where the weather is\n            colder and the growing season kicks in\n            later.<BR>Verga\u0092s happier circumstances reflect the\n            transformation of Albania\u0092s market economy from illegal to\n            grey and finally, in the last few years, to something more\n            open and organized. The transition is particularly visible\n            in the agricultural sector where a World Bank loan to the\n            Albanian government has helped fund the country\u0092s first\n            professionally-organized fruit and vegetable markets. The\n            first market funded by the Agricultural Services project was\n            established in Lushnje, a town in Albania\u0092s most fertile\n            valley, southwest of the capital city of Tirana, close to\n            the Adriatic sea. Although the market was opened only two\n            years ago, business is so brisk that it is already expanding\n            to keep up with demand for stalls and parking spaces. A\n            second market opened in Korca last year and two other\n            markets, in Shkodra in Albania\u0092s mountainous north and in\n            Vlora on the coast, are under construction."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - A reliable outlet for produce\n            doubles productivity"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - A reliable outlet for\n            produce doubles productivity"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/03/23947957/albania-reliable-outlet-produce-doubles-productivity","count":"Albania","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Bank loan, cities, crime, crop, cucumbers,\n            exporter, farmer, farmers, farms, flow of information,\n            greenhouses, growing season, hectares of land, market\n            economy, market specialist, melons, peppers, Produce,\n            retail, sale, shops, tomatoes, towns, trading, vegetables,\n            warehouses, Wholesale prices"}},"majtheme":"Rural development,Financial and private sector development","topic":"Crop Production m1326627 174,Debt m1326503 450,Debt Funds m1327683 1748,Access to Services m1327176 806,Access to Finance m1327464 1249","projn":"AL-Agriculture Services Project -- P054736","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Markets and Market Access,Housing & Human Habitats,Debt Markets,Access to Markets","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,International Economics and Trade,Agriculture,Communities and Human Settlements","entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20150203040932"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Central government administration,Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","theme":"Regulation and competition policy,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural markets","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,International Economics and Trade,Agriculture,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Crop Production m1326627 174,Debt m1326503 450,Debt Funds m1327683 1748,Access to Services m1327176 806,Access to Finance m1327464 1249","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["F"],"trustfund":"BBFAO-BB FAO,TF025124-PHRD-AGRICULTURAL SERVICES\n            PROJ.
