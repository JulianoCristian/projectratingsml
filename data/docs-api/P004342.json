Lessons stipulate that\n            significant steps to support the transition to a market\n            economy, and stability of macroeconomic conditions were\n            taken, through measures to support emerging market\n            conditions in the transport sector. However, the economic\n            stability remained fragile, and the country faces severe\n            foreign exchange constraints, leading to shortage of\n            essential products, including fuel. Thus, the high transport\n            cost reduces the value added to GDP from the export of its\n            principal products, and, revenue of transport enterprises is\n            diluted by inflation, weakening the financial sustainability\n            of operations. In addition, the urban transport management\n            needs to be seen comprehensively: the rate of attrition of\n            buses, and trolleys procured under the project is alarming,\n            bus utilization is low, and, among the factors contributing\n            to this rapid depreciation, are the difficult climatic and\n            road conditions, excessive over loadings, declining revenue,\n            and rising operating costs. To this end, the Bank may\n            consider assistance in developing a sustainable urban\n            transport policy. Conversely, while foundation towards\n            institutional strengthening, and capacity building has been\n            set, and the private sector exposed to international\n            standards in construction management, there is strong felt\n            need to deepen the skill, and knowledge transfer through\n            joint participation, and hands-on experience, for future\n

The project\n            consists of four sectoral subprojects, (railways, urban\n            transport, road freight transport and roads), each with a\n            physical and technical assistance component, and a component\n            to advise on sector policy and assist in the implementation\n            of the project. The project will focus on: 1) rehabilitation\n            of the transport fleet in railways, urban transport and\n            trucking; 2) rehabilitation of paved roads; 3) preparation\n            for restructuring of selected transport enterprises; and 4)\n            policy advice, technical assistance and training to related\n            sectoral agencies and private trucking operators. The\n            project has been designed to complement the efforts of other\n            donors active in Mongolia.
