The relevance rating would have been\n            higher had it not been for ERP's fourth humanitarian\n            objective, which was only modestly relevant to BiH's\n            reconstruction. Emergency Landmines Clearance Project: the\n            project objectives were modestly relevant to BiH's\n            post-conflict recovery program. Both efficacy and efficiency\n            in achieving the objectives were negligible; project\n            objectives were not met, yet substantial costs were\n            incurred. Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration\n            Project: for a country in an emergency post-conflict\n            situation the project objectives were modestly relevant;\n            they emphasized longer-term goals too much, even though they\n            neglected demobilization itself. Efficacy in achieving the\n            relevant objectives was modest, through the effective\n            support the project gave to reintegrating demobilized\n            combatants, albeit on a small scale and fewer than targeted.\n            Local Initiatives Project: All three project objectives were\n            highly relevant to the post-conflict development needs and\n            policies pursued in BiH, already more than a year out of the\n            war when this project began. Efficacy in achieving these\n            objectives was high, being exceeded in the case of the\n            setting up the MC0 framework in particular. Republika Srpska\n            Reconstruction Assistance Project: For the most part, the\n            objectives of this project were substantially relevant to\n            Entity and Bank recovery policies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Emergency Recovery,\n            Emergency Landmines Clearance, Emergency Demobilization and\n            Reintegration, Local Initiative, and Republika Srpska\n            Reconsturction Assistance Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -\n            Emergency Recovery, Emergency Landmines Clearance, Emergency\n            Demobilization and Reintegration, Local Initiative, and\n            Republika Srpska Reconsturction Assistance Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/03/3125667/bosnia-herzegovina-emergency-recovery-emergency-landmines-clearance-emergency-demobilization-reintegration-local-initiative-republika-srpska-reconsturction-assistance-projects","projn":"BA-Reconstruction Assistance To Republika\n            Srpska Project -- P048462,BA-Emergency Landmine Clearance Project -- P044393,BA-Emg Demob & Reinteg -- P044521,BA-Local Initiatives Project -- P045311","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Banks & Banking Reform,Rural Portfolio Improvement,Development Economics & Aid Effectiveness,Post Conflict Reconstruction","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040409135523"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Power,Housing construction,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Micro- and SME finance,Vocational training,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Energy and mining,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Finance,Education,Health and other social services,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aid,air,Auditing,autonomy,Bank\n            management,Bank Performance,Bank\n            supervision,beneficiaries,Conflict,Conflict\n            Prevention,conflicts,cost of capital,Currency\n            Units,Demining,demobilized soldiers,development\n            agencies,Development Impact,economic\n            development,elections,Employment,Fiscal\n            Year,flexibility,housing,imports,Institutional\n            Development,International Development,legal\n            documents,monetary policies,municipalities,natural\n            resources,Operations,Peace,peer\n            review,priorities,Privatization,project completion,Project\n            Implementation,quality at\n            entry,RECONSTRUCTION,Refugees,supervision,Sustainability,United\n            Nations Development Programme,war,war victims"},"1":{"cdata!":"aid,air,Auditing,autonomy,Bank\n            management,Bank Performance,Bank\n            supervision,beneficiaries,Conflict,Conflict\n            Prevention,conflicts,cost of capital,Currency\n            Units,Demining,demobilized soldiers,development\n            agencies,Development Impact,economic\n            development,elections,Employment,Fiscal\n            Year,flexibility,housing,imports,Institutional\n            Development,International Development,legal\n            documents,monetary policies,municipalities,natural\n            resources,Operations,Peace,peer\n            review,priorities,Privatization,project completion,Project\n            Implementation,quality at\n            entry,RECONSTRUCTION,Refugees,supervision,Sustainability,United\n            Nations Development Programme,war,war victims"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE),Human Development Sector Unit (ECSHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF020212-ADVISORY SERVICES AND TECH.

These\n            are some of the lesson learned: Grant, not credit, finance\n            should be considered for initial social assistance in\n            agriculture in post-conflict situations. In agriculture,\n            attention to project design and implementation should always\n            be given to linkages among producers, processors, and\n            markets even if the project has social assistance\n            objectives. In all sectors, greater development impacts\n            might have been achieved with complementary investments in\n            technical assistance and more focus on institutional\n            strengthening. For example, provision of resources to\n            farmers would have benefited from accompanying technical\n            support, in the form of professional advice to farmers on\n            such issues as animal nutrition and husbandry, and machinery\n            use. In the housing sector, more consideration might have\n            been given to occupancy issues, given their\n            sensitivity--i.e., the design of the project meant that the\n            Bank had little leverage over municipalities in the case\n            that they obstructed return of original residents to their\n            homes. This raises the issue of the degree to which the Bank\n            can make use of non-economic conditionality to support\n            social reconciliation in post-conflict situations. Reliance\n            on local counterparts for project management and\n            implementation strengthens institutional capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia-Herzegovina - Republika Srpska\n
