Sustainability is\n            rated as unlikely through lack of ongoing maintenance and\n            means to fund it. Bank performance  rated satisfactory\n            mainly for the good quality at entry of this project.\n            Borrower  performance is also rated satisfactory, despite\n            sometimes lethargic management of procurement. For not\n            achieving its major objectives but still producing a few\n            worthwhile results,  the overall outcome of the Colombo\n            Urban Transport Project   is rated moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Sustainability is rated as unlikely.  Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory; poor quality at entry with a\n            design committed to reforms-a legacy of a larger, abandoned\n            project-not supported by the borrower and lacking\n            instruments to achieve them.  Borrower performance is also\n            rated unsatisfactory; procurement was protracted, sometimes\n            featuring ad hoc acquisitions. The overall outcome of the\n            Colombo Environmental Improvement Project  is rated\n            unsatisfactory. Sustainability is rated as unlikely; Bank\n            performance is rated  unsatisfactory; poor quality came from\n            a rigid project design that failed to effectively involve\n            either borrower or beneficiaries. Borrower performance is\n            also rated unsatisfactory, principally because of the\n            failure to implement solutions for solid waste and\n            wastewater pollution. Overall outcome of the Year 2000\n            Emergency Assistance Project is rated moderately\n            satisfactory, as the project apparently achieved its\n            intended objective, but with significant shortcomings; an\n            unclear counterfactual and public agencies receiving project\n            support after January 1,2000, and yet suffering no Y2K\n            disruption. Sustainability is likely, since Sri\n            Lanka's economy and banking sectors have already\n            demonstrated their resilience to a Y2K-type event. For its\n            rapid project preparation and close supervision, Bank\n            performance is rated satisfactory. For borrower\n            performance, the rating is also satisfactory, given strong\n            project ownership and efficient  implementation by the\n            Government authorities concerned. Experience with these\n            projects confirms the following OED lessons:  1)  Project\n            performance is vulnerable to the impact of conflict,\n            especially through unexpected  conflict events during\n            project implementation. Spatially separating a project from\n            active  conflict zones does not mean that an operation will\n            be free of conflict constraints.  2) Project design should\n            not be blind to conflict, and must cautiously but explicitly\n            address the  constraints imposed. War-weary governments are\n            unlikely to have strong ownership of  reform that is\n            unrelated to the causes of the conflict.  3)  It is\n            important to focus upon a clear vision of the intended\n            development results of a project and to remain focused on\n            them through systematic monitoring and evaluation. In other\n            words, the baseline should be measured, the counterfactual\n            clearly understood, and monitoring and evaluation supported\n            and implemented."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -

Key\n            lessons learned from the project include: 1) As a project\n            evolves during identification, preparation and appraisal, it\n            is important that a realistic match is maintained between\n            project components, objectives and indicators. 2) The Bank\n            must be realistic about results of institutional\n            strengthening. Changing a government department into a\n            supposedly autonomous body would be unlikely to have a\n            noticeable impact on efficiency unless this was accompanied\n            by a deregulation of service provision and tariff setting;\n            and genuine autonomy regarding cost control, use of\n            revenues, and access to capital markets. 3) It is important\n            to avoid having too many implementing agencies involved with\n            the project, which weakened the impact of Bank discussion\n            with the government on project matters and policy reforms.\n            4) Projects are more effective if they are being implemented\n            by an established unit as part of the regular work program\n            of the executing agency. The project can then contribute\n            directly to the institutional strengthening of that agency.\n            5) Bids for major civil works and goods and proposals for\n            major consultancy studies should be obtained before board\n            presentation. The procurement process needs to be well\n            advanced by the time of negotiations, particularly in\n            countries where procurement is a slow process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -
