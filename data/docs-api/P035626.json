Several lessons were gleaned from this\n            project: 1) The successful promotion of community\n            participation and small- and medium-sized enterprises, which\n            were largely absent previously, has laid the base for a\n            larger project to expand the use of the TIPPEE methodology\n            (methods promoting enterprise development employment through\n            public works). 2) Improving low-income settlements by first\n            improving existing road alignments and avoiding resettlement\n            was a key step to improving access to urban services and\n            safety, transportation, ambulances, fire department, etc.\n            Also, for the first time in Gabon, municipalities were\n            involved in road pavement projects, learning how to procure\n            these types of works, and becoming involved with community\n            leaders in the design and implementation of micro-projects.\n            3) The project was constantly adapted during implementation:\n            The first two components were changed to be implemented\n            jointly so that experience from the micro-projects could be\n            fed into the design of the tools and techniques being\n            developed for the TIPPEE methodology. 4) This project also\n            exemplified the importance of a \"learning by\n            doing\" process. 5) The project tested approaches to the\n            to paving main access roads and transit roads with concrete\n            cement blocks in selected neighborhoods without major\n            restructuring. This turned out be socially and economically\n            viable. 6) Lastly, it is recommended that the percentages of\n            funds supplied by the Borrower be reduced in the follow-up\n            project, as well as in other operations targeting poverty alleviation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Gabon - Pilot Community Infrastructure Works\n            and Capacity Building Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Gabon - Pilot Community\n            Infrastructure Works and Capacity Building Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/12/5527062/gabon-pilot-community-infrastructure-works-capacity-building-project","projn":"GA-Pilot Com.

There are four project components. First,\n            capacity strengthening of key stakeholders is to reinforce\n            the capacity of the government sector (state and municipal\n            governments) and non-governmental sector (nongovernmental\n            organizations and local consulting firms) to prepare and\n            evaluate the various TIPPEE (labor-based public works to be\n            contracted out to small- and medium-sized enterprises\n            [SMEs]) operations. This component will provide training to\n            key stakeholders for the use of such a methodology.
