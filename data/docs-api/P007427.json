It includes: (a) Exploration: Exploration by PCJ\n            of the offshore Pedro Bank as an equity partner of private\n            oil companies (i.e., the financing of its carried equity\n            interest after a commercial discovery is made) or, under\n            certain circumstances, by exercising a sole risk option for\n            activities such as well sidetracking, deepening, testing and\n            shooting of seismic lines. (b) Technical Assistance,\n            Training and Equipment: Provision of laboratory equipment\n            and consulting expertise in geophysics, geology,\n            micropaleontology, petroleum economics and engineering, to\n            train staff, to monitor exploration work undertaken by\n            companies and to advise PCJ on other responsibilities\n            including the import and distribution of petroleum products\n            in Jamaica. (c) Offshore Seismic Survey: Acquisition and\n            processing of about 2,300 line-km of seismic data covering\n            the shelf between Jamaica's southern coast and the 200\n            m water depth line.
