In relation\n            to the Water Supply Urgent Rehabilitation (WSUR) Project,\n            the audit fully concurs with satisfactory project outcomes,\n            likely sustainability, modest institutional development\n            impacts, and satisfactory performances. Three main lessons\n            address the following: 1) The importance for project\n            flexibility during implementation increases, particularly\n            under difficult situations. The primary focus of these two\n            projects on physical rehabilitation was appropriate, given\n            the government's concern with political reform and\n            civil unrest. It also provided time to nurture on\n            institutional reform agenda and build borrower buy-ins. This\n            subsequently made it possible to help the government cope\n            with ongoing urgent issues resulting from the 1999 crisis\n            caused by the influx of refugees from Kosovo. 2) Sequencing\n            of demanding reform activities and major rehabilitation\n            efforts, as well as the timeframe for their implementation,\n            need to be adequately analyzed to take full account of\n            practical priorities, and the available implementation\n            capacity. 3) The early establishment of a benchmark system\n            is important to facilitate appropriate monitoring of\n            progress and evaluation of impact of activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania -

The significant lessons learned during this\n            project include: 1) During the preparation stage, the\n            project suffered from a failure to identify key weaknesses\n            of the sector and to act decisively to overcome them. 2) It\n            was not possible and unrealistic to expect the Government to\n            support substantial institutional changes in one water\n            enterprise without linking it to broader sector reforms to\n            address the fundamental imbalances in the sector. 3)\n            Politicization of tariff liberalization, staff recruitment,\n            and other administrative and financial matters undermined\n            the potential for reform in the water and sewage sector and\n            diminished improvements in service delivery. 4) The\n            commercial and financial autonomy of the Durres District\n            Water Works (DDWW) was essential to reduce political\n            interference in the day-to-day management and to achieve the\n            financial objectives for DDWW. 5) Local government\n            participation in the project preparation and implementation\n            was essential to establish ownership and commitment. 6)\n            Frequent changes of the Ministers of the Ministry of Public\n            Works and of the General Managers of the Water and Sewerage\n            Directory had a very negative impact on continuity,\n            commitment, and meeting development objectives. 7)\n            Implementation of technical assistance for institutional\n            improvements at the outset was critical for achieving the\n            project objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Durres Water and Sanitation\n            Rehabiliation

The project will help\n            alleviate poverty by making reliable water service available\n            at affordable prices to the urban poor in the project area.\n            The project will also address environmental concerns by\n            improving sewerage collection systems in two urban areas and\n            implementing water pricing policies that reflect real costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Durres Water Supply Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Durres Water Supply\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/04/733031/albania-durres-water-supply-rehabilitation-project","projn":"AL-Durres Water Supply Rehabiliation Project\n            -- P008260","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Albania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961005071442"},"subsc":"Sewerage,Water supply","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"BOD,central government,collection\n            systems,Competitive Bidding,conserve water,Construction,cost\n            recovery,counterpart funding,Cubic meter,Cubic meters,demand\n            management,discharge,economic development,economic\n            growth,environmental improvement,expenditures,grit\n            removal,ground water,hazardous\n            wastes,households,Imports,income,income levels,Industrial\n            water,Industrial water use,inflation,investment\n            decisions,iron,Liters per capita per day,Liters per\n            second,local authorities,maintenance costs,marginal\n            cost,municipalities,piped water,pollution,pollution\n            control,poverty alleviation,price of water,provision of\n            water,provision of water supply,public health,Pump\n            Station,pumping,pumping station,pumping stations,purchasing\n            power,Sea,septic systems,sewage treatment,sewage treatment\n            plants,Sewerage Sector,sewerage service,sewerage\n            services,sewerage systems,surface drainage,town,towns,urban\n            areas,water conservation,Water Distribution,water loss,Water\n            pipes,water service,water shortages,Water Supply,Water\n            Supply Rehabilitation,water supply systems,water\n            system,water systems,Water tariffs,water use"},"1":{"cdata!":"BOD,central government,collection\n            systems,Competitive Bidding,conserve water,Construction,cost\n            recovery,counterpart funding,Cubic meter,Cubic meters,demand\n            management,discharge,economic development,economic\n            growth,environmental improvement,expenditures,grit\n            removal,ground water,hazardous\n            wastes,households,Imports,income,income levels,Industrial\n            water,Industrial water use,inflation,investment\n            decisions,iron,Liters per capita per day,Liters per\n            second,local authorities,maintenance costs,marginal\n            cost,municipalities,piped water,pollution,pollution\n            control,poverty alleviation,price of water,provision of\n            water,provision of water supply,public health,Pump\n            Station,pumping,pumping station,pumping stations,purchasing\n            power,Sea,septic systems,sewage treatment,sewage treatment\n            plants,Sewerage Sector,sewerage service,sewerage\n            services,sewerage systems,surface drainage,town,towns,urban\n            areas,water conservation,Water Distribution,water loss,Water\n            pipes,water service,water shortages,Water Supply,Water\n            Supply Rehabilitation,water supply systems,water\n            system,water systems,Water tariffs,water use"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF020855-AUSTRIAN CONSULTANT TRUST FUND\n            FOR E & C EUROPE,TF032340-ALBANIA - DURRES WATER SUPPLY\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF031027-ALBANIA - DURRES WATER SUPPLY\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT","repnb":"P6159"},"facets":{}}}
