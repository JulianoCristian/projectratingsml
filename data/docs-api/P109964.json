The\n            project will achieve goals by contributing to: (i)\n            capacity-building and service delivery for service providers\n            with a focus on prevention activities in high risk groups;\n            (ii) existing and new treatment services on the basis of\n            performance; (iii) small grants for highly vulnerable groups\n            and HIV affected families; and, (iv) capacity building for\n            local authorities and key ministries to implement and\n            monitor HIV/AIDS control activities, and operational costs\n            for managing the National Program including improving the\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system. The four project\n            components are as follows: the first component is preventive\n            services targeted to high risk groups. Interventions\n            supported by this component fall under the first axis (or\n            operational Program) of National HIV/AIDS Strategy and Plan\n            (NHAS) 2007-2011, and aim at reducing HIV transmission among\n            high risk groups through behavior change and increased\n            access to preventative services. Second component is\n            performance-based curative services. This component will\n            support the geographic extension of antiretroviral (ARV)\n            treatment and opportunistic infection prophylaxis and\n            treatment to HIV+ people in the whole country. Third\n            component is decentralized financing of small grants to\n            families living with HIVIAIDS and high risk groups. This\n            component aims at providing limited economic and legal\n            support to the most vulnerable families affected by\n            HIV/AIDS. Finally, capacity building for local authorities\n            and key ministries to implement HIV/AIDS Activities, and\n            National Program Management. The objectives of this\n            component are to build capacity to implement and monitor\n            HIV/AIDS activities in key ministries and local governments;\n            contribute to ensure adequate operation of the\n            Secre'tariat Executive du Conseil National de Lutte\n            contre le SIDA (SEP/CNLS); increase the SEP/CNLS capacity to\n            manage the M&E system;

the coverage\n            and or utilization of a selected set of preventive and\n            treatment services, among groups highly vulnerable to or\n            affected by HIV/AIDS. The National strategy includes\n            specific indicators for each of these objectives. There is a\n            very low probability that the operation includes some minor\n            rehabilitation of existing facilities, which will in no case\n            involve land acquisition and not involuntary resettlement.\n            Possible negative impacts include waste care activities that\n            have been identified in all structures that were visited.\n            They are mostly related to pollution of the air. The study\n            assessed current medical waste management practices in\n            Burundi and made general recommendations for improvements.\n            It noted that health care professionals have a very limited\n            understanding of the dangers of medical waste, and the\n            public information campaigns via radio and other channels do\n            not highlight the risks of poor medical waste management.\n            The most serious risk is the potential spread of HIV/AIDS\n            due to improperly handled and disposed medical waste (blood,\n            urine, syringes, sharps, bandages, laboratory waste etc.).\n            The main recommendations centered on the importance of\n            training health center personnel in safe medical waste\n            management and to ensure its safe disposal."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Etude sur la mise en place de plans de\n            gestion des dechets biomedicaux"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"\u00c9tude sur la mise en place de\n            plans de gestion des d\u00e9chets biom\u00e9dicaux"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/11/9019447/burundi-second-multisectoral-hivaids-project-environmental-assessment-etude-sur-la-mise-en-place-de-plans-de-gestion-des-dechets-biomedicaux","projn":"BI-Second Multisectoral Hiv/Aids -- P109964","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"HIV AIDS,Health and Sanitation,Gender and Health,Health Systems Development & Reform,Disease Control & Prevention","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Gender","count":"Burundi","authors":{"authr":"Burundi"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000011823_20080219162504"},"theme":"HIV/AIDS","subsc":"General information and communications sector,Other social services,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Information and communications,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"commercial sex, commercial sex workers,\n            communities, Description, double orphans, epidemic,\n            financial management, financial needs, health facilities,\n            health Programs, health services, Health Specialist, health\n            strategy, high risk groups, HIV, HIV prevention, HIV\n            transmission, home care, income, intervention,\n            interventions, land tenure, male circumcision, negative\n            effects, opportunistic infection, opportunistic infections,\n            preventive activities, prophylaxis, Public Health,\n            rehabilitation, sexual transmission, treatment, UNAIDS"},"1":{"cdata!":"commercial sex, commercial sex workers,\n            communities, Description, double orphans, epidemic,\n            financial management, financial needs, health facilities,\n            health Programs, health services, Health Specialist, health\n            strategy, high risk groups, HIV, HIV prevention, HIV\n            transmission, home care, income, intervention,\n            interventions, land tenure, male circumcision, negative\n            effects, opportunistic infection, opportunistic infections,\n            preventive activities, prophylaxis, Public Health,\n            rehabilitation, sexual transmission, treatment, UNAIDS"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 3 (AFTH3)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"majtheme":"Human development","repnb":"E1802"},"facets":{}}}
