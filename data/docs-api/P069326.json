Some lessons learned included: the\n            continuing high unemployment rates among university\n            graduates is a cause for concern, despite attempts to make\n            higher education more relevant. Although limited progress\n            has been made, the higher education system can do much more\n            to improve quality and relevance, including becoming\n            actively linked in real time with the labor market and\n            economy. More up-to-date labor market information is needed\n            as well as much more private sector representation in the\n            governance of universities and community colleges. The\n            emphasis on critical thinking and creative problem-solving\n            at each level means that some mutual adjustments are needed.\n            Higher education curricula need to

Some lessons learned included:  the\n            design of competitive funds needs extensive participation to\n            succeed. The guidelines for the competitive fund were\n            prepared by someone external to Jordan universities and they\n            were never validated and disseminated widely. In order for\n            such a vast reform aiming to create a culture of quality\n            within all universities to be successful, the procedures\n            manual needs to be designed, and validated by faculty and\n            administrative staff within universities in addition to\n            extensive training for academics to write proposals\n            accordingly. This requires a lot of time and well\n            coordinated efforts but this preparation will ensure a\n            better buy-in which is a critical factor for success of the\n            competitive fund. For a competitive fund to add value it\n            needs to be streamlined with government policies for\n            development in higher education and broader economic\n            priorities. Secondly, to be most effective a competitive\n            fund needs to be headed by a well-known and respected\n            academic who can manage the competitive process both\n            technically and administratively in a transparent and\n            efficient way.

The second component improves governance by\n            supporting the Higher Education Council's Secretariat,\n            the Higher Education Accreditation Council; and university\n            management and planning. The third component helps reform\n            the community college system by developing new programs and\n            human resources, and upgrading facility and equipment.
