The Economic and Financial Reforms Support\n            Loan (EFRSL) was aimed at providingquick disbursing\n            assistance to overcome the fall in foreign exchange earnings\n            (estimated at 5  of GDP) caused by the Gulf war, while\n            supporting the implementation of major reforms. The\n            objectives of the reform program supported by the loan were\n            consistent with the Government's development strategy:\n            achieving higher growth and employment creation, restoring\n            internal and external balances, strengthening private sector\n            development and restoring Tunisia's access to\n            commercial borrowing. To achieve these objectives, the\n            reform program covered the following areas: a)\n            liberalization of external trade and prices; b) promotion of\n            financial markets including bringing banking regulations and\n            supervision up to international standards; c) measures to\n            make special investment incentives narrower and more cost\n            effective, and d) a reform program of the system of social\n            security. The Bank's preparation and borrower's\n            contribution performance was satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned are the following: a) the success of an adjustment\n            operation depends on many factors, most importantly, a\n            Government willing to take the lead in promoting a program\n            of reforms; and the willingness, from the Bank, to cover the\n            need for financial assistance in the country. In Tunisia, at\n            a time when the SAL reforms were coming to a halt, the\n            Government understood the need for moving on. Thus, the\n            EFRSL program was \"owned\" and politically\n            sustainable. In turn, the position of the Tunisian advocates\n            for adjustment reforms was strengthened by the Bank support;\n            b) a complex reform program such as the one supported by the\n            EFRSL can be prepared in a relatively short period of time\n            when the Bank staff involved is familiar with the country\n            and qualified; c) a successful operation needs excellent\n            intersectoral and interministerial coordination. This was\n            provided in Tunisia by the Ministry of Plan (now Ministry of\n            Economic Development); d) any component of the reform\n            program which is not well prepared and discussed in detail\n            with the Government before the loan is signed is likely to\n            causeimplementation delays."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Economic and Financial Reforms\n
