Lessons provide some\n            insight on the experience of this operation. By and large, a\n            Social Fund is an effective tool for providing timely\n            development assistance in post-conflict situations, given\n            its characteristics and delivery system allow for fast, and\n            direct disbursement of funds which significantly reduce\n            difficulties following the end of a conflict. Fund\n            disbursement is relatively fast because of operational, and\n            institutional arrangements, i.e., minimum channels of\n            approval; and, direct contracting. Moreover, being an\n            autonomous entity, Social Funds can minimize political\n            interference, and allow for the processing of subprojects,\n            based on agreed and transparent sets of rules. However, and\n            given that social preparation, and technical capacity\n            building activities enhance the project investments'\n            sustainability, awareness-raising and capacity-building\n            interventions during the early stage of subproject\n            implementation are critical for the effective operation and\n            maintenance (O&M) of subproject investments. Thus,\n            nongovernmental organizations and other service providers\n            should be contracted early on for the provision of training\n            and technical assistance, balanced carefully vis-a-vis the\n            need for tangible investments on the ground. Furthermore,\n            while participation and commitment of local government units\n            is crucial, potential risks of such involvement however,\n            also poses challenges: such involvement facilitates\n            technical, and financial support to subproject application,\n            construction and O&M arrangements, but there is a\n            potential danger of inappropriate political influence,\n            especially where there is still enmity between participating\n            groups. These risks, however, can be mitigated by fully\n            adhering to a set of transparent rules and procedures,\n            implemented under flexible, and clearly defined\n            community-demand parameters."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines -
