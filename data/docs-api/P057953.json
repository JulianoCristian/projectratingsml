Some of the general lessons learned\n            from this project include the following: Learning and\n            Innovation Loans (LILs) can be catalysts to introduce\n            significant/important reforms on a minor scale, to learn\n            from the process prior to scaling up good practice outcomes\n            in subsequent operations, and to commence policy dialogue.\n            Supporting client's initiatives through technical\n            assistance to scale up pilots even as they are being\n            implemented can help to replicate good ideas. 2) Under\n            post-conflict circumstances, a first time operation in a\n            sector should be strategically focused, financing only some\n            key interventions and not include all pressing needs in the\n            operation since with increased complexity implementation\n            suffers delays. With a LIL there is a pressing need to\n            obtain in a short time the learning and innovation knowledge\n            for a major follow-up operation. In post-conflict LIL\n            operations, human and institutional capacity building should\n            be given equal importance as improving infrastructure and\n            educational materials. 3) Complex components such as\n            Education Management Information System (EMIS) and student\n            assessments typically require time to design, implement,\n            fine-tune and evaluate. Ideally, these aspects should\n            feature prominently as major components (rather than as\n            small components) of a LIL with sufficient funding and\n            technical assistance allocated for these important\n            components. 4) A LIL offers a good starting point to build\n            capacity in post-conflict situations particularly in the\n            context of weak institutional arrangements since it allows\n            the opportunity to pilot innovations. 5) In post-conflict\n            circumstances and first time sector operations, procurement\n            must receive utmost attention from the project preparation\n            stage. Missions should, jointly with government, prepare the\n            first year procurement plan and have the first package for\n            tendering completed at project effectiveness. Greatest use\n            should be made of standard bidding documents. 6) The\n            inclusion of an architect/civil engineer during preparation\n            and supervision can help to avoid civil works problems such\n            as cost overrides and helping to keep up the momentum of\n            implementation. In addition, such staffing could have\n            advanced standard designs for construction and standard\n            bidding documents prior to effectiveness thereby avoiding\n            start-up problems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tajikistan - Education Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tajikistan - Education Reform
