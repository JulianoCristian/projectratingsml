Some lessons learned included:\n            Given the high levels of international assistance for\n            Kosovo, such coordination is necessary to ensure that Bank\n            funded operations add value and avoid placing an unnecessary\n            burden on counterpart institutions. Intensive coordination\n            to ensure synergy with the interventions of key development\n            partners is required. Because of the limited IDA funds, the\n            Project attempted to combine support for three different\n            sectors that were considered as priorities for the country.\n            This weakened the coherence of project design which\n            comprised three rather loosely connected components related\n            to different sectors, and created difficulties for prompt\n            coordination, monitoring and supervision. In small countries\n            with limited lending programs, multi-sectoral projects may\n            be unavoidable. In such cases, more supervision budget is\n            necessary for a complex project. Project management without\n            dedicated project implementation staff can place a heavy\n            burden on civil servants in implementing agencies,\n            especially in view of their limited familiarity with Bank\n            operational procedures. If a decision is made to forgo a\n            free-standing public implementation unit (PIU), some sort of\n            separate project implementation support mechanism is\n            essential in fragile or post conflict environments,\n            especially for multi-sectoral projects involving multiple\n            ministries and implementing agencies. The results framework\n            should be prepared with the Borrower's active\n            participation to improve project design and monitoring and\n            evaluation (M&E), not just as a compliance requirement\n            of the Bank."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kosovo - Public Expenditure Management\n            Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kosovo -

strengthen\n            Kosovo's ability  to use public resources more\n            effectively, efficiently, and transparently through\n            strengthened public expenditure management.  The project has\n            three major components. The first addresses cross-cutting\n            problems inpublic expenditure management: budget\n            formulation, budget execution, and procurement, focusing\n            particularly on high-spending ministries. The remaining\n            components support policy and procedural reforms in two key\n            sectors. One ofthese is healthcare, with three\n            sub-components, which will: finance implementation of the\n            family medicine model in four municipalities; test a new\n            system for paying providers; and provide limited training\n            for the Ministry of Health on management, policy development\n            and planning, and communication skills.  The other component\n            concerns transport, which will contribute to improving both\n            the management and use of public expenditure in the\n            transport sector via four sub-components: expenditure\n            allocation, financial sustainability, road safety, and\n            traffic management by the Pristina Municipality."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kosovo -
