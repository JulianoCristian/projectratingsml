Some\n            lessons learned included: shortening the path of the flow of\n            financial resources from the source to the enduser can help\n            achieve quicker delivery of goods and services. Developing a\n            strong relationship with government can make it possible to\n            gain approval for design features that are beneficial, but\n            politically difficult. If broader community coverage is\n            opted for rather than a more concentrated allocation of\n            project resources, then measures need to be taken to ensure\n            that resources are not spread so thinly that their impact is\n            diluted. Additional capacity building beyond an initial\n            community contribution is required to develop a maintenance\n            mentality for new assets. It is important to demonstrate\n            benefits of the community driven development (CDD) approach\n            to stakeholders in order to win their support for the\n            approach. The role of \"social mobilizer\" is\n            essential for CDD projects and any capacity built through\n            this role should be sustained after project close. The menu\n            of investment choices for participating communities needs to\n            be well thought out in order to provide the actual service\n            the investment intends."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sudan - Community Development Fund Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sudan - Community Development\n            Fund
