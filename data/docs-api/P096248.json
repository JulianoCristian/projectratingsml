It will\n            contribute to the Government's grant program for\n            settlement, rehabilitation, and reconstruction, and, provide\n            institutional support to the relevant, lead agency in\n            reconstruction of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam and Nias. Though\n            its components, the project will: 1) provide shelter,\n            repair, and reconstruction grants to control the\n            construction process, managed through a community-based\n            approach; rebuild homes by affected people themselves,\n            seeking to remain in their own land, receiving the full\n            amount of support they are eligible for. Housing\n            facilitators will be recruited to work, and assist\n            communities in these steps. Additionally, this component\n            includes a window of funds for shelter grants. 2) finance\n            block grants for priority infrastructure for the\n            rehabilitation of small-scale priority infrastructure. This\n            component builds upon, and complements existing\n            infrastructure grant support provided for community level\n            infrastructure rehabilitation. Block grants under this\n            component match with block grants provided through other\n            operations for a full minimum basic infrastructure, and\n            social service needs. 3) finance a series of immediate and\n            medium-term technical assistance (TA) activities for the\n            establishment and implementation of the shelter support\n            grants, and priority infrastructure block grant schemes,\n            and, financial management systems. Moreover, the component\n            will support overall project implementation at the\n            provincial, district, and village levels, while capacity\n            building at the community level will be pursued, to maintain\n            and manage project activities. 4) finance the technical\n            assistance consultants, providing support to the Settlement\n            Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Strategy Program for Aceh\n            and Nias, as well as the cost of the establishment, and\n            execution of public communications, complaint handling, and,\n            an internal and external monitoring and evaluation\n            framework, to maximize effectiveness, accountability, and\n            transparency.
