The lessons learned from this\n            project include: 1) While fast-track BOT\n            (build-operate-transfer) projects have proved crucial in\n            alleviating power shortages, the economic efficiency of\n            individual private investments should be improved with due\n            consideration for a cohesive sector approach and\n            rationalization of prices and risk-sharing arrangements\n            within a competitive and transparent framework. 2) It may\n            not be realistic to expect power projects developed with\n            private funds under the \"fast-tracked\" Independent\n            Power Producer (IPP) Program to be least costly in the\n            \"traditional sense.\" 3) The high cost of the IPP\n            Program has been a contributing factor to the failure of the\n            project. Such an outcome indicates the need for sufficient\n            risk analysis or management in a highly uncertain operating\n            environment. 4) The use of a \"rate of return on\n            assets\" target for financial performance is\n            inappropriate for a company or sector with a very large and\n            lumpy investment program. 5) Quality at entry is a critical\n            success factor for project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines -
