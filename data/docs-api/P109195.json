Some lessons learned included: simple and\n            relatively inexpensive projects are low risk and can deliver\n            high impact results in low capacity fragile environments.\n            They are easy to supervise, and could be effective in\n            rallying around donors in difficult contexts immediately\n            after conflict while providing immediate capacity needed to\n            undertake other important reconstruction projects. The\n            Senior Executive Service (SES) operation was designed with\n            two straight forward components, with a small budget. For a\n            country emerging from conflict, and with very little\n            implementation capacity, a multi-donor approach not only\n            provided the requisite financial support for the project,\n            but also helped support coordinated and collaborative\n            implementation supervision. Countries in post conflict\n            situations, characterized by complete institutional\n            collapse, should consider carefully the level of ambition of\n            capacity initiatives, including undertaking a level of\n            analysis of lessons learned from previous attempts on the\n            provision of 'surge capacity'. The program will,\n            most likely, be susceptible to local capacity challenges.\n            Short term technical assistance should be factored into the\n            design and deployed early during the program implementation,\n            and should maintain continuous support and oversight.\n            Program such SES are not always controversial, especially\n            when applied in low capacity environments. Recruiting former\n            high profile political appointees for assignments in their\n            former organizations requires special consideration. Handled\n            poorly, it can engender hostility or fear. Handled well, the\n            SES can bring valuable institutional memory to support\n            government operations after the emergency period. Matching\n            the skills and capabilities of program 'recruits'\n            into the recipient institutions requires detailed\n            'matching-making' and a carefully managed\n            integration/support process (again this can come from\n            specialized technical assistance)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Liberia -

The project has two components\n            with the first being the recruitment of members for the\n            Senior Executive Service (SES) scheme which involves the\n            recruitment of a minimum of 100 SES members. A total of 21\n            positions will be recruited as the first wave of\n            recruitment. The second component is for the management of\n            the SES scheme. This component would be used to procure\n            basic furniture and office equipment to support and\n            strengthen the capacity of Civil Service Agency (CSA) as the\n            oversight civil service institution to eventually manage the\n            SES program at the end of the project. In addition, the\n            component will be used to pay for travel and relocation\n            expenses, workshops and seminars to be organized on the SES\n            scheme, exit package, and
