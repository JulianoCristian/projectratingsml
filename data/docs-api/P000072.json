It would develop the transit traffic\n            which constitutes one of Benin's most important\n            economic activities by removing one of the major bottlenecks\n            on the Cotonou-Niger and Cotonou-Nigeria axes. The project\n            risk are linked to Benin's undertaking an investment\n            which would also serve Niger and Nigeria without a formal\n            commitment by these two countries to the project. However,\n            the competitive advantages of Cotonou are strong enough to\n            assure that both Niger and Nigeria will continue using it."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Cotonou Port Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - Cotonou Port Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/05/726852/benin-cotonou-port-project","projn":"BJ-Cotonou Port -- P000072","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Transport Security,Common Carriers Industry,Airports and Air Services,Roads & Highways,Transport and Trade Logistics","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Benin","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912390790"},"subsc":"Ports, waterways and shipping","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to the sea,Air\n            Transport,airfields,airlines,Aviation,barges,berth,berths,boats,breakwaters,bridge,bulk\n            carriers,bypasses,cargo,cargo capacity,cargo handling,cargo\n            vessels,cars,cement,civil engineering,civil\n            works,commodity,concrete,congestion,construction,corridor,customs,damaged\n            cargo,demolition,demurrage,dispatch,domestic air\n            transport,drainage,dredging,earth roads,erosion,feeder\n            roads,fire,forwarding,freight,freight forwarders,freight\n            traffic,goal,gravel,handling\n            equipment,highway,Highways,Income,international\n            airport,international travel,laterite,laterite\n            roads,loading,manufacturing,motive power,Navigation,ocean\n            transport,passenger,passenger traffic,passengers,paved\n            roads,paving,pilots,port area,port areas,port\n            facilities,Port Operations,Ports,quarrying,railway\n            network,Railways,receivables,reserve,road\n            network,roadworks,roll,route,sand,sanitary\n            facilities,Ship,shipowners,ships,sidewalks,silt,span,square,steel,structures,tankers,terminal,terrain,Tonnage,Traffic,Transit,transport\n            infrastructure,TRANSPORT\n            SECTOR,transportation,trucking,trucks,Upper,waiting time"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to the sea,Air\n            Transport,airfields,airlines,Aviation,barges,berth,berths,boats,breakwaters,bridge,bulk\n            carriers,bypasses,cargo,cargo capacity,cargo handling,cargo\n            vessels,cars,cement,civil engineering,civil\n            works,commodity,concrete,congestion,construction,corridor,customs,damaged\n            cargo,demolition,demurrage,dispatch,domestic air\n            transport,drainage,dredging,earth roads,erosion,feeder\n            roads,fire,forwarding,freight,freight forwarders,freight\n            traffic,goal,gravel,handling\n            equipment,highway,Highways,Income,international\n            airport,international travel,laterite,laterite\n            roads,loading,manufacturing,motive power,Navigation,ocean\n            transport,passenger,passenger traffic,passengers,paved\n            roads,paving,pilots,port area,port areas,port\n            facilities,Port Operations,Ports,quarrying,railway\n            network,Railways,receivables,reserve,road\n            network,roadworks,roll,route,sand,sanitary\n            facilities,Ship,shipowners,ships,sidewalks,silt,span,square,steel,structures,tankers,terminal,terrain,Tonnage,Traffic,Transit,transport\n            infrastructure,TRANSPORT\n            SECTOR,transportation,trucking,trucks,Upper,waiting time"}},"owner":"CD13: BN/NE/TG (AFC13)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"1983"},"facets":{}}}
