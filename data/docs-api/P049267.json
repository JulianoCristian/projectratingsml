Several lessons\n            can be derived from the implementation of this project. Some\n            are summarized as follows: 1) The experience in Uruguay\n            showed that CREMA contracts (Contracts for Rehabilitation\n            and Maintenance Departments Intendencias) are powerful\n            instruments to carry out road maintenance and rehabilitation\n            in an efficient and effective way even in a situation of\n            great budgetary pressure. 2) In the case of Uruguay, the\n            commitment of the government to maintenance was essential to\n            avoid serious damage to the road assets caused by\n            maintenance neglect, but the current government's\n            pledge to provide adequate funds for road maintenance does\n            not commit succeeding governments. The issue of a more\n            stable funding mechanism cannot be deleted from the agenda.\n            3) The Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MTOP)\n            ownership of, and commitment to the outsourcing policies\n            supported by the project were critical to their success at a\n            time of unprecedented economic crisis. The project suggests,\n            however, some interesting lessons regarding the overall\n            impact of government funding decisions on the reform process\n            as it exposes the tension between immediate stabilization\n            needs and better fiscal outcomes. The decline in sector\n            funding, and equally important the uncertainties with regard\n            to future levels of funding, forced MTOP to slow down the\n            implementation of various institutional initiatives that\n            were being tested with promissory results. 4) It resulted\n            that the degree of internalization of the technical\n            assistance recommendations varied among the Intendencias\n            according to the level of interest shown by their respective\n            leaders. This suggests that future technical assistance\n            programs should be demand-driven and tailored to the\n            specific priorities of the Intendencias requesting support,\n            even if such an approach may face some political\n            sensitivities. 5) The successful departmental road\n            maintenance program should be fine-tuned to further its\n            impact on institutional building. This program should be\n            supplemented with an incentive framework that leads the\n            Intendencias to greater efficiency and effectiveness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay - Second Transport Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uruguay -

There are 5 components. The first, road\n            rehabilitation and bridge restoration, reinforces the\n            pavement structures of national roads and strengthens,\n            widens, or replaces existing bridges. Component 2 uses\n            performance-based CREMA contracts (contracts for\n            rehabilitation and maintenance) to rehabilitate and maintain\n            road networks. Component 3, funded by the National\n            Directorate of Highway's (DNV), consists of a contract\n            maintenance program and incremental operational costs of\n            force account maintenance activities managed by field\n            districts. Component 4 caries out departmental maintenance\n            subprojects over the project period in the participating\n            departments. The last component 1) strengthens the technical\n            capacity of the ministry of transport and public works in\n            road financing and user-charge areas, strengthens the\n            DNV's institutional and operational capacity, and\n            transfers technology to and strengthens the maintenance\n            management practices of participants in the Departmental\n            Roads Maintenance program; and 2) improves pavement markings\n            and road signs along highways and implements a pilot program\n            for road safety."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay -
