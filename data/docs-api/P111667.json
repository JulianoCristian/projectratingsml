The following are among the\n            more important project lessons: (1) Close coordination and\n            cooperation between animal health and human health are key\n            to successful implementation of investments. (2) The\n            establishment of a medium to long-term prevention and\n            control program is required. The lesson for this project and\n            other animal health interventions is that even if responding\n            to a disease specific emergency, interventions also need to\n            focus on systemic improvements and basic capacity building\n            which are sustainable in the medium to long term. (3)\n            Mitigation measures to close a financing gap should be part\n            of appraisal. (4) Institutional strengthening in project\n            management is the pillar to success in fragile contexts, in\n            particular for emergency operations. (5) A flexible and\n            timely response is critical."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Avian Influenza Control and Human\n            Influenza Emergency Preparedness and Control
