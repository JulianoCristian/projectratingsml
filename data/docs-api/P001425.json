In summary,\n            while inadequate knowledge at appraisal gave rise to much\n            problems for implementation, and given the complexities of\n            changing a large subsistence agriculture and the weakness of\n            national institutions, the project, as a case study, for\n            integrated agricultural development, was successful.
