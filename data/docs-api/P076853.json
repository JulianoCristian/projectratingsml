Some lessons learned included: it is desirable\n            to retain a degree of flexibility in the project to allow\n            adjustments to respond to changing priorities within the\n            overall framework of the operation. Broad definition of the\n            disbursement categories can contribute to such flexibility\n            and facilitate the movement of funds without difficult\n            formal reallocations. This is particularly relevant if the\n            implementation period is lengthy, there is a risk that\n            individual priorities become less relevant. The preparation\n            of the project counted with the strong commitment of both\n            the highest levels of Government and the implementing\n            agencies. The successful development of regulations for the\n            resolution of insolvent banks, the new handbook of Risk\n            Based Supervision (RBS) and the chapter on consolidated\n            supervision were all due not only to the high quality of\n            international consultants recruited but also the commitment\n            made by the authorities in providing technical resources and\n            personnel exclusively dedicated to these tasks. Importantly,\n            as technical capacity was build and the new supervisory\n            vision was institutionalized, the Superintendency of Banks\n            (SB) claimed clear ownership, reflected in their commitment\n            to continue such work beyond the lifespan of the FSTAL."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala - Financial Sector Technical\n            Assistance Loan

The project components will: 1) provide\n            rapid exit and resolution of insolvent banks, by financing\n            TA to the Super-intendency of Banks (SB) to establish\n            benchmarks to assess viability, and solvency of banks, by\n            designing templates to prepare, and evaluate bank's\n            rehabilitation plans.

Policy and strategic formulation\n            will be addressed, and the evolution of capitalized banks\n            will be monitored; 3) finance TA to establish a credit\n            information system to centralize, organize, and maintain\n            information of debtors of financial institutions in\n            Guatemala. The acquisition of operational software and\n            hardware will encourage better lending practices, and\n            improve the overall financial system; and, 4) finance TA to\n            strengthen the Special Unit Against Money Laundering,\n            including training, and supervisory assistance. Moreover, TA\n            will support the adoption of international accounting\n            standards by the Central Bank, and a strategy for the\n            financial system
