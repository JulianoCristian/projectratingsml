The lessons learned\n            indicate that The success of the project depended in great\n            part on the ability of the executing agency, Guyana Water\n            Authority (GUYWA), to be able to implement the designated\n            investment program, including meeting the conditionalities\n            specified. The lack of donor coordination in the water\n            sector was actually impeding progress. There were\n            uncoordinated standards, overlapping investments, and a lack\n            of coherent strategy. This Project came close to being\n            cancelled during its life and has never enjoyed unimpeded\n            progress. The political, security, and financial environment\n            has been very difficult. However, the project did,\n            ultimately, achieve significant improvements in the\n            institutional structure of the sector and mobilize much\n            needed investments in a rational way. This is attributable,\n            in part, to the flexibility of most donors in the sector who\n            were committed to adjusting the Projects (as feasible) to\n            achieve the greatest good in the sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana - Water Supply Technical Assistance\n            and Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guyana - Water Supply Technical\n            Assistance and Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/09/5152766/guyana-water-supply-technical-assistance-rehabilitation-project","projn":"GY-Guyana Water Supply Technical Assistance\n            And Rehabilitation Pro -- P007257","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Guyana","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040929115058"},"subsc":"Water supply","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aeration, audits, Bidding, channels, coastal\n            areas, communities, conditionality, construction, cost\n            savings, debt, detection, domestic water, elections,\n            Exchange Rate, income, institutional capacity, institutional\n            structures, iron, legislation, piped water, pipelines,\n            policy framework, potable water, Private Sector,\n            procurement, procurement procedures, programs, Project\n            Management, pumping, pumping stations, pumps, quality of\n            water, quality standards, resource allocation, safe water,\n            safety, sanitation, streams, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE,\n            transportation, urban areas, water levels, water meters,\n            water pricing, water quality, water resource, water\n            resources, water resources management, water services, WATER\n            SUPPLY, water supply projects, water system, water systems,\n            water treatment, water utilities"}},"owner":"Water & Sanitation Cluster (LCSFW)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF023020-PHRD-WATER SUPPLY TECH.

The project, together with other\n            donor-financed projects in the sector, will:  (i) initiate\n            the process of upgrading water supply facilities; (ii)\n            establish appropriate procedures and methods for ensuring\n            proper system operation and maintenance (O&M) and\n            promote the involvement of the private sector in water\n            operations; (iii) enhance sector technical, financial and\n            managerial skills through training; and (iv) rationalize\n            sector organization and strengthen sector finances by\n            instituting tariff reforms and improving cost recovery. The\n            project consists of the following key concepts:  (a)\n            facilities rehabilitation, comprising some 45 major and 100\n            minor upgrading schemes nationwide, and improvements to New\n            Amsterdam distribution systems; (b) O&M improvements,\n            supporting a systemwide preventive maintenance program,\n            standardization of electro-mechanical equipment and\n            contracting out of certain support activities to the private\n            sector on a pilot basis; (c) human resources development,\n            enhancing manpower skills in the water sector; (d)\n            institutional strengthening of Guyana Water Authority\n            (GUYWA), improving the capabilites of GUYWA in management,\n
