Some lessons learned\n            included: on balance, the fact that the project handled a\n            group of countries rather than a single one was probably a\n            strong positive factor in its success. The countries\n            excelled in various aspects of the project, and thus they\n            can truly learn from each other. Project performance, and\n            its marked improvement from the initial stage to the later,\n            shows the importance of applying World Bank protocols during\n            project preparation, so that the project starts well and\n            quickly.
