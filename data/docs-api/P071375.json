The lessons learned\n            indicate that the conflict that started three months after\n            project approval essentially blocked policymaking and reform\n            implementation and led to a substantial decline in\n            population welfare. The government commitment to reforms is\n            critical if policy actions are to be sustained but reform\n            priorities can change significantly in the wake of a war\n            situation. Country volatility was a risk clearly identified\n            in the President's Report of the Economic Recovery\n            Project (ERC) and the I-CAS and draft I-TSS: there was a\n            recognition of a continuous risk that the national\n            reconciliation process may stall or reverse. Selectivity and\n            realism are essential when the reform agenda is vast and\n            available capacity might be limited compared with the\n            agenda, especially in volatile political situations. The\n            design of a quick-disbursing credit in multiple tranches\n            seems appropriate for countries which are moving slowly or\n            taking only partial measures for their reforms, or when risk\n            of non-implementation is high. It took a long time to\n            convince the government of the need for the Bank's exit\n            from this operation as country conditions effectively\n            blocked project implementation. The ERC was just one of a\n            broader Bank strategy and its collection of instruments for\n            the pursuit of its dialogue with a country in a\n            post-conflict situation. The Bank could possibly envisage a\n            more modulated response in the design of specific projects\n            in the context of volatile country situations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote
