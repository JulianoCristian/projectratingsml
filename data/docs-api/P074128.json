Some lessons learned included: more thought\n            needs to be given to the general idea of 'exit'\n            strategies. The opportunity for 'exit' starts at\n            the design phase and continues by managing effective\n            transition strategies and assisting the Government to\n            transform such transitional arrangements into longer-term\n            capacity development and performance. Grant financing was\n            justified by the urgent need to restore a functioning health\n            sector, its strong development impact and as a means to draw\n            greater and broader support for the sector from other\n            development partners. It should be recognized that until\n            economic development takes off, the funding of the health\n            sector will continue to largely depend upon donor funding.\n            The present credit's sustainability cannot be ensured\n            solely by the government until there is substantial\n            macroeconomic development. Aspects of the project requiring\n            continuous funding (civil works/maintenance, training\n            medical personnel, and drug supplies) raise issues of\n            sustainability over the long run, in case of diminishing\n            support from donors. A shortage of health workers is a\n            perennial problem in most African countries, especially in\n            rural areas, and no satisfactory solutions have been found.\n            The exodus of skilled health workers during the civil war\n            exacerbated the problem in Sierra Leone. The country was\n            also not immune from the recruiting practices of developed countries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Health Sector Reconstruction\n            and Development

Appropriate\n            design, sites and operation of sanitary landfills, leachate\n            treatment and control, and water quality testing will reduce\n            the risk of drinking water contamination. High temperature\n            incineration, installation of flue gas cleaning devices, air\n            quality testing, and non-incineration of materials\n            containing chlorine or heavy metals will prevent release of\n            pollutants into the air. Provision and ensuring the routine\n            use of protective clothing, staff training, and teaching\n            first aid will reduce the occurrence of occupational\n            hazards. Limiting access to disposal sites, fencing of\n            disposal sites, separating cells for medical wastes, and\n            sensitizing the public through the media, particularly\n            radio, television, posters, leaflets, newspapers, etc., will\n            minimize disease transmission. Furthermore, all health care\n            facilities will be equipped with appropriate equipment,\n            materials, and facilities for collecting, managing, and\n            transporting medical waste.

The issues addressed mainly focus on the\n            project's impact on the biophysical and socio-cultural\n            environments of the Koinadugu, Kono, Moyomba, and Bombali\n            districts. Possible impacts could include deforestation and\n            land cover changes caused by landfill site development and\n            building rehabilitation and construction, and the resulting\n            loss of biodiversity and soil fertility through erosion; the\n            danger open pits create to lives as causers of injury,\n            receptacles for rubbish, and breeding grounds for\n            mosquitoes; poor disposal of soil and paint materials\n            leading to pollution; dust associated with earth preparation\n            for rehabilitation works affecting air quality; loss of\n            agricultural land and crop production; ineffective waste\n            disposal impairing water quality, causing water\n            contamination, and water-borne diseases. However, this\n            report concludes that overall there are no significant\n            environmental issues to be addressed apart from those\n            referenced in the medical waste management plan under the\n            HIV/AIDS Response Project (SHARP). The comprehensive waste\n            management plan contains the following anticipated negative\n            environmental impacts and their mitigations. Appropriate\n            design, sites and operation of sanitary landfills, leachate\n            treatment and control, and water quality testing will reduce\n            the risk of drinking water contamination. High temperature\n            incineration, installation of flue gas cleaning devices, air\n            quality testing, and non-incineration of materials\n            containing chlorine or heavy metals will prevent release of\n            pollutants into the air. Provision and ensuring the routine\n            use of protective clothing, staff training, and teaching\n            first aid will reduce the occurrence of occupational\n            hazards. Limiting access to disposal sites, fencing of\n            disposal sites, separating cells for medical wastes, and\n            sensitizing the public through the media, particularly\n            radio, television, posters, leaflets, newspapers, etc., will\n            minimize disease transmission. Furthermore, all health care\n            facilities will be equipped with appropriate equipment,\n            materials, and facilities for collecting, managing, and\n            transporting medical waste. Incinerators will be built and\n            adapted for use in health facilities. Infectious hospital\n            waste will be disposed of in sanitary landfills with set precautions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sierra Leone - Health
