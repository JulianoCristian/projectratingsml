Some lessons learned included: the alignment\n            of the program with the Government strategy has a lot to do\n            with its ownership. Withholding support at a time of\n            political tension would have been the easy way out. The\n            PFRL1 was well supported with policy actions, all prior\n            actions that were consistent with international good\n            practices of public policy, which were technically and\n            politically difficult reforms. While questions remain about\n            the sustainability of the outcomes of these policies,\n            continuity in Bank engagement will be nonetheless a key in\n            sustaining them. In hindsight, it will have been useful to\n            include outcomes indicators that will allow for a more\n            objective assessment of performance in the short term.\n            Specifically, it will have been useful to have allowed for\n            the possibility of assessing progress in a short span to\n            properly supervise the project and evaluate its impact.\n            Those indicators could have also been usefully linked to\n            more quantitative benchmarks, with appropriate baselines and\n            more clearly specified timeline for

and restructuring process; (ii) enhance the legal\n            framework for bank resolution; and (iii) strengthen the\n            deposit insurance payout functions. Ukraine is a lower\n            middle income country.

Ukraine is an open economy and strongly\n            supports closer integration with the European Union, and a\n            new association agreement is under negotiation to be signed\n            in the near future, including a deep and comprehensive Free\n            Trade Agreement (FTA), which will anchor important\n            institutional and structural reforms.
