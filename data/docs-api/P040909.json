Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are considered highly satisfactory.\n            Lessons for future adjustment programs involving difficult\n            and politically sensitive reforms include: At the project\n            design stage, the focus should be on conditionality and not\n            on specific restructuring activities. Intensive discussions\n            on conditionality help surface the areas of disagreement or\n            resistance to change, and define the political space within\n            which the reform operation will take place. The reform\n            program must keep the long-term vision in mind but take a\n            series of practical, achievable steps. Reform must be built\n            on broad, multi-agency support, not narrow sectoral backing.\n            The successes to date have depended on political support\n            from the highest levels of the Argentine Government,\n            including the president, a broad coalition of ministries,\n            and a substantial number of the social health insurance\n            funds and heath care provider associations. Crucial\n            institutional development must be assisted through long-term\n            technical assistance lending. Clear analytical work helped\n            establish clear and achievable goals. Technical clarity and\n            transparency was crucial in establishing a climate of trust.\n            Equally critical was the intense supervision capacity that\n            allowed the Bank to keep abreast of difficult political\n            situations and to adapt design accordingly. Finally,\n            introducing competition and tight regulation accelerated progress."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Health Insurance Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Health Insurance\n            Reform Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/07/728469/argentina-health-insurance-reform-project","projn":"AR-H.

The loans will provide major\n            support for the first phase of the health insurance reform\n            by: 1) introducing competition into the market for health\n            insurance, while avoiding risk selection; 2) reallocating\n            resources in the Fondo Solidario de Redistribucion\n            (Redistribution Fund) (FSR) to Obras Sociales (Social Health\n            Insurance Funds) strictly on the basis of income and health\n            risk of their insured households; 3) developing an effective\n            regulatory framework and institutions for health insurance,\n            which promote competition, ensure greater transparency and\n            accountability and help to protect consumers' rights;\n            and 4) extending to the Obras Sociales and Instituto\n            Nacional de Servicios Sociales para Jubilados y Pensionados\n            (National Social Services Institute for Retirees and\n            Pensioners) (INSSJP) financial and technical assistance to\n            enable them to raise their internal efficiency, improve\n            their balance sheets, and comply with new standards and\n            regulations.
