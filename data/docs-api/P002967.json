Accordingly, it will assist the Government to\n            achieve a number of key objectives.

Second,\n            the credit will support actions aimed at completing the\n            divestiture of the Custodian Board properties. Third, it\n            will assist the Government to step up domestic revenue\n            generation which is still only around 8 percent of GDP.\n            Fourth, the credit will help to deepen the Government's\n            efforts aimed at prioritizing both recurrent expenditure and\n            development expenditure.
