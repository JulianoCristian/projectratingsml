Some lessons learned included:\n            1) to obtain job-relevant skills from school enrollment\n            students must first and foremost acquire pertinent and\n            suitably organized knowledge. If secondary education does\n            not impart the necessary knowledge, the labor market may be\n            unable to use the graduates when demand arises; 2) in\n            low-income countries where substantial numbers of students\n            fail to acquire basic skills, application of the available\n            curricula and textbooks may be more important than\n            development of new curricula. New curricula may be in\n            principle desirable, but they should be realistically\n            implement able in low-income classrooms; 3) subsidizing\n            private secondary education may help increase access in\n            countries where secondary education is constrained. Where\n            student demand is high, increasing the availability of\n            private schools may enable the government to concentrate\n            public resources on lower income and underserved groups; and\n            4) textbooks or systematically reproduced materials are a\n            prerequisite for knowledge management at all levels of\n            education. Their availability should be a policy priority.\n            Without textbooks and training of teachers in their use\n            (particularly where teachers themselves have studied without\n            them), knowledge becomes constricted, and systemic\n            efficiency is low. The cost and availability of Francophone\n            textbooks has been a long-standing problem, for which clear\n            solutions have not emerged."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso -
