system\n            that will preserve the productivity of the land; training\n            Somalis and helping to build institutions capable of\n            carrying on the agricultural development so initiated. The\n            project will form the first phase of a long term development\n            and will include funds to prepare a follow up phase.\n            Benefits of the first phase will allow the average family in\n            the Bay Region to meet basic food requirements and increase\n            marketable surpluses. Local communities will be stabilized.\n            In addition, the road component will benefit regions to the\n            North and West of the project area. Major risks are that\n            project implementation could be delayed. Extension and\n            research activities could take longer than expected to focus\n            on key issues. Farmer and local community receptivity could\n            be lower than expected and the Government might not provide\n            the strong support required at the end of the six-year\n            investment period to continue the long-term development\n            efforts in the Region."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Somalia - Bay Region Agricultural\n            Development
