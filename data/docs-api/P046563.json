Nevertheless, some lessons\n            of experience address the following. Some technical lessons\n            suggest the use of thick geo membrane under conventional\n            lining materials to ensure seepage control, while the use of\n            evapo-transpiration (ET) management and remote sensing is\n            effective in assessing, and managing water resources. In\n            addition, the community-driven Land and Water Management\n            Plan (LWMP) process provides an excellent framework to\n            address, in both structural and non-structural terms, the\n            complex water supply, drainage, salinity, high groundwater,\n            agricultural and cropping systems, land management and\n            environmental issues facing typical irrigation systems world\n            wide. Lessons regarding the institutional reform indicate\n            that any process will only be delivered with strong\n            political support, and the right enabling policy and legal\n            framework. The change process to bring about inclusive river\n            basin based integrated water resources management (IWRM)\n            must include both integrated \"bottom-up\" and\n            \"top-down\" measures. Other lessons reinforce the\n            importance of developing mechanisms to define the rights to\n            water for an appropriate natural resources and environmental\n            management, compliant to the river basin management\n            arrangements, achieved through a consultative and inclusive\n            stakeholder representation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Second Tarim Basin Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Second Tarim Basin Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6141827/china-second-tarim-basin-project","projn":"CN-Tarim Basin II Project -- P046563","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050802093842"},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Sub-national government administration,Irrigation and drainage","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development, agricultural\n            production, agricultural water, agricultural water use,\n            allocation of water, aquifers, availability of water, Basin\n            Management, canals, capacity building, catchment area,\n            Competitive Bidding, conjunctive use, construction,\n            consumptive use, crop production, crop rotation, crop\n            yields, cropping systems, Cubic meter, cubic meters,\n            decision making, diversion, drought, economic impact,\n            employment, environmental degradation, environmental flows,\n            environmental monitoring, Environmental policies,\n            Environmental Protection, Exchange Rate, farmers, farming,\n            financial viability, fish, flood control, food production,\n            groundwater, households, income, industrial use, Integrated\n            Pest Management, International Waters, Irrigation District,\n            irrigation management, irrigation systems, irrigation water,\n            labor inputs, Land Reclamation, levee, levees, livestock\n            production, LOAN/CREDIT, market prices, monitoring\n            equipment, Natural Resources, oases, oil, on-farm water\n            management, organic matter,  performance indicators,\n            pesticides, pH, poverty line, Present Value, productivity,\n            programs, Project Management, pumping, pumping station,\n            quality standards, quantity of water, quotas, regional\n            development, Regional government, regional water projects,\n            Regional Water Resources, remote sensing, river basin, river\n            basin management, river basins, salinity, secure water\n            supply, seepage, soil fertility, spring, surface water,\n            sustainable development, sustainable water, transparency,\n            transpiration, use of water, water allocations, water\n            availability, water charges, water conservation, water\n            control structures, water distribution, water extraction,\n            water fees, water inflows, water law, water logging, Water\n            Management, Water Policy, water projects, water quality,\n            Water resource, Water resource management, Water Resources,\n            Water Resources Management, water rights, water savings,\n            water storage, Water Supply, Water Supply System, water\n            table, water tariff, water tariffs, water usage, Water User,\n            Water User Association, water users, wells"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF025564-PHRD-IRRIGATED AGRIC.\n            INTENSIFICATION PROJ.

Some of the negative\n            impacts of the project are: 1) salinization of land within\n            irrigation areas and natural areas of the green corridor\n            (GC); 2) declining groundwater levels throughout the GC, but\n            particularly, the lower (LGC) downstream of Daxihaizi; 3)\n            increasing groundwater salinity in all areas and\n            particularly near irrigation areas; 4) lack of knowledge\n            about groundwater recharge rates, lateral flow rates and\n            discharge rates/areas; 5) there is little information on\n            fish and other aquatic biota; and 6) fisheries based on the\n            three endemic species have collapsed and those species are\n            either extinct or nearly so. Mitigation measures include: 1)\n            groundwater monitoring piezometers should be installed\n            within and adjacent to all irrigation areas. Additional\n            piezometers should be installed at representative locations\n            along surveyed cross-sections across the entire floodplain.\n            There should be at least three cross-sections in each reach,\n            i.e. Qiala to Daxihaizi, Daxihaizi to Yinsu, Yinsu to Alegan\n            and Alegan to Taitema Lake preferably coincident in timing\n            and location to sites where surface water is monitored; 2)\n            water levels should be monitored every 3 months for 2 years\n            to determine seasonal variations, then twice a year after\n            that before and after the summer flood. Water quality\n            samples should be taken on one occasion in the first year\n            and analysed for soil salinity levels (TDS), pH, major ions,\n            alkalinity, mineralization; and 3) fish monitoring is\n            required near each of the major hydrologic monitoring\n            stations along the river so that all parameters can be\n            easily analyzed for establishing habitat condition. The\n            locations should include river, wetland and backwater areas.\n            Sampling effort should be quantified so that catch per unit\n            effort can be defined for each
