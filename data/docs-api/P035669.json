However, sustainability is uncertain, for\n            although the Fonds d'Intervention pour le Developpement\n            (FID), is a strong institution, and, considerable capacity\n            improvements exist among local contractors, and consulting\n            firms, these gains are not likely to be sustainable without\n            continued external funding. Lessons convey that projects\n            designed, and managed outside of Government, can recruit\n            competent staff, and achieve better results, but cannot be\n            completely isolated from political influence. Thus, building\n            partnerships with communities, and local governments would\n            empower beneficiaries, and, minimize government influence,\n            while direct beneficiary involvement in implementation,\n            should also improve the influence of beneficiary\n            communities. The use of consultants in motivating\n            communities on maintenance issues, is not only helpful, but\n            contributes to the essential maintenance commitment,\n            necessary to improve the likelihood of sustainability. The\n            FID was set for a wide representation from a broad spectrum\n            of groups, but the country's vastness, and weak\n            communications, led to indecisiveness, a situation which\n            could have been minimized through a simpler structure to\n            oversee non-governmental organizations, such as the FID,\n            and, creditability should be integrated within existing\n            financial policies, markets, and institutions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Second Social Fund Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Madagascar -
