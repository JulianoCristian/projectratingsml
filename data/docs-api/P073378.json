Some lessons learned included:\n            Guinea offers an example of where program advances in the\n            fight against HIV/AIDS can occur even where political\n            instability and political leadership (both of which are\n            usually assumed to be prerequisites) are not entirely\n            adequate. To a large extent this was due to the\n            project's ability to find champions among those groups\n            who were committed. To a large extent this was due to the\n            project's ability to find champions among those groups\n            who were committed. In Guinea, these groups were found\n            among: (i) the public sector (especially, some of the\n            'second tier' ministries and local authorities at\n            regional and prefectoral levels); (ii) the private sector\n            (particularly the mining sector and several labor unions);\n            and (iii) communities. Eventually, these private sector and\n            community-level initiatives were able to overcome (at least\n            to a certain extent) uneven government commitment and weak\n            capacity. Guinea demonstrates that insufficient attention is\n            paid during project implementation to the risks and risk\n            mitigation measures proposed in theproject appraisal\n            document (PAD). In the case of the Guinea MAP, three of the\n            four output to objective risks were correctly identified\n            (though perhaps incorrectly rated), but the measures proved\n            to be wholly inadequate to alter the situation. While\n            project preparation cannot be expected to pre-identify all\n            of the potential solutions to problems which might arise,\n            supervision missions should be required to link their\n            recommendations at least in part to the risks so as to track\n            the effectiveness of the mitigation measures for future\n            projects. This will seem to be the Bank's counterpoint\n            to 'learning by doing.'"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Multi-Sectoral AIDS Project (MAP)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea -

In accordance with the\n            main goal of MAP2, the overall objective of the project is\n            to limit and reverse the trend of the epidemic by preventing\n            new infections. There are four main components. The first\n            component empowers communities to address HIV/AIDS\n            prevention, care, mitigation, and support. Grant resources\n            will support a broad range of community, civil society, and\n            private sector initiatives. Under the second component, the\n            project supports annual action plans prepared by ministries\n            at the central and regional levels and by other public\n            agencies. It is expected that about half of the funds for\n            this component will go to the Ministry of Health. The third\n            component strengthens the capacity of government agencies,\n            civil society, rural organizations, and the private sector\n            to prepare and implement HIV/AIDS prevention and care\n            projects. It will reinforce the resource management,\n            monitoring and evaluation capacity of the HIV/AIDS\n            committees. The fourth component provides support to\n            facilitate the programming, coordination, and monitoring of\n            project operations, including support to the HIV/AIDS

  socioeconomic impacts at the individual, family, and\n            community levels. The main project objectives will include\n            initiatives by the public, and private sectors to strengthen\n            the institutional framework, and build capacities responsive\n            to the epidemic. However, the presence of biomedical wastes\n            within the framework of the project, poses adverse\n            environmental impacts, due to the potential, inadequate\n            handling of infected materials. This environmental\n            assessment addresses specifically the management of\n            biomedical wastes, and examines the institutional capacity\n            within health institutions and local authorities, to propose\n            a feasible plan of action to reduce HIV/AIDS infection\n            risks. Measures to mitigate biomedical wastes disposal are\n            as follows. Institutional, legal and regulatory frameworks\n            will be strengthened through inter-governmental efforts, and\n            enforced environmentally sound waste management practices\n            will take effect. Health facilities will be provided with\n            sanitary equipment for the collection, and removal of\n            biomedical wastes, as well as trained personnel in\n            precautionary practices for handling infected, or\n            non-sterilized medical wastes. Incinerators will be\n            installed for hospital uses. Additionally, training and\n            specific programs will be conducted for health providers,\n            doctors, and municipal and sanitation personnel on the\n            related risks between AIDS and biomedical waste disposal.\n            Public awareness, and dissemination information on the\n            direct, and indirect risks of inappropriate wastes handling\n            will be organized through media channels, to sensitize\n            communities. Infrastructure related works should consider\n            adequate treatment of effluent discharges (at the municipal\n            level), including systematic incineration plans, and\n            compacted waste disposal."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Project VIH/SIDA : gestion des\n            dechets biomedicaux"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guin\u00e9e \u2013 Projet VIH/SIDA :\n            gestion des d\u00e9chets biom\u00e9dicaux"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/05/2025256/guinea-project-vihsida-gestion-des-dechets-biomedicaux","projn":"GN-Multi-Sectoral Aids Project (Map) -- P073378","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Guinea","authors":{"authr":"Doucoure, Djibril"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02101004010665"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Other social services,Health,Secondary education,General information and communications sector","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Biomedical materials; Environmental\n            assessment; Waste management; Acquired Immune Deficiency\n            Syndrome; HIV viruses; Institutional framework; Capacity\n            building; Public-private partnerships; Medical wastes;\n            Hospital equipment; Sanitation equipment; Waste disposal;\n            Environmental regulations; Health care facilities; Training\n            assistance; Incinerators; Medical practice; Water treatment;\n            Effluent charges; Public awareness; Municipal infrastructure"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 2 (AFTH2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF039393-GUINEA - PREPARATION OF\n            HIV-AIDS GLOBAL MITIGATION SUPPORT,TF026713-PHRD-GUINEA: HIV/AIDS GLOBAL\n            MITIGATION SUPPORT PROJECT (AIDS-GMSP)","repnb":"E629"},"facets":{}}}
