Before war erupted in Bosnia and Herzegovina in\n            1992, the country\u2019s economy was based on heavy and military\n            industry, and dominated by several large state-owned\n            conglomerates. A major part of this economy was destroyed\n            during the conflict. As a result, the country was left\n            without the most basic infrastructure and services, and\n            suffered from significant unemployment. People had a hard\n            time launching new businesses since the commercial banking\n            sector was embryonic.

Lessons cited from this project\n            included: 1. Transition to sustainability of the\n            micro-credit sector takes time, and must be a part of the\n            initial project design. 2. Targeted technical assistance is\n            of great importance; micro-credit organizations learned how\n            to assess their needs for technical services and how to work\n            with consultants. 3. There is no conflict between the\n            financial and social goals of this type of operations;\n            Experience from this project suggests that achieving\n            simultaneously these two objectives is not only possible,\n            but also leads to synergies. 4. Focused objectives are\n            essential: Focusing the operation on developing a very\n            specific type of micro-credit services (micro-credits for\n            income generating activities), and on targeting specific\n            types of clients (low-income entrepreneurs) was important.\n            5. Performance based financing. Loan financing under the\n            project was performance based in the sense that micro-credit\n            organizations were obliged to maintain certain performance\n            standards to remain eligible to retain existing and be\n            eligible for future financing. This has proven to be a\n            strong incentive for micro-credit organizations to perform well."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia-Herzegovina - Second Local\n            Initiatives (Microfinance) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia-Herzegovina - Second Local\n            Initiatives (Microfinance) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/12/6537788/bosnia-herzegovina-second-local-initiatives-microfinance-project","projn":"BA-Local Initiatives (Microfinance) 2\n            Project -- P066169","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Microfinance,Rural Finance,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20060117113856"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Micro- and SME finance,Law and justice","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Actual cost, agriculture, audits, banking\n            law, banking legislation, banking sector, business\n            development, business environment, Capacity Building,\n            capital base, capitalization, Central Bank, Central Bank of\n            Bosnia and Herzegovina, collateral, commercial banks,\n            commercial debt, Comparative analysis, competitors,\n            consolidation, decision making, Development Strategy,\n            Employment, enterprise development, enterprise support,\n            entrepreneurship, equity financing, equity investments,\n            expansion, external audits, financial intermediaries,\n            financial management, financial markets, financial\n            performance, financial sector, financial services,\n            inflation, Institutional Development, interest income,\n            interest rate, job creation, labor markets, laws, legal\n            framework, lenders, leverage, liquidity, loan financing,\n            MFI, Micro Credit, micro enterprises, microcredit,\n            microcredits, microenterpreneurs, microenterprise,\n            microenterprises, MICROFINANCE, microfinance industry,\n            Microfinance Institution, microfinance institutions,\n            microfinance sector, microlending, migration, ministries of\n            finance, operating efficiency, outreach, overhead costs,\n            Partnership arrangements, performance standards, portfolio,\n            productivity, Project financing, prudential requirements,\n            regulatory framework, Regulatory Reform, return on assets,\n            savings, small enterprises, SME, SME finance,\n            Sustainability, sustainable financial services, technical\n            assistance, transparency, working capital"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Unit (ECSHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF026111-PHRD-LOCAL INITIATIVES II PROJECT","repnb":"34234"},"23922215":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2005/07/23922215/small-loans-boost-incomes","available_in":"English","virt_coll":"Results Profile","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2005/07/23922215/small-loans-boost-incomes","new_url":"2005/07/23922215/small-loans-boost-incomes","disclosure_date":"2015-01-29T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2015-01-29T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2015-01-29T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/01/29/000470435_20150129135040/Rendered/INDEX/9241902005Jul10s0PUBLIC0Box0385367B.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/01/29/000470435_20150129135040/Rendered/PDF/9241902005Jul10s0PUBLIC0Box0385367B.pdf","credit_no":"3533","datestored":"2015-01-29T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2005-07-11T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Small loans boost incomes"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"After the war ended in Bosnia and\n            Herzegovina in 1995, unemployment reached 70 to 80 percent,\n            and the population grappled with both post-war\n            reconstruction and the emerging market economy.
