Building\n            capacity in implementing agencies whether at Federal or\n            local level is crucial to sustainability. Bottom Up\n            approaches to institutionalizing change do work - a limited\n            amount of funding can facilitate significant change but\n            should be supported also by policy dialogue. Flexibility in\n            adapting project activities when necessary is vital when\n            working in a rapidly changing environment. Not all\n            activities will be sustainable - transitioning to a free\n            market often means that change becomes more, not less rapid.\n            When project activities are decentralized to regional levels\n            of government or to institutions, they become more difficult\n            to monitor, and more susceptible to swings in local\n            priorities and funding. A success of the project was to\n            demonstrate that lending directly to institutions is a\n            viable way to encourage change. Designing projects for large\n            countries, where the Bank financing can only provide\n            catalytic impetus is a significant challenge and the\n            mechanisms piloted by this program should be utilized elsewhere."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation -
