The primary objectives\n            were achieved, the project made a major impact on civil\n            works and institutional development, sustainability is\n            likely under certain conditions, and both the Borrower and\n            the Bank acted satisfactorily. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, the National Agricultural\n            Research Plan should be kept under continuous review to keep\n            it aligned with the national agricultural development\n            objectives. Second, training should be focused on deficient\n            areas identified as a result of the needs survey. Third,\n            contract research sub-projects should be properly worked out\n            to accommodate the priority needs of the country. Fourth,\n            there is a need for greater recognition of the linkage\n            between training, technical assistance, and contract\n            research. Fifth, contract research funds should not be\n            utilized for infrastructure development. Sixth, a steering\n            committee should be organized to regularly review\n            implementation of research projects and take timely\n            appropriate measures to remove bottlenecks. Seventh,\n            collaborative research needs to be emphasized in future\n            research projects. Eighth, Agricultural Economics Research\n            should continue to be encouraged and even expanded. Ninth,\n            priority setting mechanisms need to be strengthened and\n            supported. Lastly, reports submitted by the expatriate\n            experts should be widely circulated and made available to\n            the possible beneficiaries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Agricultural
