Some lessons learned included: the project\u2019s\n            original design included a number of activities that\n            contributed very little to achieving the project development\n            objective (PDO). The restructuring paper recognized the\n            disconnection between one of the original PDO indicators\n            (non-performing loans) and the proposed set of activities.\n            Due to this disconnect, despite some important achievements,\n            the project had not made much progress when measured against\n            the selected indicators. The PDO indicator on non-performing\n            loans was dropped during the restructuring. Beyond the\n            management of expectation, it was important to have experts\n            with the right skills involved in designing the reform\n            program to achieve the objectives set out by the government.\n            Experts from different Global Practices (GPs) were\n            identified to help the project, including a credit bureau\n            expert from Financial Market GP and a business registration\n            expert from Trade and Competitiveness GP. Four experts,\n            covering different subject areas, reviewed the government\u2019s\n            draft Commercial Code. Equipped with the right expertise and\n            knowledge, the task team was able to help the government\n            achieve several reforms. The project was eventually\n            streamlined, but reaching agreement to restructure the\n            project took a long time. Given the generally strong\n            resistance from stakeholders to eliminate activities once\n            the project is approved, it is important that activities are\n            selectively chosen at the beginning of the process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania - Business Environment\n            Enhancement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mauritania - Business Environment\n

objective of the\n            Business Environment Enhancement Project for Mauritania is\n            to enhance the business climate through improvements in the\n            financial, legal and judiciary sectors, and regulatory\n            environment for business, and the support of measures to\n            restructure selected public enterprises (PEs). The project\n            needs restructuring for two main reasons: to improve the\n            very slow progress in implementation and disbursement; and\n            to align project objectives with new Government priorities\n            in investment climate reforms for private and financial\n            sector growth and development. The restructuring will amend\n            the project\u0092s legal documents by: 1) revising the Project\n            Development Objective (PDO); 2) modifying, eliminating\n            originally planned project activities and adding others that\n            are more consistent with the PDO; 3) reallocating funds\n            accordingly across old and new disbursement categories; 4)\n            revising the results framework to be coherent with the\n            restructured components and activities; and 5) extending the\n            closing date by a year from November 30, 2013 to November\n            30, 2014. This first extension of the closing date is\n            necessary to make the revised PDO, which maintains the core\n            focus of the project, achievable. Without an extension,\n            on-going activities will be negatively affected."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania - Business Environment\n            Enhancement Project :
