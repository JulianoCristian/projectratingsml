Marbek Resource Consultants conducted the study\n            in association with Global Change strategies International.\n            The field mission to Bangkok took place January 17-28, 2005.\n            The TPEEE Project was approved in 1993 and took place from\n            1993 to 2000. The project, national in scope, consisted of a\n            five-year demand-side management (DSM) plan. It was\n            implemented by the Demand-Side Management Office (DSMO) of\n            EGAT. Lessons learned : Consumer awareness, consumer and\n            investor knowledge and confidence in energy efficiency\n            products is a key objective for an effective DSM program.\n            Capacity building, in order to build capacity, it may be\n            helpful to begin with programs that do not require extensive\n            cooperation with other agencies to be successful. DSMO\n            programs proved to be less effective when they depended on\n            the cooperation of other agencies. Program design, a program\n            should be designed in a way that allows \"early\n            wins\" that then lead to expanded programs. Commercial\n            markets, ESCO (Energy Services Company) models must be\n            developed to suit the local or national business culture. It\n            helps to experiment with different ESCO models (financial,\n            technical) and then to build on lessons learned in the\n            particular jurisdiction and economic environment.\n            Sustainability, voluntary programs are useful as a necessary\n            step toward the development of minimum standards. This is\n            relevant to both low and high incremental cost products. To\n            sustain energy efficiency achievements, however, mandatory\n            standards may be required. Finally, along with internal\n            planning, it is important to have an external, third-party\n            monitor and an evaluation process/ agency involved on a\n            regular basis. This leads to credible data and confidence in\n            the reported results of the programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand : promotion of electrical energy\n            efficiency project (TPEEE), post-implementation impact assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand : promotion of\n            electrical energy efficiency project (TPEEE),\n            post-implementation impact assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/01/7090372/thailand-promotion-electrical-energy-efficiency-project-tpeee-post-implementation-impact-assessment","count":"Thailand,World","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Energy and mining,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"acidification, air conditioners, air\n            pollutants, air pollution, Alternative Energy, Alternative\n            Energy Development, appliances, Approach, audits,\n            Availability, carbon, carbon dioxide, CFLs, Clean\n            Development Mechanism, climate change, coal, Commercial\n            Buildings, commercial energy, commercial energy efficiency,\n            compact fluorescent lamps, consumer demand, Consumer\n            Protection, cost savings, demand for energy, deregulation,\n            diesel, DSM, economic development, efficiency improvements,\n            efficiency standards, efficient equipment, Efficient\n            Lighting, electric power, electric power sector,\n            Electricity, electricity demand, electricity savings,\n            Electricity Sector, electricity supply, electricity utility,\n            Emission, Emission Reductions, emissions, energy audits,\n            Energy Conservation, Energy Conservation Promotion, energy\n            demand, Energy Efficiency, energy efficiency labeling,\n            Energy Policy, Energy Savings, Energy Service, Energy\n            Service Companies, Energy Strategy, energy supply, energy\n            use, environmental, environmental benefits, ESCO, Fans,\n            fluorescent lamp, fossil, fossil fuel, Free energy, fuel,\n            GEF, generation capacity, GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT, GLOBAL\n            ENVIRONMENT FACILITY, greenhouse, greenhouse gas, greenhouse\n            gases, High efficiency motors, HPS, hydroelectric power,\n            industrial energy efficiency, investment opportunities,\n            kilowatt-hour, kilowatt-hours, minimum efficiency standards,\n            minimum energy performance standards, nitrogen, nitrogen\n            oxide, peak demand, peak load, peak power, policy\n            instruments, pollutant emissions, power, power capacity,\n            power demand, power generation, power producers, power\n            sector, public good, refrigerators, sulfur, tariff\n            structure, Tax incentives, utilities, utility load"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Environment and natural resource management","projn":"1W-Gef Corporate Km Studies -- P110303,TH-Gef-Electricity Egy -- P004647","docty":"Working Paper","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Environment and Energy Efficiency,Energy Conservation & Efficiency,Energy Production and Transportation,Energy and Environment","teratopic":"Energy,Environment","authors":{"authr":"Phumaraphand, Khun Napaporn"},"entityids":{"entityid":"000011823_20060928115916"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific,The World Region,The World Region","subsc":"Central government administration,Power,General industry and trade sector","theme":"Climate change,Pollution management and environmental health,Environmental policies and institutions","historic_topic":"Energy,Environment","prdln":"Global Environment Project,Knowledge Management Product","owner":"GEF Front Office (GEFVP),Energy & Mining Sector Unit (EASEG),Southeast Asia Sustainable Dev (EASTS),Climate Change-GEF - Coord.

Lessons learned include\n            the following: DSM programs should be designed with the\n            consideration of local cultural realities to ensure high\n            consumer acceptance and participation and to achieve\n            meaningful impacts. Mechanisms for transferring competency\n            and skills should be carefully assessed to determine\n            appropriate use of consultants, and consider short as well\n            as longer term assignments to maximize effectiveness.\n            Project designs should carefully consider the need for\n            independent evaluation, and if needed, develop suitable\n            contractual and reporting arrangements from the start. DSM\n            facilities should be linked with financing facilities to\n            ensure that utility efforts, largely in the industrial and\n            commercial sectors, can be followed up with meaningful\n            investments. Where multiple government energy efficiency\n            programs including DSM exist, linkages should be developed\n            to improve coordination and minimize potential overlaps. DSM\n            reform programs should ensure sustainability, taking into\n            account proposed institutional structures, pricing reforms,\n            regulation and oversight, incentive and funding schemes, and\n            established customer relationships. Well-designed, extensive\n            DSM marketing can help programs achieve significant savings\n            impacts at relatively low cost."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Promotion of Electricity Energy\n            Efficiency Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand - Promotion of\n            Electricity Energy Efficiency Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/12/1000485/thailand-promotion-electricity-energy-efficiency-project","projn":"TH-Gef-Electricity Egy -- P004647","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Energy and Environment,Climate Change and Environment,Energy Conservation & Efficiency,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Thailand","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_0102240538173"},"subsc":"Power,Central government administration,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adverse impact,Alternative Energy,annual\n            energy savings,appliances,building codes,Carbon,Carbon\n            dioxide,CFL,CFLs,climate,CO2,commercial buildings,compact\n            fluorescent lamps,cost effectiveness,demand for\n            energy,DSM,efficiency standards,electric power,electric\n            power sector,Electricity,emission,emission\n            reductions,emissions,end-use,end-users,end-uses,energy\n            audits,Energy Conservation,Energy Conservation\n            Promotion,energy consumption,Energy Conversion,Energy\n            Efficiency,energy efficiency investments,energy efficient\n            equipment,energy management,energy performance,Energy\n            Policy,energy savings,energy sector,Energy service,Energy\n            service company,energy services,energy\n            use,ESCO,expenditures,fossil fuel,fossil fuel\n            power,GEF,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT\n            FACILITY,growth in demand,HPS,IIEC,inflation,International\n            Institute for Energy Conservation,lighting,load\n            management,minimum efficiency standards,negotiations,peak\n            demand,power capacity,power generation,present\n            value,programs,sustainable energy,tons of carbon,utilities"},"1":{"cdata!":"adverse impact,Alternative Energy,annual\n            energy savings,appliances,building codes,Carbon,Carbon\n            dioxide,CFL,CFLs,climate,CO2,commercial buildings,compact\n            fluorescent lamps,cost effectiveness,demand for\n            energy,DSM,efficiency standards,electric power,electric\n            power sector,Electricity,emission,emission\n            reductions,emissions,end-use,end-users,end-uses,energy\n            audits,Energy Conservation,Energy Conservation\n            Promotion,energy consumption,Energy Conversion,Energy\n            Efficiency,energy efficiency investments,energy efficient\n            equipment,energy management,energy performance,Energy\n            Policy,energy savings,energy sector,Energy service,Energy\n            service company,energy services,energy\n            use,ESCO,expenditures,fossil fuel,fossil fuel\n            power,GEF,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT\n            FACILITY,growth in demand,HPS,IIEC,inflation,International\n            Institute for Energy Conservation,lighting,load\n            management,minimum efficiency standards,negotiations,peak\n            demand,power capacity,power generation,present\n            value,programs,sustainable energy,tons of carbon,utilities"}},"owner":"Energy & Mining Sector Unit (EASEG)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF028637-GET-THAILAND PROM.
