The project will\n            comprise about 60 percent of the total planned investment\n            over the three year period, and will include: 92 new and 32\n            modernized dairy farms, 17 new specialized breeding heifer\n            production farms, 19 new beef fattening units, 109 improved\n            pasture units, milk and beef processing and storage\n            facilities, on-farm production of milk, meat and breeding\n            animals by individual producers, and technical services and\n            research. The project will address the unsatisfied domestic\n            demand for milk and beef products and generate additional\n            foreign exchange earnings. Substantial production efficiency\n            improvement is expected through technical innovations and\n            institutional improvements under the project. At full\n            development, incremental project production will reach about\n            3.8 million hectolitre (hl) of milk, 40 thousand tons of\n            carcass beef and 33 thousand breeding heifers. Additionally,\n            a substantial amount of fertilizer will be produced from the\n            incremental farmyard manure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Fourth Livestock

Romanian Five Year Plan for\n            1981-1985 for milk and beef production. The project will\n            comprise about 60 percent of the total planned investment\n            over the three year period, and will include: 92 new and 32\n            modernized dairy farms, 17 new specialized breeding heifer\n            production farms, 19 new beef fattening units, 109 improved\n            pasture units, milk and beef processing and storage\n            facilities, on-farm production of milk, meat and breeding\n            animals by individual producers, and technical services and\n            research. The project will address the unsatisfied domestic\n            demand for milk and beef products and generate additional\n            foreign exchange earnings. Substantial production efficiency\n            improvement is expected through technical innovations and\n            institutional improvements under the project. At full\n            development, incremental project production will reach about\n            3.8 million hectolitre (hl) of milk, 40 thousand tons of\n            carcass beef and 33 thousand breeding heifers. Additionally,\n            a substantial amount of fertilizer will be produced from the\n            incremental farmyard manure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Fourth Livestock
