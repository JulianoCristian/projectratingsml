While the ERC aimed\n            essentially at reducing the size of the public sector,\n            strengthening its efficiency and production capacity, as\n            well as the development of operations to support\n            devaluation, the program had been designed in a context\n            where devaluation was not planned. (ii) There were no strict\n            guidelines or indications for use of the ERC, which gave it\n            a certain amount of flexibility. It is therefore easy to\n            understand why the ERC was used to pay external debt\n            arrears. However, importantly, the Government continued to\n            implement the measures of the International Monetary Fund\n            (IMF) program. (iii) The ERC was thus perceived more as a\n            form of budget support, a breath of oxygen that was to\n            motivate the Government in its economic recovery efforts.\n            Circumstances were such that the structural reforms were\n            introduced slowly; this can be interpreted as a lack of\n            enthusiasm on the part of the public, non-support for the\n            proposed measures (given the fact of multipartyism) and much\n            less as an insufficient commitment on the part of the\n            Government to implement the reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Economic Recovery Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon - Economic Recovery\n            Credit
