Some lessons learned included:\n            consistent Government support is key for successful project\n            implementation. Appropriate government policies have to be\n            in place for an enabling environment to allow project\n            interventions to work successfully. Without a suitable\n            institutional framework to manage, operate and maintain\n            irrigation and drainage infrastructure, investments in\n            rehabilitation are important, but nevertheless of short-term\n            impact. The project has disbursed well over US$40 million on\n            rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure over the\n            past seven years, over 90 percent on higher-order works.\n            Without these investments, systems would have likely gone\n            out of operation. In a measure to assist smallholder farmers\n            the government rescinded the land tax for landholdings under\n            5 ha. An alternative to abandoning this tax in irrigation\n            and drainage schemes would have been to retain it and use\n            the money for maintenance of the physical infrastructure.\n            This would then have provided regular maintenance funds and\n            benefitted all farmers in the irrigation and drainage\n            schemes. Having a land tax would also encourage landholders\n            who are not using the land to sell it. Charging service fees\n            in drainage schemes is difficult, as the benefits of\n            drainage extend beyond plot holders. A fixed property charge\n            to all property owners in a drainage scheme would be more equitable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Irrigation and Drainage Community\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Georgia - Irrigation and Drainage\n            Community Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/01/12022033/georgia-irrigation-drainage-community-development-project","projn":"GE-Irrigation & Drainage Community\n            Development Project -- P055068","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Water Resources Law,Irrigation and Drainage,Engineering,Water Law,Water Supply and Systems","teratopic":"Water Resources,Science and Technology Development,Law and Development,Water Supply and Sanitation","count":"Georgia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20100330230738"},"theme":"Law reform,Water resource management,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement","subsc":"Central government administration,Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Science and Technology Development,Law and Development,Water Supply and Sanitation","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural inputs, agricultural land,\n            agricultural policy, agricultural produce, agricultural\n            production, agricultural productivity, Agricultural\n            Research, aqueducts, canal systems, canals, Collector\n            drains, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, Construction, covering, crop\n            rotation, cropping patterns, Culverts, dam safety, Dams,\n            diversion structures, DRAINAGE, drainage canals, drainage\n            discharge, drainage facilities, drainage infrastructure,\n            drainage management, drainage scheme, drainage schemes,\n            drainage systems, drainage works, embankments, Engineering,\n            engineering design, Engineering Management, engineers,\n            environmental issues, Environmental Management, excavation,\n            falling, Farmer Contributions, Farmer Organizations, fire,\n            flexibility, flood control, flood damage, flood protection,\n            flood protection works, flooding, floods, freezing, gravity,\n            groundwater, Hydrants, hydraulic structures, international\n            waters, irrigated agriculture, IRRIGATION, Irrigation\n            &amp; Drainage, irrigation area, irrigation canals,\n            irrigation infrastructure, irrigation rehabilitation,\n            irrigation scheme, irrigation schemes, Irrigation Service,\n            irrigation supply, irrigation system, Irrigation Systems,\n            irrigation water, irrigation water delivery, jurisdiction,\n            land use, legal framework, machinery, metals, orchards,\n            participatory irrigation, pipe, pipes, pollution, Programs,\n            Pump stations, pumps, rain, rainfall, river systems, rivers,\n            secondary canals, sediments, signs, siphons, Spillways,\n            water abstraction, water conveyance, water diversion, water\n            fees, water flow, water pipelines, water shortages, water\n            supply, water treatment, waters, Weirs"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF025586-PHRD-AGRICULTURE DEV.
