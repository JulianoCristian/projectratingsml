The main lessons from the Second Power project\n            concern the importance, prior to Board approval, of\n            addressing procurement policies, and procedures that could\n            create problems, and delays later; the need for a truly\n            independent regulatory regime to govern tariff\n            determination, in order to help safeguard the sector's\n            financial viability; and, the importance of rigorously\n            assessing risk, and identifying exit mechanisms for project\n            components, in areas of civil unrest. Conversely, the ESDP\n            yielded the following lessons of broad applicability, as the\n            Bank expands its assistance for renewable energy, as part of\n            its 2001 Energy Business Renewable Strategy, and 2003\n            Infrastructure Plan. These lessons can be clustered around\n            three important areas: a) building-up the business and\n            policy environment, addressing in particular the key barrier\n            of access to capital; b) scaling-up the market, including a\n            reliable after-sales service system, and end-user training;\n            and, c) establishing strong project, and financial\n            management systems, including monitoring and evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -

Lessons learned are identified as\n            the following: Advance procurement--that, hiring\n            consultants, appointment of contractors, etc.) should be\n            part of various stages of project preparation and\n            processing. The Ceylon Electricity Board's (CEB)\n            authority to handle procurement independently of the\n            government should be enhanced. Give CEB autonomy so that it\n            facilitates effective project implementation--this may\n            require incorporating CEB under the Companies Act. Entrust\n            project implementation to those dedicated to that task.\n            Evaluate the security situation properly, and exclude works\n            in areas prone to civil unrest.

cost.  The project will also\n            assist in the preparation of selected hydropower projects\n            and Ceylon Electricity Board's further institutional\n            development.  The project will finance: (a) rehabilitation\n            and expansion of distribution systems to be taken over by\n            CEB during 1992-95; (b) a slice of CEB's least-cost\n            transmission investments comprising the construction of\n            about 152 km of 220-kV line, about 45 km of 132-kV line and\n            related substations; and (c) technical assistance to CEB."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -
