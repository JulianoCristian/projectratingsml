The project underwent\n            restructuring three times relating to extension of closing\n            date and revision of components and sub-components. Merit\n            Based Pay Initiative (MBPI) was formally revised to the\n            Priority Operating Costs (POC). According to the\n            Restructuring Paper dated June 6, 2011, it was the Royal\n            Government of Cambodia (RGC)\u0092s decision to cancel the MBPI\n            and Priority Mission Group (PMG), and all other salary\n            supplement and incentive schemes with effect from January 1,\n            2010 regardless of the sources of financing. It was replaced\n            with the establishment of the Priority Operating Costs\n            (POC), which was also terminated in 2012. Reallocation of\n            IDA grant was made and hence there were changes to the\n            results monitoring.

The closing date for the project will be extended\n            from January 15, 2012 until January 15, 2013. The closing\n            date for the project will be extended from January 15, 2013\n            until November 15, 2013 with a 4-month disbursement grace\n            period. This extension is necessary to allow the Project to\n            complete key activities being performed by three working\n            groups established to support the preparation and\n            implementation of the Financial Management Information\n            System (FMIS) that focus on line accountability, accounting\n            standards, and budget execution. Other activities include\n            the finalization of the uniform account code structure\n            (posting rules); IPSAS cash basis implementation; and budget\n            entity implementation for the 2013 budget. While the\n            extension period will not be long enough to finance the FMIS\n            contract (which will be financed under a new trust fund,\n            Public Financial Management Trust Fund), it will support all\n            activities related to the system procurement. In addition,\n            the requested extension will provide essential resources to\n            undertake (i) on-the-job training and capacity development,\n            and (ii) change management and communications related\n            activities to support implementation of the reforms. These\n            include (but not limited to) the uniform account\n            code-structure, the implementation of the budget entity\n            reforms, and the implementation of newly established\n            district (and Khan) funds both at the central and provincial\n            levels. Finally, the extension will allow the completion of\n            the contract for the services of the International\n            Procurement Agent. The borrower has in place an action plan\n            to complete the project. This will be the second extension\n            of the project and a cumulative extension of 22 months."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cambodia - Public Financial\n            Management and Accountability Project : restructuring (Vol.\n            2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/11/16955014/cambodia-public-financial-management-accountability-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"KH-Cambodia Public Financial Management And\n            Accountability -- P087945","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Debt Markets,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Public Financial Management","teratopic":"Public Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Cambodia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20121113235321"},"theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Tax policy and administration,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Law reform","subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Public Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ACCOUNTABILITY, accounting, accounting\n            standards, arrears, bank accounts, bid, Bidding, borrower,\n            budget classification, budget entity, budget execution,\n            budgeting, corruption, debt, debt management, disbursement,\n            exchange rates, Expenditure, financial accountability,\n            FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, Financial Management Information,\n            Financial Management Information System, grace period,\n            Information System, interest income, internal control,\n            International Development, issuance, Medium-Term Expenditure\n            Framework, negotiation, procurement, Public Expenditure,\n            Public Expenditure Review, PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT,\n            Public Financial Management Reform, Public Financial\n            Management Reform Program, Revenue administration, Service\n            Delivery, transparency, Trust Fund"}},"owner":"Southeast Asia PREM Sector (EASPT)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF054545-Public Financial Management\n            Reform Program in Cambodia,TF054547-DEVELOPMENT PARTNER PUBLIC\n            FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT TRUST FUND - RECIPIENT,TF054627-PHRD-CAMBODIA: PUBLIC FINANCIAL\n            MANAGEMENT REFORM PROJECT","majtheme":"Public sector governance,Rule of law","repnb":"73630"},"16955048":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/11/16955048/cambodia-public-financial-management-accountability-project-restructuring-vol-1-2-main-report","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/11/16955048/cambodia-public-financial-management-accountability-project-restructuring-vol-1-2-main-report","new_url":"2012/11/16955048/cambodia-public-financial-management-accountability-project-restructuring-vol-1-2-main-report","disclosure_date":"2012-11-12T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-11-12T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-11-12T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/11/13/000333038_20121113235104/Rendered/INDEX/NonAsciiFileName0.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/11/13/000333038_20121113235104/Rendered/PDF/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf","credit_no":"H241","datestored":"2012-11-13T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2012-11-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"2","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Public Financial Management and\n            Accountability Project : restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The development objective of the Public\n            Financial Management and Accountability Project is to\n            strengthen public financial management by strengthening the:\n            1) mobilization of public resources, 2) management of public\n            resources, 3) management of human resources, and 4) external\n            audit.
