- National Highways\n            Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The National Highways Rehabilitation and\n            Maintenance Project for Argentina has a satisfactory\n            outcome, is likely to be sustainable, and has a modest\n            institutional development impact. The performances of the\n            Borrower and the Bank are rated satisfactory. Among the\n            several lessons cited were these: 1) Good quality project\n            design, Borrower commitment to the project objectives, sound\n            highway maintenance policies involving private sector\n            participation, Bank flexibility in revising the Loan\n            Agreement, and good support during supervision missions from\n            the decentralized Country Management Unit are important in\n            carrying through a complex project severely endangered by\n            critical economic and political problems. 2) The critical\n            financing problems experienced from 1999 to 2003 by the road\n            sector in general, and by this project in particular, due to\n            their dependency on annual budgetary allocations subject to\n            sudden political decisions, show clearly the need to\n            establish an adequate and reliable road financing system. 3)\n            Implementation of this project has confirmed the advantages\n            of the CREMA performance based contract system compared to\n            the traditional unit price (quantity measurement) type of\n            contracting. (a) The CREMA system of contracting fosters the\n            contractors' ownership of the works by transferring the\n            responsibilities for the service quality of the roads from\n            the Road Authority to the Contractors; thus compelling them\n            to: (1) prepare results-oriented programming of their works\n            and activities, (2) exert their own quality control, (3)\n            implement adequate rehabilitation works the first year to\n            ensure low maintenance costs over the remaining four years,\n            and (4) repair promptly any road deterioration to prevent\n            further extension of the initial damage. This benefit of\n            increased ownership is further reinforced by the\n            contractors' obligation to comply with the prescribed\n            performance indicators, and the possibility of being\n            penalized in case of noncompliance. The fact that the\n            average amount of penalties has stayed at a level of 1\n            percent of contract costs demonstrates the effective\n            development of the contractors' ownership. (b) The five\n            year programming inherent to the CREMA system is also highly\n            beneficial for the public sector. Its fixed price\n            contracting format and the required careful planning of\n            rehabilitation and maintenance activities over 5 years have\n            effectively reduced the risks of cost overruns. (c) Gradual\n            implementation of the CREMA system over the years\n            contributed fundamentally to the substantial improvement of\n            road conditions experienced from 1997 to 2005 by the\n            non-concessioned network as reflected in the reduction of\n            the percentage of roads in poor condition from 28% to 4% and\n            the increase of roads in good conditions from 44% to 85%. 4)\n            Successful implementation of a necessary institutional\n            strengthening program requires clear and binding agreements\n            between the Borrower and the Bank, strong ownership by the\n            Borrower, detailed programming and consistent execution over\n            the years."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -
