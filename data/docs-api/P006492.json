The outcome of the Gas Sector\n            Development Project (Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline), was\n            highly satisfactory. Sustainability, in all cases, is likely\n            or better, though some economic, contractual, and regulatory\n            issues continue to constrain faster development of the\n            pipeline's potential. The institutional development\n            impact of the three projects varied. In the Gas Sector\n            Development Project, it was rated high based on the\n            substantial sector reform it effected. In the Hydrocarbon\n            Transport and Processing Project it was rated substantial\n            because reforms were only partially implemented. In the Sao\n            Paulo Gas Distribution Project it was rated modest because\n            the project did not contribute as much as intended to the\n            implementation of a rational gas pricing policy and tariff\n            structure in Sao Paulo and in Brazil. Bank and borrower\n            performance were rated satisfactory or better in all three\n            projects.  Several lessons can be derived from these three\n            projects, in particular: Bank involvement in large and\n            complex national or cross-border public-private\n            infrastructure projects involving a spectrum of political,\n            regulatory, financial, environmental, and social risks, can\n            bring substantial value added to the country. In complex\n            investment projects involving many partners and tight\n            schedules, key policy and institutional matters are better\n            addressed up front, and sector regulation, in particular\n            that related to priority and open access rules to gas\n            transportation pipelines, should precede gas supply and\n            transportation contracts. Uneven distribution of risks among\n            gas producers, buyers, transporters, and distributors has\n            perverse effects because resulting risk mitigation\n            strategies tend to reinforce vertical integration and\n            thereby reduce competition. Clean fuels can be more\n            competitive if appropriate environmental standards and\n            strong control and enforcement systems exist in the\n            consumption markets.  Early preparation of a comprehensive\n            and in-depth Environmental Assessment is important to\n            influence project design and ensure optimum definition and\n            implementation of environmental, social, safety, and health\n            measures. Early involvement of civil society in the design,\n            implementation, and monitoring of the environmental and\n            social mitigation and compensation programs is essential to\n            identify all relevant stakeholders and avoid later\n            conflicts, and clear participation mechanisms are necessary\n            to ensure proper design and successful implementation.\n            Involvement of international and local NGOs can positively\n            influence the implementation of large and complex projects,\n            and help ensure application of the Bank's safeguard\n            policies, when combined with Bank and sponsors'\n            receptiveness to criticism and willingness to address issues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
