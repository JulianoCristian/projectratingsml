SAC2 was to support the\n            consolidation of the comprehensive reforms undertaken under\n            the New Economic Mechanism (NEM).  Changes in ratings\n            include: outcome is downgraded to moderately unsatisfactory,\n            and sustainability rating is changed from likely to\n            unlikely.  Bank performance is rated satisfactory, although\n            with major weaknesses, through the close of SAC2, but\n            unsatisfactory through the continuation of the reform\n            program to 2004; while Borrower performance is downgraded\n            from satisfactory at the close of SAC2 to unsatisfactory\n            subsequently, due to minimal commitment to reforms in civil\n            service, public resource management and resource\n            mobilization.  Lessons from the re-assessment include: a)\n            civil service right-sizing should be established within an\n            overall vision of citizens needs and expectations of the\n            public sector; b) government ownership is critical, and\n            commitment at the technical level does not equal commitment\n            at the decision-maker level; c) before attempting to achieve\n            a better performing civil service through improved incentive\n            packages, the resources to fund those incentives must be\n            secured; d) low implementation capacity should not be blamed\n            for shortcomings in Bank-supported operations, when lack of\n            government commitment is the main cause; e) external events\n            can shape the views of policy-makers; and f) monitoring and\n            evaluation are critical for determining the outcome and\n            impact of reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Laos - Second Structural
