The main lessons address\n            the following. Projects of this nature should consider two\n            main areas - strengthening of regulatory agencies, and\n            improving payment systems - so as to better manage project\n            components, and beneficiaries, moreover, limiting the number\n            of components, to obtain satisfactory results, as proven by\n            this operation. During the mid-term review, project\n            performance indicators were redefined, which enabled\n            progress monitoring, an issue that needs to be discussed in\n            detail with beneficiaries, to ensure the value of\n            indicators, and its acceptance. Such well defined indicators\n            also insulates the implementation of the project from\n            political interference, an issue which could have been\n            prevented had the indicators been in place early on.\n            Furthermore, procurement of large, and complex information\n            technology systems, and equipment needs to be revisited by\n            the Bank, in particular, the project could be used as a case\n            study towards developing a necessary procurement expertise.\n            Procurement delays caused irreparable harm to project\n            implementation; ideally, project design should address key\n            procurement issues, to improve development impacts. Finally,\n            project coordination should be mainstreamed within\n            implementing agencies, based on the years of experience with\n            the Africa Region's policy, and, policy

The first is\n            to promote the growth of an efficient, competitive, well\n            regulated, non-bank financial sector and an efficient\n            payments system in order to: 1) increase the mobilization of\n            domestic savings in both formal and informal sectors; 2)\n            facilitate the flow of international capital into Ghana\n            through better financial intermediation; and 3) supply\n            financial services competitively to the economy.  The second\n            objective is to create an environment conducive to greater\n            private sector activity and support the successful\n            implementation of the divestiture program for state owned\n            enterprises (SOE) and the three largest state-owned\n            commercial banks.  The project addresses identified gaps in\n            the non-bank financial sector including: capital markets\n            institutions such as the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE),\n            Securities Regulatory Commission (SRC), and the Bank of\n            Ghana (BOG), and contractual savings institutions, such as\n            National Insurance Commission (NIC), State Insurance\n            Corporation (SIC), Ghana Reinsurance Organization (GRO), and\n            Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT).  The\n            project also provides for associated financial\n            infrastructure (domestic payments system) and capacity\n            building in the non-bank financial institutions sector and\n            diagnostic studies at the Ministry of Finance to enable the\n            Government of Ghana to prepare strategies for future actions\n            in expanding the provision of

The first is\n            to promote the growth of an efficient, competitive, well\n            regulated, non-bank financial sector and an efficient\n            payments system in order to: 1) increase the mobilization of\n            domestic savings in both formal and informal sectors; 2)\n            facilitate the flow of international capital into Ghana\n            through better financial intermediation; and 3) supply\n            financial services competitively to the economy.  The second\n            objective is to create an environment conducive to greater\n            private sector activity and support the successful\n            implementation of the divestiture program for state owned\n            enterprises (SOE) and the three largest state-owned\n            commercial banks.  The project addresses identified gaps in\n            the non-bank financial sector including: capital markets\n            institutions such as the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE),\n            Securities Regulatory Commission (SRC), and the Bank of\n            Ghana (BOG), and contractual savings institutions, such as\n            National Insurance Commission (NIC), State Insurance\n            Corporation (SIC), Ghana Reinsurance Organization (GRO), and\n            Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT).  The\n            project also provides for associated financial\n            infrastructure (domestic payments system) and capacity\n            building in the non-bank financial institutions sector and\n            diagnostic studies at the Ministry of Finance to enable the\n            Government of Ghana to prepare strategies for future actions\n            in expanding the provision of financial services to rural\n            and informal sectors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Non-Bank Financial Institutions\n            Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana -
