The\n            key factors leading to the Government of Ecuador's\n            (GOE's) decision not to sign the loan were political\n            instability and conflict and, in particular, conflicts\n            between national indigenous organizations over the direction\n            of the Council for the Development of Nationalities and\n            Peoples of Ecuador (CODENPE). Afro-Ecuadorian organizations\n            supported the project but were unable to influence the\n            government decesion that led to its cancellation. Political\n            instability and conflicts surrounding CODENPE created\n            repeated delays in fulfilling Ecuador's internal\n            requirements for signing the loan. Only the first of seven\n            steps required signing the loan, the Ministry of Economy and\n            Finances' (MEF's) project validation, had been\n            completed by GOE in January 2005. By February 2005, MEF had\n            decided that the original declaration of priority issued by\n            the planning secretariat had expired, and returned the\n            project to the starting point of the internal approval\n            process. CODENPE and the Afro-Ecuadorian Development\n            Corporation (CODAE) continued to make attempts to advance\n            the process but these were unfruitful. The Bank's Task\n            Team, together with both Sector Management Unit (SMU) and\n            Country Management Unit (CMU) management, remained engaged\n            throughout the period, through missions and visits and via\n            the permanent engagement of the country office. Updating the\n            agreed action plans and reminding authorities of the steps\n            required, but the agreed activities were not completed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Second Indigenous and\n            Afro-Ecuadorian Peoples Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ecuador - Second Indigenous and\n            Afro-Ecuadorian Peoples Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/12/9753766/ecuador-second-indigenous-afro-ecuadorian-peoples-development-project","projn":"EC-Second Indigenous And Afroecuadorian\n            Peoples Development Projec -- P077257","docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation","subtopic":"m,Access to Finance,Debt Markets,Banks & Banking Reform,Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures","teratopic":"Public Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Ecuador","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20080811024536"},"theme":"Indigenous peoples,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural markets,Participation and civic engagement,Land administration and management","subsc":"Agro-industry,Water supply,Primary education,Irrigation and drainage,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Public Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Education,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"approval process, assets, Bank financing,\n            Bank Lending, Bank loan, Bank policies, basic needs,\n            beneficiaries, Borrower, borrowing, Central Bank, conflict\n            of interest, consulting firm, consulting firms, CURRENCY,\n            debt, debt financing, Development Corporation, direct\n            financing, disbursement, Disbursements, discrimination,\n            economic development, empowerment, Exchange Rate, external\n            debt, Financial Management, financial resources, financing\n            sources, gender, gender equity, Government support,\n            handicrafts, human capital, ID, Indigenous Peoples, lack of\n            knowledge, Land administration, land titling, laws, lawyer,\n            leadership, leaderships, legal agreement, legal provisions,\n            Lending Instrument, LOAN, Loan Agreement, mandates, Natural\n            resources, operating costs, political appointees, portfolio,\n            poverty rates, Primary education, Procurement, Public\n            Credit, public services, Rural markets, scholarship, Senior,\n            Social Development, Technical assistance, Water supply, withdrawal"}},"owner":"Social Development (LCSSO)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF052532-PHRD-ECUADOR: SECOND INDIGENOUS\n            AND AFRO-ECUADORIAN PEOPLES DEVELOPMENT","majtheme":"Rural development,Environment and natural resource management,Social dev/gender/inclusion","repnb":"NCO170"},"3774688":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/05/3774688/ecuador-second-indigenous-afro-ecuadorian-peoples-development-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/05/3774688/ecuador-second-indigenous-afro-ecuadorian-peoples-development-project","new_url":"2004/05/3774688/ecuador-second-indigenous-afro-ecuadorian-peoples-development-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/05/28/000090341_20040528132413/Rendered/INDEX/28968.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/05/28/000090341_20040528132413/Rendered/PDF/28968.pdf","docdt":"2004-05-21T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2004-05-28T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Second Indigenous and\n            Afro-Ecuadorian Peoples Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project aims to promote the\n            empowerment and improved access to natural and financial\n            resources for indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian communities\n            within the framework of their own development.

This environmental assessment is\n            based on the country's environmental laws and\n            regulations, and on international environmental standards,\n            and, environmental checklists will be available to profile,\n            and identify within each subproject, potential environmental\n            adversity. Subprojects will be classified as: category A,\n            which includes activities concerning biodiversity\n            conservation, sustainable agricultural practices,\n            reforestation, integrated management of micro-basins, small\n            scale crop management; alternative energy, i.e., solar\n            energy, hydraulic energy, etc. These will not require an\n            environmental assessment; Category B, with subproject\n            proposals for agricultural extension practices requiring\n            soil fertility improvement, drainage, afro-forestry\n            practices, livestock productivity in fragile areas, or in\n            areas rich in medicinal plants, shall require an\n            environmental assessment, while those subprojects under\n            Category C that includes construction of irrigation systems,\n            in addition to agro-industries such as agro-processing,\n            infrastructure development will require an environmental\n            impact assessment process, and as needed, specific studies\n            that address the environmental requirement in each case.\n            Category D subprojects will not be financed by the project,\n            and these activities include: proposals within protected\n            areas, deforestation, aquaculture activities in protected\n            areas, dam construction, new roads in protected areas,\n            introduction of foreign or exotic species, and, the use of\n            pesticides.
