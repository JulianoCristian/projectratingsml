This\n            project was similar to four earlier loans to the Industrial\n            Credit and Investment Corporation of India Ltd. (ICICI). The\n            major issue discussed during the preparation, appraisal, and\n            negotiations of the project was whether to increase the\n            limit of projects that ICICI could approve without prior\n            Bank approval. The previous four loans had not been closed\n            when the Fifth was approved. Due to rapid commitments, a\n            Sixth loan to ICICI was approved in 1965. The loan closing\n            date was extended once up to December 31, 1967, due to\n            approved firms having problems obtaining import licenses.\n            The Bank refused a second extension, but suggested that the\n            balances of various unfinished sub-projects be transferred\n            to the Sixth loan. This transfer was accomplished\n            successfully. A report on the Sixth loan to ICICI has\n            commended the institution on its satisfactory progress in\n            appraisal of subloans, market analyses, and management. This\n            report notes that the subsequent Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth\n            loans to ICICI have been rated as satisfactory by another\n            report (Report Number 949) dated December 17, 1975."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
