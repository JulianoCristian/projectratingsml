The lessons\n            learned indicate that the issue of subproject sustainability\n            is crucially important and complex, involving both the\n            central and local levels. New approaches need time to be\n            integrated, particularly in a conservative environment such\n            as Nicaragua, where there is also a lack of general\n            institutional capacity, both at the central and local\n            government levels. Decentralization of the subproject cycle\n            improved client responsiveness and municipal participation;\n            increased managerial capacity of local governments; and\n            reduced subproject costs. Social funds should continue to\n            promote the involvement of NGOs and other community-based\n            organizations, particularly in training activities related\n            to participatory planning and operations and maintenance.\n            The same Bank staff was available throughout project design\n            and implementation, which did contribute to institutional\n            memory, and helped consistency in the Bank response. As\n            evidenced in Social Investment Fund (FISE), the use of an\n            accurate and agreed poverty map for subproject resource\n            allocation can help a social investment fund withstand\n            political pressures to lend more to favored municipalities\n            and communities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Third Social Investment Fund

education, health, and water supply and\n            sanitation; b) focusing on the poorer communities; and c)\n            strengthening, on a pilot basis, municipal management which,\n            in turn, should lead to more sustainable subprojects at the\n            local level. The project consists of four components. First,\n            subproject financing represents the core of the project.\n            This component will include social and economic\n            infrastructure identified by communities, nongovernmental\n            organizations, and local government representatives. The\n            majority of the demand will be for education, health, water\n            supply and sewerage, and social projects. Second, capacity\n            building of municipalities/communities will support training\n            activities for local governments, special projects for\n            indigenous people, and programs specifically targeted at\n            women. The third component will support analysis of 1998 and\n            future Living Standards Measurement Surveys, updating of\n            Social Investment Fund's (FISE's) poverty maps;\n            and analysis of the 1998 and future FISE impact evaluations.\n            Fourth, project management will cover operating costs,\n            office expansion and rehabilitation, staff training, as well\n            as improvement of office technology equipment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Third Social Investment Fund Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nicaragua - Third Social\n
