Lessons learned from the\n            projects included: projects dispersed over a wide\n            geographical area. In this case, success came from: (i)\n            logistics must be well worked out for the successful\n            implementation of large packaging works into larger\n            contracts to be undertaken by experienced large firms able\n            to operate across these large areas; (ii) assembling design\n            work already done under earlier operations; and (iii) fully\n            deploying the Bank country office to ensure regular contact\n            with client towns. Project experience demonstrates that\n            direct technical assistance and training with on-the-job\n            experience o f executing priority physical investments\n            continues to be a winning combination for improving local\n            government municipal management and urban service delivery.\n            Project design should focus only upon intended outcomes that\n            can feasibly be achieved and whose success can convincingly\n            be demonstrated. Claims to attain higher level intended\n            outcomes-economic development and poverty reduction in this\n            case should only be made when there is a convincing\n            rationale that project interventions can achieve them, and\n            also a sound Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system to\n            record the baseline, target and endline values of indicators\n

satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was substantial, and the\n            Bank and borrower performance were both satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned: successful implementation depends on\n            setting realistic development objectives, keeping the design\n            of the project simple, and establishing practical\n            implementation arrangements. Establishing base-line data for\n            the key output/impact indicators for a project and tracking\n            it over the implementation period will make quantitative\n            information available. The current IDA staff was reportedly\n            not acting as auditors to check where the government project\n            staff has gone wrong. The supervision strategy for large\n            infrastructure projects must be well structured and should\n            be followed in a disciplined fashion, and include exhaustive\n            site visits. Creation of autonomous Urban Water and Sewerage\n            Authority (UWSAs) with ring-fenced revenue has proven to be\n            an effective institutional arrangement for sustainable\n            service delivery. Quality of work and improved services\n            alter public perception. Good record keeping and timely\n            processing of financial issues simplifies audits.
