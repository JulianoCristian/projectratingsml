Ratings for the Second\n            Community Forestry Project for Mexico are as follows:\n            outcome was satisfactory; risk to the development outcome\n            was moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            include: improved stewardship of natural resources is\n            probably the main contribution of community forestry in\n            Mexico. Community forestry will not wipe out rural poverty\n            in Mexico because the program is necessarily limited to\n            communities with abundant forests and no land conflicts; and\n            even in these communities incomes from forest activities\n            will always make up only a small share of total incomes. Nor\n            by itself will community forestry reverse the declining\n            supply and lack of competitiveness of timber in Mexico. But\n            it is an important part of the broader effort to protect the\n            natural resource base. There are no quick fixes for building\n            community capacity and institutional arrangements to manage\n            and conserve forests. Plugging technical and infrastructure\n            gaps is easy compared to the work of building trust in\n            communities that have been ill served by Mexican governments\n            for decades. The hefty contribution made by Procymaf\n            communities to training and investment initiatives, the\n            broad-based participation in land zoning exercises and the\n            significant survival rate of the forest enterprises\n            established by Procymaf is the best evidence yet that the\n            programs are building capacity and sustainable institutional\n            arrangements. It is important to embed support to individual\n            communities within a broader framework that strengthens\n            cooperation between communities and municipal and state\n            governments and develops a network of professional expertise\n            on forest-centered activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -

Some lessons\n            learned included: the project helped beneficiaries to\n            capitalize on their natural resource assets and bring focus\n            to their community development process. Many of the\n            communities had been affected by long-standing conflicts\n            regarding land tenure, and high emigration rates. The\n            forestry activities and investment opportunities provided by\n            the project resulted in a positive focus for the\n            communities, while generating greater income and employment\n            opportunities. The project provided a solid platform for the\n            expansion of conservation and sustainable land management in\n            globally important ecosystems through its zoning, forest\n            management, and conservation plans. The incorporation of\n            increasing areas of forests using these instruments is\n            conducive to environmentally and socially-sustainable\n            economic development of the sector. The community forestry\n            sector does not exist in isolation from the regional,\n            national, and international/global forestry markets. Mexico\n            continues to be a net importer of wood and increasingly, the\n            national forest sector is challenged by the presence of\n            low-cost or competitively priced wood and paper products\n            from such remote places as Chile and Uruguay. As community\n            forestry enterprises develop their growth will be\n            increasingly challenged and guided by this competition.\n            Several communities supported by CFP II entered into\n            voluntary certification programs. However, there are few\n            financial incentives for doing so and transaction costs for\n            certification are high. Communities that rely on local or\n            national markets have difficulty using their certification\n            to gain market share, improve prices or find niches.\n            Increased efforts are needed to develop market mechanisms\n            and create financial incentives for certified wood."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Second Community Forestry

The\n            project's specific objectives are (i) to strengthen\n            community institutions by means of the consolidation of\n            social capital and management capacity to improve the\n            benefits flowing from use of forest resources; (ii) to\n            strengthen technical and administrative capacity of ejidos\n            and communities for the development of local and regional\n            productive processes; (iii) to identify and develop\n            investment alternatives and productive diversification for\n            communities and ejidos, and to promote local and regional\n            arrangements to facilitate access by these communities to\n            schemes for payment for environmental services. The areas\n            were selected on a basis of the presence of high value\n            standing forest resources owned by indigenous communities or\n            ejidos. The potential benefits include strengthening of\n            community decision-making processes, higher income from\n            forest production, and diversification of household incomes.\n            PROCYMAF I assisted approximately 300 communities and ejidos\n            in the States of Guerrero, MichoacBn and Oaxaca.

This would\n            be achieved by making private-sector and technical\n            assistance available to communities that own economically,\n            valuable forest lands, to help them manage their forest\n            resources in an ecologically, and financially sustainable\n            fashion. To this end, this initial environmental management\n            plan stipulates that any forest management initiative\n            supported by the project, should demonstrate compliance with\n            the environmental laws and regulations in Mexico, and\n            further specifies recognition of, and respect owed for any\n            legally documented, or customary land tenure and user\n            rights, as well as the rights of indigenous peoples, ethnic\n            groups, and workers. Mitigation measures are addressed as\n            follows. Areas larger than twenty hectares shall require a\n            simplified forest management plan, underlining that species\n            listed as endangered, should only be utilized under the\n            supervision of an established Environmental Management Unit.\n            Consequently, following a consultation process,\n            participatory forest management plans will be established in\n            accordance with stakeholders, communities, and local\n            governments. Subprojects will be subject to a screening\n            process, to evaluate potential adverse environmental\n            impacts, benefits or risks, prior to project appraisal.\n            Specific mitigation measures shall apply to areas of steep\n            slopes, of potential soil erosion, to riverine areas, and to\n            harvesting methods, as well as construction of forest roads.\n            Commercial harvesting operations will only be financed when\n            affected areas are not critical forests, or critical natural\n            habitats, and, certified by an independent forest authority.\n            Certification, though not legally required, will be\n            supported through the National Forest Fund."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
