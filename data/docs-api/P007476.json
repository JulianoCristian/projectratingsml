The support for both an independent\n            regulatory system and privatization proved to be weak, and\n            the government did not live up to its commitment. Some key\n            lessons include: 1) Build-own-operates and independent power\n            producers can be a useful vehicle to mobilize additional\n            resources for the electricity sector and shift the\n            construction and technical performance risks to private\n            investors. However, structuring them may require a lot of\n            time and senior management attention, and involve numerous\n            agreements, which is one reason why they are not necessarily\n            at a low-cost solution. 2) In an electricity system that\n            depends on the supply by private firms, this private failure\n            can become a public problem. It is therefore necessary for\n            the Bank to pay attention to the technical aspects of such\n            projects. 3) In lending to privately owned utilities, the\n            Bank should avoid creating a new financial window which\n            might end up being used for only one transaction or a very\n            small number of transactions. 4) Care should be exercised in\n            undertaking Operation Evaluation Department performance\n            audit reports prior to the implementation completion report.\n            5) While a comprehensive and innovative approach to sector\n            development has obvious attractions, it may exceed the\n            country's implemntation capacity. It may also require\n            more supervision resources than the Bank is prepared to allocate."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Energy Sector Deregulation and\n            Privatization
