risk to development outcome was substantial,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: sustaining sector reforms requires\n            continuous government commitment through different\n            administrations as well as strong stakeholder engagement. A\n            performance audit report in the 1990s recommends that for\n            geothermal projects the Bank needs to be more flexible in\n            its procurement processes, mainly in the context of\n            geothermal drilling operations. The national treasury needs\n            also to be engaged further to ensure continuity in fiduciary\n            management officers. Operational lessons include the\n            importance of: (1) government intervention whenever issues\n            arise with local governments (permits, urban planning) or\n            with its own procedures (tax exemption clearances, delays\n            with numerous clearance for release of funds); (2) allowing\n            time for land and right-of-way acquisition; (3) retaining a\n            substantial portion of the contractual amounts for\n            installation to address the often weak capacity of local\n            subcontractors; and (4) keeping a good record of\n            interactions with stakeholders (including consultations on\n            environmental and social safeguards and contractual issues\n            with contractors)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Energy
