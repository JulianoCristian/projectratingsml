The project failed to meet its objectives,\n            institutional development was negligible, sustainability is\n            unlikely, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was unsatisfactory. Two main lessons can be learned from\n            this project. First, more attention should be devoted to\n            assessing the real degree of interest in the project on the\n            part of the ultimate beneficiaries. Second, the correct\n            financial intermediary should be selected. The PFC (Power\n            Finance Cooperation) was not the correct intermediary for\n            this loan. A direct relationship between the Bank and GOI\n            (Government of India) and/or state governments and/or SEBs\n            (State Electricity Board) may have produced better results.\n            However, at the time that the loan was made, GOI was not\n            willing to borrow directly for technical assistance, even if\n            the states were to be the final beneficiaries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

The project\n            will cover technical assistance activities to be essentially\n            carried out in the form of advisory services extended to\n            state electricity boards (SEBs) and other power utilities\n            planning to enter into agreements with private parties for\n            the purchase of power, the takeover of distribution\n            activities or the management of existing facilities.  They\n            will include inter alia the provision of financial, legal\n            and technical advisory services to review outstanding\n            project proposals and assist in contract negotiations, and\n            assistance to SEBs to enable them to prepare and package new\n            projects well enough for them to invite meaningful bids, and\n            help them in the bidding, evaluation, selection, and\n            negotiation process.  The latter will focus on instilling,\n            to the extent possible, some degree of competition among\n            project developers, and on assisting in the implementation\n            of other forms of private sector participation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Technical Assistance For Private\n            Power Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Technical Assistance For\n            Private Power Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/06/733084/india-technical-assistance-private-power-development-project","projn":"IN-Private Power Devt T -- P010422","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Energy Technology & Transmission,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Power & Energy Conversion,Health Economics & Finance,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Energy","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961004153906"},"subsc":"Power,Central government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Auditing,auditors,competitive\n            bidding,Electricity,expenditures,foreign\n            exchange,Grid,institutional development,Power,Power\n            Development,POWER FINANCE,power plant,power plants,power\n            projects,power sector,power supply,power utilities,private\n            sector,public utilities,resource mobilization,return on\n            Investment,Technical Assistance,Urban Development,utility\n            operations,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"Auditing,auditors,competitive\n            bidding,Electricity,expenditures,foreign\n            exchange,Grid,institutional development,Power,Power\n            Development,POWER FINANCE,power plant,power plants,power\n            projects,power sector,power supply,power utilities,private\n            sector,public utilities,resource mobilization,return on\n            Investment,Technical Assistance,Urban Development,utility\n            operations,Water Supply"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF022510-PRIVATE POWER DEVELOPMENT,TF023100-PHRD-PRIVATE POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT","repnb":"P6073"},"facets":{}}}
