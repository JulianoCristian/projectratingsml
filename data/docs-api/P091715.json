When defining broad\n            objectives as a partner to implement activities such as EU\n            accession negotiations, the Bank has little control on\n            timing and in phasing its activities requiring a very\n            flexible implementation approach where procurement often\n            fills immediate needs that may not have been fully\n            identified at project preparation.

Croatia\u2019s overarching priority was to enter the\n            EU with a competitive and growing economy and the\n            institutional capacity to meet the demands of EU membership.\n            To achieve this, several challenges needed to be overcome,\n            including completing Croatia\u2019s transition to a market\n            economy with a focus on private sector growth. International\n            Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has been\n            focusing its assistance on helping Croatia prepare for\n            successful EU integration by, raising the competitiveness of\n            the economy through long-term investments in major trading\n            routes such as the Ports of Rijeka and Ploce. IBRD has been\n            extensively engaged in providing financial support,\n            technical assistance, policy advice, and analytical services\n            to Croatia. The Agriculture Acquis Cohesion Project has\n            helped the country meet the EU accession requirements in the\n            agriculture and rural development areas. About 1,270 new\n            jobs have been created in underdeveloped and war-affected\n            areas across the country, rebuilding lives and livelihoods\n            through activities under the Social and Economic Recovery\n            Project. Energy Efficiency Project helped introduce energy\n            efficient lighting, heating and thermal insulation in more\n            than 50 schools across the country. Throughout its\n            engagement in Croatia, IBRD has developed and maintained\n            excellent partnerships with key international institutions\n            active in the country.Croatia\u2019s per capita income reached\n            about 63 percent of the EU average."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Helping Croatia Prepare for Successful\n            European Union Integration"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Helping Croatia Prepare for\n            Successful European Union Integration"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2010/10/25176351/helping-croatia-prepare-successful-european-union-integration","count":"Croatia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade,Health and other social services,Finance","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"government organizations, education,\n            projects, administration, fighting, nations, international\n            bank, research, skills, safety, property, social services,\n            funds, development project, results, incomes, market\n            economy, economy, eu, institutions, private sector, schools,\n            livelihoods, rural development, integration, ibrd,\n            educators, job, quality of life, corruption, access,\n            competitiveness, video, agriculture, inclusion, society,\n            technical assistance, land, grants, jobs, war, agencies,\n            r&d, multimedia, pdf, public administration,\n            institutional capacity, partners, reconstruction, information"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Economic management,Human development,Trade and integration,Public sector governance,Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Financial and private sector development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Ayudar a Croacia a prepararse para una\n            eficaz integraci\u00f3n en la Uni\u00f3n Europea"}},"topic":"Economic Growth m1326241 471,Energy and Extractives m1326595 507,Efficient Energy Supply m1326601 534,Energy Efficiency m1326852 533,Energy Efficiency Finance m1326603 1697","projn":"HR-Education Sector Development Program\n            Project -- P086671,HR-Fiscal, Social And Financial Sector\n            Development Policy Loan (Dp -- P117665,HR-Agricultural Acquis Cohesion Project -- P091715,HR-Social & Economic Recovery Project -- P076730","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Post Conflict Reconstruction,Gender and Law,Disability,E-Business","teratopic":"Rural Development,Social Protections and Labor,Conflict and Development,Private Sector Development,Gender","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08315d686_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Eastern Europe and Balkans!$!517208"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Eastern Europe and Balkans!$!517208"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","theme":"Regulation and competition policy,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Macroeconomic management,Health system performance,Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance &\n            Social Care Services,Administrative and civil service reform,Export development and competitiveness,Rural policies and institutions,Regional integration,Rural markets,Rural non-farm income generation,Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support,Participation and civic engagement,Regional integration,Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction,Administrative and civil service reform,Education for the knowledge economy","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Social Protections and Labor,Conflict and Development,Private Sector Development,Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Economic Growth m1326241 471,Energy and Extractives m1326595 507,Efficient Energy Supply m1326601 534,Energy Efficiency m1326852 533,Energy Efficiency Finance m1326603 1697","owner":"Macro & Fiscal Mgmt - GP (GMFDR),Agriculture - GP (GFADR),Urban, Rural & Soc Dev - GP (GSURR),EDU GP ECA (GED03)","trustfund":"TF056498-TA TO SUPPORT THE\n            IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGRICULTURAL ACQUIS COHESION PR,BBFAO-BB FAO,TF050513-PHRD-CROATIA: SOCIAL AND\n            ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROJECT,TF041042-CROATIA - SOCIAL ECONOMIC\n            RECOVERY PROGRAM - PREPARATION,TF053149-PHRD-CROATIA: EDUCATION REFORM PROJECT","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Eastern Europe and Balkans"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Eastern Europe and Balkans"}},"repnb":"95973"},"facets":{}}}
