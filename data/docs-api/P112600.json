The Bank and borrower\n            performance were satisfactory. The risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible. Significant changes included\n            scaling up the Project to include 13 new sub-projects under\n            Additional Financing (AF). The AF also financed to a lesser\n            extent: (a) associated ASARECA monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) activities; (b) ASARECA operational costs; and (c)\n            a portion of Bank costs for continued grant oversight and\n            administration. Several lessons were learned. First,\n            agriculture research and development, especially field\n            activities, requires sustained effort to be successful. Such\n            an undertaking cannot be readily started, stopped and\n            completed on a fixed timetable without compromising the\n            results achieved. Second, it is important for research and\n            dissemination to address the entire value chain rather than\n            focusing on only specific segments. It is equally important\n            that the policy landscape is not overlooked. Third, it is\n            essential to ensure that information and knowledge flows are\n            appropriate and up-to-date. Fourth, it is important to be\n            proactive in identifying and selecting partners in research\n            and dissemination endeavors to achieve desired outcomes.\n            Fifth, to ensure sustainability of the regional agricultural\n            research for development initiatives, sustainable and\n            ensured source of funding is very important. Finally,\n            research programs should work together to build on synergies\n            and reap the corresponding benefits and not only have a\n            commodity focus."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Eastern and Central Africa - ASARECA\n            Multi-Donor Trust Fund"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Eastern and Central Africa -\n            ASARECA Multi-Donor
