Some lessons\n            learned included: in a context of fragile institutions,\n            special attention should be paid to the political economy\n            and 'second best' solutions should be explored.\n            One of the key elements of reform that was emphasized\n            throughout the project was the development of a\n            multi-sectoral regulatory agency. Such an agency never\n            became operational and was possibly rarely considered\n            seriously by the changing Governments. As discussed above,\n            the political instability and the complexity of unbundling\n            the existing vested interests at the level of individual\n            ministries (which were sensitive to the resources generated\n            through the sectoral regulatory agencies) are the key\n            reasons behind this outcome. Early recognition of the\n            strength of these vested interests could potentially have\n            allowed for the exploration of alternative, more politically\n            feasible, routes of reform. The monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) framework should receive greater priority even in\n            a weak institutional setting in order to support both a\n            quantitatively sound evaluation and project implementation.\n            The lack of a satisfactory M&E framework makes it\n            difficult to adequately assess the impact of the project,\n            and therefore limits the ability to make corrections or draw\n            lessons for future projects. The lack of adequate M&E\n            doubtless limited the ability to measure the degree to which\n            specific components achieved the desired goals or should\n            have been modified in order to accomplish those goals."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea-Bissau - Private Sector\n            Rehabilitation and Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea-Bissau - Private

          Guinea-Bissau is to support increased investment,\n            competitiveness, and participation of the private sector in\n            economic activity. There are three project components. The\n            first component supports and/or prepares the reform of\n            telecommunications, air transport, port, water, and energy\n            sectors. The project assists in attracting private\n            investments in these sectors and in the implementation of\n            the necessary legal and regulatory reforms, and funds\n            related capacity building, especially in a multi-sector\n            regulatory agency. In addition, this component supports\n            divestiture from public enterprises, including the\n            liquidation of a bankrupt commercial bank and the\n            outsourcing of custodial public services. The project\n            finances the retrenchment cost of redundant workers.

assessment of seventeen public enterprises in the Republic\n            of Guinea-Bissau that are being privatized under the Private\n            Sector Rehabilitation and Restructuring Project. It aims to\n            provide the necessary information for internal planning\n            before divestiture and for external reporting as well as\n            indicating the \"road map\" for determining the\n            environmental liabilities and audit studies for future\n            privatization candidates. The major environmental issues of\n            concern in Guinea-Bissau include deforestation, soil\n            degradation, overgrazing, and over-fishing. The\n            industrialization could become accelerated through the\n            privatization of public enterprises. This could give rise to\n            critical and most immediate problems: a) health impacts of\n            pollution derived from inadequate water supply and shortage\n            of electricity; b) poor sanitation, drainage, and solid\n            waste services; c) Poor urban and industrial waste\n            management; d) air pollution; and e) noise pollution. In\n            general, there is relatively low coverage and access to\n            basic services. Controlled landfills, incineration, and\n            resource recovery facilities are few. Hence, health and\n            safety issues, including medical monitoring and providing\n            appropriate industrial hygiene for workers, will be\n            necessary to minimize the negative impacts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea-Bissau - Private Sector\n            Rehabilitation and Restructuring Project (PSRRP) :\n            environmental impact assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea-Bissau - Private Sector\n            Rehabilitation and Restructuring Project (PSRRP) :\n            environmental impact assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/03/1121260/guinea-bissau-private-sector-rehabilitation-restructuring-project-psrrp-environmental-impact-assessment","projn":"GW-Private Sector Rehabilitation And\n            Development Project -- P001001","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Business in Development,Business Environment,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Guinea-Bissau","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01053004081650"},"subsc":"General industry and trade sector,Central government administration,General transportation sector,General energy sector,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome,air,air\n            pollution,air quality,asbestos,AUDIT\n            OBJECTIVES,AUDITING,AUDITS,bank procedures,Carbon,Carbon\n            Dioxide,climate,Climate Change,COST\n            ESTIMATES,deforestation,deposits,Direct\n            Costs,ecology,economic growth,Emissions,Endangered\n            Species,Environmental Evaluation,environmental\n            issues,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,environmental\n            performance,environmental problems,Environmental\n            Protection,equilibrium,ethnic groups,EVALUATION\n            CRITERIA,exercises,Fish,FISHERIES,fishing,good\n            practices,hazardous\n            wastes,hospitals,hygiene,Immunodeficiency,impact\n            assessment,laws,LEGAL FRAmEwoRK,legislation,malaria,market\n            liberalization,media,Mines,Natural Resources,noise\n            pollution,Occupational Health,oil,oil\n            reserves,overgrazing,pollution,Private\n            Sector,Privatization,PUBLIC ENTERPRISES,public\n            services,public transport,purchasing,purchasing\n            power,refugees,Regulatory Framework,reporting,safety,soil\n            degradation,solid waste collection,Sulfur\n            Dioxide,sustainable development,timber,waste,waste\n            management,water supply,wetlands,workers,World Bank regulations"},"1":{"cdata!":"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome,air,air\n            pollution,air quality,asbestos,AUDIT\n            OBJECTIVES,AUDITING,AUDITS,bank procedures,Carbon,Carbon\n            Dioxide,climate,Climate Change,COST\n            ESTIMATES,deforestation,deposits,Direct\n            Costs,ecology,economic growth,Emissions,Endangered\n            Species,Environmental Evaluation,environmental\n            issues,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,environmental\n            performance,environmental problems,Environmental\n            Protection,equilibrium,ethnic groups,EVALUATION\n            CRITERIA,exercises,Fish,FISHERIES,fishing,good\n            practices,hazardous\n            wastes,hospitals,hygiene,Immunodeficiency,impact\n            assessment,laws,LEGAL FRAmEwoRK,legislation,malaria,market\n            liberalization,media,Mines,Natural Resources,noise\n            pollution,Occupational Health,oil,oil\n            reserves,overgrazing,pollution,Private\n            Sector,Privatization,PUBLIC ENTERPRISES,public\n            services,public transport,purchasing,purchasing\n            power,refugees,Regulatory Framework,reporting,safety,soil\n            degradation,solid waste collection,Sulfur\n            Dioxide,sustainable development,timber,waste,waste\n            management,water supply,wetlands,workers,World Bank regulations"}},"owner":"AFT: Private Sector (AFTPS)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF040444-GUINEA-BISSAU:  PSD PROJECT,TF029582-PHRD-PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT CREDIT","repnb":"E465"},"facets":{}}}
