The lessons learned indicate\n            that flexibility of project design, accompanied by good\n            resource planning, sound engineering design, and effective\n            management for implementation, produced very good results.\n            Contractors in ex-Soviet environments still face\n            difficulties in adjusting to Bank-style construction\n            contracts with Government. Timely project implementation\n            depends on good project planning. Simple technologies and\n            design approaches which are new for the borrowing country\n            can be successfully introduced, and adopted by relatively\n            inexperienced contractors if the necessary support of\n            international experts, along with effective local support,\n            is provided. Import of working quantities of new products\n            can demonstrate the effectiveness of new technologies and\n            provide the key to their acceptance on a wider scale, as\n            well as a guide and comparative gauge for local manufacture.\n            Training (especially on-the-job) is critical in order to\n            obtain overall satisfactory results and to provide a\n            relatively homogeneous quality level throughout similar\n            sub-projects. Kyrgyz norms for flood relief works (including\n            calculation of flood return periods and associated\n            evaluation of benefits) remain intact since Soviet times."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic -

The project consists of two components. 1)\n            Rehabilitation/reconstruction of river protection and\n            irrigation infrastructure will finance repair and\n            rehabilitation of eroded river embankments in five rivers,\n            together with rehabilitation and reconstruction of 23\n            protective spurs. The component will also finance the\n            rehabilitation and reconstruction of selected irrigation\n            infrastructure inside and outside of river beds at 16\n            different schemes. Within the river beds the repair works\n            will include intake spurs, irrigation conveyance canals and\n            their embankments, spurs to protect such embankments, and\n            spillways and gated headworks. Outside the river beds the\n            repair works will include drain overpass reconstruction,\n            spillway reconstruction from debris dams and repair of\n            concrete lining. 2) Project management and implementation\n            support will establish a project implementation unit for the\n            project's daily management. Consulting firms will be\n            contracted for the preparation of feasibility studies. The\n            component will also support two study tours to countries\n            where different methods of flood protection are practiced."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Flood Emergency Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kyrgyz Republic -
