Ratings\n            for the Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project\n            (PRSC II) for Benin are as follows: outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to the development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was rated moderately satisfactory. Ratings for\n            the Third Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project (PRSC\n            III) for Benin are as follows: outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to the development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was rated moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) selectivity and simplicity of the\n            design are essential to the success of the operation.\n            Obstacles due to administrative resistance to change, as\n            well as due to lack of capacity cannot be underestimated. It\n            is better to start with a very selective matrix and enlarge\n            progressively, building on success in some components. There\n            is also a need to be realistic about the scope and pace of\n            reform; 2) it is important to properly align the PRSC with\n            budget management, so that the priority components of the\n            PRSC and the performance budgets of those ministries are\n            supportive of each other. It is also important that budget\n            support be phased with the budget cycle, in order to\n            properly impact on budget composition, and to provide budget\n            support in a timely manner; 3) the effectiveness of the\n            PRSCs in supporting sector reforms can be highly increased\n            by using a sector wide approach, as was successfully\n            experienced in rural water supply. The approach federated\n            donors around the government's objectives and allowed a\n            mix of central government programs, decentralized programs,\n            budget support and projects to combine efficiently; and 4)\n            PRSCs (I-III) rightly focused on the critical areas of\n            governance and basic service delivery. Future PRSCs need to\n            deepen support in the areas of reforms where progress has\n            been slow and focus on critical bottlenecks rather than\n            broadening the areas of

(PRSC-3) will assist the Government of Benin in\n            implementing its Poverty Reduction Strategy, launched in\n            December 2002. PRSC series are an integral part of the\n            Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). PRSC-1 aimed\n            to: (i) help create the basis for private-sector-led\n            economic growth by supporting the Government's\n            macroeconomic program; (ii) support the Government of\n            Benin's public expenditure management reform program;\n            and (iii) support the reform of the public resources\n            management in key sectors, including Health, Education and\n            Water, focusing on the delivery of basic services tailored\n            to the needs of the poor. PRSC2 expanded the coverage to\n            three new sectors (Agriculture, Rural Transportation and\n            Justice), while supporting continued implementation of the\n            Environment and Urban Sanitation and the Forest Management\n            programs as well as re-launching reforms in civil service\n            and decentralization. As a follow-up to PRSC-2, PRSC-3 will\n            maintain a core focus on economic growth and governance,\n            supporting service delivery through improved public\n            expenditure
