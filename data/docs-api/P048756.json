The lessons\n            learned indicate that a project affecting reforms in many\n            sectors is necessarily a complex operation requiring the\n            coordination of actions by several Ministries or Units of\n            the Government, all of which usually do not have the same\n            interest in restructuring or reforms. Multi-sector projects\n            also present special challenges for implementation. In\n            general, existence of multiple beneficiaries requires a\n            simplification through centralizing project implementation\n            in one unit. The Unit in charge of the execution of the\n            project must receive full support and attention of the\n            Bank's supervision missions at the onset of project\n            execution and when high turnover of staff occurs, as\n            technical assistance project schedules do not usually\n            provide for much time for on-the-job training of such units.\n            Project ownership by the Government is of paramount\n            importance in projects involving radical reforms which are\n            very politically sensitive. As soon as the Bank had detected\n            a significant or irreversible lack of political support to\n            the project by the Government, the Bank could have\n            considered more drastic measures, including project\n            restructuring. In this case, such an opportunity to\n            restructure the project was missed by the Bank in 2001 when\n            the new Administration did not translate its verbal\n            commitment to the project into actions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala - Private Participation in\n            Infrastructure Technical Assistance Loan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guatemala - Private
