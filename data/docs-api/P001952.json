Experience\n            with the assessed projects confirms a number of lessons: 1)\n            A policy framework focused on costs and access is\n            insufficient. The two primary education projects emphasized\n            cost savings over instruction on basic skills. Policy\n            dialogue and project activities need to focus on student\n            acquisition of basic skills. Providing mass education under\n            clearly inadequate instructional conditions may graduate\n            functional illiterates, and benefit only those who are the\n            brightest, or better-off. 2) Access-related indicators may\n            be relatively easy to obtain, but may not be closely related\n            to learning achievements. Monitoring indicators for the two\n            primary education projects showcased enrollment increases\n            and improvements in student flows, but not whether students\n            had acquired basic knowledge and skills. Innovative and\n            rapid means must be sought to gauge students'\n            achievements (such as the proportion of students able to\n            read fluently a simple text.). Procurement planning must aim\n            at making large numbers of textbooks available to students\n            for free, but also available for sale at the market.\n            Textbook management is most effective if it takes into\n            account the printing strengths of the local private sector,\n            and the community school associations. Though in other\n            countries enrollments in agricultural schools tend to be low\n            and labor linkages weak, in Niger there is a demand for the\n            skills provided. Bank investments of earlier decades in\n            agricultural education may continue to provide skills\n            relevant to the economy, if policy dialogue is focused\n            toward modernizing courses, generating income to schools,\n            and catering to the populations likely to be interested in\n            agricultural training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - First
