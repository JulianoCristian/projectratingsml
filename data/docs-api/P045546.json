The\n            main lessons from these credits suggest: 1) Upon the need to\n            drastically reduce the scope of a quick-disbursement\n            operation, given practical and political difficulties, this\n            should provide the opportunity for an operation\n            reassessment, in particular the credit amount, to ensure\n            that a relationship remain between that amount and the\n            policy adjustments being supported. 2) Providing general\n            budget support under circumstances where there is virtually\n            no auditing of, or accountability for government\n            expenditures, is unwise, particularly in the absence of a\n            strong, monitorable agreement with the borrower on the use\n            of those funds. 3) Providing budget support, in light of\n            major tax evasion and excessive government expenditures, can\n            be potentially counter-productive, in the absence of an\n            agreed, concerted direct attack on those elements. The\n            presence of budget support reduces the natural pressure on\n            governments to take urgent and meaningful action. 4) In a\n            situation where there is no clear borrower commitment to a\n            course of action, or there is a history of back-tracking or\n            non-implementation of laws and regulations, the mere passage\n            of legislation is not usually a good basis for tranche\n            release conditionality. There also needs to be a period of\n            implementation or, better still, conditionality based on\n            actual results achieved. Given a long, complicated reform\n            agenda, careful sequencing of operations is required. This\n            was the case for PFSAC and PFSAC2, to be followed by the\n            proposed Economic Management SAC; and for SOSAC, to be\n            followed by the proposed SOSAC2, examples of good practice.\n            In contrast, there was no immediate follow-up to TAC,\n            compounding its poor design as a one-tranche operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -

Lessons\n            drawn from the project follow. 1) In the absence of strong\n            governance, and consensus, the design, and sequencing of\n            policy conditions needs particular attention, which together\n            with realistic reform targets, would allow for the\n            implementation of even an ambitious program, as in this\n            case, whose public finance reform encompassed a very large\n            work program. 2) The participatory approach not only helped\n            in achieving consensus across governments, and among\n            Government's own entities, but fostered ownership\n            through working groups arrangements as part of the project\n            process, and facilitated reform in state financing, budget,\n            and debt management. 3) The absence of an accompanying\n            technical assistance project, could have precluded progress\n            on institutional building for policy reform, but\n            availability of donor financing, and the design of the\n            public finance reform program as two sequential operations,\n            with supportive grants, provided the required technical\n            assistance continuity to move forward. 4) The fragmented\n            governance, and extremely weak institutional capacity,\n            particular of a country emerging from conflict, benefited\n            from the broadly focused, and intensive supervision, and\n            monitoring, but particularly targeted on\n            institution/capacity building."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Public Finance\n            Structural Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Public\n
