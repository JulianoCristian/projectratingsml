Project objectives were to enhance the\n            contribution of the SSEsto industrial development through\n            the modernization and expansion of SSE production by(a)\n            facilitating the access of SSEs to formal credit, (b)\n            promoting lending to SSEs by participating financial\n            intermediaries (PFIs), (c) providing more focused and\n            integrated technical and managerial assistance to eligible\n            SSEs and reinforcing coordination among TA providers, and,\n            (d) further strengthening the management and technical\n            skills of PFIs that provide credit to SSEs. The\n            implementation and outcome of the project is evaluated to be\n            Partially Satisfactory in this report. The TA aspects of the\n            project were partially successful. Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory in some aspects of the loan, but deficient in\n            the management of Development Fund for Small Scale\n            Enterprises and Artisans (FOPINAR)'s financial\n            condition. The key lessons learned in this project include:\n            1) Apex financial institutions need to appraise the\n            financial capacity of PFIs not just at the start of the\n            project, but to develop capacity to monitor this continually\n            making revisions to the eligibility list as needed; 2) The\n            principles of transparency and accountability that\n            necessitated the creation of a separate fund (FOPINAR) for\n            project implementation need to be reiterated continually by\n            the Bank; 3) Bank supervision should have been much more\n            effective in monitoring the financial performance and\n            accounting practices; 4) TA interventions should be well\n            articulated, demand driven and lodged in an agency with a\n            clear mandate for providing TA services; 5)  Caps on margins\n            charged by the PFIs can be counterproductive; and 6) A good\n            evaluation system requires more than a monitoring database."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Fourth Small-Scale Enterprise Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ecuador - Fourth Small-Scale\n            Enterprise

To achieve these objectives,\n            the project will comprise: (a) a credit component to finance\n            SSE fixed assets, permanent working capital and subproject\n            related
