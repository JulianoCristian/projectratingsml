Salient lessons point at the\n            structure of public-private partnerships (PPP) in India,\n            where the transfer of construction and operating risks to\n            the private sector, succeeded in creating a competitive,\n            infrastructure capacity, achieved through comprehensive\n            concession arrangements. To this end, inherent political,\n            commercial, and financing risks were overcome through\n            compensation in the event of nationalization, by assuring\n            returns even at low traffic volumes, if needed through\n            contract extension, and, guaranteeing to meet cost overruns,\n            respectively. Most importantly, the proactive PPP approach\n            was a defining factor in accelerating reforms, while risks\n            proved to be important bottlenecks, much more so than the\n            lack of appropriate financing, though further support should\n            prod further reforms to improve operating conditions, and\n            concession frameworks. Nonetheless, the acceptance of\n            different risk allocations in India, still needs to be\n            explored. As for the pace of subproject preparation, though\n            initially envisaged to be a year period, in practice it took\n            over five years each to reach financial close. Thus, while\n            some shortening in the preparation cycle is still expected,\n            complementing enhanced human capacity in the public sector\n            could be the key, which would also include the bidding\n            cycle. Also, weaknesses in the traffic and revenue\n            projections needs to be revisited."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Private Infrastructure Finance
