knowledge and expertise to the local counterparts; (e) avoid\n            the project-by-project approach in the highways sector\n            without a broad policy statement; (f) use Bank remedies,\n            such as suspension, for Borrower compliance of covenants;\n            (g) have all donors review annual programs in a sector round\n            table as is done under the Transport Sector
