The conflict has also\n            resulted in the deportation of Ethiopians from Eritrea. The\n            internally displaced people (IDPs) and deportees have lost\n            their means of livelihood. Furthermore, many households in\n            the country including in Tigray, Amhara and Afar Regional\n            states have lost their breadwinners following the border\n            conflict. With recent comprehensive Peace Initiative between\n            Ethiopia and Eritrea, an Emergency Recovery Program (ERP)\n            has been initiated which is aimed at rehabilitating the war\n            affected population of the country. Environmental impacts\n            such as environmental degradation is a concern in northern\n            Ethiopia, especially in Tigray Region. Deforestation and\n            soil erosion are the major cause for land degradation and\n            poor agricultural performance. Some efforts are underway to\n            combat the environment degradation in the region. Some of\n            the efforts include terracing and area enclosures. The case\n            of Afar is different regarding environmental issues and is\n            related to stocking rate and the land carrying capacity.\n            Further research will be generally needed to draw\n            conclusions whether the land carrying capacity and the\n            stocking rates are compatible or not. The environmental\n            risks associated with housing reconstruction for IDPs could\n            be improper site selection, and drainage and sanitary\n            problems over use of local materials that can cause\n            deforestation, and lack of proper design and necessary\n            structure. However, almost all the reconstruction activities\n            are small scale and will be executed in already developed\n            areas. In addition, there is a shift in Tigray from the\n            traditional beam and earth packed roofing to a new type\n            which is replaced by corrugated iron sheet roof covering,\n            and this shift in using construction materials reduces the\n            concern of adverse environmental impacts. Moreover, the IDPs\n            will be fully involved in all steps of the reconstruction\n            activities from planning to completion of the reconstruction."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Emergency Recovery and\n            Rehabilitation Project : Environmental Assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Emergency Recovery and\n            Rehabilitation Project : Environmental Assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/05/2388823/ethiopia-emergency-recovery-rehabilitation-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"ET-Emergency Recovery And Rehab.

In\n            addition, reallocations from existing International\n            Development Association (IDA) credits, will finance other\n            elements of the program, including household rehabilitation\n            in Afar, community infrastructure rehabilitation, HIV/AIDS\n            prevention, care and support, and,\n            rehabilitation/improvement of power supply infrastructure.\n            The main expected benefit of the program will be to mitigate\n            the consequences of the ongoing humanitarian crisis, by\n            providing assistance to the war-affected people in\n            rebuilding their lives, and resume productive economic\n            activities, as well as to lay the basis for long-term\n            recovery, through infrastructure rehabilitation.\n            Nonetheless, the resumption of hostilities is the major\n            external risk, while project specific risks are linked to\n            weak implementation capacity. The credit will be disbursed\n            by December 31, 2003, and, retroactive financing - up to a\n            certain amount - has been approved for expenditures made\n            after June 18, 2000."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Emergency Recovery Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Emergency Recovery Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/11/717514/ethiopia-emergency-recovery-project","projn":"ET-Emergency Recovery And Rehab.
