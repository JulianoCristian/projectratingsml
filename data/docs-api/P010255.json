The project only partially achieved its\n            objectives, its impact on institutional development was\n            negligible, sustainability is unlikely, and the performance\n            of both the Bank and Borrower was less than satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First,\n            successor projects should not be launched before proper\n            assessment of on-going similar projects. Second, the design\n            of investment credits for CSI, especially in countries like\n            Nepal with underdeveloped financial and industrial sectors\n            and limited implementation capacity, should be kept simple\n            with clear and focused objectives. Third, creating new\n            agencies to bypass existing inefficient units often causes\n            duplication and overlapping of activities. Fourth,\n            innovative concepts, such as \"project-based\n            lending\", should be introduced in a project only after\n            that the essential ingredients required for successful\n            implementation are in place. Fifth, the risks of CSI lending\n            in a poor credit environment should have been minimized\n            through an effective management information system in the\n            PCIs. Sixth, key actions should have clear completion\n            schedules and their compliance within the deadline should be\n            strictly monitored. Finally, relying on studies alone in a\n            small project such as CSI-II was not an effective way to\n            encourage policy reform."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Second Cottage and Small Industries Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal -
