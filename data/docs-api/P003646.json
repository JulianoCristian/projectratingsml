Despite cancellation of most of the\n            loan amount, the project's key development objectives\n            were substantially achieved.   Some components were\n            cancelled including: steel plant restructuring and\n            relocation; line-of-credit component; and surplus labor\n            re-employment support.  Lessons Learned were in the areas of\n            Bank procedures and covenants as well as procurement.\n            Lengthy Bank preparation and appraisal procedures, entailing\n            project preparation studies and determining the feasibility\n            of sub-borrowers, are not appropriate for projects in\n            dynamic sectors such as industry, especially for economies\n            in transition.  Also, sub-borrowers under intense\n            competitive pressure are less likely to be able to meet\n            financial covenants.  While assurance is needed that the\n            sub-borrowers are creditworthy and have a satisfactory\n            business plan, financing terms ought to be responsive to\n            changing competitive conditions and product market dynamics.\n            Requiring sub-borrowers to assume the foreign exchange risk\n            burdens them, especially if the sub-borrower is unable to\n            hedge against such a risk, particularly in China.\n            Procurement was delayed due to: (a) lack of sufficient\n            understanding by the Borrower and its agencies of Bank\n            procurement procedures; and (b) the Chongqing Environmental\n            Protection Bureau's (CEPB's) nebulous internal\n            procedures for reviewing and approving bid documents."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Chongqing Industrial Pollution\n            Control and Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Chongqing Industrial\n            Pollution

Moreover, the\n            project supports the government of China's efforts to\n            help relatively underdeveloped regions in the interior catch\n            up with the country's faster growing coastal areas. To\n            achieve these objectives, the project will help Chongqing\n            municipality (CM) to: 1) achieve a significant reduction in\n            pollution and restructure productive facilities from its\n            most polluting industry, iron and steel; 2) establish a\n            strategy and prepare a long-term plan to achieve a major\n            reduction in pollution for the whole industrial sector by,\n            inter alia, increasing the effectiveness of CM's\n            environmental regulatory framework and pollution management\n            capability; and 3) initiate a pilot effort to assist\n            industrial enterprises in other industrial sectors to\n            restructure their productive facilities, control pollution\n            and transform themselves into modern corporations. The\n            project will include the following components: 1) support\n            for development and implementation of economic and\n            environmental policy agendas and action plans; 2) relocation\n            of the city's two major polluting steel mills; 3)\n            restructuring of advisory facilities for industrial\n            enterprises; 4) a line of credit to support a pilot program\n            in industrial enterprise reform, pollution control and\n            restructuring; and 5) technical assistance to strengthen\n            environmental regulation, surplus

   (CSSC) is located in a very densely populated area in the\n            city of Chongqing in Sichuan Province.  The steel making\n            facilities are a major source of air and water pollution and\n            are scheduled to be shutdown in 1996-1998.  As part of the\n            Chongqing Industrial Reform and Pollution Control Project, a\n            modern steelmaking plant capable of complying with accepted\n            environmental standards will be constructed.  The project is\n            composed of production and supplementary equipment which\n            include scrap processing, electric furnace steelmaking,\n            refining furnace, continuous casting, steel slag processing\n            and oxygen station, boiler station, compressed air station\n            and water processing.  The pollution sources produced by the\n            new facilities are waste gas, waste water, solid waste, air\n            power and machine noises.  This report is an environmental\n            assessment of the project.  Its environmental impacts\n            include impacts on the ecological and social environment,\n            and living quality.  The impacts may be caused by site\n            selection, potential accidents, activities during the\n            construction period, and normal operation of the new\n            facilities.  The results of the environmental impact\n            assessment show that: 1) the new facilities will have a\n            slight effect on air quality at any location; and 2) when\n            the existing plant is shutdown, air quality in the area near\n            the plant will be significantly improved by decreased\n            concentrations of Nox, SO2 and TPS."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China
