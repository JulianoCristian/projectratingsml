Lessons from\n            implementation of the project are suggested as follows.\n            Transferring governance authority to water user associations\n            improves water allocation decisions, the prioritization of\n            maintenance works, and the design and quality of\n            construction, suggesting user-focused financial\n            arrangements, where irrigation fees are collected from, and\n            managed by farmers, are the key to long-run financial\n            sustainability and accountability. In addition, long-term\n            commitment to reform agenda, where components with continued\n            government support is crucial, there is the need to devise\n            modes of engagement to keep government policy on agreed\n            trajectories, especially in the face of short-term\n            considerations. More realistic assessments of the risk of\n            loss of political momentum need to be factored into project\n            design. Recently issued government regulations and\n            ministerial decrees, provide a more credible framework for\n            the design of medium- to long-term intervention strategies.\n            Effective water resources management is best undertaken\n            within a river basin framework that: (a) takes account of\n            all water users ensuring efficient allocation; (b)\n            integrates irrigation development with land-use planning;\n            (c) pays attention to environmental aspects of water use,\n            including up-stream water management and water quality; and,\n            (d) undertakes integrated reform of government and farmer\n            irrigation institutions. Project experience shows that\n            ensuring success of this process of inter-connected reforms,\n            requires adequate ground work at the design stage, and\n            adherence to the required sequence of reforms during the\n            implementation stage. Other lessons suggest launching\n            scaled-up versions of pilot, or small-scale schemes, and,\n            projects which involve physical investments as well as\n            policy, process and institutional reforms, the nature of\n            outcome/output should be better defined, with quantitative\n            indicators tied to objectives, and a monitoring and\n            evaluation program that includes a base-line survey, and\n            independent qualitative assessments of major outputs during\n            implementation, and on completion."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -

     irrigation schemes; 4) irrigation rehabilitation, expansion\n            and upgrading, and remedial works; 5) introduction of\n            sustainable, efficient operation and maintenance to avoid\n            the need for repeat rehabilitation; and 6) the expansion of\n            Irrigation Service Fees to schemes above 500 ha in size in\n            all remaining areas of Java to establish user-pays systems\n            and support operation and maintenance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Java Irrigation Improvement and\n            Water Resources Management
