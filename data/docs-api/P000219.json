Lessons\n            convey that the Bank was overly optimistic regarding the\n            speed at which change would take place in the Burundi\n            environment, and, evidence suggests that privatization\n            programs, could greatly benefit during implementation from\n            the experience of a private sector organization, or merchant\n            bank, ensuring commitment, and an objective decision-making,\n            based on sound economic principles. Furthermore,\n            implementation delays could have been avoided, had the Bank,\n            at appraisal, agreed with the Government on key issues\n            raised in the previous operation; for although, the\n            launching of the project might have been delayed, on\n            balance, it could have led to a satisfactory outcome.\n            Alternatively, had agreement not been reached, a less\n            ambitious project design could have been implemented, even\n            if results provided only modest resource transfers to the\n            sector. It is suggested that a performance contract between\n            the Government, and a government-owned power utility, is not\n            effective for improving operational, and financial\n            performance, since it is not conducive to reduce the role,\n            and monopoly status of a public utility, and certainly not\n            to increase private sector participation. Realistic\n            assessment of the country-related risks, should be included\n            in the project design, and appraisal."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Energy Sector Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi -

management of energy resources. Specifically, the\n            project aims to: (1) develop efficient institutions in the\n            sector and improve the quality of public investment; (2)\n            improve the efficiency in the use of energy resources\n            through reforms in the pricing structure of electricity,\n            petroleum products and woodfuels; (3) expand the access of\n            the population to electricity; and (4) reduce negative\n            environmental effects for the use of energy through the\n            execution of charcoal efficiency and improved stoves\n            program.  The project has two main components: institutional\n            reform and small investments in biomass, household energy\n            and power.  The credit will support: (a) institutional\n            strengthening of the Directorate of Energy and the\n            Directorate of Water Resources and Rural Energies; (b) a\n            rehabilitation program for Regie de distribution d'eau\n            et d'electricite (REGIDESO); (c) feasibility studies\n            for selected hydropower plants and an update of the Power\n            Sector Master Plan; (d) a charcoal efficiency program to\n            disseminate improved techniques of production and sensitize\n            charcoalers to the issue of deforestation; (e) an improved\n            charcoal stoves program; (f) a household energy survey and a\n            study of peat substitution; (g) a Master Plan for rural\n            electrification; (h) extensions and new connections for the\n            distribution system; and (i) improvements in the\n            transmission system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Energy Sector Rehabilitation
