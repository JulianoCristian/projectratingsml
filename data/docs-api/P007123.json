Both World\n            Bank and Borrower performances are adjudged satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned include the following: To the degree lenders\n            do not identify all affected groups and work with them to\n            see the \"win-win\" aspects of such projects as this\n            one, success may be limited. In the early phase of this\n            project, there were several instances of both central-local\n            and intra-local conflicts related to this problem. It should\n            be made clear that revenue-sharing practices is not a goal\n            in decentralization and municipal development projects; few\n            sub-national entities can totally survive on their own\n            resources. National contracting issues had to be addressed\n            at the project level which lowered considerably the\n            probability of success. Use of revenue-sharing funds as\n            sub-loan guarantees is a good device for first-generation\n            municipal lending operations; however, sub-national\n            borrowers and lenders need to quickly move to instruments\n            which more closely link investments with their associated\n            costs, benefits, and risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Municipal Development and Urban\n            Infrastructure Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ecuador - Municipal Development\n            and Urban Infrastructure Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/04/728862/ecuador-municipal-development-urban-infrastructure-project","projn":"EC-Munic Dev I -- P007123","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Public Sector Economics,Urban Governance and Management,Municipal Financial Management,Regional Governance","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Ecuador","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00060205382593"},"subsc":"Sub-national government administration,Central government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"assets,audits,autonomy,Bank\n            Performance,Banks,borrowing,cadastres,capital\n            expenditures,commercial credit,Community Based\n            Organizations,community participation,contracting\n            procedures,contractors,current\n            expenditures,debt,Decentralization,EXCHANGE RATES,FISCAL\n            YEAR,Income,Income Statements,inflation,Institutional\n            Development,liquidity,loan guarantees,Local Government,local\n            governments,local laws,local officials,local\n            revenue,mayors,Municipal Administration,municipal\n            debt,Municipal Development,municipal elections,municipal\n            employees,municipal finance,municipal governments,municipal\n            investments,municipal officials,municipal\n            performance,municipal\n            services,Municipalities,municipality,national\n            budget,national governments,operating costs,Private\n            Sector,private sector\n            participation,privatization,provinces,public\n            enterprises,public sector,public sector deficit,public\n            works,recapitalization,reform programs,resource\n            allocation,Revenue Sharing,solid waste\n            management,subsidiary,Technical Assistance,trade\n            unions,Trust Funds,urban areas,urban development,urban\n            growth,Urban Infrastructure,urban poor,urbanization"},"1":{"cdata!":"assets,audits,autonomy,Bank\n            Performance,Banks,borrowing,cadastres,capital\n            expenditures,commercial credit,Community Based\n            Organizations,community participation,contracting\n            procedures,contractors,current\n            expenditures,debt,Decentralization,EXCHANGE RATES,FISCAL\n            YEAR,Income,Income Statements,inflation,Institutional\n            Development,liquidity,loan guarantees,Local Government,local\n            governments,local laws,local officials,local\n            revenue,mayors,Municipal Administration,municipal\n            debt,Municipal Development,municipal elections,municipal\n            employees,municipal finance,municipal governments,municipal\n            investments,municipal officials,municipal\n            performance,municipal\n            services,Municipalities,municipality,national\n            budget,national governments,operating costs,Private\n            Sector,private sector\n            participation,privatization,provinces,public\n            enterprises,public sector,public sector deficit,public\n            works,recapitalization,reform programs,resource\n            allocation,Revenue Sharing,solid waste\n            management,subsidiary,Technical Assistance,trade\n            unions,Trust Funds,urban areas,urban development,urban\n            growth,Urban Infrastructure,urban poor,urbanization"}},"owner":"Urban (LCSUW)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF021070-SWEDISH (SIDA) CONSULTANTS\n            TRUST FUND,TF020015-PAKISTANI CONSULTANT TRUST FUND,TF037599-LATIN AMERICA REGION - EL\n            NINIO, PMD II, URB.
