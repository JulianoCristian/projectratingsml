Some lessons learned includes: sustained\n            political commitment at higher levels, together with the\n            allocation of domestic resources, is essential to mobilize\n            and effectively engage development partners in conflict\n            prone settings like Cote d'Ivoire. Rapid project\n            implementation was assisted by taking advantage of the\n            project preparation period to identify key implementation\n            requirements and initiate required activities such as\n            recruitment of implementing agencies, procurement of goods.\n            Close monitoring of the project toward the achievement of\n            project development objectives using a simplified and\n            well-designed Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system is\n            essential. This will help for regular monitoring of progress\n            and analysis of implementation challenges for timely\n            implementation of corrective measures. The use of local\n            Non-Governmental Organization's (NGO's) to deliver\n            HIV/AIDS prevention services was commendable. This service\n            delivery modality could be applied to the provision of other\n            services, especially for client groups where the use of\n            public service providers is problematic. In the context of\n            post conflict and fragile situation where large parts of the\n            population are prone to displacement and economic\n            precariousness, the usual landscape of commercial sex work changes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - Emergency Multi-Sector\n            HIV/AlDS Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cote d'Ivoire - Emergency\n
