Both World\n            Bank and Borrower performances are rated satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned include: It is essential to obtain an\n            independent assessment of the extent of the damages and an\n            estimate of the costs involved without relying on figures\n            provided by inspectors from the housing ministry. Solidarity\n            among people affected by an earthquake--or a major\n            catastrophe--should not be minimized, but rather supported\n            in the project definition. It played a major role in\n            reducing by half the number of temporary shelters that had\n            to be erected and in helping people who used to live in\n            isolated farmhouses resettle in villages where the risk of\n            landslides following an earthquake is minimized. The\n            director of the project implementation unit and his staff\n            should be thoroughly familiar with Bank procurement and\n            disbursement procedures before project launching. In the\n            case of emergency operations, more flexible disbursement\n            procedures are needed. The Bank should make it a standard\n            practice to agree to the audit terms of reference at the\n            project's outset. Most project design and supervision\n            activities should have been awarded to private consulting\n            firms; this may have produced solutions more appropriate to\n            the special needs of the population. If for security\n            reasons, supervision teams cannot make site visits, the Bank\n            should consider suspending disbursements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Mascara Emergency

affected by the earthquake that struck a\n            mountainous area known as Beni Chougrane in the Province of\n            Mascara on August 18, 1994. The project aims at rebuilding\n            the economic, social, and physical assets that were\n            destroyed by the earthquake, with a view to restoring\n            essential facilities and services in the shortest possible\n            time. The project will include the reconstruction and\n            repairs to facilities in the following sectors: a) in\n            education; b) in housing; c) in agriculture; d) in public\n            health; e) in roads; f) in water supply and sewerage; g) in\n            earthquake hazard reduction and prevention; and h) in social\n            rehabilitation. The project will address the\n            population's social and environmental concerns that\n            have surfaced in the aftermath of the earthquake. Particular\n            attention will be paid to the needs of women and children.\n            The project will also have a major impact on the\n            environment. Through rebuilding of the area, the quality of\n            the environment will greatly improve, as more structurally\n            sound and functional houses will be provided to the\n            population, accompanied by good access roads, and better\n            water supply and sewerage services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Emergency Reconstruction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria - Emergency\n            Reconstruction Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/11/732797/algeria-emergency-reconstruction-project","projn":"DZ-Mascara Emerg.Recons -- P038695","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Public Sector Economics,Banks & Banking Reform,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Algeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961007131610"},"subsc":"Housing construction,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,Roads and highways,Other social services,Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adequate water,adequate water\n            resources,adequate water supply,adjustment\n            lending,Agricultural production,conditionality,Cost\n            recovery,cubic meter,cubic meters,debt,debt\n            service,disasters,economic activity,economic\n            development,economic recovery,economic reform,economic\n            situation,economic stability,elderly people,environmental\n            amenities,EXCHANGE\n            RATE,exercises,Expenditures,exploitation,families,foreign\n            exchange,high\n            unemployment,hospitals,Housing,income,information\n            dissemination,Institutional development,interest\n            rates,intervention,Islamic Development Bank,London\n            Club,macroeconomic\n            stabilization,maturities,medicines,operators of water\n            supply,Potable water,Potable water supply,private\n            sector,privatization,provisions,public enterprises,Public\n            Health,public services,Public\n            Works,recycling,roads,safety,schools,sewer networks,sewerage\n            services,towns,Unemployment,victims,water quality,water\n            supply systems"},"1":{"cdata!":"adequate water,adequate water\n            resources,adequate water supply,adjustment\n            lending,Agricultural production,conditionality,Cost\n            recovery,cubic meter,cubic meters,debt,debt\n            service,disasters,economic activity,economic\n            development,economic recovery,economic reform,economic\n            situation,economic stability,elderly people,environmental\n            amenities,EXCHANGE\n            RATE,exercises,Expenditures,exploitation,families,foreign\n            exchange,high\n            unemployment,hospitals,Housing,income,information\n            dissemination,Institutional development,interest\n            rates,intervention,Islamic Development Bank,London\n            Club,macroeconomic\n            stabilization,maturities,medicines,operators of water\n            supply,Potable water,Potable water supply,private\n            sector,privatization,provisions,public enterprises,Public\n            Health,public services,Public\n            Works,recycling,roads,safety,schools,sewer networks,sewerage\n            services,towns,Unemployment,victims,water quality,water\n            supply systems"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"P6455"},"facets":{}}}
