ENDE was visited by twelve Bank Missions\n            between 1985 and 1993. IDA officials widely cooperated with\n            the executing agency in the Project appraisal,\n            implementation and supervision, and through the prompt\n            execution of Credit administration and procurement\n            procedures. During project execution, ENDE and particularly\n            the project unit received valuable and timely collaboration\n            from Bank officials from different areas. Such cooperation\n            was instrumental for the adequate completion of works and\n            credit management so that project objectives were\n            successfully reached. Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the efficacy of\n            staffing the PEU with qualified personnel and maintaining\n            personnel continuity throughout Project implementation, the\n            cost savings from using Credit funds to pay foreign\n            suppliers directly rather than through letters of credit;\n            the reduction of potential risks by the requirement to\n            conduct environmental studies at various execution stages of\n            each project component; and the development of information\n            management systems is not only essential for modern and\n            effective enterprise management, it also becomes crucial to\n            enable eventual institutional changes, such as privatization\n            of public enterprises."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia -
