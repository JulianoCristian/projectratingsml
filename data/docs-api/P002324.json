This would be done within\n            the period of the contract plan signed by SAED and the\n            Government, which will end on June 30, 1987. In support of\n            these objectives, the project would include the following\n            components: (i) five studies to prepare and facilitate\n            SAED's disengagement process; (ii) urgent maintenance\n            works which have been postponed for lack of funds in spite\n            of safety risks; (iii) financing SAED's public service\n            activities; (iv) financing those of SAED's operational\n            expenses that deal with production-related activities during\n            a transitional period while the disengagement process is\n            taking place. In addition, funds would be allocated to\n            finance credit to former staff of rural development\n            companies to help them set up their own businesses."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal
