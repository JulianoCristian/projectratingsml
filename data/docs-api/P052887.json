Lessons\n            convey that while the project estimated the risk of not\n            continuing the reforms as \"moderate\", it provided\n            relatively little technical and financial support for\n            pursuing the reforms, in fact, very few of the legal and\n            regulatory texts cited in the Appraisal Report ever became\n            operational, and, of particular importance was the\n            insufficient project preparation to follow-up on the PNAC -\n            Pharmacie Nationale Approvisionnement des Comores - and to\n            develop modalities for ensuring services for the poor. The\n            risk should probably have been considered\n            \"substantial\" at minimum, and appropriate measures\n            should have been included, to ensure continued support and\n            monitoring during implementation.
