Major lessons o f general applicability are\n            conveyed as follows. When pressures to maintain a Client\n            current on the service of its external debt, have a major\n            impact on lending decisions, it is incumbent upon Management\n            to discuss these pressures, and any impact they had on the\n            timing, content, and size of a proposed operation with the\n            Board at the time of loan presentation. \"Stroke of the\n            pen\" measures are an unreliable indicator of Borrower\n            commitment to undertaking deeper structural reform. Uneven\n            macroeconomic performance sharply reduces the expected\n            long-term benefits of structural reform, and cripples the\n            prospects for private sector-led growth. Efforts to\n            diversify Zambia's production base have not succeeded,\n            in part because non-price constraints, such as poor\n            infrastructure, weak governance, and public

           Adjustment Credit (ESAC II). The objective of the project\n            was to support Zambia's economic reform program and to\n            aid in the reduction of poverty by promoting broad-based,\n            private sector-led growth and improving the delivery of\n            vital social services. Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (i) adjustment for\n            low income countries, especially those facing external\n            shocks like Zambia, is a long and arduous process; (ii)\n            future operations should aim at fewer, and probably more\n            critical, conditions, particularly in an election period;\n            (iii) it may be important in adjustment operations such as\n            ESAC II to identify at the design stage the likely\n            implementation bottlenecks and to provide, for instance\n            through a Technical Assistance loan, the resources needed to\n            help enhance implementation capacity of the government; (iv)\n            The nature of Non Govermental Organizations (NGOs) as a\n            heterogeneous group and the complexity of the government and\n            NGO relationship make it difficult for adjustment lending to\n            be an effective instrument for dealing with government and\n            NGO issues; and (v) Future International Development\n            Association (IDA) operations will have to give more\n            attention to issues of budgetary planning and management if\n            expenditures for social programs are to be protected."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - Second Economic and Social\n

The staff said that the credit\n            was part of the Bank's support for Zambia's\n            program of rapid liberalization and extensive privatization\n            to stimulate private sector led growth coupled with\n            increased attention to social services and other direct\n            poverty alleviation measures. In view of the uncertain\n            macroeconomic environment, effectiveness and disbursement\n            will take place when evidence of strong macroeconomic policy\n            implementation was available. This will be accomplished by\n            sending Bank staff with the August International Monetary\n            Fund (IMF) mission to examine end-June performance against\n            fund targets, progress in structural reform, and prospects\n            for continued strong performance. As explained in an\n            updating note distributed the previous week, determination\n            on the effectiveness condition will be based on the findings\n            of the mission. The Bank will also increase efforts to renew\n            the dialogue between the Government and bilateral with the\n            hope of a resumption of bilateral financing and allowing a\n            sustainable reform program to be maintained. With respect to\n            the credit itself, the staff said that it focused on some\n            new areas of emphasis, namely procurement reform and\n            informal urban settlements, and followed up on some\n            continuing issues such as the privatization of the national\n            copper company (ZCCM). The Government had already taken\n            strong action in these and other areas, including increasing\n            the administrative efficiency of the sale and transfer of\n            leaseholds, tariff reductions, and spending in the social sectors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Summary of discussion at the meeting of the\n            Executive Directors of the Bank and IDA, followed by a\n            meeting of the Board of Directors of IFC.
