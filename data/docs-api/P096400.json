Some lessons learned included:\n            creating a formal project identity for regional engagements\n            will enhance visibility and accountability within the Bank\n            for operations involving complex regional dialogue and\n            structures. As there is no formal lending relationship\n            underpinning the energy community dialogue between the Bank\n            and regional apex institutions, there is no formal project\n            identity, budgeting and direct accountability within the\n            formal Bank system for effective regional dialogue.\n            Fortunately this does not appear to have been a serious\n            problem to date, given steady and strong management support\n            and continuity in staffing assignments. Upfront approval of\n            an APL facility can help solidify both Bank and client\n            commitment and cooperation around a sectoral or regional\n            agenda. While the APL instrument offered little streamlining\n            in processing of individual operations, the upfront approval\n            of the US$ 1 billion APL facility provided strong evidence\n            of Bank commitment and helped increase the credibility of\n            the energy community ahead of the signing and effectiveness\n            of the treaty."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -
