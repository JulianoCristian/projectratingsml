2)\n            Better coordination and linkages are needed between projects\n            and within the rural sector as a whole; 3) Development of a\n            competitive fertilizer market requires actions beyond\n            \"Market Liberalization\"; 4) Reliance on the public\n            sector for input supply may create not only market\n            inefficiencies but also a shortage of inputs; 5)\n            Institutional structures and processes can restrict private\n            sector participation; 6) A one-size-fits-all agricultural\n            extension system has limited impact; and 7) A\n            strategy-focused program requires performance indicators,\n            monitoring, and an adaptive approach, reflecting the\n            strategic objectives and outcomes relative to these objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Seeds Systems Development Project\n            and National Fertilizer Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Seeds Systems\n            Development Project and National Fertilizer Sector Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/06/8466796/ethiopia-seeds-systems-development-project-national-fertilizer-sector-project","projn":"ET-National Fertilizer Sector Project -- P000753,ET-Seed System Development Project -- P000752","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Fertilizers,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Rural Development","count":"Ethiopia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20071010102931"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Petrochemicals and fertilizers,Central government administration,Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, agricultural colleges,\n            agricultural development, Agricultural Extension,\n            agricultural inputs, agricultural practices, agricultural\n            production, Agricultural Productivity, Agricultural\n            Research, agricultural ~ productivity, Agriculture,\n            agronomic practices, autonomy, barriers to entry, breeder\n            seed, business plans, Capacity Building, cereal yields,\n            cereals, coffee, coffee processing, Commercial Bank,\n            Commercial Banks, commercialization, comparative analysis,\n            competitive markets, comprehensive strategy, cooperatives,\n            cost of capital, crop, crop diversification, Crops,\n            cultivation, decentralization, decision making,\n            deregulation, development strategy, donor agency, economic\n            performance, employment, entrepreneurship, equipment,\n            exports, extreme poverty, face value, farm, farm incomes,\n            farm productivity, Farmer, farmer incomes, farmers, farming,\n            farms, feasibility studies, FERTILIZER, fertilizer\n            application, Fertilizer Consumption, FERTILIZER DEVELOPMENT,\n            fertilizer distribution, fertilizer imports, Fertilizer\n            Industry, Fertilizer Market, fertilizer prices, Fertilizer\n            Usage, Fertilizer use, fertilizers, food security, foreign\n            exchange, fresh seed, GDP, government finance, growth\n            potential, IFPRI, Industrialization, Institutional\n            Development, interest rate, interest rates, laboratories,\n            Level Playing Field, livestock, maize, maize yields,\n            management information systems, market entry, Marketing,\n            monopoly, NGOs, opportunity cost, organizational structures,\n            peer review, phosphate, Plant Genetics, Plant Quarantine,\n            population growth, price controls, price subsidies, Private\n            Sector, private seed sector, privatization, produce,\n            production functions, productivity growth, public agencies,\n            quality seed, reduced expenditures, risk averse, Rural\n            Development, SEED, seed businesses, Seed Certification, Seed\n            Enterprise, Seed Industry, Seed Multiplication, seed\n            producers, Seed Production, seed testing, seed varieties,\n            seeds, soil fertility, Soil Testing, soils, Sorghum,\n            structural adjustment, technical assistance, transport,\n            Urea, Variety Release, Wheat, wholesale prices, yield\n            increase, Yields"}},"owner":"Knowledge and Information Servs. (IMTKI)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020400-NETHERLANDS' CONSULTANTS\n            TRUST FUND,TF028065-CANADIAN CONSLT.

Involvement of agricultural extension\n            agents in distribution and credit administration impeded\n            development of the private sector and undermined the longer\n            term function of extension. Financing fertilizer imports\n            through separately mechanisms of foreign exchange allocation\n            introduces inefficiencies in the fertilizer industry. There\n            is a need to move away from project based fertilizers\n            imports in favor of general foreign exchange management. In\n            a country that is highly susceptible to drought like\n            Ethiopia, use of fertilizer can accentuate the hardship\n            caused by insufficient precipitation, putting in peril large\n            numbers of farmers and the financial institutions that serve\n            them. It is important to adopt a holistic approach to input\n            market development and seek coverage in seeds availability\n            and fertilizers as one without the other cannot give optimal\n            returns. The grain market crash of 2001, and the resulting\n            hardship in credit repayments and the precipitous drop in\n            fertilizer consumption in 2002, clearly illustrate the\n            importance of focusing as much on agricultural input markets\n            as on output markets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia -

The project is expected to achieve this\n            objective by: a) supporting policy reform to create an\n            enabling environment for the growth of a competitive\n            fertilizer sector; b) supporting institutional strengthening\n            and human resource development; c) promoting increased,\n            efficient and environmentally safe use of fertilizers by the\n            largest possible number of farmers; d) addressing fertilizer\n            supply-side constraints; and e) promoting initiatives to\n            maintain and improve the long-term fertility of the\n            Ethiopian soils and ensuring environmental conservation. By\n            the end of the project period, it is envisaged that\n            Ethiopia's fertilizer sector would have moved from a\n            state controlled to a largely liberalized system with active\n            participation of private sector importers, distributors,\n            wholesalers and retailers in a progressively competitive\n            price and trade environment. This, in turn, is expected to\n            contribute significantly to enhanced food security at the\n            national and household levels, improved management of the\n            Ethiopian soils

accelerated and\n            sustainable growth in agricultural production and\n            productivity with a view to improving food security and\n            reducing poverty. The project is expected to achieve this\n            objective by: a) supporting policy reform to create an\n            enabling environment for the growth of a competitive\n            fertilizer sector; b) supporting institutional strengthening\n            and human resource development; c) promoting increased,\n            efficient and environmentally safe use of fertilizers by the\n            largest possible number of farmers; d) addressing fertilizer\n            supply-side constraints; and e) promoting initiatives to\n            maintain and improve the long-term fertility of the\n            Ethiopian soils and ensuring environmental conservation. By\n            the end of the project period, it is envisaged that\n            Ethiopia's fertilizer sector would have moved from a\n            state controlled to a largely liberalized system with active\n            participation of private sector importers, distributors,\n            wholesalers and retailers in a progressively competitive\n            price and trade environment. This, in turn, is expected to\n            contribute significantly to enhanced food security at the\n            national and household levels, improved management of the\n            Ethiopian soils and the strengthening of fertilizer related institutions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Transitional Government of Ethiopia -\n            National Fertilizer Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Transitional Government of\n            Ethiopia -
