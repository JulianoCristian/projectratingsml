The lessons learned indicate that most of the\n            lessons are common to almost every Bank project that has\n            been implemented without proper attention to technical\n            assistance and capacity building needs of the client. The\n            assumption of the project as national policy of Government,\n            and the direction of the project by high-ranking authorities\n            evidences the commitment of the Government in the execution\n            of the project. The suitable targeting and clarity in the\n            objectives of the project ensure its later completion. The\n            participation of the government staff is critic in the\n            design of the project. The training of the personnel who\n            would manage the coordination of the implementation of the\n            project is a key factor to improve the probabilities of\n            success. From the start, the team in charge of the\n            formulation of the project and the Project Coordination Unit\n            (PCU) staff should be trained on the theory and practice of\n            management of projects. When necessary, the execution of\n            activities referred to updating or creation of standards,\n            regulations, or laws should consider the difficulty of\n            bringing about their approval, because it depends on\n            agencies external to the institution. Infrastructure\n            investments should be defined by the client after complete\n            feasibility analysis. The flexible treatment of the\n            operation by the Bank team during the second phase was an\n            important factor to adapt the project to the new needs and\n            to the new political and social situations of the country\n            without having to interrupt its implementation. The\n            permanent evaluation of the performance of the unit and its\n            interaction with the Bank and senior government staff the\n            executors was a key factor. To execute a project related to\n            decentralization, it was essential to consult and to\n            interact more with the states, municipalities and\n            communities. The Bank team should have assisted in the\n            implementation of the evaluation systems of the project. The\n            incorporation of the Unit of Evaluation into the\n            organization chart of the PCU was essential to perform\n            control measures in the management, the results, and the\n            impact expected of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Venezuela -
