The fact that the Project\n            Coordination Unit (PCU) was located in Tamale, in the\n            Northern region, limited the capacity of the project team to\n            effectively exert political influence and lobby for its\n            interests. As a result, the component on the establishment\n            of a policy framework was the one that had more difficulties\n            in being implemented. One of the achievements of the project\n            is the establishment of two biological corridors between\n            Ghana and Burkina Faso to connect the two ecological blocks\n            of the two countries and allow free movement of wildlife\n            between these blocks. The creation of the corridors also\n            resulted in the signature of a memorandum of understanding\n            (MoU) between the two countries on the management of\n            transfrontier

to improve the\n            environment, livelihood, and conservation of natural\n            resources, including medicinal plants, by addressing\n            human-induced impacts on land, forest, and wildlife\n            resources. However, activities under various components may\n            lead to land degradation, deforestation, and\n            desertification, which are the most pervasive environmental,\n            and natural resources management issues in Ghana. Mitigation\n            measures include: 1) Community-based land use models should\n            be introduced to make optimal use in each pilot community,\n            by integrating modern technologies, with traditional local\n            experiences. As such, land, and water management can be\n            utilized to maximize agricultural savanna areas. 2)\n            Alternative livelihoods should be developed for the northern\n            savanna zone, to help create jobs, and opportunities for\n            cash income among the poorest rural groups, particularly\n            during the dry season. Thus, the promotion of gum Arabic\n            from Acacia Senegal would create commercial potential, while\n            the trees also provide forage, support honey production, and\n            the use of tannin, and, a baseline survey should identify\n            products of commercial value. 3) Vegetation propagation of\n            native species of plants should be encouraged for ecological\n            tolerance, resistance, and adaptation to the local\n            environment. 4) Bushfire control may affect biodiversity,\n            thus, an early burning regime may be introduced, but as a\n            first step towards a no burning regime."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Northern Savanna Biodiversity\n            Conservation Project : environmental
