For\n            the Matadi-Kinshasa railway the principal item comprises\n            track renewal and improvements, which will reduce delays to\n            trains and improve the utilization of rolling stock; for the\n            connecting Kinshasa-Ilebo river service the project will\n            provide additional barges; and for the ports there is a\n            feasibility study to extend their capacity as part of the\n            general expansion of the Voie Nationale. These port\n            extensions may be financed as a subsequent Bank Group\n            project. The economic return on the project is estimated at\n            28 percent on the basis of shadow pricing of foreign\n            exchange and local unskilled labor. This return takes\n            account of the benefits (to Zaire) of increased capacity on\n            the all-Zaire route to the sea, and of reduced operation\n            costs on this route as a

improvement in operational efficiency and thus to\n            expand the effective transport capacity of the Office\n            National des Transports (ONATRA, the Government agency\n            responsible for inland water services, the railway between\n            the ports of Matadi and Kinshasa, and their operation). For\n            the Matadi-Kinshasa railway the principal item comprises\n            track renewal and improvements, which will reduce delays to\n            trains and improve the utilization of rolling stock; for the\n            connecting Kinshasa-Ilebo river service the project will\n            provide additional barges; and for the ports there is a\n            feasibility study to extend their capacity as part of the\n            general expansion of the Voie Nationale. These port\n            extensions may be financed as a subsequent Bank Group\n            project. The economic return on the project is estimated at\n            28 percent on the basis of shadow pricing of foreign\n            exchange and local unskilled labor. This return takes\n            account of the benefits (to Zaire) of increased capacity on\n            the all-Zaire route to the sea, and of reduced operation\n            costs on this route as a result of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zaire - Projet de Transport Ferroviaire et Fluvial"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Za\u00efre \u2013 Projet de transport\n            ferroviaire et fluvial : Za\u00efre\u00a0- Projet de transport\n            ferroviaire et fluvial"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1975/05/11768655/zaire-railway-river-transport-project-zaire-projet-de-transport-ferroviaire-fluvial","projn":"ZR-Rail&River II -- P003021","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Railways Transport,Airports and Air Services,Roads & Highways,Transport and Trade Logistics","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Transport,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Congo, Democratic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20100210024503"},"subsc":"Ports, waterways and shipping","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Transport,Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Aids to navigation; Barges; Construction;\n            Engineering research; Experts; Marshalling yards; Ports;\n            Railway tracks; Railways; Rolling stock; Salvage; Staff\n            training; Water transport; Workshops,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Aids to navigation; Barges; Construction;\n            Engineering research; Experts; Marshalling yards; Ports;\n            Railway tracks; Railways; Rolling stock; Salvage; Staff\n            training; Water transport; Workshops,,"}},"owner":"WBOff:Kinshasa-CC2:DRC/CG(Braz) (AFCC2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"618","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Zaire - Projet de Transport Ferroviaire\n            et Fluvial"}}},"facets":{}}}
