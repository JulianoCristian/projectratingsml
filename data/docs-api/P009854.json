The objectives of the project were to: (a) augment\n            power supplies to the capital; (b) improve the reliability\n            of transmission and reduce system losses; (c) reduce\n            environmental pollution from power generation; (d) move\n            towards more efficient use of existing assets in the power\n            supply system; (e) identify economic opportunities for\n            improving the quality of coal use in power generation; and,\n            (f) effect a program of administrative, financial and\n            operational improvements in DESU.
