In\n            addition 2000 ha of woodlots would be established in\n            communes all over the country."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Second Forestry Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi - Second Forestry Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1985/05/741909/burundi-second-forestry-project","projn":"BI-Forestry Ii-114626 -- P000190","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"Burundi","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970625094959"},"subsc":"Forestry","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"afforestation,agricultural\n            crops,agricultural development,agricultural\n            inputs,agricultural production,agricultural\n            residues,Agriculture,Agroforestry,bananas,beans,budget\n            deficit,cash crops,cassava,coffee,coffee exports,coffee\n            prices,coffee production,consumer price\n            index,cooperatives,cost savings,cotton,crop,crop\n            development,crop production,crop\n            yields,cropping,crops,cultivation,cultivation\n            techniques,Debt,deforestation,devaluation,developed\n            countries,development projects,development strategy,donor\n            agencies,economic activity,economic development,Economic\n            growth,economic justification,Economic Rate of\n            Return,economic risk,economic situation,economic\n            structure,employment,energy resources,exploitation,export\n            crops,extension,extension services,farm,farm\n            systems,farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,farms,fertilizer,fisheries,fishing,Food crops,food\n            production,foodcrops,Forestry,forests,fuels,fuelwood,GDP,Government\n            regulations,grazing,Gross National\n            Product,groundnuts,ICRAF,imports,income,income\n            distribution,incomes,Industrialization,integrated rural\n            development,intercropping,interest rate,International Center\n            for Research in Agroforestry,international trade,investment\n            expenditures,labor force,land resources,land\n            use,Livestock,livestock development,living conditions,local authorities,"},"1":{"cdata!":"afforestation,agricultural\n            crops,agricultural development,agricultural\n            inputs,agricultural production,agricultural\n            residues,Agriculture,Agroforestry,bananas,beans,budget\n            deficit,cash crops,cassava,coffee,coffee exports,coffee\n            prices,coffee production,consumer price\n            index,cooperatives,cost savings,cotton,crop,crop\n            development,crop production,crop\n            yields,cropping,crops,cultivation,cultivation\n            techniques,Debt,deforestation,devaluation,developed\n            countries,development projects,development strategy,donor\n            agencies,economic activity,economic development,Economic\n            growth,economic justification,Economic Rate of\n            Return,economic risk,economic situation,economic\n            structure,employment,energy resources,exploitation,export\n            crops,extension,extension services,farm,farm\n            systems,farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,farms,fertilizer,fisheries,fishing,Food crops,food\n            production,foodcrops,Forestry,forests,fuels,fuelwood,GDP,Government\n            regulations,grazing,Gross National\n            Product,groundnuts,ICRAF,imports,income,income\n            distribution,incomes,Industrialization,integrated rural\n            development,intercropping,interest rate,International Center\n            for Research in Agroforestry,international trade,investment\n            expenditures,labor force,land resources,land\n            use,Livestock,livestock development,living conditions,local authorities,"}},"owner":"WBOff:Kinshasa-CC2:DRC/CG(Braz) (AFCC2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"P4105"},"facets":{}}}
