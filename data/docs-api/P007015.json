The\n            lessons learned indicate that agreeing on a flexible design\n            supports efforts by the Borrower and the Bank to take risks,\n            be innovative, and react proactively to events that can\n            affect achievement of development objectives during\n            implementation. Proper donor coordination ensures that\n            efforts are not duplicated while investments are leveraged,\n            it requires strong capacity from the Borrower's side.\n            Creating an independent core technical group can provide\n            continuity to project efforts, particularly in a context of\n            great political volatility, but can also undermine the\n            institutional capacity of the line Secretariat. The legal,\n            policy, and institutional instruments require adhesion of\n            key stakeholders to ensure sustainability of reform efforts.\n            The definition and implementation of a MIS should be done\n            jointly with the future users of that system.
