The lessons learned\n            indicate that timing is very important. The project came at\n            a time when the government was toying with the idea of\n            decentralization and people's participation for\n            community development, but did not know how to put it into\n            action. Timely availability of fund at the grass root level\n            is important for implementing sub-project activities. It is\n            important to be patient when working at community level,\n            where people lack knowledge and skills. Building their\n            capacity to improve skills and understand procedures is time\n            consuming. In a community development project, capacity\n            building should be given to district council and local\n            population upfront, so that they can start project\n            activities soon after effectiveness. When the Bank is\n            flexible, willing to take risks, and repose trust and\n            confidence on people at grass roots level, they become\n            empowered and capable of executing activities themselves\n            with sufficient cost effectiveness Government commitment and\n            ownership of the project were important factors in the\n            success of the project. The project also demonstrated that\n            with good governance, transparency, and willingness, the\n            government will be able to make incredible achievements.\n            Having a strong and efficient team with dedicated national\n            staff at Project Coordination and Monitoring Unit (PCMU)\n            level played a major role in the success of the project The\n            project demonstrated its relevance and applicability for the\n            country's socio-economic development"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Community Reintegration and\n            Development

    vulnerable groups through a process of community-based\n            reintegration and development; and b) strengthen the\n            capacity of local communities and the administration at the\n            communal and national levels for the implementation of\n            development projects. The project consists of four\n            components. First, community initiatives will enable each of\n            the participating community to receive funds for\n            infrastructure subprojects, income-generating subprojects,\n            and capacity building subprojects. Second, institution and\n            capacity building will finance participatory rural\n            appraisals and training activities to build local capacities\n            for sustainable, self-reliant development. The training\n            program will include: 1) participatory and rural appraisal\n            methods; 2) organizational management; 3) project\n            management; 4) financial management; and 5) environmental\n            awareness and training. The third component will finance\n            studies to deepen the understanding of the concept of\n            decentralization and participation. Fourth, project\n            coordination and monitoring will provide critical equipment,\n            materials and supplies to the Project Coordination and\n            Monitoring
