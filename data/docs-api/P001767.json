The Government's\n            ownership, and commitment to the reform program were key\n            factors to its highly satisfactory performance, and, the\n            satisfactory performance by the Bank, was reflected in the\n            design of the operation, built on lessons from previous\n            programs, based on a clearly defined reform agenda,\n            emphasizing trade liberalization, and enlargement of the\n            domestic revenue base. Lessons suggest the simultaneous\n            implementation of indirect tax reform, gradual trade\n            liberalization, and rationalization of import procedures,\n            protected the budget from a potential decline in revenue,\n            which could have endangered fiscal adjustment, at the same\n            time as it reduced distortions in the allocation of\n            resources, and supported a strong supply response. But the\n            combination of prudent fiscal, and monetary policies, the\n            favorable external environment, and foreign assistance,\n            resulted in strong GDP growth, low inflation, and high\n            private investment. Furthermore, the focused nature of the\n            operation, which concentrated on a limited number of areas,\n            enabled the government to focus on actions considered\n            critical to the success of the overall reform process, and\n            helped implementation, in light of acute capacity constraints."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Economic Management Reform\n

and\n            diminishing dependency on external aid over the medium to\n            long run. The project will be disbursed in two equal\n            tranches. The operation, designed to support explicit the\n            country assistance strategy and the heavily indebted poor\n            countries (HIPC) objectives, is part of a continuing set of\n            reforms designed to consolidate a stable macroeconomic\n            environment, sustain growth, and reduce poverty through\n            improvements in the sustainability of public service\n            delivery. However, the operation involves three types of\n            risks. First, in spite of progress in building institutional\n            and managerial capacity, weaknesses remain which could slow\n            down execution or compromise the quality of reforms. Second,\n            resistance to further trade liberalization and tax reform\n            might be expected. Third, parliamentary and presidential\n            elections are planned for 1999, involving some risk of\n            slippage in implementing reforms perceived to be unpopular.\n            These risks are mitigated by the Government's\n            demonstrated commitment to a wide-ranging reform program,\n            and by its ongoing efforts to carry out systematic\n            consultation
