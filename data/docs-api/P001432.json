Most of the Loan/Credit funds for both\n            projects were used for consultants and procurement, and\n            little for construction work which was the largest component\n            in both projects. The Bank should carefully assess the\n            disastrous effect on its ongoing projects when it suspends\n            disbursements for non-repayment of earlier loans. Suspension\n            is usually brought about because of the country's\n            inability to repay its debts, and meet current obligations.\n            Thus suspension only adds to the difficulties of executing\n            ongoing projects, and invites even more adverse performance.\n            Perhaps at the time of a suspension, the Bank should make a\n            decision to either continue to support its ongoing projects\n            fully, or withdraw completely and shut them down. If there\n            is a likelihood of suspension of disbursements,\n            consideration should also be given to extending the use of\n            letters of credit beyond the supply of goods as presently\n            permitted to civil works and technical assistance contracts,\n            as a means of protecting on-going projects from sudden and\n            frequent cut-off of Loan/Credit funds. During the execution\n            of projects being carried out under difficult conditions\n            such as in Liberia, particular effort should be made by the\n            Bank to avoid frequent changes in staff, and to carry out\n            supervision missions on a regular basis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Liberia -
