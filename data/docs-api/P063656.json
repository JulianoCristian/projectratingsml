Project components call\n            for: 1) elimination of most of the remaining block\n            substations, to be replaced by the installation of\n            building-level individual substations, automated to reduce\n            energy consumption, and to convert the system from a supply,\n            to a demand-driven operation model; 2) rehabilitation of\n            heat-only-boilers, by either replacement with new boilers,\n            or new burners and pumps, and, installation of heat\n            exchangers, and related equipment, depending on each case\n            priority, to reduce fuel consumption, operating costs, and\n            emissions; 3) combined heat and power plant rehabilitation,\n            with a new process control, and instrumental system, to\n            improve reliability, and efficiency. Environmentally\n            friendly low-Nox burner units, should be adjusted for both\n            mazut, and gas firing to reduce emissions, and an additional\n            feed water pump unit should improve plant reliability.\n            Hydraulic and lubrication systems for the turbo-generator\n            will improve reliability, and control, while frequency\n            controlled district heating pumps would adjust the plant\n            demand-driven variable water flow operation mode, and, a\n            regenerative air pre-heater would improve efficiency; and,\n            4) technical assistance to improve management information\n            systems, covering accounting procedures, financial\n            management, and customer databases to enable prompt\n            processing, and managerial information to enhance cost\n            control, and monitoring.

During construction, dust and noise pollution will\n            occur, therefore water sprinklers will be available during\n            the dry season to control air pollution; construction\n            activities will be limited to daytime schedules in\n            compliance with noise ordinance regulations; and, noise\n            meters will be installed to control potential disturbances\n            to schools, and local populations. Workers will be provided\n            with noise abatement, protection devices. Solid wastes, such\n            as metals will be recycled, as specified in the bidding\n            documents; hazardous materials will be handled by licensed\n            companies, in accordance with government regulations; while,\n            existing PCBs content should be clarified, and transformers\n            tested for PCBs.
