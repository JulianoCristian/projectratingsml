The lessons learned indicate that despite\n            the time pressure during project preparation and appraisal,\n            a lot of attention was paid to design details including\n            breakdown of costs and procurement down to county level.\n            Even more importantly, the scope of the project was well\n            focused, and preparation avoided the inclusion of too many\n            or too sophisticated components, and the borrower can make a\n            significant positive impact in improving the lives of\n            lower-income communities, especially in emergency\n            situations.

Due to its emergency\n            response nature, the project focused on reconstruction of\n            physical and social infrastructure. A strong emphasis on\n            input and output monitoring, reporting, and supervision\n            contributed to a quality implementation of the project.
