Some of the key lessons learned\n            from two projects include: (i) where projects seek\n            improvements in incomes and living conditions of the poor, a\n            multidimensional approach will help to better define\n            objectives and monitor achievements;

(iv)\n            although productive subproject approaches may have a more\n            direct and visible impact on incomes, the provision of\n            complementary basic services within or outside of the\n            project framework is also key to ensuring sustainability;\n            and (v) integrating poverty reduction and natural resource\n            management (as in the Santa Catarina project) may be a\n            better option than addressing these objectives in a separate project"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Cear\u00e1 Rural Poverty Reduction and\n            Santa Catarina Natural Resources Management Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Cear\u00e1 Rural Poverty\n            Reduction and Santa Catarina Natural Resources Management Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2016/06/26577095/brazil-cear\u00e1-rural-poverty-reduction-santa-catarina-natural-resources-management-projects","topic":"Poverty Measurement and Analysis m1326941 707,Poverty and Social Impact Analysis\n            m1327421 709,Natural Resources Management m1326215 600,Rural Poverty and Livelihoods m1326688 1947,Poverty m1326687 695","projn":"BR-Santa Catarina Natural Resources\n            Management And Rural Poverty R -- P043869,BR-Rural Poverty Reduction Project -Ceara -- P050875","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"090224b0844638b8_1_0"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","theme":"Rural non-farm income generation,Rural policies and institutions,Other social development,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Land administration and management,Improving labor markets,Rural policies and institutions,Participation and civic engagement,Water resource management","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Poverty Measurement and Analysis m1326941 707,Poverty and Social Impact Analysis\n            m1327421 709,Natural Resources Management m1326215 600,Rural Poverty and Livelihoods m1326688 1947,Poverty m1326687 695","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Energy and mining,Transportation,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","owner":"Urban, Rural & Soc Dev - GP (GSURR),Agriculture - GP (GFADR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"BBFAO-BB FAO,TF050749-BNWPP-WATERSHED MANAGEMENT","majtheme":"Environment and natural resource management,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Rural development,Social protection and risk management","repnb":"106455"},"12785387":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2010/03/12785387/brazil-natural-resource-management-rural-poverty-reduction-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2010/03/12785387/brazil-natural-resource-management-rural-poverty-reduction-project","new_url":"2010/03/12785387/brazil-natural-resource-management-rural-poverty-reduction-project","disclosure_date":"2011-01-04T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2010/09/21/000356161_20100921004416/Rendered/INDEX/ICR12460P043861Official0use0only191.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2010/09/21/000356161_20100921004416/Rendered/PDF/ICR12460P043861Official0use0only191.pdf","loan_no":"4660","docdt":"2010-03-24T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2010-09-21T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Natural Resource Management and\n            Rural Poverty Reduction Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Natural Resource\n            Management and Rural Poverty Reduction Project for Brazil\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the micro-catchment has become a\n            sustainable management unit, and an effective forum for the\n            rural organization and planning essential for more complex\n            productive and environmental activities. Complex, innovative\n            projects of broad scope repeatedly demonstrate that\n            training, organization and institutional growth occupy at\n            minimum, the first half of the implementation period. Clear,\n            objective targeting parameters and strong institutional\n            commitment to compliance ensures the poverty focus of such\n            projects. The capillarity and decentralized managerial\n            structure and quality of an executive extension agency are\n            critical. Design of a demand-led investment fund with\n            discrete financing windows needs to reflect the fact that\n            poor rural families will invariably select social\n            investments over economic or environmental in the first\n            instance. Demonstration, observation, and validation units -\n            demand-led under a rural investment fund are a sound and\n            effective way to include meaningful research in a project of\n            this type."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Natural Resource Management and\n            Rural Poverty Reduction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Natural Resource\n

This project will be\n            implemented over six years and has four components. The\n            first has four subcomponents: 1) stakeholder training to\n            promote economic, social, and environmental sustainability\n            at microcatchment level; 2) environmental education of\n            farmers and fishermen that enables them to solve\n            environmental problems, and environmental teaching projects\n            implemented in municipal and state schools; 3) recruiting\n            and training extension agents; and 4) adaptive and social\n            research as well as socioenvironmental mapping. The second\n            component identifies and carries out rural investments that\n            increase value of agricultural products, improve land\n            management practices, equip rural homes with basic\n            sanitation, protect water sources, and dispose of pig waste\n            satisfactorily. The third component focuses on environmental\n            management by implementing sub-catchment plans, establishes\n            ecological corridors, consolidates protected areas, and\n            creates economic incentives.

Poor farmers' families\n            incomes and livelihoods would be improved by (i) support for\n            government efforts to integrate environmental and social\n            sustainability into development and poverty reduction\n            strategies; (ii) enhanced local governance and community\n            participation in decision making; (iii) reversed land\n            degradation and better protection of the state's\n            natural resources and; (iv) improvements to\n            income-generating opportunities and living conditions for\n            the rural poor. Environmental impacts would mostly be those\n            financed by the Rural Investment Fund (RIF). Impacts of the\n            majority would be positive or neutral e.g., from improved\n            soil and water conservation, replanting of riparian forests,\n            water source protection, domestic sanitation and improved\n            handling of pig waste. Impacts of any misdirected support\n            for agricultural diversification, agro-processing,\n            aquaculture or rehabilitation of small rural roads could,\n            however, be negative. Strict environmental procedures and\n            environmental licensing mechanisms, as well as proposing\n            mitigation measures, are built in the management of the\n            Fund.
