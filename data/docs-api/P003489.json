periods of unforeseen inflation,\n            project supervision needs to be increased during the\n            inflationary periods to prevent slippage in attaining goals,\n            especially in

The main objective\n            of the component was to raise the living standards and\n            income levels for about 96,000 poor households in Gansu\n            Province through increased agricultural production achieved\n            through: (a) 57,000 hectare (ha) irrigation development and\n            improvement, and land settlement by voluntary migration of\n            the newly irrigated land; and (b) improvement of rain-fed\n            agriculture on some 76,000 ha in Guanchuan River Basin\n            through soil and water conservation, and improved farming\n            practices. IDA's overall performance in identification,\n            preparation and appraisal was considered as satisfactory.\n            The Borrower's performance in project implementation\n            and management was generally satisfactory. The\n            project's overall outcome is satisfactory despite some\n            remaining works to be completed under the Yindaruqin\n            Subcomponent. The key lessons learned were: (a) for a major\n            and complex engineering project, more attention should be\n            paid before appraisal by the Borrower and the Bank to\n            detailed engineering investigation and design, contract\n            packaging and realistic implementation schedules, taking\n            into consideration the Borrower's resources and\n            implementing capacity; (b) evaluation of bids for major\n            civil works should be more stringent on bidders'\n            capability and past performance (i.e., on prequalification)\n            as opposed to major focus on price (bid evaluation); (c)\n            adequate and timely counterpart funds are critical to ensure\n            scheduled implementation, thereby avoiding delay and\n            increases in project cost; (d) time-bound implementation\n            plans for land settlement of migrant settlers should be\n            prepared at appraisal and covenanted in the Loan/Credit\n            agreements for effective implementation; (e) the use of\n            local consultants with suitable qualifications and\n            experience could be promoted with substantial saving to the\n            Borrower; and (f) large-scale irrigation development with\n            land settlement for poverty reduction invariably takes a\n            longer time to complete."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Gansu Provincial Development Project\n            : Part 1 - Agriculture Component"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Gansu Provincial\n            Development Project : Part 1 - Agriculture Component"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/01/731988/china-gansu-provincial-development-project-part-1-agriculture-component","projn":"CN-Gansu Provincial Dev -- P003489","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Water Resources Assessment,Water Conservation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Drylands & Desertification","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970818103000"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other finance,(Historic)Education adjustment,(Historic)Other agriculture","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"afforestation,agricultural\n            development,agricultural extension,agricultural\n            production,agricultural\n            technology,Agriculture,animals,annual\n            runoff,aqueducts,Basin,canals,capacity building,carrying\n            capacity,channel,construction,crops,development\n            projects,diseases,diversion,drains,drinking\n            water,drought,droughts,economic analysis,economic\n            development,economic\n            growth,ecosystem,employment,environmental\n            degradation,equipment,erosion,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,Export,extension,farmers,farming,feasibility\n            studies,income,income\n            levels,incomes,inflation,integration,Irrigation,land\n            development,livestock,migration,natural resource\n            base,pasture,Phosphate,ponds,poverty alleviation,production\n            technology,productivity,Programs,quotas,rainfall,rainwater,rural\n            poverty,salinity,shrubs,silt,soil,soil erosion,soil\n            moisture,soils,surface water,surface water\n            runoff,transportation,wages,water charges,water\n            conservation,Water Resources,water sources,water table,Watershed,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"afforestation,agricultural\n            development,agricultural extension,agricultural\n            production,agricultural\n            technology,Agriculture,animals,annual\n            runoff,aqueducts,Basin,canals,capacity building,carrying\n            capacity,channel,construction,crops,development\n            projects,diseases,diversion,drains,drinking\n            water,drought,droughts,economic analysis,economic\n            development,economic\n            growth,ecosystem,employment,environmental\n            degradation,equipment,erosion,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,Export,extension,farmers,farming,feasibility\n            studies,income,income\n            levels,incomes,inflation,integration,Irrigation,land\n            development,livestock,migration,natural resource\n            base,pasture,Phosphate,ponds,poverty alleviation,production\n            technology,productivity,Programs,quotas,rainfall,rainwater,rural\n            poverty,salinity,shrubs,silt,soil,soil erosion,soil\n            moisture,soils,surface water,surface water\n            runoff,transportation,wages,water charges,water\n            conservation,Water Resources,water sources,water table,Watershed,wells"}},"owner":"Financial & Private Sector Dept.
