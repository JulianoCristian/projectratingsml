The additional grant will help finance costs\n            associated with a financing gap for the construction o f two\n            additional schools, to bring the total number o f schools\n            under the project to 28, approximately the same as the\n            project's original target of 29. Additional financing\n            will allow for the construction of an additional two\n            schools. Additional classroom blocks at these and other\n            schools being constructed under the project will allow the\n            project to achieve its overall target of an additional\n            10,000 student places at the primary and secondary school\n            levels. The project is expected to achieve its original\n            target of an additional 10,000 student places (3,000 at the\n            primary level, and 7,000 at the secondary level), despite a\n            reduction in the total number of schools to be built, given\n            that additional classroom blocks have either been\n            constructed or are planned at a number of schools built\n            under the project. The project key changes being include:\n            (a) project funds will be deposited in advance into the\n            designated account maintained in Ngultrum's, to be\n            opened at the Bank of Bhutan; and (b) replenishments into\n            the designated account will be based on interim unaudited\n            financial reports and will be processed by department of\n            public accounts on a quarterly basis. The interim unaudited\n            financial reports will provide information on expenditure\n            made in the previous quarter and forecast for two subsequent\n            quarters. Quarterly disbursements will made based on these\n            financial reports, providing funds for two subsequent\n            quarters after adjustment for past disbursements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bhutan - Additional Financing for the\n            Education Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bhutan - Additional Financing for\n            the Education Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/04/9386822/bhutan-additional-financing-education-development-project","projn":"BT-Bhutan - Education Development Project -- P074114,BT-Additional Financing To Bhutan Edp -- P110892","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"m,Access to Finance,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Debt Markets,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Bhutan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20080425075214"},"theme":"Education for all,Rural services and infrastructure,Education for the knowledge economy","subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education,Secondary education,Primary education,Other industry","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, ADDITIONAL FINANCING,\n            Agricultural products, Auditing, BALANCE of PAYMENTS, Bank\n            financing, Borrower, borrowing, budget balance, Capital\n            formation, Capital goods, CAPITALS, civil service, Consumer,\n            consumption expenditure, Corruption, cost estimates, Credit\n            allocation, creditors, CURRENCY, currency exchanges, Current\n            account, Current account balance, Debt, Debt Management,\n            debt outstanding, debt service, deposit, direct investment,\n            Disbursement, disbursements, Economic Analysis, EDUCATION\n            DEVELOPMENT, education system, enrollment, equipment,\n            Exchange Rate, exchange rates, expenditure, expenditures,\n            EXTERNAL DEBT, factoring, finance costs, financial\n            arrangements, financial information, Financial Management,\n            Financial Management Arrangements, Financial Reporting,\n            Foreign direct investment, fraud, Funds flow, gender, good\n            governance, government expenditures, GOVERNMENT FINANCE,\n            holding, Human Development, Import price index, income,\n            indebtedness, Interest payments, Internal Controls,\n            International Development, judgment, Labor force,\n            large-scale borrowing, Life expectancy, Literacy, Loan,\n            Management Education, migrant labor, negotiation,\n            Negotiations, Portfolio, Portfolio equity, Present value,\n            press coverage, price index, Principal repayments, Private\n            creditors, procurement, receipt, receipts, repayments,\n            reserves, return, savings, school building, secondary\n            education, secondary school, secondary schools, Senior,\n            social services, Total debt, transaction, unemployment,\n            WAREHOUSE, withdrawal"}},"owner":"S.A.
