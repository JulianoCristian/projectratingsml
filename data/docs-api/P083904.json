Some lessons learned included: creation of a\n            project management unit (PMU) for one particular project, or\n            ideally reliance on the government\u2019s own resources for\n            project management, are alternatives that should be\n            evaluated closely based on the nature of the project and the\n            capacity of the government to execute it. The challenges\n            that the implementation completion report (ICR) faced in\n            validating the achievement of the project development\n            objective (PDO) based on the results framework confirms the\n            attention that project preparation needs to pay to\n            establishing a clear causal chain between project\n            objectives, outputs, and results indicators. ICR interviews\n            validated the significant potential impact of decentralized\n            service centers on making justice services more accessible\n            to citizens. The confusion that justice sector stakeholders,\n            ranging from judges to lawyers and citizens, seem to have\n            experienced during the transition to the oral system\n            confirms that any comprehensive reform initiative should be\n            accompanied by a strong change management and training\n            agenda. The ICR understands that the unified management\n            model that the Judiciary is setting out to establish may\n            serve this need. Future interventions can consider including\n            initiatives where different cities learn from each other\u2019s\n            experiences and even assist each other in addressing\n            bottlenecks in reform implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -
