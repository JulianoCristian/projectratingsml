The factor\n            leading to the cancellation of the project was the\n            non-ratification of the loan by the national assembly of El\n            Salvador, and not due to weak implementation or reversal of\n            the policy reforms supported by the loan. The DPL II project\n            was approved by the Board on December 13, 2005 and the loan\n            agreement was signed on March 15, 2007. Subsequently, in\n            various sessions, the loan was presented to, and discussed\n            by, the national assembly of El Salvador, but due to the\n            political gridlock, the loan was never ratified within the\n            18 months deadline after Board approval. As a result, the\n            Bank terminated the loan agreement as of June 13, 2007. Some\n            of the lessons learned from the project are: (i) Bank\n            operations are planned and prepared with the Executive\n            branch of the Government and the Legislative branch is never\n            informed nor consulted during the process of project\n            preparation. While this is a good approach to ensure prompt\n            project preparation, the fact that loans could end up\n            trapped in congress due to political reasons is increasingly\n            present. Just like it is done during Country Assistance\n            Strategy (CAS) preparation and in coordination with main\n            government counterparts, a project level consultation\n            process should take place at the congressional level making\n            sure that relevant views are received and, if technically\n            appropriate for the project, taken into account. At the very\n            least, such an approach would convey the message that the\n            Bank is an objective, technical player, ready to work with\n            any given Government as long as the common goals of poverty\n            reduction are pursued as well; (ii) One broad lesson learned\n            to reflect on is the changing socio-political environment in\n            Latin America. The region is today characterized by an\n            increasingly polarized political environment. The Bank\n            continues to have a role to play in this context; however,\n            it needs to define a strategy to work with clients across\n            the political and ideological spectrum existent in Latin\n            America today."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador - Second Broad-Based Growth\n            Development Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"El

Despite El Salvador\u0092s\n            accomplishments, the World Bank\u0092s poverty assessment for the\n            country concludes that most of the progress on poverty\n            reduction and social indicators has been maintained, but an\n            additional boost is needed to continue improvements.\n            Consequently, in 2004 the Government of El Salvador adopted\n            its \u0093Safe Country 2004-2009\u0094 program focusing on greater\n            economic growth, sound fiscal management, and public sector\n            modernization. The plan requires that a policy and\n            investment agenda be implemented to reinvigorate economic\n            growth through job creation and poverty reduction, together\n            with efforts to redirect fiscal trends and make greater\n            financial management improvements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Second Development Policy Loan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Second Development Policy Loan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2007/04/24015964/second-development-policy-loan","count":"El Salvador","lang":"Spanish","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Industry and trade,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Amount of Loan, anti-corruption, Bank\n            policy, banking sector, borrowing, Central Bank, collection\n            efforts, Consumer Protection, Consumer Protection Law,\n            contractual terms, corruption, credit rating, credit risk,\n            crime, direct foreign investment, Disbursement, economic\n            growth, enforcement of laws, external financing, Financial\n            Administration, financial capacity, financial management,\n            financial management capacity, financial sector, fiscal\n            reforms, foreign investment, Free Trade, Free Trade\n            Agreement, global economy, grace period, growth rate, human\n            capital, income, innovation, institutional reforms, internal\n            control, international markets, investment climate, job\n            creation, Loan, loan classification, macroeconomic\n            management, macroeconomic stability, middle-income country,\n            Monetary Fund, oil prices, procurement, Procurement Law,\n            procurement procedures, productivity, public debt, public\n            spending, reserves, sustainability analysis, tax, tax\n            collection, tax revenues, technical assistance, trade\n            liberalization, transparency, violence"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Development Policy Lending"}},"majtheme":"Trade and integration,Public sector governance,Rule of law,Financial and private sector development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Segundo pr\u00e9stamo de apoyo a pol\u00edticas de desarrollo"}},"projn":"SV-Second Broad-Based Growth Development\n            Policy Loan -- P094146","topic":"Public Sector Management m1326314 696,Anti-Corruption m1326754 832,Market Risks m1326284 1247,Debt m1326503 450,Bankruptcy and Liquidation m1327467 1277","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Labor Policies,Debt Markets,Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Emerging Markets","entityids":{"entityid":"000470435_20150218095541"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Capital markets,General industry and trade sector,General finance sector,Credit Reporting and Secured Transactions,Central government administration","theme":"Export development and competitiveness,Tax policy and administration,Regulation and competition policy,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Legal institutions for a market economy","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Public Sector Management m1326314 696,Anti-Corruption m1326754 832,Market Risks m1326284 1247,Debt m1326503 450,Bankruptcy and Liquidation m1327467 1277","owner":"Macro & Fiscal Mgmt -
