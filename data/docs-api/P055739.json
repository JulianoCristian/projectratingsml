No attention was paid to devices that measure hot and\n            cold water consumption, gas, or heating. The reason is\n            simple: during Soviet times, energy was so cheap that it\n            wasn't necessary to monitor its use. Since Ukraine\n            became a market economy and suddenly had to deal with abrupt\n            increases in the price of energy, the need arose to\n            radically change public consciousness regarding energy\n            efficiency. Given the low living standards of the\n            population, it was virtually impossible to raise prices for\n            communal services. So administrative and public institutions\n            - including schools, hospitals, kindergartens and the like -\n            took the lead. They needed to learn energy conservation\n            since previously control over the consumption of heating and\n            water in such places was almost nonexistent. The first\n            serious attempt to resolve this problem in Ukraine was made\n            in the City of Kyiv. The World Bank helped this endeavor\n            become reality through the Kyiv Public Buildings Energy\n            Efficiency Project (\"the Project\") over a period\n            of five years, from August 2000 to July 2005. The Kyiv City\n            State Administration (KCSA) and the Swedish International\n            Development Authority (SIDA) also took part in the project\n            on a partnership basis. The importance of the Project was\n            that its goals and tasks ran parallel to those outlined by\n            the State Complex Program for Energy Conservation, developed\n            by the Ukrainian government in 1996. The main goal of the\n            Project was to enhance the level of energy efficiency of\n            public buildings through technical improvements and a\n            rational pricing policy for heating. The Project was also\n            aimed at promoting the development of the local energy\n            conservation market and related service industries that only\n            began operating in Ukraine at that time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyiv Public Building lead Ukraine's\n            push for energy conservation"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kyiv Public Building lead\n            Ukraine's push for energy conservation"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/07/23962085/kyiv-public-building-lead-ukraines-push-energy-conservation","count":"Ukraine","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"cities, city authorities, cold water,\n            electricity, Energy Conservation, energy efficiency, Energy\n            efficiency measures, Energy Efficiency Project, gas, heat,\n            heat meters, heating, housing, living standards, natural\n            gas, oil, public utilities, utilities"}},"majtheme":"Environment and natural resource management,Urban development","topic":"Energy Access m1325609 521,Power Systems m1327093 508,Energy Efficiency m1326852 533,Urban Energy Efficiency m1326172 537","projn":"UA-Kiev Pb Energy Effic -- P055739","subtopic":"Power & Energy Conversion,Urban Environment,Environment and Energy Efficiency,Energy Production and Transportation,Energy and Environment","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Energy,Environment,Urban Development","entityids":{"entityid":"000470435_20150205101310"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","theme":"Urban services and housing for the poor,Municipal finance,Climate change","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Energy,Environment,Urban Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Energy Access m1325609 521,Power Systems m1327093 508,Energy Efficiency m1326852 533,Urban Energy Efficiency m1326172 537","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["B"],"trustfund":"TF034167-UKRAINE - DISTRICT HEATING PROJECT,TF034168-ESTONIA - DISTRICT HEATING\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF034614-RUSSIA - ENERGY,HOUSING, ST.\n            PETERSBURG REHAB.,TF035867-UKRAINE - KIEV PUBLIC BUILDINGS\n            ENERGY EFFICIENCY,TF037150-UKRAINE - KIEV ENERGY\n            EFFICIENCY PROJECT,TF040734-ECA: DISTRICT HEATING AND POWER,TF051579-NORWEGIAN TF - SECONDMENT FOR\n            GUNN OLAND","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"1":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"2":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"3":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"}},"repnb":"92493"},"6488278":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2005/12/6488278/ukraine-kiev-public-buildings-energy-efficiency-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2005/12/6488278/ukraine-kiev-public-buildings-energy-efficiency-project","new_url":"2005/12/6488278/ukraine-kiev-public-buildings-energy-efficiency-project","disclosure_date":"2006-01-06T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/12/20/000090341_20051220094932/Rendered/INDEX/33154.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/12/20/000090341_20051220094932/Rendered/PDF/33154.pdf","loan_no":"4534","datestored":"2005-12-20T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2005-12-06T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Gray cover","versiontyp_key":"1309938","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - Kiev Public Buildings Energy\n            Efficiency Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The outcome for the Kiev Public\n            Buildings Energy Efficiency Project for Ukraine was\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was highly likely, the\n            institutional development impact was substantial, and the\n            Bank and borrower performance were both satisfactory.\n            Following are lessons learned from the project: Strong\n            project ownership and commitment to results, along with\n            highly qualified management and staff, by Kiev City State\n            Administration (KCSA) and its Project Implementation unit\n            (PIU), were critical success factors for this project. The\n            project design was simplified in order to minimize project\n            risks and improve the chances for a successful outcome in\n            the Ukrainian context which had been shown as quite\n            difficult for allowing speedy processing and implementation\n            of prior projects. The project required cooperation with a\n            number of other agencies, including the main heating utility\n            in Kiev, for ensuring the speedy commissioning and\n            successful operation of heat substations, but the\n            cooperation was less than optimal. Disbursement arrangements\n            for investment projects in Ukraine have been shown to slow\n            down project implementation and therefore urgently need to\n            be improved. Flexibility and adaptation to changes in the\n            project environment helped the Bank and the implementing\n            agency overcome impediments, improve the project\n            implementing arrangements and achieve the project\n            development objectives in a more effective way. Properly\n            maintained and operating heat substations and energy\n            measuring equipment is essential for ensuring that energy\n            savings will be continued in the future. When it was time to\n            operate the new heat substations in the project public\n            buildings, there were problems to receive adequate heat\n            because the main heat supplier in Kiev, Kievenergo,\n            restricted the flow rate and undersupplied heat to the new\n            heat substations by not supplying district heating water\n            with temperature levels that met the design temperature levels."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine -

The components call\n            for: 1) Energy efficiency improvements in institutional\n            buildings, to include healthcare, educational, and cultural\n            buildings. The component will build heat meters, automate\n            substations, and include weather-stripping, and radiator\n            reflectors. Additionally, ceiling fans, faucet flow\n            restrictors, and hot water heat exchangers, will be\n            installed, along with riser balancing valves. 2) Technical\n            audits, to yield engineering estimates of the\n            buildings' present energy consumption, and provide\n            feasible retrofit actions for energy efficiency. Technical\n            designs for retrofit measures will be required, as well as\n            technical specifications for competitive bidding.\n            Substantial training will be provided. 3) Consulting\n            services for project management, to include monitoring and\n            evaluation, and, to develop training modules for energy\n            efficiency measures. An awareness campaign will be\n            developed, and training programs included. Consultants will\n            review regulations for social assistance support, and\n            strengthen communications, through computerization\n            provision. 4) Financial audits, to
