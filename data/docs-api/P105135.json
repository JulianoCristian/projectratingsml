By late 2008 development partners governance\n            concerns escalated. As a result, the International Monetary\n            Fund (IMF) postponed its Board presentation that was\n            scheduled for December, 2008. Donor coordination for budget\n            support remains essential. A partnership agreement was\n            signed in 2004 between the Government and the key budget\n            support donors, the European Union (EU), France (Agence\n            Francaise de Developpement and the French Co-operation), the\n            African Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank, later\n            joined by Germany. The goal was to provide a better\n            alignment with Government procedures and Paris declaration\n            objectives. Broader monitoring of developments on the ground\n            and more attention to outcomes, as opposed to inputs, is\n            needed. Although selected prior actions and indicators were\n            coordinated with the Government's action plan and\n            Madagascar Action Plan (MAP) objectives, their monitoring\n            did not always provide a whole picture of real progress on\n            the ground, especially in regards to developments on the\n            governance front. Even when the range of systemic\n            performance issues is broad, as it is in all areas supported\n            under the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series,\n            especially Public Finance Management (PFM), it remains\n            important to set as much as possible a few reasonable\n            objectives aiming at gradual and sustainable improvements.\n            Supplemental financing may sent mixed signals to authorities\n            when issues emerge in the implementation of a PRSC-supported program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Fourth and Fifth

Support\n            Credit (PRSC) for the Republic of Madagascar is the second\n            of a series of three PRSCs to be disbursed as single tranche\n            operations. It is consistent with the Bank's Country\n            Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed at the Board of\n            Executive Directors on April 3, 2007, to support the\n            implementation of the Government's poverty reduction\n            strategy as laid out in the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP).\n            The objective of the MAP is to promote rapid and sustainable\n            development over the next five years in line with the\n            Government's national vision document (Madagascar\n            Naturally) and the United Nation (UN) Millennium Development\n            Goals (MDGs). To attain this objective, the MAP presents\n            eight key commitments: (i) responsible governance; (ii)\n            connected infrastructure; (iii) educational transformation;\n            (iv) rural development and a green revolution; (v) health,\n            family planning and the fight against HIV/AIDS; (vi) high\n            growth economy; (vii) cherish the environment; and (viii)\n            national solidarity. The PRSC program for this series\n            focuses explicitly on improving governance, budget\n            management and service delivery, and includes specific\n            policy actions in these areas. The implementation of this\n            operation continues to be exposed to risks, many of which\n            were already identified in previous PRSC operations and in\n            the CAS. The main risks include: (i) vulnerability to\n            external shocks, particularly cyclones and changes in global\n            commodity prices, such as oil and rice; (ii) political risk\n            which poses a continued threat in Madagascar given its\n            history of instability; (iii) maintaining a stable\n            macroeconomic environment, which is critical to the\n            successful implementation of the PRSC and is a core area of\n            focus of the MAP; (iv) the implementation of reforms in\n            public finance and in key sectors (energy) poses challenges\n            and risks which could negatively impact service delivery;\n            and (v) capacity constraints present significant risks to\n            effective implementation of reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar -
