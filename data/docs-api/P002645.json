The EDRP had two main objectives: (a) to\n            alleviate the impact of the current drought on the poor and\n            vulnerable in the most affected areas of Darfur, Kordofan,\n            Khartoum and the Eastern State, and the towns of Juba, Wau\n            and Malakal in the south; and (b) to initiate an action plan\n            to improve longer term food security. The preparation of the\n            project was coordinated at all stages with the International\n            Monetary Fund (IMF) and major multilaterals. All parties to\n            the project agreed that it was necessary to provide a\n            package of relief services, agricultural inputs, and medical\n            supplies to target those most affected, and to use existing\n            Government agencies and organizations which were already\n            significantly involved in relief activities (e.g.United\n            Nations Children's fund (UNICEF) in the project's\n            implementation. The key lessons learned are: (i) production\n            shortfalls need not necessarily result in famine. The most\n            negative effects of drought may be avoided through early\n            awareness, adequate preparedness and response; (ii) an\n            emergency situation calls for massive and rapid response,\n            therefore, such an intervention must take advantage of\n            previously available infrastructure and institutions; (iii)\n            targeting scarce resources is critical for ensuring maximum\n            impact of an emergency intervention. Successful targeting\n            depends on a good understanding of the causes and process of\n            the emergency, so the most vulnerable can be identified and\n            mechanisms created to reach them; (iv) the successful\n            provision of relief services and inputs to promote immediate\n            recovery must be conducted in a timely fashion. Intervention\n            plans must take into account procurement and logistic delays\n            and accordingly ensure that planning is realistic; (v) the\n            success of costrecovery systems depends in-part on the\n            priorities set by end users and their disposable income. The\n            priority accorded to water in rural areas indicates that\n            water service development may be feasible on a more\n            commercial basis in some areas; (vi) cost-recovery systems\n            demand strong service delivery systems, good management and\n            minimum levels of community purchasing power. If some of\n            these conditions are not met,development of cost-recovery\n            systems may be premature or require concurrent development\n            of parallelsystems; (vii) national TA programs can be\n            successful through using local skilled labour, consolidating\n            local knowledge, and promoting greater ownership and use of\n            results; and (viii) in an acute drought/famine situation,\n            the distinction between immediate requirement for food aid\n            and replenishment of seed supplies must be recognized. The\n            loss of some seed imports through home consumption is\n            inevitable given the critical shortage of food until the\n            next harvest."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sudan -
