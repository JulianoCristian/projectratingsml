Some\n            lessons learned included:  in an environment where the\n            reform agenda was slowing down the team focused on areas\n            that had more consensus to move forward. The DPL focused on\n            achieving feasible reforms in the near term while laying the\n            necessary building blocks to accelerate reforms in the\n            medium term. Because public sector reforms would require\n            consensus between diverse stakeholders and would affect the\n            political equilibrium, the government continued to take a\n            strategically incremental approach.  The balanced approach\n            in the preparation of the operations between Social\n            Protections and Competitiveness translated in positive\n            results as provided the government with a set of reforms\n            that reinforced each other (i.e. impact of some trade\n            reforms might be partially compensated by reforms on the\n            social protection system).

objective of the Second\n            Public Sector Performance Development Policy Loan (DPL)\n            Project for Mauritius is to support improvements in the\n            performance of the public sector in Mauritius by assisting\n            the government to implement reforms within the following\n            three pillars: 1) strengthening programs that support and\n            empower the most vulnerable; 2) streamlining trade\n            regulations and processes; and 3) improving human resource\n            management in the civil service and the monitoring of\n            State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) performance. The Government of\n            Mauritius continues to diversify the economy to enable the\n            country to achieve a higher income status in the medium\n            term. Since independence in 1968, economic growth in\n            Mauritius has been built on a long tradition of economic and\n            institutional reforms. This DPL series supports the\n            strengthening of the institutional, policy, and management\n            tools required to address some of the challenges posed by\n            these reforms. The fiscal position is improving, and the\n            government achieved greater debt consolidation in 2012 than\n            had originally been expected."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritius - Second
