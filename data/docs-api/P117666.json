Some lessons learned included:\n            Development Policy Loans (DPLs) should be based on previous\n            technical assistance successes and salient cross country\n            experience. DPLs should be grounded in prior strong\n            analytical groundwork, which can provide the necessary\n            rationale for selection of policy and program reform areas.\n            Creditworthy middle income-countries benefit most from\n            programs that permit adequate flexibility to account for\n            rapid responses to changing circumstances, especially during\n            times of crisis. Bank-Borrower partnership rooted in a\n            country-specific reform agenda must be in place before a DPL\n            series is undertaken. The concentration of critically\n            important reform steps facilitate political ownership of the\n            program, and make the process easier for the authorities to\n            initiate and implement.

June\n            8, 2010, was submitted by Dr. Irena Mausner and Mrs. Magda\n            Acher as survivors of the holocaust and filing the request\n            on their own behalf and on behalf of the extended Fryman,\n            Mirski, Mausner and Acher families. The requesters state\n            that their property at Chocimska six Warsaw, Poland, was\n            expropriated in the 1970s without the payment of any\n            compensation. They further claim that this property is\n            likely to be \"privatized\" by the Polish Government\n            with the active support of the World Bank through this\n            operation. The Requesters further state that they owned\n            extensive tracts of agricultural land in Silesia and that\n            land was also expropriated without payment of compensation.\n            They claim that Polish Government refused to discuss either\n            claim with them. On July 14, 2010, management provided a\n            note to the panel with information concerning the activities\n            supported under the operation. According to management, the\n            operation has impacts on six different areas of policy:\n            labor markets, social assistance (pensions), public finance,\n            health, education, and private sector development.\n            Management further stated that the operation does not\n            support any privatization with respect to individual\n            companies or even the broader policy of privatization, and\n            that the areas of policy supported do not involve the sale\n            of any assets that are the subject of this dispute.\n            Management added that, in this light, there is no nexus\n            between this operation and the particular concerns raised in\n            the request."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Third

PL3 continues to support the Government's\n            successful policy response to the economic slowdown. Key\n            reform initiatives included the anti-crisis stability and\n            development plan; the reduction in the tax wedge; the\n            phasing out of early retirement pensions; and the amendments\n            of the law on freedom of business operations, the public\n            finance act and the 2009 state budget. Following the second\n            policy loan, PL3 will continue to support Government\n            measures to mitigate the impact of the global crisis on\n            households, workers and businesses. With the recovery\n            gaining speed, it also supports Government efforts to unwind\n            the extraordinary anti-crisis policies and step up reforms\n            to reinforce Poland's growth prospects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Third Employment, Entrepreneurship\n            and Human Capital Development Policy Loan Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Poland - Third
