Lessons learned include: it is unrealistic\n            to expect that a country like Albania, with weak\n            environmental support and understanding of the general\n            population and many within the administration, will, within\n            the limited period of a five-year project implementation\n            period, accept and implement best practice of managed and\n            protected nature reserves. As a result, project objectives\n            must be set realistically with due regard to the time needed\n            to change behavior and culture. The project name is IWEMP.\n            Yet, the project failed to apply successfully the integrated\n            nature of wastewater projects that require attention be paid\n            to the: (i) connection of buildings to the sewerage system;\n            (ii) the collection of wastewaters to secondary sewers in\n            the streets; (iii) the interception of the collected\n            wastewater and conveyance to the wastewater treatment\n            plants; and (iv) the safe and environmentally disposal of\n            the treated effluents. It is risky to rely on a private\n            operator to solve the many problems that face water supply\n            and wastewater operations. Specifically, the employment of a\n            private operator presumably meant that the Government was\n            planning to rely on private management in the future which\n            in turn means that the IWEMP expected the management\n            operator to guarantee sustainable operations of the sewerage\n            system and of the wastewater treatment plants. After the\n            departure of the management operator the capacity to operate\n            and maintain the project infrastructure is uncertain,\n            endangering project sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Integrated Water and Ecosystems\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Integrated Water and\n

Management Project\n            outlines expected negative environmental impacts and\n            proposed mitigations. To ensure maintenance of water\n            quality, levels, and water flows, as well as ecological\n            balance, specific indices will be monitored periodically.\n            Also to reduce the risk of water contamination, protect the\n            constructed treatment wetlands (CTW) by a flood protection\n            dyke; remove topsoil before construction and substitute\n            impervious clay liners to protect groundwater; and follow\n            procedures for sludge removal and disposal. To protect\n            biodiversity, habitats, and rare species, prepare a\n            comprehensive monitoring program and set guidelines for\n            contractors. No significant increase in mosquitoes is\n            expected, so the risk of malaria is low. Mitigations\n            comprise a management plan that combines biological and\n            chemical control measures; and creating buffer zones with\n            greenbelts around all sites. To control the social risk\n            associated with odors emanating from wetlands when waters\n            begin to stagnate, elaborate a plan for water control\n            measures to avoid putrification; and create buffer zones. An\n            environmental management plan will address reducing the\n            impact of the silt clay or clay sand material extraction for\n            CTW embankments or excavation
