SLPII will scale-up\n            nationwide the effective mechanisms and processes piloted\n            under the first phase in the local communities and\n            governments. The reallocation is necessary to adjust the\n            allocation of funds for consultant services under the\n            project. The costs of staffing the project implementation\n            unit, the Sustainable Livelihoods Program Office (SLPO),\n            come under category six (b). Other consultancy costs fall\n            under category six (a). The fee structure for staff of all\n            project implementation units (PIUs) in Mongolia is governed\n            by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), which in 2011 increased\n            the fee scale for PIU staff in line with increases with\n            public sector salaries and remain competitive with private\n            sector salaries. This was originally budgeted for and\n            therefore additional funds are required under category six\n            (b). MOF initially requested this change by letter of April\n            1, 2011, though the reallocation was delayed pending the\n            approval and Parliament ratification of the additional\n            financing, which was declared effective on March 19, 2012,\n            and which provides additional funds for consultancy services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mongolia -
