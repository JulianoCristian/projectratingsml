The primary project objective was to increase\n            Jordan's phosphate rock production by 1.5 million\n            tonnes per year, thus increasing the country's total\n            rock exports to a level in excess of 7 million tonnes per\n            year. other objectives included (i) ensuring that the\n            production from the new project site would be inter-phased\n            effectively with existing and declining phosphate rock\n            production at traditional mines; (ii) reorganizing and\n            restructuring the phosphate sector by the methodical\n            integration of traditional mining operations with downstream\n            fertilizer facilities; (iii) investigating and remedying\n            environmental degradation at phosphate loading operations at\n            Aqaba; and (iv) optimizing the design of downstream\n            phosphate beneficiation plant facilities planned as a second\n            stage Shidiya development. The performance of the Bank can\n            be considered highly satisfactory.The performance of the\n            Borrower has been highly satisfactory. There were two key\n            findings to be learned from the project implementation\n            experience were: (i) firstly, with a simple project design\n            and a strong commercially oriented enterprise, substantial\n            project benefits can be attained in terms of sector and\n            institutional development, physical output, and\n            environmental and financial/economic impact; and (ii)\n            secondly, for any enterprise involved in commodity exports\n            subject to cyclical trends, market growth prospects must be\n            addressed with caution and sensitivity analyses undertaken\n            to ensureproject viability and sustainability. In addition,\n            the enterprise management must remain flexible and be able\n            to adjust quickly its corporate strategies to survive\n            serious market fluctuations and down turns. In this case,\n            however, the major economic dislocations that occurred in\n            eastern Europe in the early-1990's that affected\n            seriously phosphate world demand could not be anticipated in\n            any meaningful way in sensitivity analyses."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan -
