Its institutional development impact is\n            negligible and its sustainability is unlikely. The project\n            had little impact on the evolution of the AIDS epidemic in\n            Zaire and made slight contribution to the development of the\n            country's capacity to combat AIDS. Despite a strong\n            technical design, the project suffered from weak project\n            management and low government commitment. Rapid\n            deterioration of Zaire's socio-political, physical, and\n            financial environment, including looting of project premises\n            in 1991 and 1993, created increasingly difficult conditions\n            for the project. IDA's decision to extend the project\n            implementation period for two and a half years in 1992\n            reflected the expectation that positive political changes at\n            the time would turn Zaire's chaotic conditions around,\n            but the situation soon resumed its downward spiral.\n            Disbursements were suspended in July 1993 and non-accrual\n            status was declared in November 1993. The project was closed\n            in January 1994 with only 41 percent of the IDA credit\n            disbursed. The Bank's leadership in developing a\n            standalone AIDS project helped to raise the perceived\n            priority of AIDS in Zaire and in the Bank, and the technical\n            content of the project was basically sound. However, the\n            project at times suffered from the inadequacy and\n            irregularity of Bank supervision. The Borrower's\n            performance exhibited weak leadership and management and\n            ultimately was responsible for the disappointing outcome of\n            the project. Lessons learned revolve around dealing with\n            hostile implementation environments, the quality and\n            training of staffing, and Bank supervision and policies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zaire -
