This Project Completion Note specifies the reasons\n            for project cancellation as follows. The difficult economic\n            and political crisis in Zimbabwe accelerated, with problems\n            servicing  external debts, and by March 2000, the government\n            defaulted on its loans to the Bank, and other international\n            financial institutions. As a result, the Bank suspended\n            disbursements on all projects in Zimbabwe on May 16,200O.\n            The economic crisis worsened during the past four years, and\n            the country's arrears continue to rise. Zimbabwe has\n            not made any effort to clear its arrears to the Bank. The\n            project was closed, and the undisbursed funds from both the\n            Credit and Grant were cancelled on June 25, 2002 some 25\n            months after the Bank suspended disbursements to Zimbabwe,\n            as a result of the government's inability to service\n            its loans to the Bank. The original closing date was 30\n            September 2005."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zimbabwe - Park Rehabilitation and\n            Conservation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zimbabwe -

The project has three components.\n            The first component reinforces institutional and\n            organizational capacity to sustain investments and\n            effectively manage the Parks estate and wildlife resources:\n            it supports organizational development, implements Fund\n            financial management and management information systems,\n            institutes comprehensive park planning, improves capacity\n            for policy development, supports monitoring and applied\n            research for protected area management and biodiversity\n            conservation, and provides interpretative and educational\n            materials and programs. The second component improves\n            elements of national park infrastructure needed to manage\n            parks for wildlife and habitat conservation and for\n            sustainable commercial development, including improving\n            infrastructure critical for park functioning and tourism\n            access, providing plant and equipment for road maintenance,\n            improving and adding staff housing, and providing vehicles\n            and other equipment for improved park management and\n            anti-poaching operations. The third component strengthens\n            biodiversity conservation in the national park and nearby\n            areas; implements the park management plan; establishes a\n            consultative process in park planning, management, and\n            conservation; supports community-based sub-projects; and\n            supports educational programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zimbabwe - Park
