Some lessons\n            learned included: a private professional operator now under\n            Armenian management with limited back office support from\n            its foreign professional partner is able to exceed its\n            contractual obligations is a proof that know-how has been\n            properly transferred and that contractual incentives are\n            working well. The independent technical auditor concluded\n            that for the third consecutive year the quality of the\n            service provided by Yerevan Djur has improved, as evidenced\n            by a steady reduction of volume of water produced, energy\n            consumed and physical and commercial losses, which provides\n            good prospects for further improvements in coming years.\n            Economic justification of projects that mostly focus on\n            rehabilitation of existing facilities and operations is\n            always difficult without reliable data before and at the\n            completion of the project. If energy savings are usually\n            easy to identify, time savings, reduction of coping costs,\n            health improvements and environmental improvements are much\n            more difficult to document. Future projects should consider\n            establishing good baseline information for better supporting\n            estimates of economic benefits in an environment where the\n

Armenia - Clean, constant water in Yerevan"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This Results Profile tells a story on\n            clean, constant water in Yerevan, Armenia. Water is treated\n            as a precious commodity in Armenia. It is expensive and not\n            always plentiful or clean enough to meet the needs of the\n            capital's citizens. Neglected for decades, municipal\n            water and wastewater systems leaked, wasted and misused\n            water. As a result, most residents only had water a few\n            hours a day. When water did come out of the tap, it was\n            often unhealthy. Armenia's government has strived over\n            the past decade to improve access to reliable and safe\n            drinking water. Two projects, financed by World Bank funds,\n            have made improvements in water delivery and quality, and\n            customer service. Thanks to the projects, 332,000 households\n            in the capital have running water 21 hours a day, up from\n            six.  Water quality and customer service began to improve\n            after reforms put a private company in charge of managing\n            the utility company. Yerevan's water supply is\n            monitored in real time through a new software program. The\n            entire network of water mains and pipes can be seen on a\n            single computer screen which shows who is receiving water at\n            any given time, and where bottlenecks occur. A customer\n            service hotline answers consumers' questions and\n            responds to emergencies around the clock. People report\n            problems with water quality or meters, and water or sewage\n            main breaks. Over the last ten years, the country has\n            significantly improved the way it manages and protects its\n            water resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"In Armenia - Clean, constant water in Yerevan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"In Armenia - Clean, constant\n            water in Yerevan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/01/25070377/armenia-clean-constant-water-yerevan","count":"Armenia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"wells, water sources, water quality,\n            municipal development, users, wastewater, pumping, drinking\n            water, network, running water, households, safe drinking\n            water, meters, water users, wastewater systems, liters per\n            second, water company, connections, construction, systems,\n            water, water meters, water supply, reservoirs, water mains,\n            installing water meters, utility, pipeline, water losses,\n            pumping stations, municipal water, water consumption, water resources"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Social protection and risk management,Environment and natural resource management,Rural development","topic":"Water Allocation and Water Economics\n            m1326745 427,Water m1326522 137,Water Management Structures m1326743 1000,Energy and Water m1327476 142,Environmental Water Use and Catchment\n            Protection m1326301 157,Water Resources Management m1326089 141","projn":"AM-Yerevan Water & Wastewater Project -- P087641,AM-Municipal Development Project-118621 -- P035805","subtopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Conservation,Urban Water Supply and Sanitation,Water and Industry","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b0830f07bb_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Sewerage,Sanitation,Water supply,General public administration sector,Housing construction,Water supply,Flood protection","theme":"Other financial and private sector development,Natural disaster management,Pollution management and environmental health,Urban services and housing for the poor,Pollution management and environmental health,Urban services and housing for the poor,Rural services and infrastructure,Water resource management","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Water Allocation and Water Economics\n            m1326745 427,Water m1326522 137,Water Management Structures m1326743 1000,Energy and Water m1327476 142,Environmental Water Use and Catchment\n            Protection m1326301 157,Water Resources Management m1326089 141","owner":"Water - GP (GWADR)","trustfund":"TF026037-TA CTF FOR KAZAKHSTAN ENVIRONMENT,TF031973-ARMENIA - SOCIAL SECTOR,TF027095-PHRD-MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT,TF029334-PHRD -MUNICIPAL & SOCIAL\n            SECTOR DEV.

Over 3.32 million households in Yerevan had\n            benefitted from improvements in the duration of water supply\n            and water quality"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Enhanced public-private partnership in\n            delivery of water services in Armenia"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Enhanced public-private\n            partnership in delivery of water services in Armenia"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2011/04/25477253/enhanced-public-private-partnership-delivery-water-services-armenia","count":"Armenia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"sanitation, water supply systems, water\n            quality, municipal development, wastewater, private\n            operator, wastewater treatment, water services, water supply\n            system, drinking water, households, wastewater services,\n            water connections, electricity, water sector, water utility,\n            systems, water, wastewater management, wastewater treatment\n            plant, water supply, wastewater infrastructure, pollution,\n            available water resources, service provision, capacity\n            building, unaccounted for water, water supply services,\n            available water, water resources, electricity consumption,\n            cut off, tanks"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Social protection and risk management,Environment and natural resource management,Rural development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Mejora en la asociaci\u00f3n entre el sector\n            p\u00fablico y el privado en la prestaci\u00f3n de servicios de agua\n            en Armenia"}},"topic":"Water Resources Management m1326089 141,Water Allocation and Water Economics\n            m1326745 427,Water Allocation and Water Supply m1326747 1063,Water m1326522 137,Water Demand Management m1326746 1064,Water Economics m1327707 1998","projn":"AM-Yerevan Water & Wastewater Project -- P087641,AM-Municipal Development Project-118621 -- P035805","subtopic":"Sanitation and Sewerage,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry,Town Water Supply and Sanitation","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b0831eaa6f_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","theme":"Other financial and private sector development,Water resource management,Rural services and infrastructure,Urban services and housing for the poor,Pollution management and environmental health,Urban services and housing for the poor,Pollution management and environmental health,Natural disaster management","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Water Resources Management m1326089 141,Water Allocation and Water Economics\n            m1326745 427,Water Allocation and Water Supply m1326747 1063,Water m1326522 137,Water Demand Management m1326746 1064,Water Economics m1327707 1998","owner":"Water - GP (GWADR)","trustfund":"TF032477-ARMENIA - URBAN DEVELOPMENT -\n            MUNICIPAL SECTOR STUDY,TF032574-ARMENIA - HOUSING AND MUNICIPAL SERVICES,TF027095-PHRD-MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT,TF029334-PHRD -MUNICIPAL & SOCIAL\n            SECTOR DEV.
