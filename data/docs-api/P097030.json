The changes address challenges resulting\n            from pursuing a complex public administration reform agenda\n            in an increasingly difficult political reform and worsening\n            security environment with diminishing government commitment\n            and implementation capacity constraints on the part of the\n            project's implementing agency the Independent\n            Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission (IARCSC).\n            The restructuring will recalibrate the project's\n            development objectives to focus on more attainable\n            priorities, adjust the project's scope to focus on\n            areas with stronger government ownership; and strengthen\n            implementation arrangements within the IARCSC.

Civil Service\n            Implementation Plan. The project builds on the lessons\n            learned from earlier involvement in public administration\n            reform in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Specifically, the\n            project recognizes that sustaining reforms in public\n            administration, and particularly as they relate to public\n            sector employment practices, takes time. The project is\n            comprised of three components designed to strengthen civil\n            service organization and management, including: 1)\n            organizational reforms in line ministries which will provide\n            support to a number of core ministries to improve service\n            delivery through restructuring organization to meet\n            functions; directed by a ministry-determined process; 2)\n            merit based human resource management policies and practices\n            which will support the establishment and implementation\n            across government of modem merit based HR policies and\n            practices; and 3) PAR Oversight and Monitoring which will\n            support the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil\n            Service Commission (IARCSC) in carrying out its stewardship\n            role under the Civil Service Law to lead, regulate,\n            formulate and implement structure policies of the public\n            administration system. Under this project the Government\n            should have in place a fully funded, regularly monitored and\n            well coordinated and communicated Civil Service Reform program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Civil Service Reform Project :\n            technical annex"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Afghanistan - Civil Service\n            Reform Project : technical annex"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/04/7593961/afghanistan-civil-service-reform-project-technical-annex","projn":"AF-Civil Service Reform Project -- P097030","docty":"Technical Annex","subtopic":"E-Government,Poverty and Social Impact Analysis,Public Sector Regulation,Public Sector Administrative and Civil\n            Service Reform,Government Diagnostic Capacity Building","teratopic":"Public Sector Development,Social Development","count":"Afghanistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070510091223"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Public Sector Development,Social Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"administrative capacity, Administrative\n            Reform, administrative reforms, administrative units,\n            Advisory Committee, analytical work, arbitration mechanism,\n            budget management, Capacity Building, capacity building\n            activities, capacity building efforts, capacity building\n            needs, capacity constraints, central government, central\n            ministries, civil servants, CIVIL SERVICE, Civil Service\n            Commission, CIVIL SERVICE MANAGEMENT, CIVIL SERVICE REFORM,\n            civil service reform effort, civil service reform program,\n            civil service reform strategy, civil service reforms, Civil\n            Service Training, competitive process, consultation,\n            corruption, Development Policy, economic activity,\n            elections, employment practices, financial capacity, fiscal\n            sustainability, government agencies, government capacity,\n            Government organizations, government systems, Human\n            Resource, HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, Human Resources,\n            implementation capacity, Information System, Information\n            Technology, institutional development, institutional\n            environment, institutional reforms, legal framework,\n            M&E, management systems, Ministry of Finance, national\n            administration, National Assembly, organizational structure,\n            political system, Poverty Reduction, public accountability,\n            Public Administration, Public Expenditure, Public Finance,\n            public institutions, public resources, public sector, public\n            service, record keeping, reform agenda, Reform\n            Implementation, regulatory environment, Regulatory\n            Framework, senior management, service delivery, state\n            institutions, Technical Assistance, transparency"}},"owner":"Econ.
