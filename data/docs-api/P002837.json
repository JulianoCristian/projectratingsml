south) and Lama-Kara (in the\n            north) with 360 places each; the strengthening of the\n            Directorate of Educational Research and Teacher Training\n            (DIFOP) in the ministry of education, in charge of preparing\n            the primary and secondary schools curricula; the expansion\n            of the National Institute of Agricultural Training (INFA) to\n            train middle-and high-level agricultural staff and\n            agriculture teachers for primary and secondary schools; and\n            the strengthening of the unit in charge of the\n

However, this risk will be minimized by\n            the technical assistance provided under the project. Also\n            the advanced stage of preparation of the project should help\n            reduce the risk of delays in its implementation. Due to the\n            presently severe constraints on the budgetary and balance of\n            payments situation, there is the risk that the Government\n            will have difficulty in providing the counterpart funds."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Togo - Prehier Projet Education"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Togo \u2013 Premier projet \u00c9ducation :\n            Togo \u2013 Projet d\u2019\u00e9ducation Prehier"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/04/11953768/togo-first-education-project-togo-prehier-projet-education","projn":"TG-Education-267620 -- P002837","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Education,Gender","count":"Togo","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20100317003557"},"subsc":"Primary education","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Education,Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Construction; Curriculum development;\n            Educational facilities; Teacher training; Teachers colleges;\n            Universities & colleges,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Construction; Curriculum development;\n            Educational facilities; Teacher training; Teachers colleges;\n            Universities & colleges,,"}},"owner":"CD13: BN/NE/TG (AFC13)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"2621","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Togo - Prehier Projet Education"}}},"facets":{}}}
