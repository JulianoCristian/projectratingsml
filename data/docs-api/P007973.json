It will help finance the foreign\n            exchange cost of up to 1,500 subprojects with an estimated\n            total cost of US$50 million and will help to create up to\n            10,000 new jobs. The project will also support Government\n            efforts to eliminate subsidies and to standardize interest\n            rates for term lending to SSEs. In addition, it will\n            strengthen the term lending system for SSEs by involving a\n            large number of financial intermediaries, thus promoting\n            competition, better service and a broader regional\n            distribution of resources. Finally, the loan will help to\n            finance a technical assistance program within COFIDE to\n            train loan officers of the participating intermediaries to\n            better meet the special needs of their SSE clients and to\n            further develop COFIDE's own staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Small-scale Enterprise Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - Small-scale Enterprise Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1981/11/725925/peru-small-scale-enterprise-project","projn":"PE-Small Scale Industry-271071 -- P007973","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Municipal Financial Management,Private Participation in Infrastructure","teratopic":"Infrastructure Economics and Finance","count":"Peru","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_9810191255482"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Infrastructure Economics and Finance","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            practices,administrative\n            procedures,agriculture,assets,balance of payments,banking\n            system,bonds,branches,Capital Goods,capital use,Central\n            Bank,certificates of deposit,cities,commercial\n            banks,commercial\n            enterprises,competitiveness,Corporation,cost of\n            capital,credit policies,credit unions,debt,demand\n            deposits,depreciation,devaluation,development banks,economic\n            activity,economic efficiency,economic\n            growth,employment,exchange rate,exchange\n            rates,expansion,exports,financial institutions,financial\n            sector,Financial Structure,firms,fish,fishing,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,GDP,housing,Imports,income,indexation,industrial\n            enterprises,inflation,inflation rate,insurance,interest\n            rate,Interest Rates,intermediate goods,labor costs,labor\n            force,labor productivity,large\n            enterprises,legislation,lending rates,licensing,LOAN\n            COMMITMENTS,local authorities,manufacturing\n            establishments,maturities,metals,minimum\n            wages,monopolies,natural resource base,oil,organizational\n            structure,overvaluation,per capita income,population\n            growth,Productivity,proven oil reserves,public\n            enterprises,Regional Banks,Resource\n            Mobilization,savings,Small Enterprises,small firms,Small\n            scale enterprises,statistical data,tariff barriers,Technical\n            Assistance,time deposits,Trade\n            Policies,unemployment,urbanization,value added,wages"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            practices,administrative\n            procedures,agriculture,assets,balance of payments,banking\n            system,bonds,branches,Capital Goods,capital use,Central\n            Bank,certificates of deposit,cities,commercial\n            banks,commercial\n            enterprises,competitiveness,Corporation,cost of\n            capital,credit policies,credit unions,debt,demand\n            deposits,depreciation,devaluation,development banks,economic\n            activity,economic efficiency,economic\n            growth,employment,exchange rate,exchange\n            rates,expansion,exports,financial institutions,financial\n            sector,Financial Structure,firms,fish,fishing,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,GDP,housing,Imports,income,indexation,industrial\n            enterprises,inflation,inflation rate,insurance,interest\n            rate,Interest Rates,intermediate goods,labor costs,labor\n            force,labor productivity,large\n            enterprises,legislation,lending rates,licensing,LOAN\n            COMMITMENTS,local authorities,manufacturing\n            establishments,maturities,metals,minimum\n            wages,monopolies,natural resource base,oil,organizational\n            structure,overvaluation,per capita income,population\n            growth,Productivity,proven oil reserves,public\n            enterprises,Regional Banks,Resource\n            Mobilization,savings,Small Enterprises,small firms,Small\n            scale enterprises,statistical data,tariff barriers,Technical\n            Assistance,time deposits,Trade\n            Policies,unemployment,urbanization,value added,wages"}},"owner":"WB Off:Lima-Andean Countries CMU (LCC6C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"3578"},"facets":{}}}
