Of the eight project\n            development objective indicators, the targets of six were\n            achieved, one was exceeded, while it was difficult to\n            determine whether the remaining one indicator was achieved.\n            Of the fourteen intermediate outcome indicators, the targets\n            of eight were exceeded, five were achieved, and one was\n            partially achieved after revision. Significant lessons\n            learned during project implementation include: 1) importance\n            of adequacy and measurement of outcome indicators; 2) choice\n            of instruments must be appropriate; 3) providing incentives\n            during a project may help to obtain support from\n            stakeholders who stand to benefit, even if they are not yet\n            aware of the impact of the project's success on their\n            well-being; 4) partnerships and cooperation between schools\n            and local communities clearly demonstrated a positive result\n            in developing and improving the education quality and level\n            of students' knowledge, and their attendance; 5) a\n            comprehensive multi-pronged approach allowed objectives to\n            improve learning conditions; and 6) the Bank team needs to\n            strengthen its supervision capacity, especially regular and\n            comprehensive reviews of the results

          Education Modernization Project for Tajikistan is to set the\n            stage for change at the national level while improving\n            learning conditions and school enrollment and completion\n            through grade five in selected districts.  The project has\n            supported modernization of the curriculum for primary\n            grades, development and trial of the new textbooks and\n            teachers guide based on the modernized curriculum. These\n            activities are completed. However, planned publishing of the\n            developed new textbooks and teachers' guide based on\n            new curriculum is suspended due to move to the new system of\n            education envisaging 1 year expansion of primary, basic and\n            full general education from 4 to 5, from 9 to 10 and from 11\n            to 12 years accordingly. The Ministry of Education (MOE)\n            plans to revise newly developed textbooks accordingly and\n            publish them in 2013.
