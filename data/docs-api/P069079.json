There are four main project\n            components. The first finances services from management\n            advisors and privatization advisors, needed to privatize a\n            savings bank, and funds a financial audit. The second\n            component strengthens the country's financial\n            infrastructure including implementing an inter-bank payments\n            system; providing technical assistance to develop national\n            accounting standards, revising the chart of accounts for the\n            enterprise, banking, insurance sectors, and budgetary\n            institutions to comply with the new law; carrying out an\n            operational and financial audit of the loan collection\n            agency; and establishing a credit information bureau. The\n            third component supports advisory services to develop and\n            implement a privatization strategy; to price and set\n            reserves for third party liability and casualty/life\n            insurance products; and to introduce modern claims\n            management systems and skills.

The fourth component focuses on revising the\n            legal, institutional, regulatory, and supervisory framework\n            for capital markets to ensure transparency, investor\n
