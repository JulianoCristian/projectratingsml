Some lessons learned includes: institutional\n            capacity development is the most critical component of an\n            effective and sustained response. Training and skills\n            upgrading alone will not be sufficient in the absence of\n            such capacity strengthening, which must include clearly\n            defined and well understood roles, responsibilities and\n            management structures. Development of a comprehensive\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E) framework should be one\n            of the first project interventions. This is important both\n            to demonstrate progress against well defined baselines, and\n            also to inform program development in order to choose the\n            most effective interventions and target these to the areas\n            where they would have greatest impact. Civil Society\n            organizations can be important agents of change, but their\n            contributions must be well managed if they are to be\n            maximally effective. Principles for maximizing the\n            effectiveness of community mobilization should be\n            implemented with project support. Maximizing outcomes and\n            impact depends on clear focus and prioritization, including\n            selection of a limited number of key ministries and\n            agencies, increased focus on those states which are\n            experiencing the greatest number of new infections, and\n            delivery of services at scale to the most at-risk and\n            vulnerable groups and populations within those states."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria -
