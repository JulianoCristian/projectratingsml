Importantly, the project supported analysis and\n            the foundation of key policies and strategies on food\n            security and poverty, and built institutional and technical\n            capacity in these areas. Both World Bank and Borrower\n            performance were satisfactory on the whole. Key lessons\n            included the following: Project simplicity, clear\n            objectives, and flexible design are important, particularly\n            where there are capacity constraints and rapid change.\n            Government ownership is vital. Balancing timely delivery of\n            outputs and in depth research on one hand and ensuring that\n            nationals learn from the experience on the other, depend\n            both on careful supervision and the implementing\n            agency's commitment to capacity building. Capacity\n            building projects should be sustained in order to ensure\n            sustainability of outcome. Short-term and on-the-job\n            training may be more appropriate for government officials\n            than longer-term training abroad (advanced degree programs).\n            The effectiveness of technical assistance programs depends\n            on both the quality of the program and the relationships\n            between the technical advisors and their counterparts,\n            Borrower officials."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique -

The project has three main\n            components. First, policy development through strengthening\n            capacity for monitoring of poverty and household food\n            security status and strategies and policy analysis within a\n            recently-established Poverty Alleviation Unit of the\n            National Planning Commission. Second, awareness-creation and\n            in-service training through: (a) support for two national\n            food security conferences, a series of workshops and\n            high-level policy seminars to create widespread awareness\n            and debate of food security issues; (b) intensive short-term\n            training courses for managerial/technical central and\n            provincial staff in analysis of food security issues and\n            appropriate responses -- including concepts/methods,\n            marketing, production, planning/management, macroeconomic\n            aspects and household access -- to be offered through Centro\n            de Formacao Agrario (CFA) in Maputo; (c) development of\n            training modules on food security topics for inclusion in\n            training courses for district and provincial staff at\n            CFA's provincial centers to be offered as part of\n            ongoing rural development programs; and (d) curriculum\n            development, pedagogical materials, textbooks and staff\n            development for the inclusion of food\n            security/nutrition-related courses at training institutes in\n            health. Third, strengthening the food security dimension of\n            university-level pre-service training programs through\n            support for development/implementation of research and\n            teaching on smallholder farming and food security issues at\n            the University Faculty of Agriculture, including technical\n            cooperation with overseas universities, faculty exchanges,\n            research funds, computer equipment, books and other\n            pedagogical materials."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Food Security Capacity Building
