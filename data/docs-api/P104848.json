Some lessons\n            learned included: among the major challenges encountered\n            during project implementation was the difficulty of many\n            prospective private sector investors in complying with the\n            project's safeguard and fiduciary guidelines, which\n            were not fully consistent with Government of Vietnam (GOV)\n            laws and policies. The efforts to move towards adopting\n            country systems for safeguards and fiduciary guidelines\n            should be continued by the Vietnam country team. The lack of\n            specific GOV legal guidelines requiring the competitive\n            selection of private sector partners as part of the\n            establishment of a new legal entity, Special Purpose Vehicle\n            (SPV) served as a disincentive for prospective private\n            investors to participate in direct equity investment\n            sub-projects under HIFU Development Project (HDP). The\n            financing agreement and Project Appraisal Document (PAD) of\n            HDP provided for possible amendments to the project manuals\n            subject to the clearance of the Bank and a resolution of the\n            Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee (HCMC PC). In cases\n            such as HDP where project implementation was affected by the\n            challenges in applying certain guidelines of the project\n            manual, such as those pertaining to procurement and\n            safeguards, the Borrower should be strongly encouraged to\n            review and to formally propose amendments. In the case of\n            HDP where there was an open menu for sub-projects, Ho Chi\n            Minh City Finance and Investment State Owned Company (HFIC)\n            should have been provided with the flexibility to appraise\n            eligible sub-projects in its pipeline on a first-come, first\n            served basis. In the absence of such requirements, the Bank\n            should not have postponed the appraisal of sub-projects from\n            certain sectors in favor of other those from other sectors,\n            particularly in the context where disbursement levels were\n            generally below targets. HFIC generally complied with the\n            financial covenants of the project with the exception of\n            isolated incidents that were a result of directed\n            investments of HCMC PC in sub-projects that were channeled\n            through HFIC. The sequenced preparation and implementation\n            of HDP and Local Development Investment Fund Project (LDIFP)\n            has strategically allowed the Bank to distill and apply\n            lessons from the implementation of HDP to the design and\n            implementation of LDIFP in real-time. In the case of HDP\n            which was implemented in very constrained economic\n            conditions for private sector investors, the strong\n            commitment of HCMC PC and HFIC to promote the project to the\n            investor community, to provide technical assistance to\n            private sector partners in applying the project manual, and\n            to collaborate very closely with the Bank team in\n            continuously developing the pipeline of subprojects and\n            appraising potential sub-projects, were critical in ensuring\n            the achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO)\n            and the commitment of the full International Development\n            Association (IDA) credit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Ho

This manual requires that\n            private sector parties who make unsolicited proposals must\n            submit enough details to allow HIFU and the Hochiminh\n            People's Committee (PC) to make a very informed\n            decision on the project. This information is the same that\n            would have been prepared by HIFU and the line departments if\n            the project had been initiated by the PC. In other words,\n            the private sector must meet all the requirements that HIFU\n            shall specify in accordance with this manual so that HIFU\n            can verify and interrogate the information and complete the\n            requirements for the feasibility study. The purpose of this\n            project preparation manual is to provide HIFU with an\n            outline of the various tasks required in the selection,\n            preparation, and management of investment projects as well\n            as providing information on the preparation of feasibility\n            studies and the various appraisal processes. The project\n            preparation manual has been prepared in line with the\n            various tasks and activities considered necessary for\n            developing a proposed municipal infrastructure project to\n            the level where it can be considered for financing by HIFU."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Environment risk management plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Ho Chi Minh City\n            Investment Fund for Urban (HIFU) Development Project :\n            operational manual (Vol. 5) : Environment risk management plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/05/12463890/vietnam-ho-chi-minh-city-investment-fund-urban-hifu-development-project-operational-manual-vol-5-environment-risk-management-plan","projn":"VN-Ho Chi Minh City Investment Fund For\n            Urban Development Project -- P104848","docty":"Manual","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Transport Economics Policy & Planning,Labor Policies,Roads & Highways,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Transport,Social Protections and Labor,Environment","count":"Vietnam","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20100624000001"},"theme":"Urban services and housing for the poor,Other urban development,Municipal finance","subsc":"General transportation sector,Solid waste management,Sanitation,Other social services,Health","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Transport,Social Protections and Labor,Environment","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"acceleration, accident prevention,\n            accidents, air, Air pollutant, air pollutants, air quality,\n            BRIDGE, car, CONSTRUCTION, drivers, dust, emission,\n            environmental, environmental protection, equipments,\n            exploitation, HIGHWAY, HIGHWAY INVESTMENT, human resource,\n            inspection, insurance, manpower, material, Natural Resource,\n            noise, pollution, RISK MANAGEMENT, road, roads, route,\n            Safety, safety regulations, sand, sites, steel, supervision,\n            tax, technical department, traffic, traffic accidents,\n            traffic safety, transport, transportation, trucks, velocity,\n            walking, waste disposal, waste management"}},"owner":"Vietnam Sustainable Development (EASVS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Financial Intermediary Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"majtheme":"Urban development","repnb":"E2122"},"facets":{}}}
