Some lessons learned: Accreditation processes\n            are difficult in remote regions and are vulnerable to\n            manipulation. When carried out as envisioned, the National\n            Board of Accreditation's certification is comprehensive\n            and rigorous. However, it is frequently difficult to arrange\n            for experts to visit institutes in remote regions, and there\n            is potential for manipulation of the accreditation process.\n            Autonomy is important, but institutes must be ready for it\n            in terms of accountability and initiative. A number of\n            institutes receiving autonomy under both projects benefitted\n            in terms of being able to pursue cutting-edge fields of\n            research and cost recovery. However, many were not equipped\n            to make effective use of autonomy, due to low confidence,\n            responsibility and initiative. Systemic reform in Indian\n            technical education is incomplete without the inclusion of\n            private institutes. Given that private institutes enroll\n            approximately 85 percent of all students studying\n            engineering in India, improving the technical education\n            system requires their participation on a much larger scale\n            than occurred in either project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Third Technician Education Project ;\n            and Technical and Engineering

- Technical and Engineering Education\n            Quality Improvement Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Technical and\n            Engineering Education Quality Improvement Project (TEQIP)\n            for India were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: strong\n            ownership of the central and state governments is essential\n            to successful project implementation, especially if the\n            project is designed to do the right things at the right time\n            which has been the case with TEQIP. The instrument chosen\n            for the project, a reforms-based Specific Investment Loan\n            (SIL) embedded, worked well in India where there were a\n            large number of states and institutions competing for\n            project funds. Competitive funding of institutions is a\n            flexible tool that can be used to support changing sector\n            priorities by selecting appropriate eligibility and\n            selection criteria. Voluntary participation by states to\n            implement reforms increases the likelihood of their success.\n            Innovations introduced under reform-oriented investment\n            projects can have spill-over effects on parts of the sector\n            not under the purview of the project. Similarly, strong\n            ownership coupled with demonstrable positive project\n            outcomes can create a receptive platform for further\n            innovations. Implementation performance depends on the\n            availability of adequate full-time staff and their timely\n            training in implementation procedures; ideally prior to\n            project effectiveness. Staff continuity should be maintained\n            as much as possible to reduce delays caused by unfilled\n            posts and time taken by new staff to learn the job.\n            Decentralizing project implementation to the institution\n            level can increase participation but execution can get\n            delayed because it takes time to train all the implementers\n            in the proper procedures. Additionally, good communication\n            mechanisms between the institutions and state level\n            implementing agencies and the state and central level\n            agencies, if absent, can delay or even derail\n            implementation. Any reform-based project in the technical\n            and engineering sector cannot omit private institutions who\n            dominate as providers. Private aided and unaided\n            institutions used the resources provided under the project\n            well. However, given their relative unfamiliarity with\n            public procurement methods, they may need greater\n            supervision and training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Technical and Engineering Education\n            Quality Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Technical and Engineering\n            Education Quality Improvement Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/09/11235128/india-technical-engineering-education-quality-improvement-project","projn":"IN-Technical/Engineering Education Quality\n            Improvement Project -- P072123","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Teaching and Learning,Access & Equity in Basic Education,Housing & Human Habitats,E-Business,Tertiary Education","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Education","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20091020235645"},"theme":"Education for the knowledge economy,Other social development","subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"academic autonomy, Academic calendar,\n            academic excellence, academic institutions, Academic\n            Progress, academic quality, academic year, Accreditation,\n            Accreditation of Programs, achievement, achievements,\n            Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, binary\n            information, block grants, capacity building, choice of\n            courses, classrooms, Colleges, communities, competitiveness,\n            continuing education, counseling, credit transfers,\n            Curricula, degrees, demonstration, description,\n            disadvantaged students, disciplines, education programs,\n            EDUCATION QUALITY, education sector, educational policies,\n            Employment, enabling environment, engineering education,\n            engineers, Enrollment, equipment, external efficiency,\n            Faculty Development, faculty members, faculty positions,\n            faculty quality, female, female students, formative\n            evaluation, future students, Gender, girls, global market,\n            grade inflation, graduate education, graduate programs,\n            Higher Education, Higher Education Financial Management,\n            higher education institutions, higher education system,\n            human capital, Human Development, Human Resource, Human\n            Resource Development, Human Resources, ICT, ID, Implementing\n            Agencies, Implementing Agency, indigenous people, Indigenous\n            Peoples, Information System, information systems,\n            innovation, innovations, Institution, institutional\n            capacity, internal processes, interventions, investments in\n            education, IP, knowledge economy, labor force, labor market,\n            learning, learning process, lectures, libraries, Management\n            System, manufacturing, market place, material, mentors,\n            networks, organizational change, participations, Performance\n            Indicator, Performance Indicators, policy framework,\n            polytechnics, post-graduate students, Postgraduate\n            Education, postgraduate students, principals, private\n            institutions, private sector, problem solving, procurement,\n            productivity, Professional Publications, professors, Project\n            management, public funds, quality assurance, quality of\n            education, quality of teaching, R &amp; D, R &amp;D,\n            R&amp;D, remedial classes, remedial teaching, result,\n            RESULTS, retention, scholars, scientists, semester system,\n            settlement, skilled manpower, social development, staff\n            development, Student Performance, student satisfaction,\n            Supervision, Targets, teacher, Teachers, teaching, Technical\n            assistance, Technical Education, technical staff, technical\n            support, telecommunications, Tertiary education, tertiary\n            education reforms, training programs, training workshops,\n            trainings, tuition, tuition income, undergraduate education,\n            undergraduate teaching, universities, University Grants,\n            uses, verification, workers"}},"owner":"S.A.

As such, the status of\n            enrollment in Indian engineering education is reviewed, as\n            well as the initiatives, and enabling mechanisms taken by\n            the Government through the existing national policy, in\n            providing education coverage for people with special needs,\n            for women, and minorities. The project fully endorses such\n            policy, and will support the cause of schedule castes (SCs)\n            and schedule tribes (STs) students, in protecting the\n            interests of indigenous persons, particularly that of the\n            SC/STs. It is not envisaged that new institutions will be\n            created, thus it is unlikely adverse impacts will affect\n            STs' land rights. The quality of education for SC/STs\n            will be enhanced, to meet international standards, focusing\n            in particular, on popularizing technical education among\n            SC/ST communities. The legal framework, and constitutional\n            provisions allow for the advancement of socially, and\n            educationally backward classes of citizens, and, promotes\n            special care for the educational, and economic interests of\n            the weaker sections of the population. Claims shall be taken\n            into consideration, through grievance mechanisms due to\n            discrimination against SC/STs candidates, through the\n            judicial system, and by the National Commission for SC/STs,\n            in addition, counseling and advisory services will also be provided."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
