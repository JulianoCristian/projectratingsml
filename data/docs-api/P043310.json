This report\n            therefore states that although Coal India Ltd. (CIL) and the\n            Government of India (GOI) have expressed their willingness\n            to act on a number of the outstanding issues, the pace of\n            resolution in some cases has been rather slow due to the\n            complexity of the issue, and the constraints of the existing\n            legal context. This also limits the impacts of the\n            Bank's efforts to facilitate desirable resolutions. As\n            described in the report, there are a number of issues for\n            which Bank supervision has already been terminated (issues 6\n            and 9) or which Management now proposes the Bank should no\n            longer supervise, either because they are substantially\n            resolved (issues 1 and 4) or because there is little\n            prospect that further Bank supervision would impact outcomes\n            (issues 5 and 7). For the remaining issues - settlement of\n            claims for Project affected people (PAP) cultivating land\n            under customary tenure (issue 2), provision of long-term\n            leases for their house plots in the resettlement area (issue\n            3), and mechanisms for consultation and dissemination of\n            project related information to PAPs (issue 8) - Management\n            proposes to monitor development for a further six months,\n            and to intervene if it believes this would help further\n            progress.

A number of\n            lessons are drawn from the project experience as follows.\n            Although the cancellation of the main investment loan for\n            the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project (CSRP) could not have\n            been anticipated, it was a contributing factor in\n            diminishing the different subsidiaries independence against\n            the development of a strong central authority in\n            implementing changes; rather agreements should be made\n            directly with the implementing agencies, not simply with\n            their parent holding companies. The planning and targets for\n            organizational change should be informed by a comprehensive,\n            and realistic institutional assessment, undertaken at\n            project preparation, built into the project design, to allow\n            a more deliberate phasing of activities, and more systematic\n            learning from those activities. This could have allowed that\n            issues requiring decisions by ministries other than those\n            responsible for project implementation (e.g. the Law\n            Ministry regarding decisions on security of tenure for plots\n            in resettlement sites, and mine land allocated for land\n            based income generation) be made conditions of appraisal,\n            not left to be resolved during project implementation.\n            Safeguard policy frameworks agreed with the borrower, should\n            be specific and detailed on the obligations of the Borrower\n            regarding assistance and entitlements. Determination of\n            Borrower obligations cannot be left to decisions during\n            project implementation. Thus, Coal of India Ltd. -CIL's\n            resettlement policy would have benefited from more detailed\n            description of the entitlements of project affected people\n            (PAP) concerning self-employment, i.e. effective\n            self-employment assistance cannot consist only of skills\n            training, rather should include investment assistance, and\n            assistance to establish market linkages. Similarly,\n            community development activities such as the Indigenous\n            Peoples Development Plans, need to incorporate a clear\n            time-bound exit strategy for external support, enabling an\n            assessment of the organizational performance arrangements to\n            promote sustainability. Moreover, mitigation activities\n            (e.g., environmental protection) should be in compliance\n            with national laws, and monitored by state agencies, with\n            the Bank actively involved in complying with such policies.\n            to this end, air quality improvements cannot be achieved\n            solely by dust suppression measures implemented by the CIL\n            mines, but rather through coordinated efforts involving the\n            Thermal Power Stations, local industries, non-CIL mines,\n            together with proper road maintenance by the relevant state authorities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

Coal Sector Environment and Social\n            Mitigation Project : Management Report and Recommendation in\n            Response to the Inspection Panel Investigation Report"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This report comprises Management's\n            Report and Recommendation in Response to the\n            Inspection's Panel Investigation Report (report no.\n            24000) related to the India Coal Sector Environmental and\n            Social Mitigation Project. As noted by the Panel in its\n            Report, Management acknowledges that with hindsight, there\n            were deficiencies in the project appraisal process, even\n            though the World Bank complied with most of its formal\n            obligations at appraisal. Management also endorses the\n            Panel's observation that concerted efforts were made\n            with the help of thorough and extensive supervision of\n            project implementation to address those deficiencies in a\n            prompt and timely manner. While the success of resettlement\n            -implementation depends on a range of factors including\n            borrower commitment, the macroeconomic environment, the\n            continuing feasibility of rehabilitation measures considered\n            appropriate at the time of project appraisal and the efforts\n            of the affected people themselves, Management agrees that\n            the World Bank team made every effort to promote successful\n            resettlement throughout project implementation. The fact\n            that this may not have resulted in fully successful\n            resettlement for every project-affected person (PAP) does\n            not necessarily represent a failure of World Bank\n            supervision. Experience under the project, the objectives of\n            which included testing the effectiveness of government\n            policies, highlights the complexity of the resettlement\n            process and some important lessons that can be learned to\n            inform future resettlement programs. In this report,\n            Management asserts that the World Bank made every effort to\n            apply its policies and procedures and to pursue its mission\n            statement in the context of the project; that it remains\n            committed to a process of consultation and disclosure to\n            support the achievement of the project's environmental\n            and social objectives; that it intends to continue to\n            utilize its dialogue with the Government (GOI) and its\n            public sector enterprise, Coal India Ltd., to: (1) monitor\n            provision of support to communities, in particular tribal\n            living in coal mining areas, including the issuance of land\n            titles/long-term leases to PAPs; (2) encourage establishment\n            of an Independent Monitoring Panel to support resolution of\n            issues related to subsistence allowances and land titling;\n            and (3) advise GOI on apparent entitlements for subsistence\n            allowances for 121 eligible families in Parej East.\n            Management also proposes to continue post-project\n            supervision until June 30, 2004, when all of the outstanding\n            actions are expected to be completed. The Report identifies\n            several lessons learned from this project experience: 1)\n            Assumptions about organizational change should be realistic.\n            2) Efforts should be made to strengthen national and state\n            level legislation. 3) Mechanisms for institutional\n            coordination should be carefully assessed during\n            preparation. 4) Critical issues should be resolved prior to\n            initiation of implementation. 5) Obligations of implementing\n            agencies should be clear and specific. 6)  Innovative\n            approaches should be explored for restoration of livelihoods\n            in mine-related resettlement. 7) Thorough analysis of the\n            feasibility and risks of proposed resettlement options\n            should be conducted during project preparation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

This Report concerns only the\n            Parej East mine, owned and operated by Central Coal India\n            Ltd. (CCL), a subsidiary of Coal India Ltd. (GIL), where two\n            villages, Parej and Durukasmar, are affected by mine\n            expansion operations. The Request for Inspection was\n            submitted on June 21, 2001 by a representative of\n            Chotanagpur Adivasi Sewa Samiti (CASS), a local\n            nongovernmental organization (NGO) representing residents of\n            Parej East. The Requesters claimed that they had suffered\n            harm as a result of failures and omissions of IDA in the\n            design and implementation of the CSESMP in Parej East\n            Project area. They claim that their rights to participation\n            and consultation were effectively denied them. The\n            Requesters believe they have been deprived of fair and\n            adequate compensation for their lands and villages. They\n            have focused their key complaint on the failure to restore\n            their income levels. Although previously landowners, they\n            now claim to be living in colonies without legal possession\n            of any land, where their former skills are no longer\n            applicable, their productive sources dismantled, and their\n            supporting networks and kin groups dispersed. This harm is\n            alleged to be the result of the Management violating various\n            provisions of the following Bank policies and procedures:\n            Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.30), Indigenous Peoples (OD\n            4.20), Environmental Assessment (OD 4.01), Project\n            Supervision (OD 13.05), Disclosure of Information (BP\n            17.50), and Management of Cultural Property (OPN 11.03). In\n            its Response of July 2001, Management maintained that the\n            Bank had complied, and intended to continue complying, with\n            the relevant policies and procedures related to the design\n            and implementation of the CSESMP. After reviewing\n            Management's Response and visiting the Project area,\n            the Panel recommended an investigation to the Board of\n            Executive Directors. The Board approved the Panel's\n            recommendation on September 7,200l. The Requesters made\n            subsequent submissions, which were received and reviewed by\n            Management. This report finds that Management has failed to\n            comply with OD 4.30 with regard to certain aspects of\n            involuntary resettlement, among them, land and housing\n            compensation, and resettlement sites, compensation for loss\n            of access to forest products, income restoration; jobs in\n            the mine, non-farm-based self-employment, income restoration\n            through self-employment, and the feasibility of changing\n            project-affected persons (PAPs) into entrepreneurs and\n            generating income before displacement as well as supporting\n            them during the transition  period in the resettlement site.\n            Other findings concerned alternative income generating\n            schemes, land reclamation and water quality management, the\n            indigenous peoples development plan, stakeholder\n            consultation and information disclosure, and project supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Coal Sector Environmental and Social\n            Mitigation Project : the Inspection Panel Investigation Report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India -
