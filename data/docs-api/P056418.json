Some\n            lessons learned includes: the performance agreement, though\n            not as successful in other countries, turned out to be a\n            success in Lesotho due to three main reasons. The main\n            lesson learned is, that, despite accumulated experience\n            elsewhere, performance agreements may be a successful tool\n            if strong government commitment is in place. The geographic\n            and economic context of small countries like Lesotho,\n            necessitate further attention to contract management issues.\n            The main lesson learned is that governments and the Bank\n            should strive to perceive sector reform agendas that are\n            comprehensive in terms of policy, legal and regulatory\n            environment, and have
