The overall outcome of the Mining\n            Sector Development and Environment Project is assessed as\n            moderately satisfactory in light of the project's\n            continuing relevance and the substantial progress in its\n            capacity-building objective. However, the sustainability of\n            the capacity building achievements of the project is now in\n            doubt and overall project sustainability is rated unlikely.\n            Bank performance is assessed as satisfactory, albeit only\n            marginally, given shortcomings in the project's quality\n            at entry. Borrower performance is assessed as unsatisfactory\n            because the Government did not provide proper sector\n            leadership, failed to reform the Geological Survey\n            Department and latterly did not provide adequate funding for\n            the Minerals Commission to operate effectively. The main\n            lessons learned are: 1) Improving the legal and fiscal\n            framework for private investors can be highly effective in\n            attracting inflows of capital to the mining sector. 2)\n            Legalization of artisanal mining is desirable but needs to\n            be accompanied by measures to tax and control the\n            environmental damage caused by such mining. 3) Effective,\n            transparent, and equitable mechanisms for transferring\n            resources back to communities affected by large-scale mining\n            are essential sociopolitical tools to ensure that tangible\n            economic benefits are felt by local people and that mining\n            has legitimacy in the eyes of the public."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -

Some lessons learned included:\n            implementation experience demonstrated that an appropriate\n            policy, legal and institutional framework is essential for\n            sustainable development of the mining sector. The\n            privatization of state-owned mines could not have taken\n            place without these elements. Open lines of communication,\n            positive attitudes and constructive working methods\n            developed by Bank task team and the staff of key\n            implementing agencies of the Borrower, contributed\n            significantly to successful project implementation leading\n            to almost total disbursement of the International\n            Development Association (IDA) Credit. Implementation\n            experience revealed the need for skills enhancement within\n            sectoral agencies as well in the private sector. An urgent\n            need exists for technical, economic, legal and environmental\n            skills pertaining to mining, to be developed in the private\n            sector. The flexibility in project design was a major factor\n            which allowed the achievement of all stated project\n            objectives. It also enabled the implementation team to make\n            necessary improvements in the project design to meet\n            operational realities on the ground. As Bank and Government\n            policy related to privatization and private sector\n            development underwent significant changes during the life of\n            the project, the project
