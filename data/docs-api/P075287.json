Some lessons\n            learned included: take into account the small size of the\n            Lao PDR program and opportunity costs of the World Bank (WB)\n            team in pursuing an overambitious budget support operation.\n            In addition, every action or trigger should be accompanied\n            with technical assistance (TA) or other WB program in order\n            to achieve outcomes. The reform areas to which the\n            Government has not fully committed or that do not have\n            enough capacity or champions in the Government that are able\n            to lead reforms should not be included, while the dialog in\n            these areas should continue through other instruments, such\n            as analytical and advisory services (AAAs) and capacity\n            building activities.

Relying on outcomes will also allow focusing on\n            achieving outcomes through a coherent and well-timed\n            program, rather than focusing on having an action in each\n            sub-sector every year. Triggers and actions should be worded\n            more flexibly and indicatively, to allow for adjustments\n            along the way that would lead to better outcomes rather than\n            fulfilling the matrix to the letter.

programmatic three-year\n            policy reform Program, and, performance indicators in line\n            with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The Project aims\n            at ensuring that public resources are both available, and\n            effectively used to meet Lao PDR's development\n            outcomes. Three broad benefits can be identified: improved\n            public expenditure management performance; alignment of\n            public expenditures with pro-poor National Growth and\n            Poverty eradication Strategy (NGPES) goals; and, enhanced\n            environment for growth and revenue generation.

The project benefits outweigh its risks, and\n            furthermore, an explicit recognition by the Government of\n            weaknesses, will place Capacity Enhancement (CE) at the\n            center of the reform program.
