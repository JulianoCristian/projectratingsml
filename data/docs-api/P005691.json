The purpose of the project was\n            to facilitate implementation of the new housing policy\n            adopted by the Tunisian Government in July 1988. The project\n            was designed essentially to: (a) increase the supply of\n            affordable housing by simplifying the allocation of\n            resources to low-income households, by mobilizing domestic\n            savings and facilitating the conversion in April 1989 of the\n            National Housing and Savings Fund (Caisse nationale\n            d'epargne-logement or CNEL) into a housing bank (BH)\n            with the legal status of a privatebank, and by granting a\n            line of credit to this institution, which would be\n            restructured to focus on housing programs geared to\n            low-income families; (b) increase participation by the\n            private sector in developing sites, building housing, and\n            performing the topographic work involved; (c) simplify the\n            regulatory system governing land development and housing\n            construction; and (d) begin modernizing the land management\n            information system by simplifying land registration and\n            management procedures. The main lessons have to do with the\n            need to pursue housing finance reform in Tunisia-by\n            diversifying the financial products available on the market\n            and by facilitating financing for other banks to prevent a\n            de facto monopoly by BH. The lessons taught by the failure\n            with the land management component should convince\n            decisionmakers that any new reform in the sector needs to be\n            preceded by some key decisions, such as appointment of a\n            sole responsible official with access to adequate resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Fifth Urban
