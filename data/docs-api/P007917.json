It is reiterated that in emergency\n            situations, where a rapid response from the Bank is needed,\n            the use of an existing loan is often likely to be the most\n            appropriate mechanism to achieve responsiveness. The\n            assessment of outcome is satisfactory, sustainability\n            likely, though the institutional development impact, only\n            modest. Lessons suggest that following the emergency,\n            reconstruction works, particularly those involving large\n            capital investments, and operation and maintenance\n            requirements, should be carefully appraised, subject to the\n            same technical, economic, financial, and institutional\n            analysis as for similar investments. And, during\n            implementation of similar projects, the Government should\n            avoid shifting responsibilities to other agencies during the\n            course of project execution, whereas a clear agreement on\n            responsibilities for project implementation at inception,\n            would both facilitate the likelihood for follow-up, and\n            sustainability after project completion. It is recommended\n            that countries with El Nino type phenomena experiences,\n            should undertake contingency planning, and preventive\n            measures, while many of these types of investments should be\n            incorporated in regular sector investment programs, during\n            non-emergency periods."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay -

However results were mixed, for although\n            private sector strengthening, produced outputs in terms of\n            relevant outcome indicators, the quality of these outcomes\n            was inadequate. Hence, sustainability is rated unlikely,\n            though institutional development impacts are modest.\n            Furthermore, while the performance of the borrower is\n            unsatisfactory, based on the weak preparation efforts\n            stemming from the lack of consensus within the Government,\n            the Bank performance is rated satisfactory, not only because\n            of sound project preparation, and supervision, but because\n            of its responsiveness to, and understanding of the\n            Government's concerns. Two main lessons are learned\n            from this project. 1) New laws, and regulations are not\n            sufficient to produce effective policy changes, particularly\n            when political powers, will not enforce them. The\n            Government's commitment to financial reforms was\n            largely subdued, illustrated in the form of delays in\n            submitting, and approving new banking legislation,\n            aggravated by the reluctance to apply legislation timely,\n            and consistently. 2) Effective strengthening of the\n            financial sector, legal, and regulatory framework should\n            precede any credit line operation, not merely accompany it,\n            and, credit lines should not use public banks as financial\n            intermediaries. The project demonstrates the high risks\n            posed by a credit line operation, in a country with a weak\n            banking system, poor regulatory framework, and thriving\n            political influences."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay -
