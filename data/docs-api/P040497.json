Some lessons learned\n            included: the Mexico experience demonstrates the need for\n            policymakers to be sensitive to the negative incentives\n            created by emergency programs for the financial sector. In\n            particular, it highlights the importance of ordinarily\n            conditioning relief to troubled banks on replacement of\n            existing management. The Bank's efforts in one area of\n            the financial sector need to be placed in the context of an\n            over-all strategy for policy actions in the sector. The\n            financial sector policy matrix developed in the spring of\n            1996 and revised repeatedly since then has served as an\n            instrument for assisting the Bank and its counterparts to\n            develop a more consistent and coherent strategy in such\n            related areas as banking, pension reform, housing, capital\n            markets development, and rural financial markets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Financial Sector Restructuring Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Financial Sector\n            Restructuring Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/05/731676/mexico-financial-sector-restructuring-loan-project","projn":"MX-Finan.
