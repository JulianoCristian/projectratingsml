The transcarpathian biodiversity protection\n            project was supported by a global environmental facility\n            (GEF) grant (the total cost of the project is United States\n            (U.S.) 0.58 million dollars, the GEF grant is U.S. 0.50\n            million dollars). The project objective was to demonstrate\n            the modern principles of environmental protection and\n            regenerating ecology in Ukraine, as well as to maintain an\n            initiative of the international biosphere reserve that was\n            developed by Ukraine, Poland, and the Slovak Republic. In\n            1994-1999, the Danube delta biodiversity project (with the\n            total cost of the project of U.S. 1.7 million dollars and a\n            GEF grant of U.S. 1.5 million dollars) was implemented. The\n            project provided support for protecting and improving the\n            conditions of the Ukrainian part of the ecological system of\n            Europe's largest waterway delta, which had a beneficial\n            effect on the general situation regarding preservation of\n            its biodiversity. The project for ozone depleting substances\n            phase-out in Ukraine (GEF grant of U.S. 23.2 million\n            dollars) is currently at the stage of implementation. The\n            project envisages support for the measures to replace\n            dangerous technologies at enterprises in the areas of\n            refrigerating engineering and production of aerosols,\n            solvents, and halons. Still another grant of the global\n            ecological facility is aimed at implementing the project for\n            GEF biodiversity conservation in the Azov-black sea\n            ecological corridor (the total cost of the project is U.S.\n            9.3 million dollars and a GEF grant is U.S. 6.9 million\n            dollars). The project objective consists in conserving\n            biological diversity in the territories along the Ukrainian\n            coast of the black and Azov seas. The GEF biodiversity\n            conservation project is carried out in two stages (the total\n            cost of the project is U.S. 112 million dollars). The\n            project is aimed at supporting an efficient long-term\n            strategy for the protection and well-balanced utilization of\n            Ukraine's biodiversity, and involving representatives\n            of the state and private sectors of the economy, as well as\n            expert researchers in partnership cooperation on these\n            issues. Promoting attraction of investments to the reformed\n            areas is one of the directions of the strategic assistance\n            rendered by international financial donors to Ukraine. The\n            project for managing Crimea's coastal zone and reducing\n            biogenous contamination (Black sea and Danube program of GEF\n            strategic partnership), aims to achieve this goal (a GEF\n            grant is U.S. 70 million dollars). Presently, the World Bank\n            and the Ukrainian Government are discussing possible\n            measures to be taken under the project, and sources of local financing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"World Bank projects in environment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"World Bank projects in environment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2004/04/23955291/world-bank-projects-environment","count":"Ukraine","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Industry and trade,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"basin, Biodiversity, Biodiversity\n            Conservation, Biodiversity Conservation Project,\n            Biodiversity Project, Biodiversity Protection, biological\n            diversity, Biosphere, Biosphere Reserve, Coastal Zone,\n            ecological balance, ecological system, ecology,\n            environmental protection, Geographic Information, Geographic\n            Information System, issues, national parks, natural\n            habitats, natural resources, nature, partnership, protected\n            areas, Sea, Seas, wetlands"}},"majtheme":"Rural development,Environment and natural resource management,Financial and private sector development,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Rule of law","topic":"Environmental Management and Mitigation\n            Plans m1327126 2307,Environmental Safeguards m1327127 901,Environmental Management m1327125 598,Environmental Laws and Regulations\n            m1326889 849,Ecosystem Management m1326434 1829","projn":"UA-Transcarpathian Biodiversity Protection\n            Gef Project -- P009103,UA-Black Sea Umbrella/Crimea Coastal Zone\n            Management -- P091029,UA-Ukraine Phase II Biodiversity Enabling\n            Activity -- P073418,UA-Rural Land Titling & Cadastre\n            Development Project -- P035777,UA-Azov Black Sea Corridor Biodiversity\n            Conservation Gef Project -- P048790,UA-Ozone Depleting Substances Phase-Out Gef\n            Project -- P044728,UA-Danube Delta Biodiversity Gef Project -- P039166","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Ecosystems and Natural Habitats,Biodiversity,Housing & Human Habitats,Wildlife Resources,Common Property Resource Development","teratopic":"Environment,Rural Development,Communities and Human Settlements","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150204145650"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Forestry,Other industry,Other social services,Agricultural extension and research,Sub-national government administration,Central government administration,Sewerage","theme":"Biodiversity,Environmental policies and institutions,Pollution management and environmental health,Legal institutions for a market economy,Personal and property rights,Rural markets,State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization,Other rural development,Participation and civic engagement,Water resource management,Land administration and management","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Environment,Rural Development,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"Global Environment Project,Recipient Executed Activities,IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Environmental Management and Mitigation\n            Plans m1327126 2307,Environmental Safeguards m1327127 901,Environmental Management m1327125 598,Environmental Laws and Regulations\n            m1326889 849,Ecosystem Management m1326434 1829","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["B","C","F"],"trustfund":"TF054320-BLACK SEA UMBRELLA/CRIMEA\n            COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT,BBGEF-BB GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL FUND,TF028968-GEF2-UKRAINE: GRANT FOR\n            PREPARATION OF BIODIVERSITY PHASE II ENABLING A,TF025449-PHRD-HEALTH SECTOR\n            RESTRUCTURING PROJ.,TF029537-PHRD-TITLE REGISTRATION PROJECT,TF034032-UKRAINE - AGRICULTURE,TF034354-UKRAINE - NATIONAL TITLE\n            REGISTRATION PROJECT,TF036049-UKRAINE - TITLE REGISTRATION PROJECT,TF038444-UKRAINE:  TITLE REGISTRATION\n            & LAND REGISTRATION PROJECTS,TF040887-UKRAINE: RURAL LAND TITLING PROJECT,TF040898-UKRAINE: RURAL LAND TITLING PROJECT,TF028267-GEF1 - UKRAINE : AZOV-BLACK SEA\n            CORRIDOR BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROJ,TF028961-GEF1-PDF B UKRAINE BIODIVERSITY\n            CONSERVATION IN AZOV-BLACK SEA,TF040319-UKRAINE - BIODIVERSITY\n            CONSERVATION - AZOV BLACK SEA,TF020426-GEF - UKRAINE PHASEOUT OF OZONE\n            SUBSTANCE PROJECT,TF028469-GEF1 PDF B: ODS PHASEOUT\n            PROJECT UKRAINE,TF034529-UKRAINE - OZONE DEPLETING SUBSTANCES,TF034565-UKRAINE - PHASEOUT OF OZONE\n            DEPLETING SUBSTANCES,TF035750-EASTERN EUROPE - (GEORGIA -\n            NEAP, UKRAINE - DONETSK-ENV.

There are four main project components.\n            The first implements management measures at priority marine\n            and terrestrial protected areas in the corridor by 1)\n            creating or expanding protected areas at two national parks;\n            2) preparing and implementing management plans for these\n            protected areas and three existing protected areas; and 3)\n            providing professional development for park staff in\n            protected areas administration and management planning,\n            wetland and waterbird ecology, and managmeent, warden\n            skills, and visitor management. The second component\n            develops and implements a corridor conservation strategy for\n            maintaining the corridor's ecological function by 1)\n            identifying and prioritizing key natural areas and\n            ecological functions and their managmeent requirements using\n            remote-sensing assisted inventories of natural habitats; 2)\n            establishing a monitoring system; 3) finalizing the coastal\n            protected area plan; and 4) preparing land use plans in\n            selected raions. The third component builds awareness and\n            support for wetlands conservation through an environmental\n            education program and implements a competitive small grants\n            program. This projet will work together with the Rural Land\n            Titling Project to assess the environmental management needs\n            of lands within the former collective farm as the fourth
