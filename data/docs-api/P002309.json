The project failed to\n            achieve its original production objectives due to\n            lower-than-expected rainfall and unfavorable soil\n            conditions. The project was reoriented away from pure\n            production objectives toward the reconstitution and\n            protection of the natural, local vegetative cover. Except\n            for chronic financial problems, project implementation was\n            successful after reorientation. The project also generated a\n            number of hard-to-quantify benefits, including advances in\n            forest cover reconstitution techniques; excellent training\n            of forest technicians and extension workers; and an\n            innovative approach to engage the rural population in\n            reafforestation and soil management. Performance under the\n            natural forest management and the planning, monitoring, and\n            economic studies component was disappointing, while the\n            training component activities were successful. Although the\n            educational benefits of the rural forestry and training\n            component are sustainable, the majority of\n            directly-productive activities will likely not be\n            sustainable without further assistance. The Bank bears\n            responsibility for overly optimistic project objectives and\n            a somewhat inappropriate assessment of project risks. While\n            the Bank responded quickly and showed commendable\n            flexibility in the reorientation, its supervision missions\n            were lacking in several areas. The Borrower provided very\n            proficient and highly motivated staff. However, there were\n            problems with disbursement of counterpart funds, slow\n            processing of requests, and division of responsibility which\n            led to delays. The project yielded a number of lessons.\n            Pedological and climatic conditions in Senegal's\n            Centre-Est do not allow for cost-effective wood production\n            in industrial plantations, but other methods do exist. Yet,\n            these remain too expensive under the current Senegalese wood\n            price system and are unlikely to meet increasing demand.\n            Planting in and around farmland can be profitable, although\n            these markets may quickly be saturated. Forests cannot be\n            viewed as mere wood reserves, but must be managed as an\n            integrated system of resources. The rural population is\n            increasingly aware of the dangers of wood resource\n            degradation and can be effectively mobilized to contribute\n            to natural resource management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal -
