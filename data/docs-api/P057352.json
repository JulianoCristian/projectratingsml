Lessons learned\n            included: 1) The design of water supply plants needs to be\n            developed based on a combination of cost-effective technical\n            specifications, appropriate and well-defined design\n            standards and accurate forecasting of future demand for\n            water consumption; 2) Positive hygiene behavior change is a\n            long-term process that requires targeted, effective and\n            sustained hygiene promotion messages; 3) In order to\n            maximize the benefits of the projects, it is important that\n            sufficient attention be given to sanitation and hygiene\n            promotion and these should be well integrated and\n            coordinated with water supply investments and activities; 4)\n            Ensuring community participation in the design, planning,\n            implementation and post-construction management of the\n            project is challenging if insufficient project budget is\n            allocated at the project design stage for these activities\n            and there are insufficient capacity and mechanisms to\n            support such participation; 5) The principle of user\n            financing has worked effectively in China and is an example\n            for global dissemination; 6) Clarity on the issues of water\n            supply plant ownership and ways to expedite the hand-over\n            process for completed plants would strengthen\n            post-construction management arrangements, leading to\n            greater sustainability and better service; 7) Households\n            need to be offered a choice of affordable sanitation options\n            as well as adequate information in order to make an informed\n            decision; 8) Better coordination amongst the many line\n            departments with responsibilities for the sector would help\n            to improve the efficiency of the project and the skill\n            available for implementation; 9) The potential impact of\n            natural disasters, such as typhoons and droughts, needs to\n            be considered when assessing the availability of water\n            resources and emergency preparedness; 10) Consideration\n            needs to be given to the increased wastewater produced by\n            increased water consumption, particularly in densely\n            populated areas; and 11) Any covenant which is set to ensure\n            the sustainability for the water supply schemes, should be\n            developed taking into account the actual requirements for\n            rural water supply schemes and the affordability of beneficiaries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

The RWS\n            program consisted of four successive projects (Rural Water\n            Supply Project, National Rural Supply Project, National\n            Water Supply and Sanitation Project, and Forth Rural Water\n            and Sanitation Project) that lasted over the last 17 years.\n            The total World Bank investment in these four projects was\n            US$628 million. The program succeeded at serving about 25\n            million people in 18 provinces and developed a very\n            effective cost recovery policy where the users finance up to\n            75 percent of the capital investment as well as the full\n            operation and maintenance (O&M) cost. With the World\n            Bank assistance, the RWS programs were designed to increase\n            rural access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation.\n            The first project was not specifically targeted at the poor\n            or based completely in rural areas, but both these policies\n            changed in succeeding projects. Within the selected\n            counties, denser areas were chosen to make the cost of\n            supplying piped water economically viable, and within the\n            selected villages, the network aimed to cover all economic\n            sections of the community. For the more remote and less\n            densely populated areas of the project provinces, the\n            approach was to provide hand pumps, rainwater collection\n            systems and small tube wells."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Willingness to charge and willingness to pay\n            : China Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Willingness to charge and\n            willingness to pay : China Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/03/9976970/willingness-charge-willingness-pay-china-rural-water-supply-sanitation-program","projn":"CN-Fourth Rural Water Supply Project -- P057352,CN-Rural Water S.

There are three project components: 1) Water\n            supply component will give villagers in all 27 counties the\n            opportunity to invest in improved water supplies. Households\n            can choose whether to invest in individual household\n            connections or to rely on community standposts. 2)\n            Sanitation and health education component will help to\n            reduce incidences of waterborne disease by a) making\n            available information on improved latrine designs, their\n            investment costs, and economic and health benefits through\n            sponsoring village information sessions about water supply,\n            improved latrines, and related hygiene practices; b)\n            financing improved latrine facilities on a demonstration\n            basis in project village schools and in selected households\n            in each project village; and c) identifying specific types\n            of behavioral change that will improve health conditions. 3)\n            Project management component will be in charge of the\n            county, province, and national project offices; provide\n
