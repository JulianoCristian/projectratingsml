Some\n            lessons learned included: sustaining the dialogue on\n            macroeconomic performance is critical for a satisfactory\n            outcome of a development policy credit. Much more care can\n            be exercised in establishing the outcome indicators in order\n            to better capture the relevant macroeconomic risks in a\n            high-uncertainty environment such as in Honduras. Linking\n            the program with analytical work is the key to providing the\n            basis for a satisfactory outcome. The design of the\n            operation was backed by solid analytical work which enabled\n            the bank team to respond to the government requests in a\n            short period of time under a difficult social and political\n            environment. All the Economic and Sector Work (ESW) allowed\n            the government and the team to identify priority policy\n            areas, build consensus around critical

The DPC operation supports\n            progress towards the Country Partnership Strategy objectives\n            of expanding opportunities and reducing vulnerabilities and\n            of improving citizen security. Specifically, the operation\n            supports four areas that are central to the reform program:\n            (1) tax administration, focused on improving taxpayer\n            compliance; (2) civil service reform, focused on the\n            rationalization of the public wage bill by delinking\n            teachers\u0092 salary adjustments from those reflected in the\n            private sector's minimum wage; (3) pension reform,\n            designed to lessen contingent fiscal vulnerabilities by\n            reducing the public pension institutions' actuarial\n            deficits, and (4) citizen security reform, focused on\n            strengthening institutional coordination mechanisms and\n            programs needed for an integrated violence prevention\n            strategy . The reforms supported by this operation are\n            expected to have a positive impact on poverty and inequality."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - First Programmatic Reducing\n

for SDR\n            49.6 million to the Republic of Honduras. The operation\n            supports the Government's program to tackle its\n            difficult fiscal situation in the short run, and to launch a\n            number of structural reforms that will pay off in the medium\n            to long run. Specifically, the operation supports four areas\n            that are central to the reform program: (i) tax reform,\n            including closing tax loopholes, widening some tax bases,\n            and improving tax administration; (ii) civil service reform,\n            focused on human resource management in the education sector\n            and a rationalization of the public wage bill; (iii) reform\n            of power sector tariffs to support the financial\n            sustainability of the state-owned electricity company; and\n            (iv) strengthening public financial management and\n            transparency by resolving outstanding public sector arrears\n            and investigating the shortcomings of the financial\n            management information system. The operation is prepared in\n            the context of an Interim Strategy Note, presented jointly\n            with this operation to the Board of Executive Directors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras
