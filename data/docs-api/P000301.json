While the performance by the Borrower is\n            satisfactory, despite the uneven, overall implementation,\n            until corrective measures were taken in late 1996-early\n            1997, the Bank's performance is unsatisfactory, given\n            the inappropriate implementation arrangements, and highly\n            inadequate supervision in the early years, with changes in\n            project objectives not adequately documented. Lessons\n            highlight that critical public sector reforms are possible\n            in a politically fragile environment, as proven by the\n            success of the public finance reform, which was internalized\n            because there was consensus for an improved budget\n            management, otherwise government activities would have been\n            suspended. However, idiosyncracy changes, could have\n            fostered the well prepared, though sensitive civil service\n            reform, which has yet to be implemented. Similarly,\n            institutional development is uncertain, and requires a\n            sustained engagement on the part of both the Government, and\n            the Bank. Conversely, information technology can be\n            successfully introduced in a poorly developed human resource\n            environment, provided external assistance, close attention\n            to technology transfer, and training programs are in place.\n            Finally, minimizing the financing of recurrent costs, was\n            paramount for project sustainability, while donor\n            coordination would have served better, under one influential\n            leadership role in a specific area of the national program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Public Institutional\n

The\n            project will facilitate the implementation of the\n            medium-term macroeconomic adjustment program introduced in\n            1990.  The strategy to sustain institutional development\n            includes:  (a) ensuring adequate legislative and\n            administrative rules in targeted institutions; (b) revising\n            existing procedures and adopting new ones for\n            resource/budgetary use in those institutions; and (c)\n            beginning to build national capacity to plan, manage, and\n            communicate resource management issues, through training\n            Burkinabe, rather than through widespread long-term\n            technical assistance.  Specifically, the project will:  (a)\n            reinforce information and budgetary management functions in\n            the  Administrative and Finance Departments and the Research\n            and Planning Departments of four priority ministries\n            (Finance, Health, Education, and Civil Service); (b) finance\n            a civil service census and introduce new procedures for\n            civil service management and training; (c) support an\n            updating of Burkina's public procurement code,\n            legislation, and procedures; (d) through legal, procedural\n            reforms, and training, assist in creating a favorable\n            business climate with appropriate commercial laws, judicial\n            practices and personnel; and (e) finance the training of\n            Burkinabe journalists in economic journalism so as to\n            improve the quality of analysis and reporting of economic policies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Public Institutional\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso - Public\n            Institutional Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/05/735470/burkina-faso-public-institutional-development-project","projn":"BF-Public Institutional -- P000301","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Banks & Banking Reform,Poverty Assessment,TF054599-PHRD-KYRGYZ REPUBLIC: WATER\n            MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT PROJECT,National Governance","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Burkina Faso","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961002211324"},"subsc":"Law and justice,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability,administrative\n            arrangements,administrative culture,administrative\n            functions,Administrative Reform,Administrative\n            Reforms,Audits,authorization,banking system,Civil\n            Service,Civil Service Reforms,climate,conceptual\n            framework,Currency Unit,donor agencies,donor\n            representatives,economic growth,economic management,economic\n            reform,Education,employment,Financial Planning,financial\n            resources,FISCAL,FISCAL YEAR,flexibility,Government\n            services,Government\n            spending,Health,immunization,Institutional\n            Development,institutional reform,Journalists,judicial\n            reforms,laws,Lawyer,legislation,Nations,negotiations,Operating\n            Costs,policy dialogue,policy framework,poverty\n            alleviation,Preparation,Primary Education,private\n            sector,public enterprises,public institutions,Public\n            Procurement,public resources,public sector,Public Sector\n            Management,Quality control,recurrent\n            costs,representatives,sector policy,service\n            quality,structural adjustment,structural reforms,technical\n            assistance,technical skills,technical support,time frame,transparency,TRANSPORT"},"1":{"cdata!":"accountability,administrative\n            arrangements,administrative culture,administrative\n            functions,Administrative Reform,Administrative\n            Reforms,Audits,authorization,banking system,Civil\n            Service,Civil Service Reforms,climate,conceptual\n            framework,Currency Unit,donor agencies,donor\n            representatives,economic growth,economic management,economic\n            reform,Education,employment,Financial Planning,financial\n            resources,FISCAL,FISCAL YEAR,flexibility,Government\n            services,Government\n            spending,Health,immunization,Institutional\n            Development,institutional reform,Journalists,judicial\n            reforms,laws,Lawyer,legislation,Nations,negotiations,Operating\n            Costs,policy dialogue,policy framework,poverty\n            alleviation,Preparation,Primary Education,private\n            sector,public enterprises,public institutions,Public\n            Procurement,public resources,public sector,Public Sector\n            Management,Quality control,recurrent\n            costs,representatives,sector policy,service\n            quality,structural adjustment,structural reforms,technical\n            assistance,technical skills,technical support,time frame,transparency,TRANSPORT"}},"owner":"Public Sector Reform & Capacity (AFTPR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF028098-UK (ODA) CONSULTANT TRUST FUND,TF021515-PUBLIC INSTITUTIONAL DEV.
