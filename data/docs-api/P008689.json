There are four lessons: 1)  Biodiversity\n            conservation cannot be carried out in isolation. It has to\n            be integrated within the economic interests of local and\n            regional communities. Resentment is created when financing\n            of nature conservation appears to have preference over unmet\n            local needs, be it employment or delivery of basic services.\n            Failure to integrate local interests in the conservation and\n            management strategy of a biosphere reserve can endanger its\n            longer-term sustainability. 2) Conservation areas will be\n            sustainable only if there is good management and sufficient\n            funding. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) project\n            designers must help establish sound management and\n            governance arrangements that include local stakeholders and\n            promote income-generating activities. 3)  When establishing\n            biodiversity reserves, facilitate networking of the reserve\n            staff with the national and international nongovernmental\n            organizations and promote recognition by international\n            conventions.  4) The GEF should move towards a\n            country-focused strategic approach to complement its\n            thematically-driven development framework. By doing so GEF\n            would develop synergy from a more coherent policy framework,\n            thus improving effectiveness and reducing transaction costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Danube Delta Biodiversity Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Danube Delta\n            Biodiversity Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6067886/romania-danube-delta-biodiversity-project","projn":"RO-Danube Delta Biodiversity Gef\n            Project-271505 -- P008689","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"Romania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050715142011"},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"Global Environment Project","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agriculture, aquatic resources,\n            BIODIVERSITY, biodiversity conservation, Biological\n            Diversity, Biosphere, birds, buffer zones, community\n            development, Conservation, Conservation areas, dams, delta\n            ecosystems, discharge, drainage, economic activity, economic\n            development, economic growth, economic value, ecosystem,\n            ecosystem restoration, ecosystems, employment, endangered\n            species, energy efficiency, Environment Protection,\n            environmental conservation, environmental degradation,\n            Environmental Protection, Environmental Protection Agency,\n            erosion, exchange rate, Exploitation, fauna, fish,\n            fisheries, fishing, flora, Forests, freshwater, Geographic\n            Information, geographic information systems, Global\n            Environment, Global Environment Facility, habitat, Habitats,\n            health services, high unemployment, housing, Income,\n            international conventions, international organizations,\n            intervention, inventories, isolation, lakes, land\n            management, land use, laws, legislation, local authorities,\n            migrants, migration, mitigation, natural resource\n            management, natural resources, nature conservation, nature\n            Reserves, pollution, ponds, productivity, protected areas,\n            public awareness, public sector, quotas, RAMSAR,\n            reclamation, recreation, resource use, sand, scientific\n            research, silviculture, social costs, strategic planning,\n            Sustainable Development, sustainable resource management,\n            sustainable resource use, sustainable use, transaction\n            costs, vegetation, waste, waste disposal, water pollution,\n            water resources, Waterfowl, wetland ecosystems, wetland\n            management, wetlands, wetlands management, Wildlife"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF028614-GET-PPA FOR ROMANIA DANUBE\n            DELTA BIO.,TF028660-GET-ROMANIA DANUBE DELTA BIODIVERSITY","repnb":"32684"},"891712":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2000/12/891712/romania-danube-delta-biodiversity-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2000/12/891712/romania-danube-delta-biodiversity-project","new_url":"2000/12/891712/romania-danube-delta-biodiversity-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/03/01/000094946_01021005390542/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/03/01/000094946_01021005390542/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","datestored":"2001-04-10T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2000-12-20T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Romania - Danube Delta Biodiversity Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project outcome was satisfactory,\n            sustainability is likely, and institutional development\n            impacts are high. Several lessons are drawn from the\n            project. The level of responsibility granted to staff of\n            participating institutions, was conducive in turn to the\n            delegation of authority demonstrated in project management\n            during implementation. Both aspects proved instrumental no\n            only in securing project success, but in building ownership,\n            and capacity. The relatively low cost of preparation, and\n            the absence of processing requirements at the time, were\n            offset by the support of quality supervision, enhanced by\n            staff continuity, consistently including a mix of relevant\n            Bank technical, and administrative expertise, who\n            contributed to improved relations with the country. However,\n            public resistance, and negative support to the project,\n            could have been minimized, had a public communications\n            strategy been professionally designed, early on in the\n            project cycle, to build the necessary support among key\n            stakeholders. Likewise, an early participatory approach\n            should have been pursued to undertake a socioeconomic\n            assessment of reserve resources, and thus develop community\n            based strategies, to strengthen sustainable means for\n            resource conservation. Most importantly, performance\n            indicators should be available, to form the baseline for\n            assessments of ecosystems, socioeconomic aspects, and\n            factors affecting

It will enable DDBRA and DDI to monitor and\n            manage protected areas effectively, working with local\n            community groups to ensure sustainable resource use, and\n            restoring some wetlands to their natural condition. An\n            innovative feature comprises testing various approaches to\n            wetland restoration and monitoring their impact. The project\n            includes the following components: (a) strengthening the\n            wardens department, to support natural protection, surveys,\n            public awareness and nature

     monitoring, together with applied research into reed\n            restoration; (d) protection of a lake from direct inflow of\n            Danube water; willow planting; village woodlots; pilot\n            protection of fish fingerlings from an irrigation pumping\n            station intake; removal of some deteriorating metal\n            structures for aesthetic enhancement; sturgeon
