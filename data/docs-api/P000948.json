Some key lessons\n            learned include: Confused thinking about objectives ends up\n            in sub-optimal design. It is important to provide an\n            operational definition for each indicator - to state exactly\n            what data will be collected for it. It is possible to apply\n            design tests to the design of development projects. It is\n            worthwhile to define clearly the minimum requirement at the\n            start of project preparation and to reach agreement with the\n            borrower not to go ahead with a project if this preparatory\n            work has not been completed. It is important to distinguish\n            between core capacity and extended capacity. It is wrong to\n            move from preparation into implementation if core capacity\n            is not in place. It is risky to accept an empty shell as a\n            viable institution, and so is relying on a new institution\n            as an implementing agency, if its role and function in the\n            sector is not clear. Interagency conflicts are hard to\n            settle. Due to frequent losses of motor vehicles and\n            equipment provided to project implementing units, it is\n            advisable to introduce asset management systems, conduct\n            inventories, and report them to the Bank."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -

In particular, the\n            project will focus on: a) strengthening the capacity of the\n            National Council for Technical and Vocational Education and\n            Training (NACVET) to respond to the short-term training\n            needs of those employed in the informal sector; b) involving\n            indigenous trade associations in designing competency based\n            training programs, in selecting participants for training,\n            and in choosing the tools to be included in equipment kits;\n            c) creating closer links between trade associations,

will include: 1) practical\n            skill training of informal apprentices in five skill areas;\n            2) practical skill training and entrepreneurship training of\n            informal

         productivity in selected occupational areas, and to reorient\n            the vocational skill training system away from a\n            supply-driven to a demand-driven system. In particular, the\n            project will focus on: a) strengthening the capacity of the\n            National Council for Technical and Vocational Education and\n            Training (NACVET) to respond to the short-term training\n            needs of those employed in the informal sector; b) involving\n            indigenous trade associations in designing competency based\n            training programs, in selecting participants for training,\n            and in choosing the tools to be included in equipment kits;\n            c) creating closer links between trade associations, public\n            and private training institutions, and the Government; d)\n            re-orienting the focus of private and public training\n            institutions away from the provision of long pre-employment\n            training to the provision of short post-employment\n            competency-based training for those in the informal sector.\n            To achieve this, the project will include: 1) practical\n            skill training of informal apprentices in five skill areas;\n            2) practical skill training and entrepreneurship training of\n            informal sector master craftsmen and women; 3) ensuring that\n            trainees have access to essential high-quality tools; 4)\n            support to public and private training institutions; and 5)\n            training program development, evaluation, and monitoring."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Vocational Skills and Informal\n            Sector Support
