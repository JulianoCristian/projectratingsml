power sector. The principal objectives of the\n            program are to improve the efficiency of power generation,\n            transmission and distribution. Government policies are\n            designed to: rationalize investments, bring electricity\n            pricing in line with long-run marginal costs, finance a\n            larger share of future investments from sector cash\n            generation and thereby reduce pressure on other public\n            sector investments, and improve the regulatory framework and\n            utility management. The loan supports measures to achieve\n            these objectives and assist in restructuring the finances of\n            the sector. The Power Sector Adjustment Loan Project forms\n            part of the package to help financing needs of Colombia for\n            1987-90.
