The main risk of the project is linked to the\n            generally slow response of the Togolese authorities to\n            technical assistance, in particular as it relates to\n            planning. The recent progress made, however, in the\n            establishment of the General Directorate of Transport (GDT),\n            staffing and the definition of its work program is an\n            indication of the Government's commitment to strengthen planning."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Togo -
