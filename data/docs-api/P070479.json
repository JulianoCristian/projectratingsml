Several lessons are drawn from the\n            project experience. The program could not have proceeded\n            without a medium-term vision, and political commitment at\n            the highest level of state management, a commitment\n            essential to coordinate the actions of different sectors\n            affected by the various reforms, as well as in supporting\n            the debate in the state congress, with unions and other\n            stakeholders. Nonetheless, the medium- and long-term process\n            of reform, and fiscal discipline call for longer periods of\n            program implementation, to assure fiscal discipline, and\n            resolve indebtedness, in view of uncertainties, and elements\n            outside the control of the state government, possibly\n            through a programmatic type of support. Moreover, project\n            preparation in electoral years require close involvement,\n            and endorsement of outgoing. and incoming administrations,\n            as demonstrated by this operation, which helped assure\n            macroeconomic stability at a time of critical political\n            transition, and helped avoid a repetition of a recurrent\n            \"end-of-sexenio\" crisis. Finally, evidence of\n            compliance with public finance targets should be based on\n            audited, official data, since differences observed between\n            preliminary fiscal data and the final \"Cuenta\n            P\ufffdblica\", for which the executive branch is accountable\n            to Congress, are of a magnitude that call into question the\n            reliability of preliminary figures; rather, figures from\n            audited reports, including the annually presented Cuenta\n            P\ufffdblica, (instead of preliminary ones) should be used as\n            evidence of fiscal performance. In view of the comprehensive\n            nature of fiscal adjustment programs, an effective\n            coordination proved essential for timely program\n            implementation, and supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Estado de Mexico Structural\n            Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Estado de Mexico\n            Structural
