The role of the public\n            sector was significantly redesigned, to ensure food\n            security, enhancing production, storage, and transportation\n            of agricultural products. Although privatization of\n            agricultural processing and marketing enterprises was\n            largely met, little change occurred regarding enterprise\n            restructuring. Policy reforms contributed to positive\n            agricultural output and exports, substantially improving\n            livestock production. The key lessons suggest that: 1) the\n            likelihood for successful adjustment operations, lies within\n            the political will and consensus to favor reforms; 2) an\n            important element in project design, particularly that of\n            adjustment operations, lies within the economic and sector\n            work framework, which provides the conceptual basis for a\n            sustained sector policy over an extended period; 3)\n            technical assistance, critical to facilitate policy reform,\n            is not easily provided within a conventional operation;\n            however, the complexity of agricultural credit operations is\n            best handled on a stand-alone basis; 4) sector adjustment\n            operations create an adequate environment for parallel\n            investment operations, favored by its progressive policies;\n            and, 5) rural credit provision is best handled through sound\n            commercial banking practices."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania -
