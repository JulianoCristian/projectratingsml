The program supported the Government's\n            efforts in establishing an enabling environment for economic\n            recovery of the agricultural sector and focused on the\n            following key objectives: (i) helping to develop land\n            markets as the basis for sound agrarian reform; (ii)\n            demonopolization and privatization of the large state-owned\n            conglomerates that dominated agricultural marketing and\n            processing; (iii) elimination of the remaining price and\n            trade distortions in agriculture; and (iv) elimination of\n            the local governments' interference in commercial\n            decisions. Implementation of the reform program supported\n            under APEAC helped to establish an enabling environment for\n            recovery of the agricultural sector by supporting land\n            reform, demonopolization of trade in agricultural inputs and\n            outputs, elimination of trade and price distortions, and\n            abolishment of the remaining export taxes on agricultural\n            commodities. It also supported improved mechanisms for\n            ongoing privatization, enterprise reform and restructuring,\n            and enhanced the policy, legal and regulatory environment\n            for private sector development. IDA recognized that the\n            transition from a command to a market oriented economy would\n            take time, and a series of adjustment operations would be\n            needed. Development of land markets was too ambitious an\n            objective to be realized within 12 to 15 months of the\n            program implementation. Resolution of debts of grain\n            combination should have been addressed during the program\n            design before proceeding with their privatization.\n            Liberalization and privatization measures and elimination of\n            legal impediments is not sufficient for the creation of a\n            competitive environment for agrobusiness. Adjustment\n            programs can succeed even if not well coordinated by a\n            Central Working Group, but only if there is a strong working\n            level commitment to individual components. Legal framework\n            is necessary but not a sufficient condition to implement\n            policy reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Agricultural Privatization\n            and
