The Bank maintained good relations with the\n            Borrower and the Beneficiary during loan processing and\n            project implementation. The Project was entirely\n            satisfactory in that the power transmission facilities were\n            completed, and are functioning properly. This work was done\n            at a substantially lower cost than was originally estimated.\n            Eventually almost US$20 million of the Loan had to be\n            cancelled. Financially, WAPDA's position had improved\n            considerably by the time the Project was completed. This was\n            the result of tariff increases generally following the plan\n            devised by the Bank at appraisal. Thus, WAPDA's\n            progress during the Project was mixed. It was quite adequate\n            in the context of the Project, but in broader terms,\n            fundamental problems remain to be resolved, specifically,\n            the ones noted above.
