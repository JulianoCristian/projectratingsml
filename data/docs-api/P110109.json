Some lessons\n            learned included: complementarity between policy and\n            institutional dialogue through PRSO and existing investment\n            and technical assistance projects is critical for the\n            success of reforms. In order to assist in effective\n            implementation of the policy reforms, complementary\n            technical assistance have been provided through projects and\n            coordinated technical support by other development partners.\n            Opening the dialogue and flexibly adapting to the political\n            economy for reforms will be critical for success. These\n            include local governments such as provinces and the national\n            assembly economic and budget committee. Supporting a\n            reasonably well defined reform agenda of a senior champion\n            in Government is equally important for success. In areas\n            where sector working groups are active, it is important that\n            PRSO engage in and maintain direct communications with\n            existing sector working groups to ensure a constructive and\n            consistency to the existing reform dialogue. It is equally\n            important that PRSO coordinates closely and maintain contact\n            with other development partners who do not participate in\n            the PRSO modality but are

Fifth Poverty Reduction Support\n            Operation Program (PRSO-5) for Lao People's Democratic\n            Republic aims to support the Government's priorities as\n            outlined in its National Socio-Economic Development Plan\n            (NSEDP) and supported by the country assistance strategy\n            (CAS), namely by: (i) sustaining growth through improved\n            investment climate and competiveness; and (ii) improving\n            social outcomes by improving the quality of the public\n            finance management framework and service delivery mechanism\n            in the health and education sectors. PRSO-5 will contribute\n            to the achievement of these objectives through improving\n            management of key areas (regional integration, private\n            sector development, and quality of investment in natural\n            resource sector) and through strengthening of public\n            financial management and service delivery capacities and\n            targeted poverty reduction programs. The PRSO program\n            squarely supports the four pillars of the CAS: (i) sustain\n            growth through improved management of key drivers - regional\n            integration and private sector development, rural\n            development, and natural resource management; (ii) improve\n            social outcomes and reduce vulnerability through\n            strengthened public financial management and service\n            delivery capacities and targeted poverty reduction programs;\n            (iii) adopt a strategic approach to capacity development and\n            partnership in support of better NSEDP results; and (iv)\n            support the implementation of Second Nam Theun (NT2)\n            hydro-power project, focusing on the revenue management\n            arrangements. PRSO-supported reforms are timely for\n            improving the public financial management framework, as\n            significant resources will accrue to the Government from the\n            NT2 project and other natural resource sector developments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lao People's Democratic Republic -\n            Fifth Poverty Reduction Support Operation
