Some lessons\n            learned included: Reliance on competitive funds to manage\n            technology generation and dissemination has its limits, as\n            there is also a need to ensure the provision of essential\n            public goods such as basic long term research programs.\n            Investment in generating demand-driven research alone is\n            insufficient to address long-term problems (e.g. human and\n            physical capacity) where the allocation of funds to\n            strategic research issues is essential for the viability of\n            a comprehensive program. There are significant risks\n            involved in promoting innovative approaches from outside the\n            predominant institutional structures (i.e. national research\n            institutes), however, specific circumstances can justify\n            such an 'outside' approach although they do not\n            eliminate the risk of possible lack of success and\n            ownership. Therefore, care should be taken to ensure a broad\n            based public-private partnership as well as long term\n            institutional and financial sustainability of the model\n            after project closure. While it is important to focus on the\n            establishment of the funding cycles and tools, eventually\n            focus must turn to the development of sustainability through\n            private cost recovery, funding partners, and ongoing\n            government support. The establishment of an effective system\n            for monitoring results at sub-project and project levels\n            provided the necessary evidence to argue the value and\n            strength of competitive funding for science, technology and\n            innovation in the agricultural sector, and to promote the\n            ability of local groups to design, implement and monitor\n            innovation sub-projects. However, more deliberate care is\n            needed to document the ex-post impacts and the careful and\n            limited use of control groups to reach clearer conclusions\n            on the project impact."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Second Agricultural Research and\n            Extension Adaptable Program Loan (Phase 2) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - Second
