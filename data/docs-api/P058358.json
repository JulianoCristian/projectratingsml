Establishing\n            strong working relationship with development partners,\n            especially AusAID, was key to ensuring pre-financing and\n            therefore continuity of priority activities during\n            suspension of disbursements. Financing some training\n            activities and arranging alternative financing during the\n            suspension period was essential to keeping the project\n            going. Stakeholders' involvement throughout project\n            life is crucial. Local empowerment for planning and\n            implementing locally developed work plans results in greater\n            ownership, commitment and transparency. Finally, ownership\n            and dedication by the Project Coordination Committee, which\n            met on a regular basis, demonstrated commitment to the\n            objectives of the project and was essential to ensuring that\n            the project did not collapse during the lengthy period of\n            instability in the country."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Solomon Islands - Health Sector
