ex-combatants from the Rwanda\n            Patriotic Army and armed groups and supporting their\n            reintegration into civilian life. The document will identify\n            social and environmental risks and devise appropriate\n            mitigation measures. Ex-combatants will be free to settle in\n            the community of their choice. Their access to land will be\n            facilitated with the same community-based procedures used\n            for others who need land. Social integration may be\n            difficult in the context of Rwanda, as many ex-combatants\n            lost their families during the genocide, while others have\n            committed acts of violence in their communities. The social\n            reintegration assistance will provide assessments of\n            community perceptions of ex-combatants and\n            ex-combatants' perceptions of communities; expansion of\n            current national and community reconciliation activities;\n            and specialized counseling. The project will also provide\n            targeted support for the social and economic reintegration\n            of female ex-combatants. Child ex-combatants among armed\n            groups will be identified and will undergo specialized\n            counseling and reintegration assistance. The project is\n            classified as environmental Category B, as it includes\n            support to income-generating activities, which will be\n            screened for environmental impacts to minimize negative impacts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda -
