The\n            lessons learned were: (1) Bundling of infrastructure\n            subprojects can produce catalytic effects. (2) A national\n            DRM strategy should respond to the particular needs and\n            conditions prevailing in the country in question. (3) DRM\n            awareness at community level contributes to ownership and\n            sustainability of results. (4) Development of monitoring and\n            evaluation systems is critical to accurate assessment of\n            results and balanced inference of lessons. (5) The\n            importance of the Bank's GFDRR grants in providing\n            highly qualified and intensive technical assistance to\n            enhance and help build national capacities and\n            hazard-monitoring systems. (6) The frequent supervision and\n            presence of an on-site team composed of specialists in DRM\n            was indispensable to successful implementation and wide\n            variety of beneficial outcomes. (7) Institutionalization of\n            DRM priorities. Collaboration with the ERDMP contributed to\n            FPS' developing a set of guidelines and standards for\n            subproject maintenance and repair. This signals ownership of\n            DRM concepts and is a positive indicator of sustainability\n            of the new or rehabilitated infrastructure. (8) Multiple\n            restructurings may create high transaction costs. Multiple\n            restructurings may create high transaction costs for small\n            operations like the ERDMP and can divert both Government and\n            Bank resources away from implementation, especially in a\n            context in which inter-agency coordination is already\n            difficult. (9) Undertaking a large amount of small-scale\n            reconstruction works may not be a viable model in this type\n            of context."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Emergency Recovery and
