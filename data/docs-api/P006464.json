The PCR concludes that the project had good overall\n            results, noting that a majority of the sub-projects are\n            performing well. As per the Operation Evaluation Department\n            (OED), the outcome of the project is unsatisfactory with\n            sustainability as uncertain. Institutional impact was\n            negligible. The project aimed to support productive\n            agro-industrial investments, and to liberalize credit in the\n            agricultural sector, with a US$300 million loan mostly for\n            local expenditures. Despite an encouraging start, and\n            general success in exceeding the target reduction of\n            official credit for agro-industry, the National Program of\n            Agro-Industrial Development (PNDA) experienced several\n            problems during implementation. These problems resulted from\n            (i) the project's two-stage implementation and problems\n            in indexing and pricing sub-loans; (ii) the consequences for\n            Secretaria do Tesouro Nacional - National Treasury\n            Secretariat (STN), PBs, and beneficiaries of delays in\n            replenishing the Special Account; and (iii) the pace of\n            commitments to refinance and associated foreign-exchange\n            losses for STN. Lessons learned are as follows :(a) All\n            future lending should be in US dollars to minimize the\n            impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of\n            sub-loans and flow of repayments to STN. (b) Participation\n            can and should be broadened. Although more than 50\n            Participating Bank (PBs) had been accredited by Banco\n            Central do Brasil - Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), only\n            fourteen actually participated in the project. (c) Local\n            project supervision should be improved by making the various\n            data bases on PNDA disbursements compatible with one\n            another. (d) STN should take steps to provide information on\n            loan implementation and, results, as requested by the Bank."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Fourth Agro-Industries Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil -

The terms on\n            which the Treasury of the Ministry of Finance will refinance\n            these subloans will be designed to enable the Government to\n            recover from the participating banks (PBs) the full costs of\n            obtaining and administrating the Bank loan. The terms on\n            which the PBs would lend to their customers would be a\n            market outcome and, therefore, based essentially on the\n            PB's refinancing costs plus a spread as determined by\n            the market."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
