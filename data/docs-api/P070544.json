For the\n            last decade, Tanzania has sustained high economic growth\n            driven by structural reforms and improvements in economic\n            performance and service delivery. Growth in Gross Domestic\n            Product (GDP) has averaged between 5 and 7 percent a year\n            since 2000. Access to primary education has increased\n            dramatically, along with solid increases in net enrollment\n            rates. Under-five child mortality has declined by more than\n            a third since 2000. To assist Tanzania in meeting its\n            development goals, International Development Association\n            (IDU) will continue to actively coordinate with partners and\n            participate in the joint development dialogue with the\n            government.

Accountability, Transparency and\n            Integrity Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Accountability,\n            Transparency and Integrity Project (ATIP) for Tanzania were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was substantial; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the\n            benefits and potential trade-offs associated with the aid\n            delivery modalities need full consideration at the outset.\n            The Bank's configuration of technical and financial\n            support provided with the ATIP was informed by two major\n            approaches: (i) Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) approach to\n            reforms, and (ii) the pooling of efforts, management,\n            finances and oversight through the mechanism of common\n            basket funds. The combining of sectors in an omnibus\n            'umbrella project' plus the multiplicity of\n            implementation agencies pose additional implementation\n            challenges and increase transaction costs downstream.\n            Available commentaries and lessons learned through previous\n            sectoral works need to be carefully reviewed at design\n            stage, to better understand the feasibility of the\n            interventions and avoid over-ambitious targets. The presence\n            of top-level leadership with executive capacity and\n            strategic focus should be tested rather than too readily\n            assumed, as their absence has detrimental effects at\n            implementation stage. The constructive impulse to mobilize\n            additional financing behind the government reform drive led\n            to assumptions as to how 'ready to run' was the\n            project design. Procedural and budgeting problems should not\n            be underrated. Another particularly troublesome aspect of\n            project management related to work planning in the context\n            of mainstreaming and integration with Medium Term\n            Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The choice to embed the\n            specific conditionality of the Memorandum of Understanding\n            (MoU) in the project design is highly questionable, as its\n            costs far outweigh its potential benefits. The process of\n            restructuring does not need to await the MTR but should be\n            conducted as soon as there are signals that the DO may not\n            be achieved and/or the IP has the prospect of being\n            unsatisfactory. As referred to above, the attenuated\n            consultative process to restructuring may have been\n            inevitable. Defining and managing a robust approach to\n            'change management' is essential when dealing with\n            complex institutional reforms, and can help to maximize\n            returns at implementation stage. Given the complex and\n            difficult nature of cross sectoral public sector reforms,\n            such a diverse and extended sector nationally, a robust\n            'change management approach' was required to\n            galvanize participating actors around the efforts for\n            reform. The nexus of benefits to identified groups from the\n            reforms needs to be established in all cases. Funding of\n            non-state actors can be time-intensive and requires careful\n            planning, with good information, clear criteria to guide the\n            selection process and hands-on monitoring. This is necessary\n            to ensure that activities are well supervised and\n            strategically linked."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Accountability, Transparency and\n

improved\n            access to judicial and legal services and in the accountable\n            and transparent use of public financial resources. This will\n            be achieved by improving the skills and systems to deliver\n            judicial/legal services and public financial management, and\n            strengthening the capacity of oversight and watchdog\n            institutions (OWIs) to perform their role. The program has\n            four components: 1) strengthening the legal and judicial\n            system; 2) enhancing public financial accountability; 3)\n            strengthening oversight and watchdog institutions; and, 4)\n            project coordination. To strengthen the legal and judicial\n            system, this first component consist of six sub-components\n            that will a) establish a harmonized national legal framework\n            by amending key legislation, streamlining processes, and\n            improving capacity for legal research, towards drafting the\n            law reform. Also included are improvements to the legal\n            environment for enhanced social justice, safety, and\n            economic development, focusing on accessible justice by the\n            poor and disadvantaged. Support will be provided to\n            strengthen research capacity, and studies on a national\n            legal framework. Moreover, improved governance and\n            administrative justice will be supported, specifically\n            within legal and judicial institutions, by enhancing\n            transparency in the administration of justice through\n            relevant interventions. To this end, improved skills and\n            knowledge for legal professionals will be fostered through\n            quality legal training, improved practical training skills\n            for law students, and improved capacity on continuing\n            education programs. An improved service delivery capacity in\n            key legal institutions will entail the provision of\n            organizational and support services, enhanced competence and\n            integrity personnel, and an improved working environment\n            (this includes infrastructure and civil works for office\n            facilities). The second component will enhance public\n            financial accountability, through improved capacity at the\n            Ministry of Finance, so as to achieve sound macroeconomic\n            and fiscal management, and, public financial management will\n            be improved at ministries and agencies to improved resources\n            on decision-making and accountability. The third component\n            will strengthen oversight and watchdog institutions,\n            particularly regarding crosscutting reforms, i.e.,\n            generating high quality information on government\n            performance and outcomes, focused on improving the ethical\n            environment. Finally, the fourth component will support\n            project coordination, i.e., monitoring and evaluation\n            activities, support concerning institutional structures, and\n            to information, communication, and education activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Accountability, Transparency, and\n            Integrity Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania -
