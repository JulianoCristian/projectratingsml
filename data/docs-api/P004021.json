The lessons learned indicate that the\n            project's objectives for restructuring of the power\n            sector for competition and private sector participation\n            along with major investments in physical infrastructure\n            would have been challenging under favorable circumstances\n            and could have been jeopardized by the economic crisis that\n            affected Indonesia and other Asian countries during 1997-98.\n            The restructuring of a power sector from a government-owned\n            monopoly to a competitive market system is likely to require\n            a long time, depending on the preparatory work to create the\n            necessary legal framework.

The\n            mitigation measures the SAR proposed to deal with these\n            problems were the implementing agency's agreement to\n            use standardized procurement documents; the fostering of\n            \"ownership\" of the technical assistance by the\n            implementing units within PLN; and PLN's use of updated\n            prices in preparing cost estimates.
