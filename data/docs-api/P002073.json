Key lessons learned include: 1)\n            Macroeconomic risks such as policies towards the supply and\n            pricing of bitumen and the declared self-sufficiency and\n            consequent import restrictions of the government were not\n            sufficiently considered in the project design. 2) In\n            parallel with the economic decline and political turmoil, an\n            institutional decline was experienced in the road sector in\n            Nigeria with a particular severe impact on the project.\n            Fundamental restructuring is required to achieve\n            sustainability. 3) Reliable supply of bitumen is crucial for\n            the execution of a road project. 4) To achieve sustainable\n            finance of road maintenance, the road users must be involved\n            in the management of the roads. 5) The Bank should continue\n            to support Road Vision 2000, which aims at fundamental\n            reform of road management in Nigeria. 6) Possible future\n            support by the Bank could be in the form of guarantees to\n            private sector concessionaires for the management of highly\n            trafficked roads and investments in the recovery of the\n            badly deteriorated road network. 6) Unless a fundamental\n            reform of the management of the roads can be achieved with\n            true stakeholder ownership, the Bank should not finance\n            further road projects, but should focus on the promotion of\n            the reform process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria -
