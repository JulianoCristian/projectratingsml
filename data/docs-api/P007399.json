Conversely, on assessing the Basic Education Project\n            (PROMEB), the audit concurs with the ICR's ratings of\n            satisfactory outcomes, substantial institutional development\n            impacts, likely sustainability, and satisfactory Bank and\n            Borrower performances. Experience with the assessed\n            projects, confirm a number of the Operations Evaluation\n            Department - OED - lessons in the education sector: Despite\n            considerable quality-oriented investments by both the\n            assessed projects, progress in student performance has been\n            limited, confirming that educational project inputs, and\n            rising education budgets do not translate automatically into\n            increased student performance; rather, to increase\n            performance, teachers and students must use inputs\n            effectively, maximizing the instructional time students are\n            engaged in learning. While both assessed projects developed\n            action plans, their implementation was limited. Such actions\n            must be feasible within the budget, and human resources\n            available, and, Government officials must also clearly\n            perceive the need for plans, and the subsequent actions.\n            Notwithstanding, the PROMEB and its follow-up project\n            successfully involved the communities in the management of\n            rural schools, which suggests that decentralization of\n            school management to the community level, may mobilize local\n            support for the schools, thus increasing pride in\n            achievement by students, and teachers. However, although the\n            achievement tests developed through PROMEB provided valuable\n            monitoring information to the government, such outcomes were\n            not widely disseminated, and its use was limited: to be\n            valuable, however, the information must be disseminated\n            widely at the school level if possible, and actions must be\n            carried out based on the feedback it provides."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras -

The most substantial impact on implementation\n            was caused by hurricane Mitch in November 1998. To respond\n            to the crisis, the project legal documents were amended in\n            April 1999, thereby integrating the project in the national\n            emergency plan through a new emergency subprojects\n            component. This component was instrumental in providing\n            resources at the departmental and community levels. The key\n            lessons learned are: A community-based strategy can lead to\n            rapid improvements in the delivery of education services in\n            rural areas. The achievement of project development\n            objectives is best guaranteed by appropriate adjustments to\n            the changing needs of the country and the sector. The\n            development impact of external evaluation of student\n            learning achievements is greatly enhanced when results are\n            broadly disseminated and utilized in sector policy\n            decision-making. Maintenance agreements for the\n            sustainability of education infrastructure must be supported\n            by adequate financing. The production of textbooks and other\n            education materials must be supported by an efficient\n            distribution system. New textbooks should be consistent with\n            changes in curriculum. The production of new education\n            materials is enhanced by the systematic field test of such materials."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Basic Education

better teaching, increase school\n            attendance, and create more effective learning conditions,\n            thereby reducing student dropout and repetition rates and\n            raising student's academic achievements. The project\n            also aims at strengthening the Ministry of Education's\n            institutional capacity to deliver basic education services\n            at higher levels of efficiency and fiscal accountability,\n            leading to a reduction in administrative costs. The project\n            comprises two major components. The first component is the\n            Improving the Quality of Basic Education component which\n            provides for: 1) training and assistance to upgrade the\n            skills of preprimary and primary teachers, principals and\n            supervisors, and improvements to pre-service teacher\n            training and accreditation; 2) educational materials\n            including textbooks, didactic materials, classroom\n            libraries, and improved distribution facilities; 3)\n            bilingual education in indigenous areas for the Garfuna and\n            Miskito communities; 4) external evaluation of\n            student's academic achievements; and 5) infrastructure\n            improvements for overcrowded rural schools, including\n            additional teachers and access to community-run preschool\n            education in poor rural areas. The second component is an\n            Institutional Strengthening one which will provide for: 1)\n            technical assistance for the restructuring and\n            decentralization of the MOE, and improved supervision; 2) a\n            pilot program of teacher performance incentives; and 3)\n            project administration, monitoring and evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Basic Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Honduras - Basic Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/03/16268043/honduras-basic-education-project","projn":"HN-Basic Education -- P007399","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Gender,Health, Nutrition and Population,Education","count":"Honduras","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000425962_20120514104352"},"subsc":"Pre-primary education,Tertiary education,Primary education,Central government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"Spanish","historic_topic":"Gender,Health, Nutrition and Population,Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"absenteeism,academic achievement,academic\n            performance,ACADEMIC YEAR,achievement indicators,achievement\n            tests,Achievements,addition,adult education,Adult\n            Illiteracy,age group,aged,average level,Basic\n            Education,basic skills,Bilingual Education,Birth\n            rate,classroom teaching,classrooms,Community\n            Participation,curricula,Decentralization,dropout\n            rates,economic growth,education budget,education\n            curricula,Education Expenditures,education\n            facilities,education investments,Education Law,education\n            levels,education programs,Education Projects,Education\n            Quality,Education Sector,Education Statistics,EDUCATION\n            SYSTEM,Educational achievement,educational\n            materials,Enrollment,enrollment rate,Enrollment ratio,equal\n            distribution,equitable access,Ethnic Groups,experienced\n            teachers,families,Female enrollment,first grade,formal\n            education,functional literacy,gender\n            differences,girls,grading,health services,indigenous\n            children,instruction,instructional\n            materials,Interventions,investment in\n            education,isolation,labor force,learning,learning\n            disabilities,learning materials,liberal arts,Library\n            Books,Life Expectancy,literacy rate,living conditions,local\n            authorities,local education,Low\n            enrollment,mathematics,Mid-Term Review,Mortality,national\n            curriculum,Net enrollment,nutrition,parents,Population\n            Growth,posters,poverty reduction,preprimary\n            education,Preschool Education,preschool teachers,Primary\n            Education,primary education expenditures,Primary Education\n            Spending,Primary Enrollment,primary levels,Primary\n            School,primary school curriculum,Primary school\n            enrollment,primary school teachers,primary schools,primary\n            students,principals,printing,private sector,Professional\n            Training,public awareness,public expenditure,public\n            health,Public Primary,public sector,qualified\n            teachers,quality of\n            education,reading,repeaters,Repetition,Repetition\n            Rate,Repetition Rates,Rural Areas,Rural Population,rural\n            schools,Rural teachers,safety,scholarships,school\n            attendance,school buildings,School Committees,school\n            construction,school desks,school dropouts,school\n            facilities,school furniture,school\n            supplies,schooling,Schools,secondary education,secondary\n            level,secondary schools,secondary students,siblings,SOCIAL\n            CONTEXT,social studies,student achievement,Teacher,teacher\n            shortages,Teacher Training,teacher training\n            schools,teachers,teaching,Teaching Materials,teaching\n            quality,technical education,textbook distribution,textbook\n            production,Textbooks,Training Centers,training\n            opportunities,training programs,universities,university\n            education,urban areas,urban schoolsBasic education;\n            Bilingual education;
