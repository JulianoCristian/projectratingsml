The project achieved\n            its main objectives, its impact on institutional development\n            was moderate, sustainability is likely, and both the Bank\n            and Borrower acted satisfactorily. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, there is a need to\n            evaluate more carefully project objectives and targets at\n            the time of appraisal, to ensure that these are consistent\n            with what can realistically be achieved within the envisaged\n            timeframe. Second, WAPDA's administrative procedures\n            should also be streamlined in order to minimize the time\n            that technical staff assigned to the project have to devote\n            to routine tasks. Finally, despite periodic attempts to\n            address the issue, the utility of progress reports as a\n            management tool remains limited."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Fourth Wapda Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Fourth Wapda Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/12/733651/pakistan-fourth-wapda-power-project","projn":"PK-Wapda IV (Power Tran -- P010212","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Business Environment,Business in Development,Pharmaceuticals & Pharmacoeconomics,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961019174131"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,accounts,accounts\n            receivable,acquisition,actual costs,ADB,administrative\n            procedures,Bank performance,Bank supervision,Bidding,budget\n            deficits,capital expenditures,competitive\n            bidding,Contractors,cost estimates,debt,distribution\n            systems,Economic Impact,employment,energy consumption,energy\n            efficiency,environmental issues,Environmental\n            Management,environmental problems,exchange\n            rate,expenditure,expenditures,financial covenants,financial\n            performance,FISCAL YEAR,fixed assets,foreign\n            exchange,inflation,institutional development,internal\n            audit,Internal Cash Generation,inventory,local\n            manufacturers,LRMC,marginal cost,Net Operating\n            Income,operating costs,Operating\n            Expenses,pollution,Procurement,project\n            implementation,reorganization,reporting,return on\n            investment,sales,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,accounts,accounts\n            receivable,acquisition,actual costs,ADB,administrative\n            procedures,Bank performance,Bank supervision,Bidding,budget\n            deficits,capital expenditures,competitive\n            bidding,Contractors,cost estimates,debt,distribution\n            systems,Economic Impact,employment,energy consumption,energy\n            efficiency,environmental issues,Environmental\n            Management,environmental problems,exchange\n            rate,expenditure,expenditures,financial covenants,financial\n            performance,FISCAL YEAR,fixed assets,foreign\n            exchange,inflation,institutional development,internal\n            audit,Internal Cash Generation,inventory,local\n            manufacturers,LRMC,marginal cost,Net Operating\n            Income,operating costs,Operating\n            Expenses,pollution,Procurement,project\n            implementation,reorganization,reporting,return on\n            investment,sales,working capital"}},"owner":"SAS","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"15228"},"740132":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/02/740132/pakistan-fourth-water-power-development-authority-wapda-power-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/02/740132/pakistan-fourth-water-power-development-authority-wapda-power-project","new_url":"1985/02/740132/pakistan-fourth-water-power-development-authority-wapda-power-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/02/01/000009265_3970716151825/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/02/01/000009265_3970716151825/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2499","docdt":"1985-02-28T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1985-02-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Fourth Water and Power\n            Development Authority (WAPDA) Power Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Fourth Wapda Power Project will\n            assist WAPDA in the further reinforcement and expansion of\n            the secondary power transmission network and thereby reduce\n            transmission losses.
