Chimborazo Development Investment Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Chimborazo Development Investment\n            Project for Ecuador received a satisfactory outcome rating\n            with moderate risk to development outcome. The Bank received\n            a moderately satisfactory performance rating while the\n            Borrower was rated satisfactory. Two restructurings took\n            place during this project. The first restricting was a level\n            two restructuring that: (i) adjusted Results Framework to\n            better reflect project activities; (ii) adjusted the\n            location of roads rehabilitation segments; reallocated\n            US$790,000 of loan proceeds to reflect actual costs at\n            sub-component level; updated project financing plan; and,\n            changed the name of the Borrower. The second restructuring\n            was also a level two restructuring which extended the\n            closing date by nine months to permit completion of several\n            large irrigation subprojects. For budgetary reason, team\n            leaders withdrew certain road segments targeted for\n            financing under Sub-component 1.2 and substitutes would be\n            needed. Roads eligible for Central Government financing\n            required final technical/feasibility studies. The project\n            generated several lesson including: (1) the project thrived\n            in large part because of a dynamic, well-connected leader\n            who championed its goals, owned the methodology, understood\n            the project\u0092s strategic context, saw the longer-term\n            potential for his province of working successfully with the\n            Bank. (2) Successful monitoring and evaluation performance\n            requires complete buy-in to a coherent progression of\n            research/reporting throughout, on the part of both the\n            Borrower and the Bank teams. (3) The indirect benefits of a\n            well-conceived investment operation can be considerable and\n            important. In this case, the strong emphasis on local\n            institutional capacity-building based on standards, rules,\n            rights and responsibilities had a marked impact on reducing\n            conflict among irrigator communities, liberating them to\n            focus on agricultural advancement rather than the constant\n            and corrosive struggle for water. (4) The design, content\n            and delivery \u0096 including culturally appropriate social\n            mobilization behind and communicating the desirability of\n            change \u0096 along with reliable, continuous technical and\n            financial support, market intelligence, and productive\n            organization and entrepreneurship, are basic pre-requisites\n            to secure farmer buy-in."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Chimborazo Development Investment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ecuador - Chimborazo Development\n            Investment

Subsequent\n            missions in 2011 and 2012 provided the data and agreements\n            needed to prepare the project restructuring. This paper\n            presents the restructuring, which entails: (i) adjustment of\n            the results framework to better reflect project activities;\n            (ii) adjustments to the location of the rehabilitated roads\n            segments; (iii) reallocation of loan proceeds to reflect the\n            actual costs at the component level; (iv) update of the\n            Project financing plan; and (v) change in the name of the\n            Borrower. The evaluation highlights how beneficiaries are\n            contributing to the Project with both financial resources\n            and community work, and are effectively organized in Water\n            User Associations (WUAs), which represents a significant accomplishment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ecuador - Chimborazo Development\n            Investment Project : restructuring  : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/06/16400590/ecuador-chimborazo-development-investment-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"EC-Chimborazo Development Investment Project\n            (Pidd) -- P094784","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Irrigation and Drainage,Water Supply and Systems,Labor Policies,Housing & Human Habitats,Post Conflict Reconstruction","teratopic":"Water Resources,Communities and Human Settlements,Water Supply and Sanitation,Social Protections and Labor,Conflict and Development","count":"Ecuador","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20120620004215"},"theme":"Other environment and natural resources management,Rural services and infrastructure,Other rural development","subsc":"Irrigation and drainage,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Communities and Human Settlements,Water Supply and Sanitation,Social Protections and Labor,Conflict and Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural produce, agricultural\n            production, agricultural products, canals, communities,\n            counterpart, counterpart funds, Description, drainage,\n            feasibility studies, feasibility study, food security, IBRD,\n            IRRIGATION, irrigation area, irrigation infrastructure,\n            irrigation investment, irrigation methods, irrigation\n            projects, irrigation rehabilitation, irrigation schemes,\n            irrigation system, irrigation systems, irrigation\n            technologies, linings, management authority, meeting,\n            modality, piped water, productivity, Project Appraisal,\n            Project design, Project document, Project documents, Project\n            financing, Project implementation, Project Management, rain,\n            rainfall, reservoirs, river basins, Road, roads, suppliers,\n            surface irrigation, water concession, water distribution,\n            water flow, Water User Associations"}},"owner":"Environment (LCSEN)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF055402-PHRD-ECUADOR: CHIMBORAZO\n            DEVELOPMENT PROJECT,TF055593-TFESSD SOCIAL WINDOW: ANDEAN\n            SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY INITIATIVE","majtheme":"Rural development,Environment and natural resource management","repnb":"67695"},"facets":{}}}
