Some lessons learned included: such\n            development objectives as increase income and employment\n            should be kept as the 'contribution of the project to\n            higher level development objectives of the country.'\n            Hence, the objectives of the second project are to increase\n            competitiveness, entrepreneurship and sustainability of\n            partnerships, and producer associations. Such outcomes can\n            be credited directly to the project. As a remedy, the\n            follow-up project introduced time saving measures such as a\n            framework insurance policy covering all future partnerships.\n            It delegates more responsibility to the regional level and\n            to the partners for the pre-investment studies and\n            partnership structuring, shortening the preparation cycle.\n            The results, up to the time of this ICR preparation are\n            encouraging. Although identifying skilled people to prepare\n            partnership feasibility studies remains a challenge. Poor\n            feasibility studies usually result in delays and other\n            problems (often requiring restructuring) during\n            implementation. The gradual reduction in the complexity of\n            the studies while focusing on the essentials and\n            particularly on risks diminished implementation delays and\n            eliminated non-viable partnerships from the onset. Perennial\n            crops that require some medium-term investment are not very\n            suitable for poor farmers, as they do not have the financial\n            capacity to maintain those crops over the years before\n            seeing the financial results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Productive Partnerships Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia -

implementation of a demand-driven, productive partnership\n            scheme with the private sector. There are two main project\n            components. The first component finances technical\n            assistance and training for activities associated with\n            information sharing, mobilization and screening of interest,\n            pre-investments, ex-ante evaluation of detailed productive\n            partnership sub-project proposals, and studies. The second\n            component supports the implementation of productive\n            partnerships by financing 1) cost sharing transfers as a\n            financial incentive for participating small farmers producer\n            organizations; and 2) technical assistance and training to\n            productive partnership participants. The third component,\n            project management, includes the operation of a management\n            information system, and the design and implementation of\n            monitoring, evaluation,
