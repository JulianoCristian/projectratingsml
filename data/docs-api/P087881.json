Some lessons learned\n            included: the Bank\u0092s role in capacity building and providing\n            fiduciary monitoring agent (FMA) support to project\n            management team (PMT) was also crucial, which helped to\n            build up a dedicated and highly professional PMT. To\n            maximize the project economic and social benefits, it is\n            important to integrate the civil works development and\n            rehabilitating irrigation and drainage infrastructure with\n            improved agriculture and farming systems with farmer\n            consultation for maximum synergies. The project results show\n            that small local contractors are better in delivering\n            development objectives in shortest possible time, with\n            greater involvement of the local community and smaller\n            duration also prevented issues arising from price change.\n            Direct involvement of the beneficiaries in planning and\n            implementation of operation and maintenance (O and M)\n            systems, even at a later stage, creates a sense of ownership\n            among farmers, which is instrumental in achieving\n            sustainable water management. The grant equally emphasized\n            creation of local employment which was a major concern due\n            to rampant high unemployment. The project implementation and\n            supervision experiences showed that the work of the FMA had\n            been very important and beneficial to the achievement of the\n            project outputs and outcomes. Despite an adverse operating\n            environment, infrastructure rehabilitation activities can be\n            implemented cost effectively."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iraq - Emergency Community Infrastructure\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Iraq -
