During late 1990s, the corruption and the lack of\n            efficiency and proper mechanisms in the government system\n            were the biggest obstacles in transition process. There was\n            a need to improve service delivery mechanisms. People\n            suffered because of high levels of corruption in the system\n            that primarily existed in the form of state-capture.\n            Bringing transparency and improving the working of\n            government at macro level was important to ensure improved\n            service delivery to citizens, and public access to\n            information was necessary in order to bring accountability\n            to the system.The Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan\n            (PSAL) project was initiated in 2000 by the World Bank to\n            address these issues and to strengthen the reform process in\n            Latvia. The program focuses on public sector reform, the\n            privatization process, and creating a legislative basis for\n            other reforms. The PSAL project attempted to bring certain\n            changes through necessary reforms to reduce corruption and\n            bring accountability in the system. Simultaneously, new\n            mechanisms were introduced for improved service delivery and\n            information access to the citizens. The project outcome is\n            satisfactory, its sustainability likely, and the\n            institutional development impact (within the government) is\n            considerable. Although the World Bank Research suggests\n            substantial poverty reduction through PSAL, the public\n            governance issues under PSAL operations seem difficult to\n            assess at present, as the change process will require time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latvia programmatic structural adjustment loans"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Latvia programmatic structural\n            adjustment loans"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2003/01/11305023/latvia-programmatic-structural-adjustment-loans","count":"Latvia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Industry and trade,Finance,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to information, accountability,\n            Accountability Mechanisms, accounting, accounting framework,\n            administrative framework, affiliate, agency operations,\n            annual report, annual reports, anticorruption,\n            anticorruption agenda, anticorruption effort, anticorruption\n            efforts, assets, auditing, bribery, budget allocations,\n            budget execution, budget resources, budgetary resources,\n            cabinet of ministers, central government, civil servants,\n            civil service, civil service pay, civil society, commitment,\n            conflict of interest, corrupt, corruption, Corruption\n            Prevention, cost effectiveness, effectiveness of government,\n            environmental degradation, evasion, external audit,\n            financial accounting, financial management, good governance,\n            government officials, human resource management, inflation,\n            institutional development, judicial system, judiciary,\n            Justice, law enforcement, laws, legislation, local\n            government, local governments, macroeconomic framework,\n            market economy, minister, ministers, nongovernmental\n            organizations, Pension reform, pensions, performance\n            evaluation, policy commitments, policy decisions, poverty\n            reduction, private sector, privatization, programs,\n            provisions, public, Public accountability, Public Accounts,\n            public administration, public agencies, public expenditure,\n            public expenditure management, public institutions, public\n            officials, public sector, public sector employees, public\n            sector management, public sector performance, public sector\n            reform, public services, public utilities, public welfare,\n            reform agenda, reform process, reform program, regulatory\n            framework, resource management, SAL, sector policies,\n            service delivery, social assistance, social programs, social\n            services, state audit office, state enterprises, strategic\n            policy, STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT, Structural Adjustment Loan,\n            STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOANS, structural reform, transition\n            economies, transparency, Treasury, trust funds, welfare of citizens"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance,Economic management,Financial and private sector development","projn":"LV-Private Sector Adjustment Loan\n            (Psal)-434448 -- P066153","docty":"Working Paper","subtopic":"Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Public Sector Expenditure Policy,Public Sector Economics,Economic Adjustment and Lending,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","authors":{"authr":"Kanungo, Parameeta"},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20091104012250"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Central government administration,General transportation sector,General industry and trade sector,General finance sector,General energy sector","theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization,Regulation and competition policy,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Macroeconomic management","colti":"Empowerment case studies","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","owner":"Poverty Reduction/Econ Mngmt (ECSPE)","trustfund":"TF026117-PHRD-STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN II,TF039528-LATVIA -

It is important to note that, public\n            governance issues under structural adjustment operations\n            will be both, difficult to implement and to evaluate,\n            because change is only expected to occur in small steps, and\n            over a number of years; benefits are rarely noticeable in\n            the short-run; and, formal achievement of benchmarks is\n            meaningless, unless embodied in deep-rooted, and lasting\n            institutional changes. However, some lessons learned seem\n            reasonable: 1) the choice of a programmatic structural\n            adjustment instrument proved beneficial, in that it allowed\n            a medium-term framework to be developed, with several\n            activity phases, programmed over a period of time. This\n            presents the advantage that, given the Government's\n            commitments, potential resentments over tranche release\n            exchanges, are less likely to occur. Furthermore, the close\n            collaboration between Latvia, and Bank officials immediately\n            following the Russia crisis, contributed to the\n            precipitated, and exceptional financial assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latvia -

The reform\n            program will help Latvia return to a macroeconomic framework\n            conducive to growth and improve its public sector\n            performance by 1) correcting macro-economic imbalances, 2)\n            strengthening the credibility of the public sector, 3)\n            improving institutional capacity to deliver public services,\n            and 4) encouraging private sector development through\n            finalizing the privatization process and defining a clear\n            and transparent regulatory framework. Latvia expects to\n            achieve these objectives by implementing specific reforms\n            supported by the World Bank in the areas of pensions, public\n            sector management, human resource management, public\n            expenditure management, privatization and regulation of\n            public utilities and private business. The PSAL will also\n            put in place measures to assist the government's\n            anti-corruption effort and to streamline business\n            regulation. The reforms will enhance Latvia's prospects\n            for timely European Union accession; and provide a positive\n            signal to international institutions and investors regarding\n
