The lessons\n            drawn from this project include: When the disease burden is\n            high, the centralized vertical organizational structure is\n            useful. When the disease burden is reduced, an integrated\n            approach is more efficient. The role of the states in\n            project implementation needs to be strengthened. It is\n            important to strengthen the capacity of the general health\n            system to address long-term issue of diagnosis and\n            treatment. Effective program management requires high\n            quality, up-to-date epidemiological and management\n            information. It is important to increasingly embed leprosy\n            control activities in the General Health System. Effective\n            targeted program require high levels of coverage and\n            saturation, and the identification, reach and coverage of\n            hard-to-reach groups, particularly urban poor, women and\n            scheduled tribes/castes, remain challenging. There is a need\n            for a clear and well-coordinated strategy, which\n            incorporates various Information, Education, and\n            Communication interventions to meet well-defined goals.

The project finances the incremental\n            cost of a six-year time slice of an enhanced National\n            Leprosy Eradication Program. This brings an added value and\n            efficiency to this program through the promotion of an\n            appropriate mix of service delivery mechanisms, policies and\n            strategies, provision of a wider and more effective package\n            of leprosy services, and expansion of the use of appropriate\n            technology. This project focusses on program enhancements in\n            five activities: (a) expansion of multidrug therapy through\n            a vertical structure targeting about 66 high-endemicity\n            districts and providing outreach services to the community\n            and service circuits; (b) integration of multidrug therapy\n            into the general health care system in about 77\n            intermediate-endemicity districts and pockets of infection;\n            (c) disability care and prevention through health education,\n            preventive precautions, physiotherapy, supportive medicines,\n            ulcer care and reconstructive surgery; (d) promoting public\n            awareness and community participation; and (e) enhancing\n            skills and institutional development through the provision\n            of short-term training to about 160,000 persons and\n            strengthening program coordination capabilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - National Leprosy Elimination Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - National Leprosy\n            Elimination Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/06/734652/india-national-leprosy-elimination-project","projn":"IN-National Leprosy Elimination Project -- P010424","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,m,Health Systems Development & Reform,Health Information & Communications Technologies,Health Indicators","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961004103151"},"subsc":"Health","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"blindness,community\n            health,CURRENCY,Disabilities,disability\n            care,discrimination,Disease\n            Control,employment,Epidemiology,Expenditures,externalities,families,girls,Health\n            Centers,Health Education,health financing,health\n            interventions,health promotion,health sector,Health\n            Services,health status,health system,health systems,Hospital\n            Services,hospitals,illiteracy,inhibition,international\n            organizations,intervention,Leprosy,malaria,mass\n            media,medicines,morbidity,motivation,nutrition,patient\n            satisfaction,patients,physiotherapists,physiotherapy,posters,prevalence\n            of leprosy cases,Primary Health\n            Care,probability,prognosis,Public\n            Health,rehabilitation,Safety,screening,Surgery,total\n            population,tuberculosis,voluntary\n            organizations,waste,workers,young adults"},"1":{"cdata!":"blindness,community\n            health,CURRENCY,Disabilities,disability\n            care,discrimination,Disease\n            Control,employment,Epidemiology,Expenditures,externalities,families,girls,Health\n            Centers,Health Education,health financing,health\n            interventions,health promotion,health sector,Health\n            Services,health status,health system,health systems,Hospital\n            Services,hospitals,illiteracy,inhibition,international\n            organizations,intervention,Leprosy,malaria,mass\n            media,medicines,morbidity,motivation,nutrition,patient\n            satisfaction,patients,physiotherapists,physiotherapy,posters,prevalence\n            of leprosy cases,Primary Health\n            Care,probability,prognosis,Public\n            Health,rehabilitation,Safety,screening,Surgery,total\n            population,tuberculosis,voluntary\n            organizations,waste,workers,young adults"}},"owner":"S.A.
