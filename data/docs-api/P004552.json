Nonetheless, the\n            lessons suggest that: 1) although a long-term coconut\n            development program has been prepared, there is still lack\n            of consensus on the precise elements for the strategy of\n            this program. Issues include the competition faced by\n            coconut oil from substitutes in export markets, the\n            agronomic constraint of shading, and a \"holistic\"\n            approach in the preference to keep coconut as a secondary\n            crop, or to diversify out of it to other profitable crops,\n            or uses; 2) the private sector needs to be actively pursued,\n            for experience shows that the private sector's contract\n            services are more reliable, than attempting to establish\n            separate public sector facilities; 3) innovative financing\n            mechanisms need to be addressed, particularly, alternative\n            cost-sharing arrangements should evolve to finance a\n            long-term replanting program; 4) likewise, mechanisms to\n            reduce planting costs should be explored, to help develop a\n            market for coconut hybrid seedlings for replanting purposes.\n            Experience suggests that hybrids may outperform tall\n            coconuts, making those worth producing; and, 5) project\n            delays undermined its benefits, thus project readiness at\n            entry is critical for a timely implementation, which should\n            include clear monitoring and evaluation practices."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines -

  years.  This project will constitute the first phase of a\n            long term small coconut farms development program, which,\n            over the next twenty years, will result in the replanting of\n            some 743,000 ha of senile coconuts and the rehabilitation of\n            418,000 ha of low bearing palms.  Project objectives are to\n            : a) launch a long term program of coconut replanting and\n            productivity improvement; b) increase the incomes of coconut\n            smallholders by improving coconut yields and copra quality;\n            and c) boost foreign exchange earnings by ensuring an\n            increasing and reliable supply of higher quality copra for\n            processing and export.  Project components include : 1)\n            establishment of seedgardens, nurseries and other\n            infrastructure sufficient to sustain a long term program of\n            replanting 50,000 ha of senile palms per annum; 2) replant\n            25,000 ha and support intercropping during the first 3 years\n            of replanting; 3) rehabilitate 348,000 ha of middle aged\n            palms and support the development of 50,000 ha of immature\n            palms; 4) support a pilot copra quality improvement program;\n            and 5) provide for the institutional strengthening of the\n            Philippines Coconut Authority (PCA)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Small Coconut Farms\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Small Coconut Farms\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1990/05/739213/philippines-small-coconut-farms-development-project","projn":"PH-Coconut Farms Devt. -- P004552","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Research,Economic Theory & Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"Philippines","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960928130859"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Central government administration,Crops","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            land,Agriculture,capital markets,Coconut,coconut\n            industry,coconut oil,coconut\n            products,commodity,copra,crop,Debt,Economic Rate of\n            Return,equipment,Expenditures,exports,Extension,extensionists,farm,farm\n            activities,farm incomes,Farmers,Farms,fibers,Financial\n            Sector,Flour,food processing,Housing,hybrid\n            seed,intercropping,interest rate,international\n            trade,Irrigation,laboratories,natural\n            resources,nurseries,organizational structure,Palm\n            oil,palms,Plantations,poverty\n            line,produce,producers,productivity,replanting,Research\n            Centers,rural poverty,rural poverty alleviation,Rural\n            Roads,Securities,seed production,technical\n            assistance,Textiles,vegetable oils,Water Supply,yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            land,Agriculture,capital markets,Coconut,coconut\n            industry,coconut oil,coconut\n            products,commodity,copra,crop,Debt,Economic Rate of\n            Return,equipment,Expenditures,exports,Extension,extensionists,farm,farm\n            activities,farm incomes,Farmers,Farms,fibers,Financial\n            Sector,Flour,food processing,Housing,hybrid\n            seed,intercropping,interest rate,international\n            trade,Irrigation,laboratories,natural\n            resources,nurseries,organizational structure,Palm\n            oil,palms,Plantations,poverty\n            line,produce,producers,productivity,replanting,Research\n            Centers,rural poverty,rural poverty alleviation,Rural\n            Roads,Securities,seed production,technical\n            assistance,Textiles,vegetable oils,Water Supply,yields"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"P5198"},"facets":{}}}
