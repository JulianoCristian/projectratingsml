Probably the most A significant conclusion\n            to be drawn from the experience of the first program loan to\n            Zambia is that where an economy is highly dependent on a\n            commodity whose price fluctuates widely, the direct impact\n            of the loan can be lost or 0ified by much larger forces\n            which operate on the economy. The discussion which led to\n            this program loan began at a time when the world copper\n            prices had been relatively low for some two years, after\n            several years of rising prices. However, by the time\n            implications for the Zambian economy could be investigated,\n            an agreement on the necessary policy response reached, a\n            loan negotiated, and arrangements for disbursement worked\n            out, copper prices had recovered to a level which led the\n            Zambian government and the Bank to agree that the\n            justification for the loan no longer existed. Therefore, by\n            agreement with the government of Zambia, the undisbursed\n            balance was cancelled."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - Program Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zambia -
