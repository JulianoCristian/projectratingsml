The Bank originally approved the loan on June 22,\n            1989, and the project was to finance water and sanitation\n            services and productive activities in the pilot states of\n            Queretaro, Hidalgo, and Michoacan. Subsequently, the newly\n            elected Mexican Government implemented a poverty alleviation\n            program that made Bank funds unattractive for the\n            beneficiary states. The Borrower and Bank considered several\n            alternatives to reformulate the project according to the new\n            policies. The original effectiveness date of December 27,\n            1989 was extended eleven times. Ultimately, the\n            reformulation efforts led to the conclusion that it was more\n            efficient to terminate the loan and identify a possible new\n            operation. The effectiveness date of April 26, 1991 was\n            allowed to elapse and all obligations of the parties were\n            terminated. This report finds the decision to terminate to\n            be prudent and reasonable. The project was well designed and\n            took a comprehensive approach to attack the vicious cycle of\n            women's lack of productivity. Its conceptual\n            underpinnings were accepted by the new Government and\n            adopted for the ongoing Women in Solidarity programs. The\n            Bank arguably played a valuable role and acted as a\n            catalyzer of the actions that followed. Cost recovery was an\n            important policy issue involved. The Water, Women, and\n            Development Project included a credit line for more\n            ambitious activities requiring greater capital expenditures,\n            while the Government's approach utilized quasi-grant\n            funds requiring limited investments. Such alternate schemes\n            might be considered in the context of a new loan operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Water, Women and Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Water, Women and\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/06/737018/mexico-water-women-development-project","projn":"MX-Wtr, Women&Dev -- P007670","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Health Economics & Finance,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Mexico","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960927191218"},"subsc":"(Historic)Urban water supply","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"community participation,community\n            water,construction,cost recovery,decision making,decision\n            making process,Exchange\n            rate,expenditures,households,Income,investment\n            cost,investment costs,living standards,local water,local\n            water utilities,low income,low-income population,maintenance\n            costs,poverty alleviation,private\n            sector,productivity,provision of water,provision of water\n            supply,Public Works,Regional Development,sanitation\n            investment,Sanitation Sector,sanitation services,urban\n            areas,water rates,water sector,water supply,water supply\n            services,water systems,Water tariffs"},"1":{"cdata!":"community participation,community\n            water,construction,cost recovery,decision making,decision\n            making process,Exchange\n            rate,expenditures,households,Income,investment\n            cost,investment costs,living standards,local water,local\n            water utilities,low income,low-income population,maintenance\n            costs,poverty alleviation,private\n            sector,productivity,provision of water,provision of water\n            supply,Public Works,Regional Development,sanitation\n            investment,Sanitation Sector,sanitation services,urban\n            areas,water rates,water sector,water supply,water supply\n            services,water systems,Water tariffs"}},"owner":"WB Off:Mexico - MX & CO CMU (LCC1C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"repnb":"10819"},"737385":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1989/05/737385/mexico-water-women-development-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1989/05/737385/mexico-water-women-development-project","new_url":"1989/05/737385/mexico-water-women-development-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1989/05/24/000009265_3960927191008/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1989/05/24/000009265_3960927191008/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","loan_no":"3101","datestored":"2001-04-28T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1989-05-24T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Water, Women and Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The main objective of the project is to\n            improve the living standard of low income population groups.\n            To that end, the project will include three major components\n            relating to: (i) water supply and sanitation; (ii) income\n            generating activities; and (iii) project preparation in\n            other states.
