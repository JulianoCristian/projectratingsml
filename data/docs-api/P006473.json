     The project itself, benefiting from an uncommon combination\n            of factors, is unlikely to be replicable without adaptation.\n            Lessons learned include: a) soil conservation investments\n            must be based on technical changes that bring recognizable\n            and early productivity benefits to farmers; b) extensive\n            training, emphasizing group and
