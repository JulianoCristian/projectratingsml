The FSAL program therefore focused on the\n            following two key objectives: (1) improving the sector\n            environment to reduce the operational risks and latent\n            instability of even promising banks; and (2) dealing with\n            old problem loans and problem banks that affected the entire\n            sector. Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned in the project were as follows: (i) a stable\n            macro-economic framework is critical to the success of\n            financial sector reform; (ii) preparation of an FSAL within\n            the framework of a country's medium-term assistance\n            strategy will contribute to the success of the project;\n            (iii) financial reform strategy implemented in Kazakhstan\n            proved its viability and may provide a useful model for late\n            reforming Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries; (iv)\n            independence of the Central Bank is a key factor in the\n            success of the financial sector reform; (v) rapid response\n            and timely delivery of Technical Assistance (TA) is very\n            important to support FSAL implementation; and (vi)\n            hyperinflation, which reduced financial assets and\n            liabilities, and the low level of intermediation by the\n            financial system, gave the government a window of\n            opportunity to build institutions without making major\n            disruptions in the intermediation
