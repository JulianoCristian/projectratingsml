The key\n            lessons learned include: 1) A focus on strategic and\n            structured human resource development, backed with\n            management commitment and budget, was central to success. 2)\n            The creation of community accounts linked forest protection\n            and village resource development. 3) The sustainability of\n            joint forest management depends upon the capabilities of\n            local institutions to be fair and to manage conflict as it\n            arises since a disenchanted minority can easily sabotage\n            forest management efforts. 4) The practice of subdividing\n            the degraded forests of village forest committees into\n            multiage blocks proved to be an effective mechanism for\n            meeting the multiple interests of the community by providing\n            a diverse resource, a more continuous stream of benefits,\n            and a basis of rotational grazing. 5) Forest restoration\n            requires active public participation. 6) The poverty\n            alleviation impact of the project is considerable. Forest\n            benefit streams provide strong incentives to forest users,\n            and benefit sharing policy provides an effective\n            self-funding mechanism for regular forest maintenance. 7)\n            Communicating the aims and outcome of the forest sector\n            reform program to a broader constituency could provide\n            greater support for the program. 8) Reform of a public\n            forest institution and the establishment of collaborative\n            forest management require long-term commitment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Madhya Pradesh
