Portugal graduated from the Bank in\n            1989. Nevertheless, several lessons can be derived from this\n            experience of this last in a series of education projects:\n            first, it is critical to candidly assess, throughout\n            implementation, Government's commitment and capacity to\n            implementing the components of a given project, and take\n            heed to the emergence of alternative sources of financing\n            which may be more advantageous, and which may strain the\n            Borrower's implementation and managerial capacity. Part\n            of this commitment is demonstrated through provision of\n            timely and sufficient counterpart financing: if not\n            forthcoming, definitive actions should be taken to quickly\n            remedy the situation. Second, non-performing components\n            should be quickly and effectively dealt with early on, with\n            action taken to restructure or to drop them after giving\n            reasonable opportunity to progress. Third, those responsible\n            for monitoring implementation must be more alert and thus\n            better able to react appropriately, to the emergence of\n            conflicting priorities as public budgets evolve and demands\n            shift. Finally, when having the benefit of insight from\n            multiple projects in a given sector, better efforts should\n            be made to directly and openly take into account lessons\n            learned from those earlier experiences."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Portugal -
