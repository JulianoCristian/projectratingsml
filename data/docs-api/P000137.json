through introducing improved range\n            and cattle management systems on about 100 ranches to be\n            developed on tribal land zoned as commercial; (ii) seek new\n            technologies to benefit small livestock owners through\n            developing about fourteen grazing units on tribal lands\n            zoned as communal for testing alternative grazing systems\n            and provide support for small communal schemes in these\n            areas; (iii) promote more efficient marketing of livestock\n            through constructing new and improving existing trek routes,\n            improving rail handling facilities, and constructing holding\n            grounds for small stock; and (iv) strengthen institutions\n            serving livestock development programs. About 1,000\n            individuals in tribal areas are expected to benefit from the\n            ranch development and a much larger number, over 3,500\n            individuals, will benefit from the communal grazing units\n            and the improvement of the marketing infrastructure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Volume 2"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Botswana - Second Livestock\n            Development Project (Vol. 2) : Volume 2"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1977/10/748718/botswana-second-livestock-development-project-vol-2-volume-2","projn":"BW-Livestock Ii-319878 -- P000137","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Livestock and Animal Husbandry,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Drought Management,Agricultural Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Agriculture,Water Resources","count":"Botswana","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00122105325988"},"subsc":"(Historic)Livestock","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture,Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,Animal,Animal Health,Animal\n            Production,Animal Production Research,animals,Anthrax,arable\n            agriculture,arable land,beans,beef,birds,breeding,bulls,calf\n            mortality,calves,carrying capacity,Cattle,Cattle Herd,cattle\n            population,climatic conditions,cowpeas,Cows,Crop,crop\n            failures,Crop Production,cropping,Crops,cultivation,Desert\n            Soils,disease\n            prevention,drought,evaporation,farmers,farming,farms,fattening,field\n            work,food crops,Forests,Game,grain,grain\n            production,grasslands,Grazing,Grazing Land,grazing\n            lands,head of cattle,herd\n            size,Herds,herdsize,ILCA,insects,International Livestock\n            Center for Africa,lack of water,Livestock,Livestock\n            Development,Livestock Development Project,livestock\n            population,livestock\n            statistics,maize,marketing,meal,Meat,millet,National\n            Herd,Natural\n            vegetation,pests,planting,plowing,produce,production\n            systems,rainfall,rainfall areas,Ranch\n            Development,ranches,Range\n            Degradation,Rangeland,rangelands,regeneration,Rural\n            Income,sandy soils,soil types,soils,sorghum,Steers,stock\n            production,Stocking Rate,stocking rates,sunflower,Sunflower\n            seeds,traditional herds,trypanosomiasis,United\n            Nations,United States Agency for International\n            Development,USAID,veterinary,veterinary care,Water\n            flows,weed control,wells,wildlife,yields,young stock"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,Animal,Animal Health,Animal\n            Production,Animal Production Research,animals,Anthrax,arable\n            agriculture,arable land,beans,beef,birds,breeding,bulls,calf\n            mortality,calves,carrying capacity,Cattle,Cattle Herd,cattle\n            population,climatic conditions,cowpeas,Cows,Crop,crop\n            failures,Crop Production,cropping,Crops,cultivation,Desert\n            Soils,disease\n            prevention,drought,evaporation,farmers,farming,farms,fattening,field\n            work,food crops,Forests,Game,grain,grain\n            production,grasslands,Grazing,Grazing Land,grazing\n            lands,head of cattle,herd\n            size,Herds,herdsize,ILCA,insects,International Livestock\n            Center for Africa,lack of water,Livestock,Livestock\n            Development,Livestock Development Project,livestock\n            population,livestock\n            statistics,maize,marketing,meal,Meat,millet,National\n            Herd,Natural\n            vegetation,pests,planting,plowing,produce,production\n            systems,rainfall,rainfall areas,Ranch\n            Development,ranches,Range\n            Degradation,Rangeland,rangelands,regeneration,Rural\n            Income,sandy soils,soil types,soils,sorghum,Steers,stock\n            production,Stocking Rate,stocking rates,sunflower,Sunflower\n            seeds,traditional herds,trypanosomiasis,United\n            Nations,United States Agency for International\n            Development,USAID,veterinary,veterinary care,Water\n            flows,weed control,wells,wildlife,yields,young stock"}},"owner":"WB Off:Pretoria - Southern AFR 1 (AFCS1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"1630"},"facets":{}}}
