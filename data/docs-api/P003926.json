The project's main objective was to\n            increase the supply of unsubsidized term finance and\n            high-quality technical assistance to enterprises undergoing\n            restructuring in three industrial subsectors namely\n            textiles, pulp and paper, and engineering. Bank\u2019s\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower\u2019s performance was\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned are as follows: (i)\n            the experience with the IRP confirmed the validity of the\n            Bank's Operational Directive on Financial Sector\n            Operations; (ii) support for the provision of technical\n            services to firms needs to be driven by the demands of those\n            enterprises, rather than be supply driven, and should be\n            based on supporting measures to improve the public and\n            private provision of those services; (iii) build into\n            projects systems to monitor subproject implementation\n            results and TA impact; and, (iv) successful execution of\n            studies requires participation of all stakeholders\n            throughout the process, and adequate capacity in the\n            implementing agencies to manage them effectively."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Industrial Restructuring Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Industrial\n            Restructuring Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/02/732000/indonesia-industrial-restructuring-project","count":"Indonesia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,autonomy,bank deposits,Bank\n            Indonesia,Bank management,Bank Performance,bank\n            supervision,banking regulation,banking system,banks,barriers\n            to entry,benchmarks,capital adequacy,capital markets,central\n            bank,commercial banks,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,deposits,deregulation,development\n            projects,domestic credit,domestic liquidity,Environmental\n            Management,export growth,financial deregulation,Financial\n            Institutions,Financial Sector,Financial Sector\n            Development,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,government\n            regulations,imports,incentive framework,inflation,interest\n            rate,interest rates,laws,lending rates,loan\n            supervision,market risk,maturities,monetary policy,policy\n            environment,pollution,pollution abatement,portfolios,private\n            banks,private commercial banks,productive\n            assets,productivity,Project Financing,prudential\n            regulations,recession,savings,sensitivity analyses,state\n            banks,structural adjustment,technical assistance,term\n            finance,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,autonomy,bank deposits,Bank\n            Indonesia,Bank management,Bank Performance,bank\n            supervision,banking regulation,banking system,banks,barriers\n            to entry,benchmarks,capital adequacy,capital markets,central\n            bank,commercial banks,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,deposits,deregulation,development\n            projects,domestic credit,domestic liquidity,Environmental\n            Management,export growth,financial deregulation,Financial\n            Institutions,Financial Sector,Financial Sector\n            Development,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,government\n            regulations,imports,incentive framework,inflation,interest\n            rate,interest rates,laws,lending rates,loan\n            supervision,market risk,maturities,monetary policy,policy\n            environment,pollution,pollution abatement,portfolios,private\n            banks,private commercial banks,productive\n            assets,productivity,Project Financing,prudential\n            regulations,recession,savings,sensitivity analyses,state\n            banks,structural adjustment,technical assistance,term\n            finance,working capital"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Financial Intermediary Loan"}},"majtheme":"Environment and natural resource management","projn":"ID-Industrial Restructu -- P003926","topic":"Industrial Zones m1326507 1202,Industry Policy m1327403 1075,Industry Analytics and Diagnostics\n            m1326714 1231,Industrial Clusters and Value Chains\n            m1326062 1226,Industry Laws and Regulations m1327712 970","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Financial Intermediation,Banks & Banking Reform,Environmental Economics & Policies,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,Economic Theory & Research","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970716145515"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia"}},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"Other industry,Banking","theme":"Other financial and private sector development,Other environment and natural resources management","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Industrial Zones m1326507 1202,Industry Policy m1327403 1075,Industry Analytics and Diagnostics\n            m1326714 1231,Industrial Clusters and Value Chains\n            m1326062 1226,Industry Laws and Regulations m1327712 970","owner":"Financial & Private Sector Dept.
