under the First and Third Livestock Projects. It covers\n            selected counties in eleven provinces in eastern Turkey,\n            where mean family incomes are over 30 percent lower than the\n            national average. About 50 percent of the beneficiaries will\n            be small farmers, whose present incomes are at or below the\n            poverty level established for Turkey. Supervised credit will\n            be provided through TCZB, to about 5,200 subborrowers for\n            investment in imported and local high-quality animals, farm\n            buildings, pasture improvement and feedstuff production,\n            and, in appropriate cases, tractors and other farm\n            machinery.

the village development subproject of the\n            Second Livestock Project and to extend the improved dairy\n            production concepts introduced in western and central Turkey\n            under the First and Third Livestock Projects. It covers\n            selected counties in eleven provinces in eastern Turkey,\n            where mean family incomes are over 30 percent lower than the\n            national average. About 50 percent of the beneficiaries will\n            be small farmers, whose present incomes are at or below the\n            poverty level established for Turkey. Supervised credit will\n            be provided through TCZB, to about 5,200 subborrowers for\n            investment in imported and local high-quality animals, farm\n            buildings, pasture improvement and feedstuff production,\n            and, in appropriate cases, tractors and other farm\n            machinery. The project also provides for an expansion of\n            technical/extension services to farmers and training of\n            professional staff and farmers, both in Turkey and abroad.\n            To enable credits to be extended to small farmers, TCZB has\n            liberalized its loan security requirements and has agreed to\n            bear the full risk of non-payment for sub-loans make
