It encountered\n            serious problems throughout: the construction schedule was\n            over-optimistic; the wood gassification plant never supplied\n            more than 20 percent of the sawmill's requirements; the\n            sawmill suffered from poor design and layout and was\n            frequently out of action; and management was weak. The\n            project has not established a port facility nor a wood-fired\n            power facility capable of meeting demand. It has also not\n            undertaken research into forest management methods.\n            Production and exports have fallen far short of\n            expectations. On the positive side, it has provided access\n            to an otherwise inaccessible area, established a town, and\n            provided permanent employment. The most successful component\n            has been log harvesting; this has been well managed and a\n            long-term plan is in place. The sustainability of the\n            project is unlikely. The Government of Guyana now recognizes\n            that the successful management of Demerara Woods Ltd. is\n            beyond its capacity and hopes to dispose of the company\n            early in 1991. The Bank has shown a highly level of\n            commitment to the project throughout, but mistakes made\n            early on in the project cycle severely undermined its\n            viability. The Borrower's commitment has also been\n            strong throughout and considerable dexterity was shown to\n            prevent project collapse at an early stage. However,\n            problems of recruiting and retaining a high caliber staff\n            seriously inhibited the Borrower's ability to manage\n            the project. The five principle lessons learned are: (a)\n            large-scale innovative technology should never be\n            incorporated into projects; (b) in sawmilling projects,\n            detailed attention must be paid to mill design and technical\n            specifications; (c) unless a clear precedent exists, it\n            should be assumed that state-owned sawmilling enterprises\n            are unlikely to succeed; (d) great care must be taken to\n            ensure adequate human resources are available, and it cannot\n            be assumed that project support training will solve this\n            problem; and (e) where a project is cofinanced by several\n            agencies, one agency must adopt a lead role."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana - Upper Demerara Forestry Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guyana - Upper Demerara Forestry Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1991/05/737137/guyana-upper-demerara-forestry-project","projn":"GY-Agric.

The project would increase export earnings of\n            forestry products from the current level of US$3.9 million\n            to about US$11 million by 1982. The project would establish\n            logging operations over an area of 152,000 ha and process\n            the wood in a sawmill with an annual output capacity of 17.4\n            million bd ft of sawn timber. The project consists of\n            logging roads and equipment, a sawmill including repair\n            shops and transport fleet, a waste wood power plant with a\n            capacity of 6,000 kw, port facilities including a 13 km\n            access road to the port, and a township for about 1,500\n            people.

The project would increase export earnings of\n            forestry products from the current level of US$3.9 million\n            to about US$11 million by 1982. The project would establish\n            logging operations over an area of 152,000 ha and process\n            the wood in a sawmill with an annual output capacity of 17.4\n            million bd ft of sawn timber. The project consists of\n            logging roads and equipment, a sawmill including repair\n            shops and transport fleet, a waste wood power plant with a\n            capacity of 6,000 kw, port facilities including a 13 km\n            access road to the port, and a township for about 1,500\n            people. The design engineering and supervision of\n            construction of the project would be carried out by a\n            consulting firm which would also manage the sawmill complex\n            during the first three years of its operation. The project\n            includes a study for management of forest resources. It also\n            provides for training of both operative hands and management personnel."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana - Upper Demerara Forestry Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guyana - Upper Demerara Forestry Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/09/726887/guyana-upper-demerara-forestry-project","projn":"GY-Agric.
