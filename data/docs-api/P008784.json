Institutional development is rated high, and\n            sustainability as likely. Bank performance is rated highly\n            satisfactory for the Education Reform Project and\n            satisfactory for the Higher Education Project. Borrower\n            performance for both projects is rated satisfactory.\n            Experience with the projects confirms a number of OED\n            lessons from education projects: 1) When ministries\n            collaborate effectively and borrower staff are committed to\n            the reform process, projects that involve multiple\n            ministries may be effectively implemented. 2) Comprehensive,\n            complex and demanding reforms can work well if initiated\n            through respected national institutions, particularly if the\n            goals o f the reform are clearly explained to the public. 3)\n            Rigid procurement and disbursement requirements imposed on\n            smaller institutions (such as schools) or individuals who\n            receive grant funds may adversely impact their ability to\n            implement their projects. Special efforts may be required to\n            limit the paperwork and deadline obligations that grant\n            recipients face. 4) Small grants (e.g., for stipends or for\n            research) often have a portion contributed by the\n            government, since the Bank finances only a percentage.\n            Government delays in paying counterpart funds disrupt\n            important educational activities o f individuals. Broader\n            procurement planning may be needed to ascertain that a\n            shortfall or delay will not disrupt crucial activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Education Reform Project

A number of lessons drawn from the\n            project are conveyed as follows. The painful circumstances\n            prevailing in the country for fundamental social sector\n            reforms, were conducive to a difficult, costly, and slow\n            process. However, the option chosen in light of the frequent\n            political changes (which could have hampered reforms),\n            provided the opportunity, to the different leaders, to\n            advance the part of the reform closest to their political\n            platform. This was possible due to realistic assumptions,\n            and implementation arrangements, in line with the situation\n            in the country. Moreover, while stakeholder involvement, or\n            participatory processes were not an option at preparation,\n            the perceived power distance between the Government, and\n            individual citizens changed in time, so that by project\n            restructuring, participation was included in the pilot\n            component on rural education successfully. It is fair to\n            point out that despite frequent leadership changes, the\n            sustained political commitment was strong, enhanced by a\n            broad project design, suitable for each educational vision,\n            and strategy. However, the project missed the opportunity of\n            using convincingly, the power of good monitoring and\n            evaluation, though at final implementation, monitoring\n            criteria was used. While disputed arguments over taxation of\n            technical assistance (TA) contracts affected sub-components,\n            the focused work of TA in educational assessment, achieved\n            in a very limited time, was largely successful. Finally, the\n            sustained public information campaigns, though only\n            implemented at the Mid-Term Review, prominently supported\n            changes, directly reaching interested audiences, teachers\n            and parents."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Education Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Education Reform
