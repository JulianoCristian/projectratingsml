Some lessons\n            learned includes: the project was designed on the assumption\n            that reducing extraction of water from an aquifer and\n            reducing losses between the pump and the crop will make more\n            water available for other uses. The main weakness of project\n            design was that the project's main instrument governing\n            water extraction (the tripartite agreement) was a contract\n            with individual farmers while the regulation of extraction\n            needed to be broadened to encompass the entire population of\n            stakeholders using the groundwater aquifer. The\n            implementation of small works by the communities through\n            'community contracts' was found to be a great\n            success in terms of quality of works and creation of the\n            sense of ownership by the communities involved. The GSCP has\n            helped develop and demonstrate institutional and technical\n            methods that can help slow aquifer depletion, but for areas\n            where affordable groundwater stocks are being exhausted,\n            assistance should also be provided to help farmers cope with\n            the transition to non-irrigated livelihoods."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen -
