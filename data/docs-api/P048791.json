Some lessons learned included: in a country\n            with no precedent for incorporating biodiversity\n            conservation in spatial planning, it is unrealistic to\n            expect that it can be achieved within the relatively short\n            lifetime of a project. It is advisable to limit such\n            activities to a pilot level to demonstrate their benefits.\n            Establishing consultative bodies for protected area (PA) is\n            not a guarantee that they will operate in a meaningful way.\n            It takes substantial work and effort to develop adequate and\n            country-specific tools for successful stakeholder\n            representation in PA management. Top quality technical\n            assistance from peer organizations coupled with adequate\n            resources can significantly improve national standards and\n            practice of PA interpretation and visitor management, by\n            raising awareness about expectations of foreign visitors and\n            modern international good practice. Competitive Grant\n            Schemes (CGS) inevitably produces winners and losers. Full\n            transparency of the decision-making process, a good public\n            information system and appropriate community participation\n            in the CGS cycle can help avoid the

Negative environmental impacts include the\n            following: The small-scale construction of infrastructure\n            will have minor, short-term direct impacts on vegetation and\n            local species-mainly due to soil excavation, dust, and\n            noise. Increased recreational use of project sites may\n            produce a direct impact because of under-management of\n            tourist sites and facilities, possible overuse of campsites\n            or trails, increased waste, harvesting of live wood for\n            campfires, purposeful disturbance of wildlife, accidental\n            fires, disturbance of flora and fauna, trespassing into\n            fragile areas, and non-maintenance of trails lading to slope\n            erosion. Mitigation measures include: incorporating\n            environmental considerations into engineering design to\n            ensure that waste is managed: waste bins, and technology for\n            toilet facilities like leaching fields, organic composting,\n            and septic tanks. To reduce pressure on overgrazed\n            pasturelands, park administration will provide shepherds\n            with basic extension services and provide basic veterinary\n            assistance. Reducing the level of grazing through land\n            zoning will reduce disturbances to wildlife, in particular\n            the mountain goat.
