Though most objectives of Education I1 were\n            not met, the project was rated moderately satisfactory\n            because the infrastructure and staff training it provided\n            has increased institutional capacity in the long run. The\n            Education Sector Adjustment Credit was rated highly\n            satisfactory because nearly all its policy conditions were\n            met, and their effect was lasting. Institutional development\n            for the Pre-service Teacher Training Project was rated\n            substantial but for all others it was rated modest.\n            Sustainability was rated likely for all projects. Bank\n            performance was rated unsatisfactory for Education I1 (Bank\n            did not effectively intervene to resolve problems) and\n            satisfactory for the other projects. Borrower performance\n            was rated unsatisfactory for Education 11, highly\n            satisfactory for the Education Sector Adjustment Credit and\n            for the Pre-service Teacher Training Project; it was rated\n            satisfactory for the remaining three. Experience with the\n            projects confirms OED lessons from education projects: 1)\n            Policy dialogue and project activities must stay focused on\n            improving instructional effectiveness and providing students\n            with basic skills. Activities aimed at strengthening\n            management and procuring educational commodities may be\n            necessary but they are not sufficient for the improvement of\n            learning and quality in educational systems. Providing mass\n            education under clearly inadequate instructional conditions\n            may graduate functional illiterates and benefit only a\n            minority of students. 2) Textbooks are crucial providers of\n            information in schools. Procurement methods and plans must\n            aim at making large numbers of textbooks available at an\n            affordable cost and free to the poor. Textbook management\n            must build on the strengths of the private sector and of\n            community associations. 3) Sustained investment in human\n            resources can improve implementation capacity of specific\n            institutions. For example, foreign fellowships for persons\n            who return and devote their career to the agencies they were\n            expected to serve may result in a considerable cadre of\n            trained and competent staff. 4) In earlier decades, the Bank\n            supported vocational training schools in many countries,\n            which often function with few students, high unit costs, and\n            outdated equipment and curricula. Bank investments will be\n            best used if policy dialogue is focused toward modernizing\n            courses, generating income, and catering to the populations\n            likely to be interested in vocational training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea -

The overall\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower are\n            rated satisfactory. General lessons learned from the project\n            focused on the following: 1) Consensus among the key players\n            of any institutional reform is essential for successful\n            implementation. Solving the perennial problem of weak\n            coordination between ministries is critical. Where the\n            project was weakest-decentralizing teacher recruitment,\n            solving the teacher payment problems, undertaking\n            evaluations to make the link between teacher training and\n            student achievement--was where more than one ministry was\n            involved. 2) While the LIL instrument has been flexible, it\n            would be useful if the number of performance indicators was\n            determined at an earlier stage. 3) The LIL strengthened the\n            capacity in the education sector to pilot, test, and adjust\n            the decision-making process to evolving situations. 4)\n            Ministries of Education generally do not undertake\n            systematic monitoring and evaluation because they are\n            ill-equipped to do adequate economic and financial analysis\n            and generate the information needed to understand costs.\n            This is a general problem, but needs to be tackled upfront\n            if information and analysis is to be used in the decision\n            making. Project-specific lessons comprised the following: 1)\n            The involvement of associate teachers and school directors\n            in the practical training of the student-teachers was\n            extremely important in providing a solid professional basis\n            to the student-teacher, stabilizing them in their respective\n            classrooms within a very short time, and providing the\n            necessary professional support that they need on a\n            day-to-day basis within the school. However, associate\n            teachers and head teachers should be selected with great\n            care and given appropriate and sustained training and\n            incentives to make them want to host, monitor, and mentor\n            new student-teachers. 2) Regular training and a coherent\n            capacity-building program for all concerned parties (tutors\n            in the college, the pedagogic advisers, associate teachers)\n            is extremely important in ensuring consistency of messages\n            to students. 3) Lessons learned and difficulties encountered\n            during training should be fed back into the revision of\n            college-based courses for greater efficiency and relevance.\n            4) To ensure consistency and coherence, it is necessary to\n            put in place an in-service teacher-training program that\n            draws from the approach and contents of the current\n            pre-service teacher education program. 5) Project managers\n            attention should constantly be drawn to the importance of\n            monitoring and evaluation, and Bank staff should pay greater\n            attention during supervisions of monitoring and evaluation\n            activities. 6) The increase in the entry level qualification\n            enabled the teacher training institutions to focus and spend\n            a significant portion of their time on professional and\n            pedagogic training. 7) The rapidly changing composition of\n            the teaching corps and the growing numbers of contractual\n            teachers in the education system, is an urgent call for the\n            need to adopt a career development plan. 8) Adequate human,\n            fiscal, and physical resources are extremely important for\n            the smooth implementation of any program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Pre-Service Teacher Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea - Pre-Service Teacher\n
