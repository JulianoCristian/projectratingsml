Recommendations rather than lessons are\n            provided, first indicating that not only did the Public\n            Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review\n            (PEMFAR) report develop a more comprehensive diagnosis, and\n            more detailed recommendations - including a more realistic\n            sequencing of the proposed public finance reforms - but it\n            helped all stakeholders better understand the rationale for\n            the reforms, as more emphasis was placed on deepening the\n            reform process, on improving the structure of public\n            expenditures and on modernizing the country's budget\n            planning, and management instruments. The PEMFAR became\n            critical to the success of the project. Moreover, the type\n            of technical support national institutions need to implement\n            reforms, is not just through the Bank (which should not be\n            the sole institution involved in the preparation and\n            financing of such program), but also the country itself\n            should develop a budget reform/poverty reduction-related,\n            capacity-building strategy, that should be discussed with,\n            and supported by, all major donors. Finally, the protection\n            of activities and expenditures, vital to improve the\n            performance of public sector institutions and support the\n            goal of poverty reduction, require projections of government\n            revenue, based on a realistic external support:\n            overoptimistic budget assumptions about available resources,\n            will render impossible to adequately attain high-priority\n            maintenance and operating expenditures; rather, annual\n            budget preparation should be initiated at the earliest\n            possible stage, preferably during preparation of sector\n            strategies and medium-term public expenditure frameworks.\n            The study of the protection of vital recurrent expenditures\n            should also address the seasonality of both spending, and\n            available resources. Finally, it is suggested that sector\n            specialists need to be heavily involved in the design, and\n            supervision of a multi-sector adjustment program, focusing\n            on budget reform. Linking adjustment credits and sectoral\n            programs probably is the best way to give Bank sector\n            specialists the incentive to monitor effectively the\n            progress of the reforms to be implemented in their sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger -
