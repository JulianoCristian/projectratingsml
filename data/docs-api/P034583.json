Among the key lessons learned,\n            sustaining fiscal reform stands as a major factor in the SAC\n            successful operations, for although fiscal reform can be\n            hampered by external factors, such as the collapse of the\n            Russian economy, with severe fiscal strains for Georgia, the\n            country, nonetheless, was able to restore funds. However,\n            further gains in resource mobilization should only be\n            emphasized once tax compliance is achieved, for as revenue\n            mobilization increases, it becomes more difficult to achieve\n            incremental tax revenues. The lessons also suggest the\n            advantages of a high level counterpart to support successful\n            reforms, or resource mobilization. Likewise, certain\n            specific measures in the Letter of Development Policy, which\n            provided real power and credibility to both institutions,\n            were equally advantageous. Credibility of legal status can\n            be gradually built, as shown by the instrumental timetable,\n            which helped meet prudential targets under the SACs. While\n            the transfer of entities to the private sector, may be\n            facilitated by vouchers, these may tend to concentrate among\n            only a few, whereas a comprehensive listing, could provide\n            better results. The benefits of trade liberalization were\n            effectively emphasized under both operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - First and Second Structural\n            Adjustment Credit

    foster a strong and sustained growth recovery and reduce\n            poverty.  The Government's reform program, supported by\n            the project, aims at: 1) maintaining a tight monetary\n            program supported by an improving fiscal position; 2)\n            streamlining the Government sector and improving efficiency\n            of public spending; and 3) inducing a rapid adjustment of\n            the productive sector to new market signals.  Other\n            objectives of the project are to: 1) provide budgetary\n            support to maintain the level of critical public\n            expenditures; 2) provide foreign exchange for the purchase\n            of critical imports; and 3) provide a framework for\n            financial assistance from other donor agencies.  The key\n            reforms that the project will finance are: 1) removal of tax\n            exemptions and strengthening of tax administration; 2)\n            improvements in collection of energy payments; 3) changes in\n            the provision and financing of social services; 4)\n            restructuring of the pension system and social protection;\n            5) acceleration of
