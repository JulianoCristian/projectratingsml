Some lessons learned included: 1)\n            sustained government commitment is key to successful reform.\n            The privatization of the telecommunications company and the\n            institutional transformation of Credit Institution for\n            Micro-enterprises, (Association pour la promotion et\n            l'appui au d\u00e9veloppement des micro-entreprises) (PADME)\n            and Credit institution for Small and Medium Enterprises,\n            (Agence pour la promotion et l'appui aux petites et\n            moyennes entreprises) (PAPME), two major project activities,\n            have been delayed partly due to insufficient Government\n            commitment. The privatization unit was not independent and\n            adequately staffed. The commitment to privatize Benin\n            Telecom in a transparent way and using the World Bank\n            resources materialized only in 2005 with the new Government.\n            2) Stable policy environment is critical to ensure\n            sustainability of nascent and still fragile institutions\n            such as PADME and PAPME. 3) Experience has demonstrated that\n            institution-building takes time, and that the support should\n            be sustained to ensure their success. 4) The key performance\n            indicators that were defined appeared to be excessive in\n            number and in many cases called for data that was not\n            readily available without beneficiary surveys being conducted."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Private Sector

competitiveness, and the access of small\n            and medium enterprises (SMEs) and micro-enterprises to\n            credit. The project has three components. The first aims to\n            remove remaining policy constraints to private sector\n            development and exports through concrete actions agreed in\n            the context of an improved dialogue between the government\n            and the private sector. This component will also support the\n            privatization program. The program will privatize two\n            textile companies and adopt a new sectoral policy for the\n            textile sector. It will also design and implement a revised\n            sectoral policy in the telecommunications sector to increase\n            sound competition and efficiency. The second component will\n            help local firms enhance their competitiveness and develop\n            external markets for their products. It will assist the\n            recently established association for export development in\n            providing services to its members. This component includes a\n            matching grant fund and support for trade information\n            services. The third component builds on recent efforts to\n            develop two credit institutions into sustainable financial\n            institutions specifically geared to meet the needs of SMEs\n            and micro-enterprises; strengthens micro-finance supervision\n            in the finance ministry; and helps develop a micro-finance\n            nongovernmental organization."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin -
