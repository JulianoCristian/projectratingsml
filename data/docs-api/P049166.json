A key lesson learned from this\n            project is the importance of combining social and community\n            services components with infrastructural components,\n            particularly in the context of land reclamation and\n            Irrigation and Drainage (I&D) projects. The project\n            shows that basic social infrastructure (drinking water\n            supply, sanitation, electricity, health facilities, etc.)\n            can be as important as the availability of I&D\n            infrastructure in attracting people to newly reclaimed\n            areas. The project also illustrates the important\n            contribution of community development support activities.\n            Although they generally account for only a small fraction of\n            project overall costs, such activities are crucial elements\n            for creating and developing social cohesion in a context\n            where families from different regions and backgrounds have\n            come together. The project clearly illustrates the critical\n            importance of the project formulation and design phase, and\n            their underlying assumptions. The project preparation team\n            failed to recognize the risk in the Government of Egypt\n            (GOE) not complying with its commitment of having all\n            I&D operating properly. The team also failed to\n            recognize the constraints imposed by Principal Bank for\n            Development and Agricultural Credit (PBDAC) collateral\n            requirements for farmers to have access to credit, which led\n            to the failure of the largest component in the original\n            design. On the positive side, the project showed that major\n            restructuring could provide the needed corrective measures\n            to compensate for weak project design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - East Delta Agriculture Services Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - East Delta Agriculture\n            Services Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/06/12800547/egypt-east-delta-agriculture-services-project","projn":"EG-East Delta Ag.

The project became effective January 25,\n            1999. It was formally restructured, with approval by the\n            Board in 2002. Since the restructuring the project has been\n            implementing activities in accordance with the restructuring\n            plan; the project is focused on the project description as\n            delineated at the time of the restructuring.
