Some lessons learned\n            included: the parallel financing provided by the Royal\n            Netherlands Government allowed the project implementation\n            team to hire needed technical assistance prior to signing\n            and effectiveness. This ensured that people were in place to\n            support critical project components when the project became\n            effective. Moreover, the block grants could also begin right\n            as the project became effective so that villages could begin\n            their ECED programs quickly. The Project's\n            interventions were provided in a package that included\n            facilitation, block grants (for operation) and teacher\n            training that proved to be very effective. Moreover, each\n            village group received facilitation under the Project during\n            three years, long enough for them to be made aware of the\n            ECED services. This period was important to generate demand\n            for ECED at the village level and also to build ownership by\n            the local population by providing incentives for them to\n            establish and operate ECED centers. Together, these design\n            features were important for obtaining positive achievements\n            and to ensure sustainability at the community and district

objective of the Early\n            Child Education and Development Project (ECED) for Indonesia\n            is to improve poor children's overall development and\n            readiness for further education, within a sustainable\n            quality ECED system.  The project is rated\n            'satisfactory' on both project development\n            objectives (PDO) and implementation progress. Most of the\n            performance indicators have been met, and in some instances\n            targets have even been exceeded. Nearly 6,000 target\n            community-managed ECED centers have been funded and are\n            operational, providing services to children ages 0-6 years\n            old. More than 497,000 children (mostly 3-6 years old) have\n            now enrolled in these services. A parenting program will be\n            introduced this year to increase immediate benefits to\n            younger children and to prepare those children for later\n            successful participation in ECED centers. Another notable\n            progress at the community level is the functioning of a\n            community-based monitoring team (TPP) which had been idle in\n            previous years.
