The project was\n            conceived as the first phase of a longer term institution\n            building and maintenance program. It was to assist the\n            Government to improve institutional capacity for the\n            maintenance of the road network; to meet the backlog of\n            periodic maintenance on the most important sections of its\n            paved and unpaved road network; and to improve the\n            accessibility of rural areas for which agricultural\n            development projects were being implemented or planned.\n            Another objective was to help develop the domestic\n            construction industry. The project was substantially\n            completed in July 1988 at the beginning of the rainy season.\n            The physical targets of the project were substantially\n            achieved although progress was delayed by diversion of\n            equipment and frequent reorganizations of the Ministry of\n            Public Works, Transport, and Urbanism (MTPTU). Considering\n            the many setbacks the project suffered during several coups\n            in Burkina Faso in the early 1980s, the results achieved are\n            satisfactory. The project implementation was reasonably good\n            under difficult circumstances of domestic turmoil which\n            prevailed during most of the executing period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Fourth Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso - Fourth Highway
