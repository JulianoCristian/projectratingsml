Sustainable Municipal Solid Waste\n            Management Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Sustainable Municipal Solid Waste\n            Management Project for Tunisia received an unsatisfactory\n            outcome rating with substantial risk to development outcome.\n            Both the Bank and the Borrower received moderately\n            unsatisfactory ratings for their part in the project. There\n            was one restructuring of the project that saw extensive\n            changes to the project. The reasoning for the restructuring\n            was to: (a) to complete the remaining infrastructure and\n            institutional activities; (b) to adjust the institutional\n            component to take into consideration the post-revolution\n            context at both a national and local level; and (c) to more\n            accurately measure project progress and outcomes. The\n            proposed restructuring would not modify the Project\n            Development Objective (PDO). Key changes included: (i)\n            Extension of Loan closing date by two years, (ii) revision\n            of project components to include: (a) replacing the activity\n            on regional municipal solid waste management plans by an\n            independent strategic review of the national solid waste\n            management program (PRONGID); and (b) investing in 7 instead\n            of 9 landfill gazes (LFG) collection systems outside of\n            Tunis. (iii) Update of the results monitoring framework to\n            account for the change in project components, candidly\n            reflect project outcomes, and adapt specific targets\n            especially those related to reduction of CO2 emissions. (iv)\n            reallocations between disbursement categories to reflect the\n            addition of a new category of eligible expenditures for\n            training. There were five key lessons learned from this\n            project and are as follows: (1) The model used by CDM\n            (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - IPCC 1996) was\n            too rigid and highly optimistic, as was already clear\n            following its 2006 revision. A more cautious approach in the\n            economic analysis in view of the uncertainty surrounding the\n            reduction of emissions would have been appropriate. (2)\n            Agreements can be negotiated with waste pickers. Each\n            country should develop guidelines on how to deal with waste\n            pickers looking for win-win solutions, taking into account\n            recycling procedures, local circumstances and waste pickers\u0092\n            traditional lifestyle. (3) It is urgent to develop a\n            mechanism for consultations with communities on where to\n            erect new facilities, and implement a solid communication\n            strategy. (4) Strengthening the sustainability of municipal\n            waste management in a highly centralized system of\n            government with little autonomy and accountability at the\n            local level is a daunting task. (5) The reform of the solid\n            waste management system is a long-term process. Because of\n            the complexity of the issues, a series of operations are\n            needed to build up the sustainability of the system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Sustainable Municipal Solid Waste\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia -
