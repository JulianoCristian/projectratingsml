Some lessons learned included:\n            improving financial and operational performance is an\n            important objective that needs consistent effort from all\n            sides to be achieved. Objectives need to be realistic, and\n            dialogue with the owners of the utilities, the local\n            governments, is an essential element to ensure the success.\n            Readiness for implementation is one of the key factors of\n            project success. Large infrastructure projects should\n            commence after land acquisition issues are cleared, the\n            final designs and necessary permits (location permit,\n            construction permit) are ready. Public consultation is also\n            an important element to explain the project to the affected\n            beneficiaries. The selection of monitoring indicators and\n            baselines need to be carefully done taking into account\n            existing capacities and applicable standards, and involving\n            institutions that are in place to monitor results. Showing a\n            clear link between wastewater infrastructure investments and\n            their environmental impact has positive demonstrative\n            effects on building acceptance and ownership of the project\n            in the region and the country."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia -

This\n            environmental assessment aims at assessing potential\n            environmental consequences of the project; and recommending\n            measures that should be taken in order to maintain\n            conditions for the protection of the marine environment in\n            the sea.  During the construction of the collecting system,\n            the impact of odor will be mitigated by ventilators and\n            filters for air cleaning.  Noise will be reduced by burying\n            the structures under ground and sufficiently apart from\n            residential areas.  When constructing the treatment plants,\n            unpleasant odors and aerosols will be mitigated by forced\n            ventilation of the entire indoor space. Solid wastes\n            associated with the operation of the treatment works will be\n            properly disposed of.  For instance, screenings will be\n            washed, dewatered, and disposed at a sealed landfill site.\n            To prevent fresh and sea water pollution, the submarine part\n            of the outfalls will be protected from wave and anchorage\n            impacts by burying and concreting the pipes to the point of\n            8 meters of sea water depth.  The problem of vibration of\n            the outfalls as a result of air penetration into the pipes\n            will be eliminated by the construction of an appropriate\n            ventilation shaft."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia -
