During\n            the first half of the 1990s (1992-95), BiH experienced the\n            most devastating violent conflict and collapse of its\n            economy altering the social and economic landscape of the\n            country and causing widespread economic damage. In an effort\n            to provide yet another opportunity to the Borrower to\n            finalize the restructuring process, on July 18, 2008, the\n            Bank sent a letter to the Borrower requesting confirmation\n            of the project implementation arrangements by September 15,\n            2008. However, the latest implementation arrangements\n            presented by the Government in September 2008, proposing to\n            have a project team that would move physically between the\n            two entities every six months, were judged as inappropriate\n            by the Bank and a sign of lack of ownership and commitment\n            to reform the project. Taking into account lack of progress\n            since project approval in June, 2005 and the diminished\n            support for ERP from government authorities, the decision to\n            cancel the credit was made by the Bank on October 29, 2008.\n            As no activities were implemented under the project and no\n            disbursements had taken place, the entire credit was\n            cancelled.  Some lessons learned are as follows: 1)\n            excellence in technical analysis is not sufficient to\n            counterbalance the political cost of implementing unpopular\n            reforms, unless there is a strong local ownership of the\n            reform agenda; 2) linking conditionality to board\n            presentation under investment operations may not be the best\n            vehicles for triggering reforms, such as the adoption of the\n            controversial higher education law, something which can be\n            more effectively accomplished under development policy\n            lending's (DPLs); and 3) implementation arrangements\n            need to be more tailored to the country environment to be\n            more conducive to sound implementation, particularly in\n            countries such as BiH with its internal institutional complexities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -

The\n            project consists of three components.  The first, the\n            Secondary Education Grants Program will provide grants to\n            schools to: (a) facilitate the development and\n            implementation of broad based curricular programs and\n            technical and professional curricular families for secondary\n            education, and (b) enable certain schools to expand so that\n            students are able to study revised four year programs or\n            attend general education.  The second, education finance and\n            management, will facilitate the design and implementation of\n            more transparent formula-based financing mechanisms for\n            publicly-provided general education.
