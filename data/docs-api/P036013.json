Some insights, rather\n            than lessons are offered from the success experience of this\n            operation. It is first emphasized that policy changes are\n            more likely to be implemented successfully when Bank support\n            is provided right at the time when public entities have\n            committed to the process of commercialization, and,\n            supportive sector-wide reforms are being put in place.\n            However, whenever railway companies are moving toward\n            commercial operations, their long-term financial health\n            needs to be assured by rationalizing subsidy support, and\n            introducing an appropriate costing model. In addition, a\n            critical success factor in a complex task, such as the\n            installation of an integrated management system, is that\n            sufficient technical supervision and support must be\n            available to assist with problem solving as may arise.\n            Further lessons point at maximizing the benefits of a\n            complex information system, which require that middle and\n            upper level management foresee, and understand the benefits\n            of using the system; and, at the Public Service Obligation\n            Subsidy, which should be for specific services that the\n            Government considers socially necessary; such services\n            should be transparent, explicitly defined, and fully\n            compensated as part of a Contract Plan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Railway Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Railway Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6049149/romania-railway-rehabilitation-project","projn":"RO-Railway Rehabilitation -- P036013","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"Romania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050707134541"},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Railways","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, assets, ballast cleaning, Bank\n            management, Bank Performance, borrowing, Centrally planned\n            economies, coaches, competition from road, complex task,\n            Corridor, cost of capital, debt, debt service,\n            Decentralization, EIB, environmental protection, Financial\n            Performance, financial resources, Fiscal Year, Freight,\n            freight operations, freight operator, freight operators,\n            income, inflation, institutional change, Institutional\n            Development, labor productivity, legislation, local\n            governments, locomotives, macroeconomic stabilization,\n            management, market economies, natural resources, operating\n            costs, operations, passenger coaches, passenger services,\n            passenger trains, peer review, Private Sector, Private\n            Sector Participation, privatization, productivity,\n            profitability, property taxes, provisions, PSO, Public\n            Service, Public Service Obligation, rail, rail network, rail\n            system, rail transport, RAILWAY, railway infrastructure,\n            railway operations, railway operators, railway project,\n            railway reform, RAILWAY REHABILITATION, railway\n            restructuring, railway sector, railway service, railway\n            staff, railway traffic, Railways, reorganization, rolling\n            stock, savings, stations, structural adjustment, sustainable\n            use, technical assistance, telecommunications, track,\n            tracks, traffic units, trains, transition economies,\n            transparency, transport, wagons"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF023062-PHRD-LOCAL GOVERNMENT\n            DEVELOPMENT PROJ.,TF029112-PHRD-RAILWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF030313-CANADIAN CTF FOR CENTRAL AND\n            EASTERN EUROPE FY03 - ECA GENERAL,TF030428-CANADIAN CTF FOR CENTRAL AND\n            EASTERN EUROPE FY04 - ECA GENERAL,TF040621-ROMANIA - RAILWAYS AND BULGARIA\n            RAILWAY REHAB PROJECT","repnb":"32688"},"3421747":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/05/3421747/romania-railway-rehabilitation-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/05/3421747/romania-railway-rehabilitation-project","new_url":"2004/05/3421747/romania-railway-rehabilitation-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/05/13/000012009_20040513130454/Rendered/INDEX/27705.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/05/13/000012009_20040513130454/Rendered/PDF/27705.pdf","loan_no":"3976","datestored":"2004-05-13T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2004-05-11T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Gray cover","versiontyp_key":"1309938","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Romania - Railway Rehabilitation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The outcome of the project is highly\n            satisfactory, sustainability highly likely, and\n            institutional development impacts are high, with a highly\n            satisfactory borrower performance, and satisfactory Bank\n            performance. Regardless of the highly satisfactory outcomes,\n            lessons of experience suggest the following. The partnership\n            in the loan - in this case between the Government, the\n            Railways, and the Bank - bestows upon the Bank a greater\n            responsibility than simply monitoring progress of the\n            lending program, and progress on each of its components.\n            Through the interaction with the Ministry of Transport and\n            the Executive Management of the Railway, the Bank staff\n            needs to understand the changing (Railway) environment, and\n            share in the development of strategies to ensure the overall\n            success of the Railway reform. In projects with significant\n            institutional development, or restructuring objectives,\n            supervision missions should review, and conduct consultation\n            meetings beyond the project components framework, to guide\n            the process towards the shared objectives between the client\n            and the Bank, with encouragement by the Bank, and management\n            assistance (Railway in this case) towards decisions that\n            continue the reform programs, an in turn, building support\n            for such actions at the Government level. The project's\n            partnership, upon restructuring, needs to address details of\n            a project's components only when needed, but when\n            necessary, do so exceptionally. This was recognized by the\n            Bank early in the review and supervision process, in\n            connection with the Integrated Railway Information System,\n            and increased consultations and reviews on this component,\n            and its supporting telecommunications component, in order to\n            provide the required expertise, and achieve success. General\n            lessons further suggest that while lender/donor coordination\n            is best managed by the borrower, discussions should take\n            place with the Bank on the content of project interventions,\n            prior to these being undertaken, and, given restructuring\n            needs, appropriate importance should be given to the Mission\n            Statement and Mandate, being Supervision the adequate phase\n            for the details of the project's policy and\n            institutional components, not during preparation which may\n            be out of context."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania -
