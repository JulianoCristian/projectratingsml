Design of schools should be based on the actual\n            building sites selected, and functions must be discussed\n            with end users to ensure that the curricula can be\n            effectively delivered, and cost estimates are realistic.\n            Projects with a heavy organizational change component should\n            include a communication and change management strategy so\n            that all stakeholders are fully aware of the objectives,\n            strategies, and implications. Objectives such as gender\n            equity and poverty reduction require specific measures to\n            ensure their realization. Unit involved in project\n            implementation should be staffed with trained personnel\n            throughout the life of the project, particularly in critical\n            areas such as procurement. Management of the implementing\n            agency and Project Advisory Committees must provide the\n            necessary direction and support to ensure the success of the\n            project. Attention must be given to ensuring that studies,\n            formulation of policies, systems for monitoring efficiency\n            and effectiveness are implemented in a timely manner.\n            Fellows must be selected carefully and arrangements made for\n            trained personnel to be deployed appropriately to allow for\n            transfer of knowledge and application of skills."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Saint Lucia -

As a second, integral part of the\n            strategy, the project catalyzes a major adjustment process,\n            focused on revision to more reasonable levels of primary and\n            secondary teacher to student ratios, in line with ratios of\n            countries at similar levels of economic and social\n            development. Such adjustment is critical to ensure that\n            already relatively high levels of resource allocations to\n            public education better respond to current and projected\n            needs, including increased financing for system management\n            and educational equipment and supplies, and school\n            facilities and equipment maintenance - all of which are\n            areas presently significantly underfinanced."},"docna":{"cdata!":"St. Lucia - Basic Education Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"St. Lucia - Basic Education\n            Reform Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/12/732762/st-lucia-basic-education-reform-project","projn":"LC-St. Lucia Basic Education Reform Project\n            -- P038698","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender","count":"St. Lucia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970702134845"},"subsc":"Secondary education,Central government administration,Primary education,Tertiary education","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ACADEMIC YEAR,additional resources,age\n            cohort,Basic Education,compulsory\n            education,curricula,Curriculum,detailed planning,economic\n            constraints,Economic Development,economic growth,economic\n            transition,education policy,education projects,Education\n            Reform,education sector,education system,education\n            systems,educational administration,educational\n            inputs,educational materials,educational\n            opportunities,Educational Planning,Educational\n            Testing,employment,Environmental awareness,formal\n            education,girls,improving access,labor force,language\n            arts,leadership,learning,learning opportunities,leaving\n            school,levels of education,mathematics,Ministries of\n            Finance,National education,parents,partnership,poverty\n            reduction,primary school,primary school facilities,primary\n            schools,primary students,principals,private sector,Public\n            Sector,qualified teachers,quality education,school\n            buildings,schooling,secondary education,secondary\n            level,secondary schools,social development,student\n            achievement,student performance,teacher,teacher\n            effectiveness,teacher training,Teachers,teaching,tertiary\n            education,Test scores,textbooks,universal access,universal\n            access to primary education,universal access to secondary education,youth"},"1":{"cdata!":"ACADEMIC YEAR,additional resources,age\n            cohort,Basic Education,compulsory\n            education,curricula,Curriculum,detailed planning,economic\n            constraints,Economic Development,economic growth,economic\n            transition,education policy,education projects,Education\n            Reform,education sector,education system,education\n            systems,educational administration,educational\n            inputs,educational materials,educational\n            opportunities,Educational Planning,Educational\n            Testing,employment,Environmental awareness,formal\n            education,girls,improving access,labor force,language\n            arts,leadership,learning,learning opportunities,leaving\n            school,levels of education,mathematics,Ministries of\n            Finance,National education,parents,partnership,poverty\n            reduction,primary school,primary school facilities,primary\n            schools,primary students,principals,private sector,Public\n            Sector,qualified teachers,quality education,school\n            buildings,schooling,secondary education,secondary\n            level,secondary schools,social development,student\n            achievement,student performance,teacher,teacher\n            effectiveness,teacher training,Teachers,teaching,tertiary\n            education,Test scores,textbooks,universal access,universal\n            access to primary education,universal access to secondary education,youth"}},"owner":"Education Sector (LCSHE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"}},"trustfund":"TF034299-COLOMBIA -
