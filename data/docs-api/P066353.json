Strong Government\n            support is another key success factor for a GDLN center to\n            become a well recognized and well utilized capacity building\n            facility, since the primary target audience of a GDLN center\n            consists of senior policy makers within the public\n            administration. In Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal, the\n            governments have provided continuous support through the\n            sponsoring of learning activities and the promotion of the\n            center's services across the ministries and the major\n            administrations. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            activities are an important part of a Learning and\n            Innovation Loan (LIL) initial design. Otherwise, the\n            assessment of the success (or failure) of the pilot cannot\n            be carried out.

There are five\n            components to the project. Component one: clarifying land\n            tenure. This component will remain intact. That is, it will\n            help secure land rights and develop private and government\n            capacity to survey land and provide titles to interested\n            right holders. Component two and three: enhancing local\n            management capacity and financing of local investments. The\n            component on local participatory planning (enhancement of\n            local management capacity) and the related financing\n            component (local investments) will be combined. Component\n            four: supporting decentralization and project coordination.\n            Activities related to support Cote d'Ivoire's\n            decentralization process will be omitted in the restructured\n            project because this process has been stalled due to crisis.\n            Component five: boosting rice production. In the face of the\n            recent \"food price crisis\" in Cote d'Ivoire,\n            a new component will be added to help vulnerable farm\n            households in the north and west of the
