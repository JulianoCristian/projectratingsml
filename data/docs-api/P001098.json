It is too early\n            at this stage to attempt a full evaluation of project\n            outcomes as the various institutions have been in operation\n            for too short a time and a later review of these outcomes is\n            needed. Even so, a few lessons can be learned from the\n            project at this time. First, severe problems in project\n            implementation arose because the views of user ministries\n            were insufficiently taken into account during project\n            generation and appraisal. Second, the Borrower's\n            reluctance to adapt to the Bank's accommodation\n            standards has resulted in school enrollment targets not\n            being reached. Third, closer coordination between RMWA and\n            Bank headquarters was needed in the supervision of the\n            project. Fourth, a cheap source of power for television\n            receivers is needed for the establishment of an economical\n            ETV system. Finally, changes in curricula are difficult to\n            effect and need close attention by Bank missions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ivory Coast - Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ivory Coast -

The project has two noteworthy features.\n            The first time the Bank will be directly involved in the\n            field of primary education and also, for the first time, the\n            Bank will participate in the financing of instructional\n            television. The Ivory Coast provides particularly justified\n            grounds for these innovations. The reason is that the\n            country has achieved remarkable economic performance since\n            independence in 1960. Primary education has continued to\n            prepare primary school leavers exclusively for secondary\n            school entrance and for white collar jobs. In so doing it\n            has failed to respond to the real needs of the economy. The\n            Government is aware of these shortcomings and has drawn up a\n            long-term educational program based on a new policy. The\n            main objectives of this policy are to improve the efficiency\n            of the system and to expand the output of technical,\n            vocational, agricultural education; and at the secondary and\n            post-secondary levels."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Transcript of Meeting of the Executive\n            Directors of the IBRD Held on March 24, 1970:  Ivory Coast\n            Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ivory Coast -
