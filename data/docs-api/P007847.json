Several lessons were gleaned from this\n            project: 1) A CDD approach (community driven development)\n            require years of accompaniment in order to train and coach\n            the communities to generate social and human capital and\n            engage actively in productive activities that will increase\n            rural family incomes. 2) CDD approach creates voice for the\n            silent poor, developing confidence among its residents, and\n            a stronger interest to demand a plan for local development.\n            3) Investments financed by communities increase the\n            likelihood of better subproject maintenance. 4) A project\n            designed with a CDD approach should have a dynamic\n            monitoring and evaluation system that will be updated as new\n            subprojects are introduced into project implementation. For\n            example, a baseline would have made it easier to gauge\n            advancement.   5) Project coordinating units need to be\n            insulated from political interference. 6) The follow-on\n            project in preparation should have a much stronger emphasis\n            on income generating subprojects and the marketing of their\n            products.7) Clarify the specific role of other sectoral\n            institutions in project implementation. 8) Design the Fund\n            for Sustainable Agricultural and Rural Development (FUSARD)\n            as a separate component versus subcomponent. 9) A CDD\n            approach would benefit from closer coordination with local\n            authorities for potential fiscal support for both capital\n            and recurrent expenditures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama -

Specific operational goals include: creating\n            capacity at the local level to organize, self-diagnose\n            problems, plan activities, seek out and negotiate\n            assistance, and act to resolve priority quality of life\n            issues; (2) establishing a demand-driven financing mechanism\n            operating in high poverty areas and providing matching\n            grants to communities; and (3) promoting long-term\n            conservation and sustainable use of Panama's\n            biodiversity resources. To meet these objectives, the\n            project will finance three components: (a) sustainable rural\n            development, promoting community training, organization,\n            planning, and investment; (b) biodiversity conservation,\n            financing research and planning and environmental impact\n            assessment and monitoring, capacity building for\n            participants and institutional strengthening in\n            environmental impact assessment processes; and (c)\n            activities contributing to biodiversity conservation and\n            sustainable use; and (c) coordination of the two components\n            by a unit also financed to provide technical assistance and\n            studies related to rural development and natural resources
