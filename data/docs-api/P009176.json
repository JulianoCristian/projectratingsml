Although the four\n            projects were generally well conceived and executed, certain\n            difficulties were experienced in the construction of some of\n            the roads. In the context of rapid and thorough going\n            political and managerial reorganization, the four highway\n            projects under audit were not well suited vehicles for the\n            promotion of the Bank's policy dialogue. Nevertheless,\n            adaptations were made within these constraints and the\n            projects did make some, though limited, contributions to the\n            development of transport policy.
