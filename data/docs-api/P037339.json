Up-front geological\n            risks, linked with drilling of the first geothermal doublet\n            need to be mitigated by careful geological assessments.\n            Geothermal projects require integrated analysis of\n            geological, technical, environmental, economic and financial\n            aspects. Market demand is a function of relative costs of\n            geothermal heat relative to other heating options. Market\n            assessment should include evaluations of consumer choice\n            variables in selection of heating systems, current estimates\n            of heating costs from existing systems, and likely end user\n            efficiency improvements following conversion to geothermal\n            heat. The proposed financing plan will have to be designed\n            for debt service levels that the operating company can\n            support. A detailed implementation timetable, taking account\n            of the phasing of project components and re-assessment prior\n            to the next phase, is essential. Sound and experienced\n            project management is key for the success of a geothermal\n            project, as in any complex project. In particular, the\n            management should include an experienced top manager, who is\n            knowledgeable about major key aspects of geothermal projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Podhale Geothermal District Heating\n            and Environment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Poland -

There are five project components. The\n            first supports drilling geothermal wells for production and\n            re-injection to cover the base-load heat demand for the\n            entire service area; constructs a geothermal district\n            heating plant, an absorption heat pump plant, and a natural\n            gas plant; and expanding the existing district heating\n            infrastructure. The second component builds a new heat\n            distribution network. The third component installs heat\n            exchanges and meters in individual households and other\n            buildings. The fourth component, the project management\n            component, supports the institutional strengthening of the\n            district heating enterprise(PEC/GP) with an emphasis on\n            providing technical consultant services and specialized\n            services such as financial management and auditing. The\n            fifth component is aimed at monitoring and evaluating the\n            global environmental benefits from the project, that is,\n            making a credible assessment of carbon reductions, which in\n            turn helps establish the potential for a broader\n            introduction of geothermal district heating in Poland and\n            elsewhere in Central and Eastern
