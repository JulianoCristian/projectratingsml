This was the case with coping\n            strategies where, because of community participation, there\n            was often an increased demand for smaller water tanks. It\n            also led to easier transition to participatory beneficiary\n            involvement during implementation. With beneficiary\n            involvement during implementation, temporary jobs were\n            created and targeting improved because the\n            unemployed/under-employed were more available to\n            participate.  Even when the goal is to deliver climate\n            change-related global benefits, one must build national\n            policies and priorities, because global benefits will be\n            achieved and sustained only if they are consistent with\n            national policies and priorities. For community-based\n            biodiversity and climate change projects to succeed, one\n            must build over a period of time partnerships and\n            understanding among project implementers and communities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen -
