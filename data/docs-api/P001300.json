The rating\n            is consistent with the fact that, given only partial\n            achievement of the immediate objectives of the project, it\n            is unlikely that institutional development, as supported by\n            the project, will be financially sustainable, in light of\n            the existing, and future, levels of Government funding, and,\n            it further spells out the absence of increased awareness,\n            and adoption, of improved technologies, a key assumption\n            within the project. The performance of the Bank is assessed\n            as deficient, both in terms of preparation and appraisal, as\n            well as supervision, due to a consistent lack of objectivity\n            regarding the actual impact, and likely sustainability of\n            the project. Similarly, the performance of the borrower, who\n            did not comply with most of the legal covenants, is rated\n            unsatisfactory. Several lessons are drawn from the project,\n            namely, that to ensure cost effectiveness of extension\n            operations, funding should be identified at the earliest\n            stages, and, if contribution difficulties arise, operations\n            should be scaled down to appropriate funding levels. In\n            addition, the design process must incorporate realistic risk\n            assessment of key policy, institutional, and financial\n            aspects, to adequately influence project outcomes, while\n            more analytical rigor should be introduced for supervision,\n            and, management should account for clearly defined responsibilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya -
