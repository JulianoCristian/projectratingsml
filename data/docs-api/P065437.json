Some lessons\n            learned includes: project design should have a robust\n            assessment of the governance challenges and plan mitigation\n            measures accordingly. Long-term engagement in the sector and\n            consistency of the supervision team are assets in using\n            adaptive management methods to resolve issues. A phased\n            approach allowed for the implementing agencies to, first,\n            build a basic operational capacity and, then to benefit more\n            fully from substantial field investment was appropriate\n            under the circumstances.

       long-term conservation of Uganda's biodiversity,\n            through a sustainable, and cost-effective management of its\n            wildlife, and cultural resources. To this end, the project\n            components will: 1) fund the establishment of the Uganda\n            Wildlife Authority (UWA), develop its internal systems,\n            management team, and governance structure. A strategic plan\n            was developed for the agency, which includes methodologies\n            for facilitating the annual operating plans for the\n            protected areas. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) share\n            of this component reflects incremental costs for the\n            administration of a protected area system, economically\n            justified due to the competing land uses, and the basic\n            needs of the relatively poor, rural population. The\n            rationalization process involves the protection of the\n            biodiversity heritage, and ecosystems, to provide sound\n            basis for a sustainable tourism sector. The project will\n            also ensure appropriate resettlement plans; 2) provide\n            logistical support, equipment, and construction funds to\n            establish new programs for environmental conservation\n            education, to include a range of exhibits, and awareness\n            campaigns, supporting biodiversity conservation; 3) provide\n            training, management support, and technical capacity\n            building, to enable the Wildlife Department implement its\n            responsibilities under relevant international treaties,\n            particularly to function s the management authority for the\n            Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species\n            (CITES). Moreover, a sustainable tourism framework will be\n            established, based on policy development, and an enabling\n            legislation; and, 4) provide moderate, operational funds,\n            equipment, and civil works to continue the establishment of\n            the Uganda Museums and Monument Agency, to facilitate its\n            offerings expansion, and identify new antiquarian sites."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Protected Areas Management and\n            Sustainable Use Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Protected Areas\n            Management and
