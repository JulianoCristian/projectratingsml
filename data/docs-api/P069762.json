The\n            Agricultural Rehabilitation Project had the following\n            ratings: moderately satisfactory outcome, unlikely\n            sustainability, modest institutional development impact,\n            satisfactory Bank performance, and not rated Grantee\n            performance.  The Second Agricultural Rehabilitation Project\n            had the following ratings: moderately unsatisfactory\n            outcome, unlikely sustainability, modest institutional\n            development impact, unsatisfactory Bank performance, and\n            satisfactory Grantee performance. Experience with these\n            projects highlights the following lessons: 1) With its\n            global outreach and the expertise and experience of its\n            staff the Bank is well positioned to make a substantial\n            contribution to post-conflict reconstruction and\n            development.  However, the experience of the three community\n            empowerment and the two agriculture rehabilitation projects\n            shows that careful thought to suitability of design and\n            strategies to country conditions is paramount, especially\n            where country capacity is weak; 2) even in the case of\n            post-conflict Timor-Leste, where sophisticated monitoring\n            and evaluation was impractical, there was a need to have a\n            system to track project inputs, outputs, and outcomes and\n            provide information about the adaptations needed in project\n            design to ensure that the project objectives and activities\n            are in keeping with the emerging institutional context and\n            the absorptive capacity of the country; 3) particularly in\n            post-conflict environments, an approach to capacity building\n            that considers the underlying capacity in the country as\n            well as how it would be promoted by the various donors is\n            critical; and 4) the experience of Timor-Leste highlights\n            the critical importance of coordinating multi-agency\n            reconstruction efforts more effectively in a newly\n            independent post-conflict country."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor-Leste -

Community Empowerment and\n            Local Governance Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Although the project outcome is rated\n            satisfactory, supported by satisfactory performances, both\n            by the Bank and Borrower, sustainability is unlikely and\n            institutional development impacts are only modest. A number\n            of lessons of relevance to future operations in Timor-Leste\n            and to operations in other post-conflict situations are\n            provided, lessons especially important in three areas: local\n            governance and institutional development (including in\n            regards to the role of women), project management and the\n            relations with the Government, and the revolving funds. The\n            lack of governmental presence at local levels in the\n            post-conflict situation requires that careful thought be\n            given to how local level institutional development can later\n            be related, to the extent possible, to emerging\n            administrative or representative structures, in order to\n            avoid competing authorities, side-lining of local\n            non-governmental institutions developed, or wasting capacity\n            and skills developed at the local level, which could be of\n            value to the emerging formal structures. Local capacity\n            building should remain a priority throughout a project,\n            particularly with regard to regular leadership training,\n            gender sensitivity training, and training in participatory\n            needs assessment, and project planning. It is important to\n            keep the women in the mainstream of the development process:\n            the establishment of one development council, rather than\n            several bodies in the community, promoted the mainstreaming\n            of women in community development. Gender disaggregating\n            project data is a prerequisite for a development project,\n            while lack of attention to this prevents management from\n            recognizing, and addressing critical gender-related issues\n            appropriately. Finally, it is essential to keep the local\n            governance objective high on the project agenda, and to\n            actively create awareness of this at the national, as well\n            as local levels to ensure that lessons learned are\n            integrated into the policies of the emerging government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor Leste -
