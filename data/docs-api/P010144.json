Given that this was the first Bank\n            financed project in the telecommunications sector. The Sri\n            Lanka Department (SLD) adapted to the Bank procedures and\n            procurement practices. The project reporting was regular.\n            There were, however, substantial delays in project\n            implementation, largely due to a late decision to move from\n            analogue to digital technology and consequently the need to\n            redesign part of the network. The overall performance of the\n            Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL), the Borrower, and SLTD, the\n            beneficiary, has been quite satisfactory. Since the project\n            covered manly rural areas, which have long suffered from\n            lack of communication for economic advancement, it is\n            reasonable to conclude that,
