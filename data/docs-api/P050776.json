Some\n            lessons learned included: flexibility in supervision to\n            adapt to changing scenarios is essential for success, both\n            when the changes are marginal and when they are fundamental\n            to the point of rendering the attainment of the operation\n            objectives impossible. The Bank can help in building lasting\n            reforms by limiting the scope of the projects to what can be\n            accomplished within a certain political and economic\n            environment, even if not fully market-oriented. Donors such\n            as the Bank can add value by setting benchmarks consistent\n            with international best practice and putting the client\n            institution in contact with top practitioners in each field.\n            In principle, a viable and broadly independent microfinance\n            institution can be set up within an existing public sector\n            bank and there may be benefits to doing so. However, this\n            leaves it open to influence by the prevailing political\n            climate. It may be tempting in some political environments\n            to expand outreach at the expense of sustainability. The\n            Bank's decision to remain engaged was anchored on real\n            successes achieved in terms of outreach, which illustrates\n            dilemmas about outreach versus sustainability. Subsidies can\n            be explicitly taken into account through a Subsidy\n            Dependence Index provided it is well defined. While\n            institutional aspects are crucial for the delivery of\n            financial services to microenterprises, national economic\n            policies are equally crucial."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Northeast Microfinance Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Northeast Microfinance\n            Development

The project\n            addresses the lack of access of the poor to financial\n            services, an important constraint to improved productivity\n            and incomes. The project's overall objective is to\n            improve the access of microenterprises throughout the\n            Northeast Region to sustainable, formal financial services\n            by supporting expansion of the program known as\n            \"CrediAmigo\" in Brazil. The project has three\n            components. The first provides funds for CrediAmigo to make\n            loans for working capital and investment to solidarity\n            groups and individual solidarity group clients who have\n            \"graduated\" by virtue of a good loan repayment\n            record. The second component strengthens the capacity of\n            CrediAmigo by hiring consultants to assist it to develop\n            promotional and marketing strategies; build risk management\n            capabilities; enhance loan officer productivity; increase\n            cost-effective geographic coverage using projections,\n            bolstering legal and regulatory requirements, and providing\n            training and support needs; identify and design new loan and\n            savings products; conduct evaluations of the environmental\n            management program; and to support loan administration.
