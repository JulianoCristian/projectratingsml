Some lessons learned includes: an\n            effective combination of government commitment, investments,\n            and public participation can achieve real improvements in\n            solid waste services. A related lesson is that this same\n            combination can catalyze fundamental reforms in the solid\n            waste sector, but these changes take time to be effective\n            and cannot be expected to happen overnight. Financial\n            sustainability in solid waste management is incomplete if\n            cost recovery from primary waste generators is not\n            addressed. Local opposition to siting landfills can be a\n            serious stumbling block to project implementation, resulting\n            in lengthy delays and potential project failure. Since\n            landfill projects are inherently risky from a non-technical\n            standpoint, a multi-municipality and multi-site approach can\n            help mitigate these non-technical

The project has\n            made progress towards meeting its development objectives and\n            is likely to achieve them if implementation is completed as\n            planned, however overall implementation has been slower than\n            originally envisaged. Initially the project made steady\n            progress with respect to activities in the northern coastal\n            Municipalities of Kotor, Budva and Tivat, resulting in\n            improved solid waste disposal and environmental conditions\n            in this area. The extension has been requested by the\n            Government of Montenegro by a letter dated July 30, 2010, in\n            order to allow for conclusion of the negotiations between\n            the Bank and the Government for the additional financing\n            (AF) and for its presentation to the Bank's Board of\n            Directors for approval. This will be the third extension of\n            the project closing date.
