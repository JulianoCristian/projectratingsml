Riots and looting of project facilities\n            during the first two years of project implementation\n            resulted in the destruction and loss of technical and\n            financial information available at the level of implementing\n            agencies. Insecurity and political instability thereafter\n            prevented continuation of implementation and supervision.\n            Thus, for example, there are no data available to indicate\n            that livestock productivity was raised by expanding animal\n            health services under this project. The students being\n            trained in Senegal did not complete their curriculum before\n            the project closed. The looting of warehouses belonging to\n            the National Federation of Central African Herders (FENC)\n            during the riots seriously disrupted distribution of\n            veterinary pharmaceuticals, causing increased mortalities of\n            livestock and alleged emigration of a number of herds to\n            neighboring countries. Civil disobedience and lack of the\n            government's timely responses eventually led to the\n            closing the project. Project sustainability is uncertain.\n            Overall World Bank performance is rated marginally\n            satisfactory while Borrower performance is adjudged\n            unsatisfactory. However, The Interprofessional Livestock\n            Development Fund (FIDE) stands out as a model for the\n            organization of financial flows to the livestock sector,\n            both from within and outside, from the private sector, and\n            from Government, with joint management in which\n            professionals have the opportunity to gain control."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central African Republic - Livestock\n            Development and Rangelands Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Central African Republic -\n            Livestock Development and Rangelands Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/03/728880/central-african-republic-livestock-development-rangelands-management-project","projn":"CF-Nat.
