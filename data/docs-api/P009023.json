Bank performance was, on balance, satisfactory,\n            but there were some areas of weakness in strategy and policy\n            and the Bank could have pushed further, even at mid-term,\n            towards challenging the community decision processes in the\n            direction of identifying and targeting the poor and\n            involving women. Legal rangeland ownership issues and\n            associated data were clearly not adequately understood at\n            appraisal. Borrower performance is rated satisfactory but\n            there were some weaknesses. The borrower was committed to\n            the project and provided very strong leadership in achieving\n            the inter-departmental coordination between the Department\n            of Reforestation and Erosion Control (AGM) within MOF, the\n            General Directorate of Production and Development (TUGEM),\n            the General Directorate for Agricultural Research (TAGEM),\n            and the General Directorate of Rural Services (KHGM) within\n            the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA). The\n            sustainability is rated non-evaluable, based on a weighting\n            of several elements. The objectives of the project as stated\n            were, essentially, \"to restore sustainable (land\n            management) in the upper watersheds\". There are a\n            number of concerns about sustainability but also, given the\n            very long-term impact of these objectives and the lack of\n            early impact data, unusually

Major lessons are as\n            follows. A participatory project design should focus on the\n            process, rather than on physical targets, although clearly,\n            informed assumptions have to be made for the purpose of\n            estimating costs, and returns. In this case, the design\n            should have allowed for an annual cycle of work, starting\n            from participatory micro catchment planning, while the ratio\n            between conservation, and supporting income-generating\n            expenditure should be further addressed. While the project\n            delivered an infrequent, and invaluable lesson in the\n            successful collaboration between implementing agencies, it\n            also showed that key elements within such cooperation (and\n            that of villagers) are time, and training, requiring\n            flexibility to accommodate each agency's contribution\n            to its fullest extent. Despite successes, legal\n            uncertainties surrounded the rangeland, particularly the\n            non-forest rangeland, aggravated by an inadequate legal\n            framework for the Ministry of Agriculture's\n            participation in related activities. Nonetheless, the\n            exemplary approach taken by project design, and\n            implementation is worth noting, which built on existing\n            local technology, and capacity, thus enhancing the\n            employment of its farmer-centered problem-census\n            problem-solving approach, in a sensitive manner.

In-situ conservation areas for woody and\n            non-woody target species were established, and institutional\n            capacity for the development of a national strategy plan for\n            in-situ conservation, was built. Despite successful\n            achievements, project implementation was longer than\n            expected, and, the one year extension of closing date, was\n            due to biological and scientific reasons, which caused\n            delays in the selection of gene management zones (GMZs). The\n            lessons learned suggest that, a number of elements should be\n            in place for successful in-situ conservation efforts,\n            mainly, that forestry, agriculture, and environmental\n            agencies actively coordinate these efforts, and\n            specifically, that communities in the proximity of the GMZs,\n            be properly familiarized, and participate in project\n            management. Effective mechanisms, such as the Project\n            Implementation Committee or Inter-Ministerial Steering\n            Committee could cooperate, if limited experience exists\n            among project agencies in working together; and, project\n            design should include funding to secure community\n            participation. Projects which are technical in nature,\n            require adequate training in the most advanced techniques,\n            same should be provided at the earliest stages.
