The\n            project would include; (iii) associated programs, namely the\n            expansion to 500 ha of the outgrower program, a pilot\n            program of food crop production aimed at provision of basic\n            foodstuffs for workers, and studies and rubber trials (in\n            the areas of Kribi and the Southern and Eastern provinces)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Third HEVECAM Rubber Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon - Third HEVECAM Rubber Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1984/05/741557/cameroon-third-hevecam-rubber-project","projn":"CM-Hevecam Rubber -- P000361","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Public Sector Economics,National Governance,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Cameroon","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970818102142"},"subsc":"(Historic)Perennial crops","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting,Accounting records,agricultural\n            problems,agricultural production,Agricultural\n            Research,agriculture,audits,autonomy,Balance\n            sheet,Cadres,climatic conditions,competitive\n            bidding,Consolidation,cost of capital,crops,Debt,Debt\n            service,Decrees,diseases,economic\n            analysis,education,EIB,Electricity,equipment,ethnic\n            groups,execution,expenditure,extension,FINANCIAL\n            ANALYSIS,financial difficulties,financial\n            institutions,Financial Rate of Return,financial\n            resources,FINANCIAL RESULTS,fiscal,fiscal\n            year,Forestry,Government\n            Management,health,Housing,inventories,lack of autonomy,Legal\n            Documents,legal provisions,legal requirements,living\n            conditions,logging,market value,Marketing,municipal\n            government,municipality,Nations,OIL,operating\n            costs,operating expenses,parastatals,Private\n            sector,Producers,productivity,Public\n            services,rehabilitation,representatives,roads,Rural\n            Development,savings,social infrastructure,social\n            services,subsidiary,Taxation,technical\n            assistance,timber,transport,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounting,Accounting records,agricultural\n            problems,agricultural production,Agricultural\n            Research,agriculture,audits,autonomy,Balance\n            sheet,Cadres,climatic conditions,competitive\n            bidding,Consolidation,cost of capital,crops,Debt,Debt\n            service,Decrees,diseases,economic\n            analysis,education,EIB,Electricity,equipment,ethnic\n            groups,execution,expenditure,extension,FINANCIAL\n            ANALYSIS,financial difficulties,financial\n            institutions,Financial Rate of Return,financial\n            resources,FINANCIAL RESULTS,fiscal,fiscal\n            year,Forestry,Government\n            Management,health,Housing,inventories,lack of autonomy,Legal\n            Documents,legal provisions,legal requirements,living\n            conditions,logging,market value,Marketing,municipal\n            government,municipality,Nations,OIL,operating\n            costs,operating expenses,parastatals,Private\n            sector,Producers,productivity,Public\n            services,rehabilitation,representatives,roads,Rural\n            Development,savings,social infrastructure,social\n            services,subsidiary,Taxation,technical\n            assistance,timber,transport,water supply"}},"owner":"WB Off: Yaounde-Central Africa 1 (AFCC1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"5046","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Troisieme projet de Hevecam - Cameroun"}}},"facets":{}}}
