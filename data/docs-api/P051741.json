Some lessons\n            learned included: the project was able to reach its goals\n            despite all obstacles thanks to the flexibility used by the\n            World Bank and Government's team in its implementation.\n            This flexibility helped to respond to the cyclones and to\n            evolving needs. This flexibility also allowed quick\n            reallocations of resources from activities funded by other\n            sources to others that were not. The decentralization of the\n            activities financed by the project, and particularly the\n            technical assistance offered to the deconcentrated levels of\n            the ministry also allowed a smoother implementation of\n            activities and the achievement of the project development\n            objective (PDO). However, technical assistance to the\n            central level is also needed to ensure a sustainable\n            development of the health system. Public-private\n            partnerships in the health sector can be a useful tool to\n            provide quality health services; however, enough resources\n            need to be provided to ensure that the cost of this\n            provision is covered. To increase service utilization it is\n            important to make sure that all causes of non-utilization\n            are dealt with. This project only aimed at improving\n            geographical access by trying to build new facilities.\n            However, the main cause of non-utilization of health\n            services has always been their cost."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Second Health Sector Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Madagascar - Second Health Sector\n            Support

There are five project\n            components. The first finances civil works for health\n            centers and district hospitals, re-equipping newly\n            constructed or rehabilitated health facilities; and carries\n            out studies, trains personnel, provides medicines; supports\n            supervision activities, decentralized health\n            administrations, sanitation activities; and helps maintain\n            buildings, equipment, and vehicles. The second component\n            finances transport and other logistical expenditures, drugs\n            and insecticides, equipment, studies, and training to\n            diagnose, prevent, treat, and monitor malaria, tuberculosis,\n            plague, and schistosomiasis. The third component funds\n            information, education, and communication efforts to improve\n            reproductive health service delivery; training to raise\n            standards in health interventions like child survival and\n            safe motherhood; and prevention campaigns to improve\n            STD/HIV/AIDS services, particularly among prostitutes and\n            other groups at risk. The fourth component provides a\n            package of institutional strengthening and child treatment\n            support to enable the health ministry to enhance the\n            effectiveness of nutrition programs and to develop a\n            multi-sectoral operational nutrition information system. The\n            fifth component finances reform by improving sector\n            coordination; increasing service coverage, financial access,\n            and equity; and enhancing
