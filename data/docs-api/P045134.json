The lessons\n            learned indicate that in a country, like Bosnia and\n            Herzegovina, with strong traditions in the forest sector,\n            benefits of Bank assistance lie in sector reform and\n            institutional strengthening as well as the introduction of\n            modern technologies. Nevertheless, the lesson is that\n            initial emphasis on technical investments can achieve\n            immediate impacts on the ground and can build trust as well\n            as momentum for institutional reforms. In the Bosnia and\n            Herzegovina (BiH) forest sector, the Bank was seen as a\n            trusted broker, and as a result, it helped achieve consensus\n            between varying stakeholder interests, as well as among\n            sub-sectors. The lesson is that support for a participatory\n            approach to institutional reform is more likely to be\n            successful than a purely technical approach. Project\n            implementation was initiated in a post-conflict situation,\n            yet it was successful. The lesson is that Bank support for\n            technical issues in a divided country can help bring about\n            broader based trust and collaboration between stakeholders.\n            Reform processes need enough time to mature and to convince\n            all stakeholders and that the speed of change varies from\n            country to country. Therefore, facilitators of reforms need\n            to stay involved in order to sustain processes after they\n            are initiated.  The lesson is that patience and continued\n            support are needed to bring about sustainable reform. The\n            project included a range of financing instruments including\n            grant funding for capacity building. The lesson is that\n            projects seeking to achieve institutional reform benefit\n            from a mix of credit and grant funding."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Forestry

construction and\n            utilization. Some of those negative environmental impacts\n            and measures to mitigate them are described here: During the\n            construction phase, use soil and humus after construction\n            for topsoil or use borrows with valid operating license. To\n            alleviate mud and dust, wet or cover truck load. Use\n            alternative routes to minimize noise, vehicle exhaust, and\n            road congestion. During operation, limit activities to\n            daylight working hours and operate equipment with mufflers\n            to reduce noise disturbance and lessen vibrations. Cover\n            working areas, use sealed formwork, isolate wash down areas,\n            collect and dispose of waste material at appropriate\n            locations, secure storage and ensure proper loading of fuel\n            along with maintaining equipment to prevent water and soil\n            contamination. Avoid crop and tree destruction by\n            appropriately handling machines and paying compensation for\n            damages. Prevent oil and fuel spills to reduce air, water,\n            and soil pollution. Workers will be supplied with safety\n            instructions and protective gear. To control vehicle speed,\n            install traffic and warning signs. To limit traffic volume,\n            monitor movement of cattle. To minimize danger of erosion,\n            landslides, and hazardous conditions, install nets and\n            warnings, and repair roads."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Forestry Project :\n            environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -
