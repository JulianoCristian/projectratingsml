The main\n            lessons learned from the experience under the three TSP\n            operations are: 1) In cases like Timor-Leste where there is\n            high political risk, due in large measure to high\n            unemployment among disgruntled youth, efforts should be\n            directed at creating jobs and achieving \"quick\n            wins\" in poverty-related services, and through work\n            programs; rather than dissipating efforts across a wide\n            range of areas and measures, with little explicit\n            priorities. 2) Where capacity limitations are severe and\n            technical assistance (TA) is normally required to do the\n            work itself, as well as to train a large number of\n            personnel, it is probably more effective to provide TA which\n            is dedicated entirely to training, in parallel to advisors\n            who actually do part of the work. Combining both functions\n            in the same individual, though attractive in principle,\n            often leads to situations where the advisors devote hardly\n            any time to training, and therefore, building local capacity\n            suffers. 3) Quite often, but particularly in countries with\n            limited qualified personnel, success is highly correlated\n            with working with the more competent and committed\n            counterparts. Therefore, where possible, it would be\n            desirable for the Bank to focus its support around proven\n            achievers, while seeking to develop institutional capacity.\n            4) Despite its costs to the Government and its development\n            partners, which can be high at times, the benefits of active\n            donor coordination are often worthwhile and outweigh its\n            costs, as demonstrated by the experience under the TSP program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor-Leste - First, Second, Third\n            Transition Support

Timor-Leste had the following ratings: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. The Second Timor-Leste\n            Transition Support Program had the following ratings:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            low or negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. The lessons learned\n            included: 1) Fostering ownership and supporting country\n            systems. As a budget support operation, the TSP has ensured\n            that the use of funds from the operation responds to\n            Government priorities, supporting ownership; 2) Building\n            management capacity and results-orientation through program\n            implementation. The TSP has supported capacity building\n            through its dialogue on policy design and implementation and\n            its monitoring of results. The Government's capacity is\n            much stronger in these areas today than it was at the\n            restoration of independence; 3) Prioritizing for results in\n            a capacity-constrained environment; 4) Balancing short-term\n            results with long-term institution-building. Budget support\n            operations such as TSP play an important role in the\n            long-term strengthening of Government systems and processes\n            and the development of institutional structures; 5)\n            Supporting a whole-of-Government approach. In bringing the\n            majority of Timor-Leste's development partners together\n            around a whole-of-Government framework for development, the\n            TSP has provided an anchor for all donor-financed activities\n            in the country; 6) Providing timely analytical inputs for\n            appropriate program design and fruitful dialogue. The TSP\n            has been built on detailed analytical work to guide the\n            design of program objectives and activities; 7) Balancing\n            coverage and focus. The TSP brought to light the challenges\n            of budget support in low-income, low-capacity countries; and\n            8) Minimizing the burden of preparation, appraisal, and\n            monitoring. The Government and, in particular, the Ministry\n            of Planning and Finance as the main coordinating agency, has\n            argued that TSP progress and appraisal missions have placed\n            a considerable burden on the administration, with the\n            counterpart teams fully engaged in the TSP process during missions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor-Leste - Third Transition

satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was satisfactory, and the\n            Bank and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The\n            findings and implications indicate that the development of\n            sector management information systems permits a gradual\n            shift away from milestones towards performance indicators.\n            Survey data reveals significant gender inequalities in\n            development indicators and access to public services. The\n            Transition Support Program (TSP) has built on the\n            Government's planning process, by incorporating\n            priority actions identified in agencies' annual action\n            plans. The scope and detail of the TSP and its annual matrix\n            are, in part, a consequence of the TSP assuming a\n            coordinating role across a wide range of sectors. There has\n            been much debate regarding the appropriate scope and detail\n            required in the TSP program and action matrix. The\n            Government has argued that the TSP progress and appraisal\n            missions have placed a considerable burden on the\n            administration, with the counterpart teams fully engaged in\n            the program process during missions. The TSP has supported\n            capacity building through its dialogue on policy design and\n            policy implementation. The TSP has provided a key forum for\n            policy dialogue between the Government and its external partners."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor-Leste - Second Transition Support Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Timor-Leste -
