The project\n            was approved by the Board on August 20, 1991. Subsequently,\n            military-led riots broke out in several parts of Zaire,\n            which led to widespread looting and the evacuation of most\n            foreigners. As a result, the credit did not become effective\n            until December 8, 1992. Following effectiveness, project\n            activities moved slowly because of the difficult political\n            and economic circumstances. These included non-payment of\n            civil servant salaries, lack of counterpart funding,\n            liquidity problems in the banks, hyper-inflation, and the\n            continuing absence of technical staff. Additional riots in\n            1993 further complicated project implementation because of\n            looting and deteriorating security. As with other projects\n            in Zaire, disbursements were suspended indefinitely on July\n            15, 1993. On November 15, 1993, because the Government had\n            failed to meet its debt service obligation, Zaire was placed\n            in non-accrual status and the Bank decided to close all\n            credits to the country. On March 4, 1994, IDA closed the\n            credit and canceled the undisbursed balance. Only eight\n            percent had been disbursed, of which three-quarters was used\n            for project preparation. No audit is planned. Notably, the\n            project managed to achieve the close collaboration of all\n            donor agencies funding agricultural research, including an\n            agreement to merge independent research programs under a\n            single national structure. This provides a potential basis\n            for future coordination."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zaire - National Agricultural Research Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zaire - National Agricultural\n            Research Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/10/734113/zaire-national-agricultural-research-project","projn":"ZR-Ag Res -- P003112","docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation","subtopic":"Agricultural Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Science Education,Scientific Research & Science Parks,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Education","count":"Congo, Democratic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961007110949"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural\n            extension,Agriculture,collaboration,consulting\n            services,equipment,farmers,food security,International\n            Service for National Agricultural Research,ISNAR,National\n            Agricultural Research,poverty\n            alleviation,programming,research capacity,research\n            programs,rice,rice research,rural roads,Scientific\n            Research,technical assistance,training programs,UNDP,United\n            Nations,United States Agency for International\n            Development,upland rice,USAID"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural\n            extension,Agriculture,collaboration,consulting\n            services,equipment,farmers,food security,International\n            Service for National Agricultural Research,ISNAR,National\n            Agricultural Research,poverty\n            alleviation,programming,research capacity,research\n            programs,rice,rice research,rural roads,Scientific\n            Research,technical assistance,training programs,UNDP,United\n            Nations,United States Agency for International\n            Development,upland rice,USAID"}},"owner":"WBOff:Kinshasa-CC2:DRC/CG(Braz) (AFCC2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"13602"},"5076676":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1991/09/5076676/conformed-copy-c2292-national-agricultural-research-project-development-credit-agreement","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1991/09/5076676/conformed-copy-c2292-national-agricultural-research-project-development-credit-agreement","new_url":"1991/09/5076676/conformed-copy-c2292-national-agricultural-research-project-development-credit-agreement","docm_id":"090224b0807fb00e","chronical_docm_id":"090224b0807fb00e","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/AFR/2004/12/15/20DA36E97FBC23A685256F020082ED4E/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/20DA36E97FBC23A685256F020082ED4E.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/AFR/2004/12/15/20DA36E97FBC23A685256F020082ED4E/1_0/Rendered/PDF/20DA36E97FBC23A685256F020082ED4E.pdf","credit_no":"IDA22920","datestored":"2004-09-01T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1991-09-09T00:00:00Z","unregnbr":"29936","docna":{"cdata!":"Conformed Copy -
