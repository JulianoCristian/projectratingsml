Some\n            lessons learned included: the key lessons from this project\n            are that genuine Water Resource Management (WRM) reforms\n            will be successfully delivered if: (i) there is a strong\n            enabling policy, regulatory and legal framework; (ii) strong\n            political commitment to the reform process and the will to\n            overcome the resistance to reforms that will emerge; (iii)\n            any reform package should include a combination of\n            government institutional reforms or top down measures and\n            bottom up reform measures involving water users. This\n            combined approach should be focused on participatory\n            irrigation management by creating and strengthening the\n            relationship between the water service providers and the\n            water users through Water User Association (WUAs).\n            Professional leadership and management by Project Management\n            Offices (PMOs) at all levels is a key success factor, as is\n            the careful selection and continuity of appointment of PMO\n            staff at all levels. The Bank's supervision strategy\n            was built around using this capacity within the\n            borrower's project management organizations and\n            institutions and effectively using the monitoring and\n            evaluation system established through an independent third\n            party, thus developing trust and credibility between the\n            Bank and the borrower."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Guanzhong Irrigation Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Guanzhong Irrigation\n            Improvement

There are eight\n            project components. 1) Improvement and expansion of water\n            source will improve the existing nine irrigation areas and\n            develop some tracts of land. 2) Improvement of major\n            distribution system will support repair and completion of\n            concrete panels or masonry lining in main and branch canals.\n            3) The component will support rehabilitation of pumping\n            stations in six irrigation districts (IDs). 4) This\n            component will improve the existing minor canals, drains,\n            and on-farm development works on partially irrigated land,\n            and expand new systems to land that currently has no\n            irrigation distribution network at the lateral level. 5)\n            Improvement of operation and maintenance will improve access\n            roads to key infrastructure works and renovate management\n            stations and research facilities. 6) Training, study tours,\n            and technical assistance will improve the knowledge and\n            understanding of resources. 6) Project management\n            arrangements will ensure good coordination between\n            government bureaus and irrigation districts associated with\n            project implementation. 7) This component will supervise IDs\n            in finalizing the designs for the canal improvement works.\n            8) The component will facilitate land acquisition to\n            accommodate enlarged storage facilities and relocate the\n            people
