Lessons\n            learned focus on a) loan conditions and selection of a Bank\n            product, b) microfinance activities, and, c) info-center\n            components. The selected loan instrument - Learning and\n            Innovation (LIL) - in particular, requires a flexible\n            project design, especially so given the Bank's standard\n            amendment process, which can be time-consuming and\n            unresponsive to client needs and timeframes; rather, a\n            streamlined amendment mechanism would be helpful in\n            increasing the effectiveness of LILs. Moreover, since\n            technical assistance (TA) plays such an important role in\n            LILs, the Bank supervision team should be prepared to\n            provide expert advice and experience. However, other forms\n            of Bank assistance might have been more effective, such as a\n            fee-based contract for TA. Since Nacional Financiera (NAFIN)\n            had sufficient funding for micro-finances, a TA relationship\n            could have provided the missing elements of state-of-the-art\n            technical tools, systems, indicators and cases, based on\n            international best practice. Lessons for microfinance\n            operations stipulate that limiting the institutional format\n            of the microfinance service provider in the legal agreement\n            was not useful, and set the stage for amendments. Twinning\n            and franchising approaches may prove to be an efficient\n            means of providing a significant scale of microfinance\n            services. Turnkey projects would be another option. It is\n            further outlined that TA and local circumstances can help\n            guide a subsidized, state credit program into a viable\n            autonomous microfinance institution-but this evolution takes\n            time and a commitment, that goes beyond short-term\n            expediency. Finally, it is noted that sector-specific\n            info-centers and portals are more likely to succeed than\n            those with a more general private sector clientele. The\n            government can play a catalytic role in info-center\n            development, given successful info-centers or cybercaf\u00e9s\n            require an alignment of the interests and capacity of\n            suppliers, producers, and distributors. This is difficult to\n            achieve through market mechanisms only. Thus, an initial\n            investment by the government can build private sector faith\n            in the system, and help overcome initial technological,\n            financial and organizational barriers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -

The components\n            will: 1) strengthen eligible micro-finance institutions\n            within the country's less developed rural-urban\n            markets, through innovative approaches for local businesses,\n            to gain reliable access to commercially priced working\n            capital, and investment credit, and secure as well savings\n            facilities; 2) promote increased access to information\n            communications technology-based business development\n            services, to enable participating micro-businesses to access\n            new markets, and increase income. Business application,\n            databases, and business management, and planning tools will\n            be developed to match local needs; in addition, training,\n            and programs will be provided for the use of ICT in business\n            development services; and, 3) design, and implement\n            monitoring, and evaluation systems, supported by consulting\n            services, and, will as well finance the incremental costs of\n            equipment, and software needed for this purpose. Project\n            management, administration, and coordination will be\n            financed, as will the necessary training to ensure\n            widespread participation in project activities by
