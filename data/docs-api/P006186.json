Lessons\n            learned indicate that the project has shown problems related\n            to the interference of political cycles in project\n            implementation as a consequence of the change in\n            administrations and political, economic and social unrest.\n            The long implementation cycle suffered from a loss of the\n            authorities interest and commitment in project objectives\n            and execution.  Among the lessons learned are the following:\n            (1) Project objectives and components should be simple and\n            focused; (2) A comprehensive, rigorous and realistic\n            assessment of risks, in terms of country capacity,\n            institutional effectiveness, fiduciary aspects, economic and\n            financial viability, as well as other exogenous factors\n            should be completed, and mitigating strategies and action\n            plans to address them as/if they occur, should be\n            incorporated to the project design; (3) The team should put\n            in place mechanisms to strengthen weak areas and make sure\n            that the World Bank Procurement, Financial Management,\n            Disbursement guidelines and procedures are fully understood\n            by the Borrower; (4) A good monitoring and evaluation system\n            with focus on results and outcomes should be an integral\n            part of the project design; (5) Bank management should\n            ensure continuity in supervision teams to avoid\n            interruptions or delays with implementation; (6) Bank\n            Supervision of the project should be continuous and\n            supported by proper budgets and skill mix; and (7) The\n            project team should work with the counterparts to ensure\n            that the beneficiaries and stakeholders at large remain\n            involved at the project execution stage, so that the project\n            does not lose its priority and visibility."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia -
