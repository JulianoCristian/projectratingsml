The project outcome is rated as\n            unsatisfactory, its sustainability as uncertain and the\n            institutional development is rated as negligible. Three\n            major lessons can be drawn from the adjustment experience.\n            First, the piecemeal approach followed in the past,\n            characterized by incomplete reform measures which were not\n            implemented effectively enough, failed to generate a strong\n            supply response. It is important to reach a consensus on an\n            ambitious growth vision and then to act in a way that is\n            consistent with that vision. Second, it is essential to push\n            aggressively on a select number of key economic levels to\n            truly spring the economy forward. The preoccupation with\n            detailed processes and the existence of too many\n            non-essential conditions obscured the strategic vision which\n            was needed to create and maintain the momentum for reform.\n            Third, the authorities did not explain the benefits of\n            adjustment to the population; they only underlined its\n            costs. While projects aimed at reducing poverty were\n            designed to accompany the adjustment program, there was no\n            attempt made by the authorities to explain how it was\n            addressing poverty issues. In order to encourage popular\n            participation and acceptance, the government's economic\n            program needs to be broadly disseminated, explained, and discussed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Public Sector Adjustment Credit"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Madagascar - Public Sector\n            Adjustment
