Some lessons learned included: global\n            experience demonstrates that projects that build significant\n            and complex infrastructure such as this one take on average\n            almost ten years to implement successfully. The Bank should\n            take this into consideration when designing operations in\n            the sector, as shorter execution periods could impede the\n            achievement of desired outcomes. The presentation of the\n            condominial system to the potential beneficiaries by the\n            social promoters was very important for a successful\n            implementation since this system represented a new way of\n            doing business for Lima Water and Sewerage Public Company\n            (SEDAPAL), so there were many doubts about its quality and\n            costs from both the company and the beneficiaries at the\n            beginning of each civil work package. The involvement of the\n            beneficiaries during the design and implementation phases\n            through the formation of Water and Sanitation Committee\n            (WSC) as well as through workshops organized by social\n            promoters was a key feature in the development of this\n            system, as it helped to empower the beneficiaries and will\n            contribute to sustain an adequate operation and maintenance\n            of the system in the long-term. SEDAPAL formal legal\n            recognition of the WSC once the civil works are completed\n            and the systems are in operation will help them further\n            fulfill their role during the operation phase and prevent\n            the disappearance or dismantling of this important community structure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru -

The expansion of services under the additional\n            finance will incorporate the experience of the project\n            implementation to date, and that from international\n            experiences in the design of water and sanitation projects\n            for low income communities.
