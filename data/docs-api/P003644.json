The main lessons learned from the project\n            is as follows: (i) successful resettlement must be\n            adequately funded and funding must be reliable, as both can\n            be jeopardized if the resettlement budget competes with the\n            construction budget in a project, especially if cost of\n            either is higher than anticipated; (ii) resettlement\n            programs must ensure that people can regain control of their\n            lives immediately, thus no one should be moved until\n            resettlement sites are fully constructed and outfitted and\n            the means for livelihood are in place; (iii) information and\n            transparency were critical for gaining trust and obtaining\n            ownership, in both the overall program and the\n            resettler-host community agreements, which set the\n            foundation for positive long term relationships; (iv)\n            achieving successful resettlement with real development\n            requires at least two different sets of skills and\n            competencies, which an implementing agency should have\n            available from the beginning; (v) the Bank needs to find\n            ways to allocate funds to allow continued supervision of\n            projects that have critical and unresolved safeguard issues;\n            and (vi) the scope and budget of a resettlement and\n            development program needs to be updated periodically to\n            encompass the dynamism of communities and ensure that\n            adequate funding is available to meet the legitimate,\n            changing needs of affected people."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

Lessons highlight the\n            nature of this free-standing resettlement project the Bank\n            has ever financed. This is reflected in the project\n            objective, design principles, and whole implementation\n            process, as well as the government's commitment to\n            post-relocation support to the people resettled. Adequate\n            institutional capacity and effective management systems were\n            conditions for success: there was much knowledge and rich\n            experience gained from previous operations, and extensive\n            training provided. Likewise, independent supervision and\n            monitoring mechanisms, proved to be important in reservoir\n            resettlement management, which included an independent\n            monitor, a resettlement supervisor, a public health monitor,\n            an environment supervising engineer, and an international\n            panel of experts. Paramount was the technical service of the\n            project design institute, who continued its involvement in\n            resettlement implementation as technical advisor, and\n            reviewer of resettlement plans, and designs. Moreover, the\n            reservoir resettlement followed a consultative, and\n            participatory process for its design and implementation,\n            adequately adopted in the project, enabling full community\n            participation, integrated into the resettlement design.\n            Although the project never experienced funding shortages\n            (which ensured its timely and smooth implementation), most\n            of the funds however, were disbursed on an advanced basis\n            due to the late approval of the revised budget, thus\n            creating confusion and implementation difficulties. It is\n            outlined that livelihood development - the core of a\n            resettlement program - should have been given the highest\n            priority, instead, given the scale of resettlement, much\n            focus was devoted to the physical construction and\n            relocation components, which led to a late start of the\n            livelihood development programs, and the slow livelihood recovery."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
