Lessons\n            reinforce that project design should be simplified, focused,\n            and include only organically-linked components. The\n            inclusion of other components is likely to result in the\n            neglect or mismanagement of some of the components. This\n            project covered the whole country and included slum\n            improvements, municipal service provision, infrastructure\n            for new municipalities, a municipal loan scheme, and a\n            microfinance scheme. The attention paid to each of these\n            sub-components varied considerably, to the extent that the\n            municipal loan scheme was virtually abandoned, though never\n            formally closed. The project involved a wide range of\n            institutions, which not all did share the same priorities in\n            relation to the project objectives. Moreover, a\n            decentralized approach requires a strong commitment of all\n            stakeholders, and, the responsibilities of each institution\n            involved in the implementation of the project have to be\n            clearly distributed. Further lessons address the critical\n            aspect of periodic technical audits, and the need for\n            supporting measures in terms of management of facilities and\n            maintenance, needed to accompany investments programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - Municipal Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cote d'Ivoire - Municipal\n
