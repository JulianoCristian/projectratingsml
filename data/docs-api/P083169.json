Some lessons learned included: in\n            the absence of any kind of strategic plan for HIV/AIDS, as\n            was the case in Bhutan, project preparation should include\n            support for the development of such a plan prior to\n            appraisal. The plan will then form the basis for project\n            design and reinforce the 'Three Ones' principles\n            in HIV/AIDS response. It will also help engage all\n            stakeholders and build stronger commitment. In a low\n            prevalence setting with severe human resources constraints,\n            such as Bhutan, the best use of resources (human and\n            financial) is to focus on HIV/AIDS interventions for\n            most-at-risk populations (MARPs). It is critical to\n            undertake behavioral surveillance and socio-geographical\n            mapping of MARPs prior to designing policies and program\n            interventions. This will also provide baseline data for the\n            Results Framework and helps set realistic targets. In\n            addition, STI patients should be viewed as a MARP and\n            benefit from Behavioral Change Communications (BCC) and\n            Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) other than STI\n            treatment. Public actors are less effective and motivated to\n            conduct outreach for marginalized MARPS such as Commercial\n            Sex Worker (CSW), injecting drug use (IDU) and sex with men\n            (MSM). Peer groups should be mobilized for this purpose.\n            While the multi-sectoral approach can be relevant for a low\n            prevalence country; activities should be restricted to the\n            most critical sectors given severe human resource\n            constraints, such as in Bhutan. Such a streamlined\n            multi-sectoral design will facilitate implementation.\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) should be tailored to\n            the country's limited capacity and characteristics of\n            the epidemic. Information should be used to improve the\n            evidence base for local decision making."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bhutan - HIV/AIDS and STI Prevention and\n            Control

Under this component, infection control\n            procedures will be strengthened to improve occupational\n            health conditions and reduce disease transmission.\n            Environmentally sound treatment and disposal of health care\n            waste will be instituted in key facilities.  This will be\n            done through establishing appropriate institutions,\n            training, procurement and monitoring and evaluation.  As\n            part of addressing staff health, post-exposure prophylaxis\n            against HIV should be considered once the national ART\n            programme is established.  Staff vaccination against HBV is\n            not within this plan but is an important part of\n            occupational health and will be addressed within the\n            national programme.  Currently government policy is to\n            procure disposable needles. syringes and gloves, but within\n            budget constraints. The national programme will address\n            additional procurement of disposable equipment.  Good\n            infection control in health care facilities requires clear\n            national guidelines, staff trained in their implementation,\n            supported by adequate supplies and coordinated with waste\n            management.  Healthcare waste management requires the\n            establishment of a system of segregation, safe collection\n            and transportation, treatment and disposal of all waste\n            starting at the source of generation. The system should\n            minimize contact with patients, the general public and the\n            environment. In particular, there is need to establish clear\n            protocols for safe and secure collection, treatment and\n            disposal of sharps (e.g., needles, syringes, blades, and\n            other instruments capable of inflicting a wound or a\n            puncture) to minimize the risks associated with disease\n            transmission. There may be need to transport some critical\n            waste over short distances. Therefore the system to be put\n            in place needs to ensure safe and secure transportation to\n            treatment and final disposal sites. The Plan will also\n            recommend the selection of environmentally sound and\n            cost-effective treatment technologies to render special\n            waste streams harmless, either on-site, or off-site. A\n            quality assurance system (appropriate to the scale of the\n            activities) to ensure that waste handling and disposal\n            requirements are met. Segregation is the most important\n            step, which should be done at the source of generation e.g.\n            all patient activity areas, diagnostic service areas,\n            operation theatres, labor rooms, treatment rooms etc.  All\n            the bags/container must be labeled according to a designated\n            color-coding system. Certain categories of waste which may\n            need pretreatment (decontamination /disinfection) at the\n            site of generation such as plastic and sharp material etc,\n            should be removed from the site of generation only after treatment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bhutan - HIV/AIDS and STI Prevention Control\n            Project : infection control and healthcare waste management plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bhutan - HIV/AIDS and STI\n            Prevention Control Project : infection control and\n            healthcare waste management plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/04/4932909/bhutan-hivaids-sti-prevention-control-project-infection-control-healthcare-waste-management-plan","projn":"BT-Bhutan - Hiv/Aids And Sti Prevention And\n            Control Project -- P083169","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Urban Solid Waste Management,Waste Disposal & Utilization,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Sanitation and Sewerage","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Bhutan","authors":{"authr":"Bhutan"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20040712183723"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Health","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptation,air,air\n            pollution,autoclaves,burial,disinfection,Disposal\n            equipment,disposal sites,dump sites,final disposal,food\n            waste,glass,Hazardous Waste,Hazardous Waste\n            Management,health care,health care waste,health\n            hazards,health screening,Health Services,healthcare\n            waste,healthcare waste\n            management,hospitals,incineration,incinerators,infectious\n            waste,injuries,Isolation,landfills,location,municipal\n            landfill,nurses,nursing,occupational\n            health,patients,Pharmacy,plastic,plastics,pretreatment,public\n            health,scavenging,screening,sewage,solid waste,Solid Waste\n            Management,special\n            waste,sterilization,tin,vaccination,waste,waste\n            disposal,waste handling,waste management activities,waste\n            management equipment,waste streams,wastes,water pollution,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"Adaptation,air,air\n            pollution,autoclaves,burial,disinfection,Disposal\n            equipment,disposal sites,dump sites,final disposal,food\n            waste,glass,Hazardous Waste,Hazardous Waste\n            Management,health care,health care waste,health\n            hazards,health screening,Health Services,healthcare\n            waste,healthcare waste\n            management,hospitals,incineration,incinerators,infectious\n            waste,injuries,Isolation,landfills,location,municipal\n            landfill,nurses,nursing,occupational\n            health,patients,Pharmacy,plastic,plastics,pretreatment,public\n            health,scavenging,screening,sewage,solid waste,Solid Waste\n            Management,special\n            waste,sterilization,tin,vaccination,waste,waste\n            disposal,waste handling,waste management activities,waste\n            management equipment,waste streams,wastes,water pollution,workers"}},"owner":"S.A.
