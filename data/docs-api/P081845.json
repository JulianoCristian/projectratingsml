Ratings for the Second Development Support\n            Credit Project were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Ratings for\n            the Fourth Development Support Credit Project were as\n            follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the Bank must\n            maintain a close dialogue with political parties out of\n            power and with other key opinion makers to have a better\n            assessment of the support for reforms. This approach is\n            strategic and must be done even while working closely with\n            and supporting like minded governments. Such an approach\n            helps to mitigate risks of possible reversals if and when\n            the ruling parties change, and to avoid the appearance of\n            playing favorites. The Bank needs to do much more targeted\n            and tailored engagement and communication with stakeholders,\n            quite apart from the Government. This is needed for\n            deepening ownership and support for reforms under\n            programmatic loans, such as the DSC. Such an approach\n            becomes all the more critical during the tenure of an\n            elected government which tends to be disproportionately\n            sensitive to public opinion and is, oftentimes, reluctant to\n            make unpopular policy choices."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Development Support Credit\n            Series (I-IV)

The lessons learned indicate that a\n            Development Support Credit (DSC) type operation is not the\n            best vehicle to achieve long-term structural change, but it\n            can be a good catalyst to initiate it. Likewise, a DSC can\n            serve a the final push to implement other reforms that have\n            been on the agenda for a long time. The triggers for the\n            follow-on DSC 2 were relevant to deepening the program, but\n            later needed significant revisions to reflect evolving\n            conditions. There was little overlap between the programs of\n            the two institutions. The Bank might have had a stronger\n            hand in some areas, such as energy pricing, if the IMF had\n            had cross conditionality. In the case of time bound\n            conditions such as the awarding of the financial advisory\n            contract for Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCBs), the\n            contractor may take opportunities to increase fees. The\n            current Bank timeframe for Bangladesh for public sector bank\n            restructuring is about 4 years, whereas in Pakistan, as a\n            comparison, it took almost 10 years for a similar financial\n            restructuring to take place."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - First Development Support Credit"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - First

This will be accomplished by (a) ensuring a\n            stable macroeconomic environment; (b) relying on the private\n            sector as the engine of growth; (c) establishing a sound and\n            well-functioning financial system and ensuring that the poor\n            have access to financial resources; (d) taking advantage of\n            the opportunities provided by globalization, (e) developing\n            rural areas and accelerating rural non-farm growth; (f)\n            creating the conditions needed for an expanding and dynamic\n            manufacturing sector; and (g) substantially augmenting the\n            capacity and quality of infrastructure services. 2)\n            Promoting Good Governance: The Government's strategy of\n            improving governance focuses on addressing three major\n            areas: (a) improving the investment climate by creating a\n            competitive environment across all segments in society; (b)\n            establishing and enforcing clear rules and regulations for\n            public sector administration; and (c) promoting voice and\n            participation of the civil society, including women, the\n            poor and disadvantaged groups, as a step toward a\n            transparent and 'open' government. 3) Investing in\n            Human Development: This is to be done through targeted\n            public expenditures in health, education, and nutrition, and\n            radically improved system of incentives for public service\n            providers. Within the health sector, although some success\n            has been achieved in preventive health care, a small\n            proportion of poor people have access to public health care\n            services. The strategy thus gives priority to completing the\n            unfinished agenda and addressing the pro-poor concerns in\n            health and nutrition. The introduction of a national\n            nutrition program to address the malnutrition of children\n            under two as well as pregnant and lactating mothers through\n            the provision of food supplements, nutrition and health\n            counseling is a positive step to address the problem. In the\n            area of basic education, the plan is to improve quality,\n            while increasing access for the poorest segments o f\n            society. NGOs and private sector are envisaged as providers\n            of high-quality education along with the government. 4)\n            Promoting Women's advancement: While the gender-gap is\n            closing in Bangladesh for most social indicators, the\n            overall level of empowerment measured in terms of literacy,\n            work force participation, property rights, and credit\n            access, remains low. The strategy for furthering\n            women's advancement includes emphasis on policies and\n            institutional actions to combat continuing negative gender\n            ratios, violence against women, high maternal mortality, and\n            restrictions on women's employment and economic\n            opportunities; and policies to ensure formal equality;\n            supporting affirmative actions at all levels and in all\n            spheres; and creating a women-friendly institutional\n            environment overall. 5) Ensuring Social Protection: To help\n            increase the poor's crisis-coping capability and form\n            important risk-insurance policies for them, four sets of\n            policies would be emphasized for the poor to cope better\n            with various income (consumption) shocks. The first set of\n            policies will continue focus on social safety nets; the\n            second on policies that will address the vulnerabilities of\n            the 'new poor'; the third will emphasize the\n            development of social solidarity; and the fourth set\n            concerns risk insurance, including measures to mitigate\n            risks faced by the poor."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -Development Support Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh -Development Support\n            Credit
