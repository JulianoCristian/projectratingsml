The\n            overall rating for all the four projects is rated as\n            satisfactory in the Implementation Completion Report (ICR)\n            rating, and also the performance of the Bank and the\n            Borrower for all four projects is rated as satisfactory. The\n            main lessons learned from this review are: (i) as noted in\n            Independent Evaluation Group (IEG's) ICR Review of\n            Fiscal and Institutional Adjustment Loan (FIAL III), project\n            design needs to be clearly aligned with its development\n            objectives in order to attain the latter. Even if the\n            structural deficit of the central administration is\n            \"highly sensitive and political\" as the ICR\n            states, the magnitudes of these structural rigidities were\n            such that they must be addressed if progress is to be made\n            in achieving the substantial fiscal adjustment that is\n            required for sustained macroeconomic stability; (ii) loans\n            with large numbers of objectives and conditions, and\n            involving too many institutions relative to the management\n            capacity of the Government and the Bank itself, overtax the\n            implementation capacity of both the Bank and the borrower\n            and result in poor execution; (iii) the inclusion of\n            objectives of widely different levels of priority and weak\n            connection with the ultimate goals of the operations tends\n            to obscure the degree of attainment of the latter; and (iv)\n            success depends on the borrower's ownership of the\n            objectives of the loan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Structural Fiscal Adjustment; and\n            First, Second,

Loan for Colombia had\n            the following ratings: the outcome was satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development\n            impact was substantial, and the Bank and borrower\n            performance were both satisfactory. The experience with\n            Fiscal and Institutional Adjustment Loans (FIAL II) shows a\n            high degree of collaboration between the Government and the\n            Bank, and this should remain a central characteristic of the\n            preparation of the upcoming loans of the program. Colombia\n            is a middle-income country with a fairly sophisticated\n            public sector and an explicit reform agenda, so this\n            collaboration has to also be complemented with flexibility\n            in terms of specific conditions while retaining a good\n            overall vision and monitoring of the objectives. Taking from\n            the recommendations described throughout this document, the\n            main areas where particular attention needs to be taken for\n            the preparation of the upcoming loans are the following:\n            Bring the tax administration and legal defense components up\n            to speed. Ensure that the government's medium-term\n            vision of tax reform is adequately captured. Ensure that\n            budgetary reform achieves a reduction in revenue earmarking.\n            Be sensitive to the political environment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -  Second Programmatic Fiscal and\n            Institutional Structural Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia -

The objectives of\n            this series of loans are two: first, to promote reforms\n            addressing fiscal rigidities necessary to attain the\n            substantial fiscal adjustment underlying sustainable\n            macroeconomic stability; and second, to improve the\n            provision of public services and  establish the\n            institutional basis for higher efficiency and accountability\n            in public expenditure. The specific objectives of the FIAL\n            program are to: (i) increase tax revenue and reduce\n            distortions in the tax system; (ii) modernize the tax\n            administration; (iii) promote the development of a sound\n            fiscal responsibility legal framework; (iv) reduce losses\n            and generate revenues through improved asset management; (v)\n            prevent massive losses to the State from judicial claims;\n            (vi) improve budget management with modem tools and legal\n            reforms; (vii) develop incentives for efficiency gains in\n            subnational entities; (viii) strengthen the public sector\n            procurement system; (ix) improve performance through\n            management contracts for agencies; and (x) support a\n            coherent and comprehensive reform implementation process.\n            This Second Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional Structural\n            Adjustment Loan Project focuses on the following elements:\n            (i) issuance of all legislation to regulate the application\n            of the tax reform law; (ii) further improvements in tax\n            administration, including specific audit targets and the\n            implementation of integrated tax-customs audits; (iii)\n            approval of an official budget reform strategy; (iv)\n            Congressional approval of an improved 2004 Annual Budget\n            Law; (v) presentation to popular vote of the Constitutional\n            referendum; (vi) issuance of a new policy for legal defense\n            of the state; (vii) presentation to Congress of reforms to\n            the public procurement law; (viii) approval of an official\n            asset management policy and the achievement of specific\n            revenue targets; (ix) signature of management contracts with\n            two government agencies; and (x) enactment of a Fiscal\n            Responsibility
