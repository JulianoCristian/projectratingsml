This ensures better and sustained transfer of\n            knowledge of power plant management. Furthermore, instead of\n            as assigning individual contracts for sub-tasks of\n            constructing power plant, a single contract such as an\n            Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract can\n            ensure better performance of overall plant operation. The\n            use of the Quality Based Selection (QBS) method could have\n            contributed to ensuring a tighter and higher quality\n            supervision of the contractors for the power plants, and\n            enabled reduction in the significant errors that were made\n            during construction, which in turn led to the delays\n            in-completing the construction of the

      parallels an existing line, but has its own right-of-way\n            (ROW). POTL involved erecting pylons approximately every 300\n            meters along the route. This work required access roads,\n            where these did not already exist, as well as staging areas\n            to erect the pylons and string the wire. The Volta River\n            Authority (VRA) subscribes as a matter of policy and\n            practice to the following resettlement objectives: To\n            conceive of and execute resettlement activities in a\n            socially responsible manner as sustainable development\n            programs, providing sufficient resources to enable persons\n            displaced by the project to share in project benefits. To\n            consider involuntary resettlement as an integral part of\n            project design, and deal with resettlement issues from the\n            earliest stages of project preparation. To void land\n            acquisition and involuntary resettlement wherever feasible,\n            and to minimize land acquisition and involuntary\n            resettlement wherever such is unavoidable. To consult with\n            project-affected persons (PAPs) in a meaningful manner, and\n            to provide opportunity for their participation in the\n            planning and execution of resettlement programs. To assist\n            PAPs in proportion to impact, recognizing the special needs\n            of vulnerable populations. To compensate PAPs fully and\n            fairly for all assets lost permanently or temporarily, which\n            means timely payment of full replacement value prior to\n            construction. To ensure that all PAPs who lose residences or\n            business are provided acceptable alternative accommodations\n            before demolition of the structure and construction of the\n            infrastructure. To ensure that PAPs who lose\n            income-generating resources are assisted in their efforts to\n            improve their livelihoods and standards of living or at\n            least restore them."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Compensation and resettlement plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana -

POTL involved erecting pylons approximately every 300\n            meters along the route.

The Volta River\n            Authority (VRA) subscribes as a matter of policy and\n            practice to the following resettlement objectives: To\n            conceive of and execute resettlement activities in a\n            socially responsible manner as sustainable development\n            programs, providing sufficient resources to enable persons\n            displaced by the project to share in project benefits. To\n            consider involuntary resettlement as an integral part of\n            project design, and deal with resettlement issues from the\n            earliest stages of project preparation. To void land\n            acquisition and involuntary resettlement wherever feasible,\n            and to minimize land acquisition and involuntary\n            resettlement wherever such is unavoidable. To consult with\n            project-affected persons (PAPs) in a meaningful manner, and\n            to provide opportunity for their participation in the\n            planning and execution of resettlement programs. To assist\n            PAPs in proportion to impact, recognizing the special needs\n            of vulnerable populations. To compensate PAPs fully and\n            fairly for all assets lost permanently or temporarily, which\n            means timely payment of full replacement value prior to\n            construction.

300-MW,\n            with the potential to upgrade to 600-MW, combined-cycle\n            thermal generating plant to be located 15 km northeast of\n            Sekondi-Takoradi, near the village of Aboadze. This\n            environmental assessment addresses the requirements of the\n            Afican Development Bank and also those of the World Bank as\n            a Category \"A\" project. In general, the analysis\n            indicates that the plant will have modest, but mitigable,\n            environmental impacts. The key potential issues include: 1)\n            the effect of the cooling water on marine life and the\n            consequent effects on the thriving fishing industry of\n            Aboadze and neighboring villages; 2) the effects that the\n            loss of site land will have on nearby families who currently\n            practice predominantly subsistence level agriculture on that\n            site; 3) air quality impacts; and 4) potential spillage\n            and/or leakages of oil."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Environmental impact statement :\n            Transmission line Prestea -
