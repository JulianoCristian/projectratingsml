The lessons\n            learned indicate that the agency was established by\n            legislation and five new staff persons were employed to\n            implement the project. A resident technical assistant was\n            employed to assist the personnel in the agency in developing\n            the knowledge and skills to implement the project. At the\n            end of this process, the staff of the agency had acquired\n            skills that were relevant to a more complex project of\n            issuing guarantees that supported commercial risk. The\n            Project Appraisal Document and the Development Credit\n            Agreement proved that project funds could be used for a\n            guarantee agency after the Closing Date. In retrospect, the\n            agency should have been given the authority to use World\n            Bank and donor funds to guarantee activities involving\n            commercial risk as well as non commercial risk. If this\n            broader mandate had been given at the outset, greater value\n            would have been obtained from the technical assistance\n            provided to support the guarantee program for non commercial\n            risk, all available donor funds committed to the project\n            would have been disbursed and the impact of the project in\n            developing trade and generating growth would have been greater."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -
