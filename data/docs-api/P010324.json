Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, the success and\n            sustainability of Bank financial/industrial intermediation\n            operations, both in term lending and institutional\n            development, depends on: a) the Government's\n            implementation of elements of a prudent financial sector\n            policy and establishing and enforcing proper institutional,\n            regulatory, and incentive framework for the financial\n            institutions and private sector; b) the financial viability\n            of the credit institutions and their internal operational\n            efficiency; and c) sound capital structure of sub-projects,\n            their profitability, and satisfactory rate of return.\n            Second, effective and timely monitoring and supervision of a\n            project by both the Bank and borrower is integral to the\n            success of a project. Third, clear objectives, precise terms\n            of reference, the link to the project objectives, and\n            potential benefits of the TA should be identified at the SAR\n            stage. Finally, the quality of project supervision and\n            administration can be improved by either developing a strong\n            monitoring and reporting system in the Government or\n            selecting an Apex agency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Third Industrial Investment\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Third Industrial\n            Investment Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/05/734933/pakistan-third-industrial-investment-credit-project","projn":"PK-Ind.Inv.Cr.
