Some lessons learned included: engaging in\n            reforms at the center of government entails acknowledging\n            shifts in political priorities and reform space that will\n            constrain implementation. Horizontal cross-agency reforms\n            should be limited to only a few areas in environments of\n            fluctuating political commitment. The efforts entailed in\n            coordination should not be underestimated in advancing\n            horizontal reforms, particularly when not tied to incentive\n            structures, such as financing). To accompany such reforms,\n            significant agility in the project\u2019s reform trajectory and\n            implementation are needed to remain relevant to shifting\n            priorities over time. The use of information and\n            communication technology (ICT) in advancing reform progress\n            is highly constrained by leadership and organizational\n            factors. Despite notable advances in the modernization of\n            specific functions assigned to the Chief of Cabinet Office,\n            particularly in relation to monitoring public sector\n            performance and advancing the e-government agenda, there\n            remains space to further build the technical capabilities to\n            execute the broad range of functions assigned to the Cabinet Office."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -
