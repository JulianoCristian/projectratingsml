Some lessons learned included:\n            informing and sensitizing beneficiaries, and explaining the\n            project execution strategy, is required if populations are\n            to take full project ownership. Combining road\n            rehabilitation (or other infrastructure improvement) with\n            local investments can improve the impact of the former and\n            stimulate local development. Strong cooperation between\n            development organizations such as the Bank, Agence Francaise\n            de Developpement (AFD), and the European Union (EU) can be a\n            factor of success especially in the context where leadership\n            and donor coordination by the government is weak. As part of\n            project design, the provision of resources to address\n            emergency issues is required in post-conflict and\n            disaster-prone countries. Improved transport conditions in\n            rural areas translate into better access to markets by\n            producers, hence increasing income-generating opportunities;\n            they also translate into improved access to social services\n            (health, education). A work strategy focused on small and\n            medium enterprises (SMEs) for transport infrastructure can\n            act as a catalyst for developing private sector activities\n            and generating employment. Gravel roads can be a sustainable\n            and cost-effective technical solution to improve rural\n            transport infrastructure. Improving road maintenance\n            services in a volatile environment like Haiti which suffered\n            a total collapsing of its national systems in place in the\n            nineties is very challenging and a medium long term issue.\n            Participatory planning and inclusion can ensure better\n            targeting of resources while better responding to community\n            needs. Infrastructure subprojects of the type included in\n            TTDP component two should present an operation and\n            maintenance (O and M) strategy and attendant training

infrastructure in areas\n            struck by natural disasters.'  The changes follow the\n            occurrence of the series of hurricanes and tropical storms\n            that struck Haiti in 2007 and 2008, causing major damages,\n            particularly on transport infrastructure. The Haitian\n            Government and International Development Association (IDA)\n            have identified the Transport and Territorial Development\n            Project as a possible vehicle to channel funds for\n            reconstruction works. The amendments to the projects grant\n            agreement aim at reallocating project resources to these\n            reconstruction activities, by creating a new component\n            entitled 'post natural disasters' reconstruction\n            of selected infrastructure', with a total financing\n            amount of US$8 million. Initial project activities will be\n            kept unchanged. Provided country environment and project\n            performance allow for it, an additional financing will be\n            processed in late FY09 or early FY10 to compensate for this\n            reallocation and allow all initial activities to be\n            financed. This additional financing may also cover any\n            possible increase of the price of road works, following the\n            increased cost of gasoline. If an additional financing\n            cannot be processed, a second restructuring, involving\n            substantial modifications of the initial result framework,\n            will be processed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Transport and Territorial\n            Development Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Haiti - Transport and Territorial\n            Development Project : restructuring"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/11/10102295/haiti-transport-territorial-development-project-restructuring","projn":"HT-Haiti Transport And Territorial\n            Development Project -- P095523","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Rural Roads & Transport,Transport Economics Policy & Planning,Natural Disasters,Disaster Management,Post Conflict Reconstruction","teratopic":"Environment,Transport,Conflict and Development,Rural Development","count":"Haiti","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20081214225301"},"theme":"Infrastructure services for private sector development,Trade facilitation and market access,Social safety nets,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement","subsc":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways,Other social services,Central government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Transport,Conflict and Development,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Transportation,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access road, bridge, bridges, contingency\n            planning, deaths, Development Project, Disaster, Disaster\n            Management, drainage, elections, environmental impact,\n            floods, gasoline, gasoline tax, hurricane, hurricanes,\n            international community, Nations, natural disaster, natural\n            disasters, Police, Public Works, reconstruction,\n            reconstruction activities, rehabilitation, resettlement,\n            road, Road Improvement, Road Maintenance, road maintenance\n            activities, Road Maintenance Fund, road standards, road\n            works, roads, Route, Safety, Storm, storms, temporary\n            shelters, transparency, Transport, transport conditions,\n            transport corridors, transport infrastructure, transport\n            sector, UNDP, vehicle"}},"owner":"Transport (LCSTR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"}},"trustfund":"TF090223-TRANSPORT","majtheme":"Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Trade and integration,Financial and private sector development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","repnb":"46844"},"facets":{}}}
