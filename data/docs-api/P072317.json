Some lessons\n            learned included: an efficient partnership for local and\n            community-based development is possible between governmental\n            and non-governmental organizations in Tunisia. This is best\n            illustrated by the high level of contributions leveraged\n            from ODESYPANO (Northwest Forestry and Pastoral Development\n            Agency - Office du Developpement Sylvo-Pastoral du\n            Nord-Ouest) partners (35 percent on average of the total\n            cost of the 476 CPAs (Annual Program Contract - Contrat\n            Programme Annuel) executed under the project. This\n            achievement is largely due to the partnership mechanism\n            implemented by the ODESYPANO with active collaboration from\n            regional and sub-regional public administrations in the five\n            governorates. However, further strengthening is needed to\n            consolidate these established local partnerships. As\n            indicated, the sustainability of this partnership will\n            depend on enhancing and institutionalizing key requirements\n            such as: (a) better linkages between PDC (Community\n            Development Plan - Plan de Developpement Communautaire)\n            programming and financing as well as planning and budgeting\n            procedures used by the regional administrations, and (b)\n            more flexibility in regional administrative procedures for\n            allocating budgets to technical ministries, so that CPAs can\n            be financed when ready, rather than having to wait for funds\n            at fixed intervals during the fiscal year. The use of\n            community-based Integrated Participatory Approach (IPA) has\n            helped the administrations at regional and local levels to\n            move from an often confrontational relationship with\n            communities in project areas to a more productive\n            relationship based on mutual trust. IPA has also helped\n            communities progress from a mentality of passive contributor\n            to that of an active participant in their own local\n            development. From an environmental viewpoint, IPA has also\n            reinforced community adhesion to soil and water conservation\n            works on private lands, when combined with productive\n            activities in the context of PDCs. These works are then\n            better designed and maintained since they are conceived in\n            close collaboration with populations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Northwest Mountainous and

the construction of feeder roads as the\n            main anticipated negative impact. Other impacts include\n            uncontrollable pasturage and soil erosion caused by\n            livestock. Overuse of agrochemical inputs linked to\n            agricultural intensification will be avoided by sensitizing\n            and educating targeted populations through agricultural\n            extension to disseminate information about integrated pest\n            management. Ecosystem disturbance will be alleviated by\n            avoiding the destruction of existing protective works. The\n            exploitation of available water resources (the decrease of\n            the water table and disturbance of the hydrological\n            network), the increase in water use because of intensive\n            agricultural production, uncoordinated maintenance of the\n            forest or inappropriate cultural practices increasing\n            erosion and siltation, accidental chemical spills-all could\n            lead to flooding problems, a decrease in livestock\n            resources, water pollution, and an amplification of\n            socio-economic problems and would be exacerbated during the\n            rainy season. These problems will be mitigated by\n            integrating environmental protection into proposed methods\n            for forest management, reforestation and revegetation, and\n            selecting resistant plant species. Drainage works will\n            control the flow of surface water. Providing filters and\n            planting vegetation along embankments and among alluvial\n            deposits and upstream water bodies will protect natural\n            resources threatened by soil erosion and excavation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Northwest Mountainous and Forestry\n            Areas Development Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"R\u00e9publique Tunisienne \u2013 Projet de\n            d\u00e9veloppement des zones montagneuses et foresti\u00e8res du\n            nord-ouest de la Tunisie"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/04/1729383/tunisia-northwest-mountainous-forestry-areas-development-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"TN-Northwest Mountainous And Forestry Areas\n            Development Project -- P072317","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Tunisia","authors":{"authr":"Friaa, Jaafar"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02032004022918"},"admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Other social services,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Forestry,Crops","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Soil erosion; Water erosion; Agrochemicals;\n            Pest management; Water pollution control; Potable water;\n            Livestock water requirement; Agricultural intensification;\n            Agricultural extension; Information dissemination; Ecosystem\n            management; Water tables; Alluvial soils; Vegetative\n            propagation; Embankments; Water utilization; Chemical\n            spills; Hazardous substances transportation; Plant-water\n            relationships; Forest management; Environmental protection;\n            Drainage systems; Archeological impacts; Hygiene"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Water & Environ Group (MNSRE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF026699-PHRD-TUNISIA: NORTH-WEST\n            MOUNTAINOUS AREAS AND FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT,TF023532-NTF-ESSD WB/WWF ALLLIANCE FOR FORESTRY","repnb":"E536"},"facets":{}}}
