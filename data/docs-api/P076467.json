Some lessons learned included: a focused and\n            participatory livelihoods approach through organized\n            beneficiary groups can provide quick and tangible income\n            results and improve well-being of poor rural households, and\n            as a result contribute to their improved status in the\n            community. There needs to be a strong technical support,\n            especially in the case of marginalized groups who are\n            exploring new livelihoods strategies. The length of a\n            project needs to be long enough to allow for proper\n            sequencing of activities first participatory identification\n            and mobilization of the poor and formation of the\n            institutions of the poor, then asset creation and\n            aggregation through federations and then for innovations and\n            building of local capacities. Direct control of funds, and a\n            demand-driven process for investment decisions by\n            beneficiaries, is critical for the empowerment of the poor,\n            and to make sure resulting livelihoods sub-projects are\n            suitable to the capacities, resources and social relations\n            of poor community members. However for sustaining and\n            developing such livelihoods it is important that funding\n            support is matched by very good technical advice and linkage\n            development. Targeting needs a structured, locally\n            appropriate and participatory approach to wealth ranking.\n            This needs to be well prepared, communicated, transparently\n            and fairly implemented, and consistently applied statewide.\n            Social accountability mechanisms need to be introduced at\n            the community level, to ensure compliance through\n            self-monitoring and peer pressure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Chhattisgarh District Rural Poverty Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Chhattisgarh District\n            Rural

opportunities for the poor and vulnerable, especially women\n            and tribals, to meet their own social and economic\n            development objectives. To achive this, the project creates\n            infrastructure and income opportunities for the rural poor;\n            empowers active groups of disadavanteged people; and\n            supports village governments in becoming more responsive and\n            effective in assisting them. There are two main project\n            components. Component 1 focuses on six main activities: 1)\n            human resource development for project stakeholders to build\n            skills and change behavior through orientation, reward, and\n            performance appraisal, and supply-driven and demand-driven\n            training; 2) strengthening of \"panchayats\" to\n            develop training programs; 3) formation and strengthening of\n            organizations to recruit and build the capacity of\n            nongovernmental organizations and project facilitation\n            teams; 4) communication and information to ensure that the\n            project and its rules are disseminated to all target\n            beneficiaries appropriately; 5) monitoring and learning and\n            special studies to support information gathering; and 6)\n            project administration. Component 2 comprises community\n            investments, including matching grants for community\n            invrstments, matching grants for \"panchayat plans,\n            village funds that are entirely financed by community\n            contributions and that finance operation and maintenance of\n            village infrastructure, and innovation funds."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
