The gas supply derived from the project helped\n            the national gas company alleviate the country's energy\n            shortage and allowed it to operate the\n            Hazira-Bijapur-Jagdishpur pipeline at near capacity. The\n            project also considerably improved the environment of Bombay\n            and Delhi through increased gas consumption. Following the\n            sector policy and institutional development measures taken\n            by the government since 1996, the project was instrumental\n            in fostering natural gas development. Key lessons learned\n            noted improvements to 1) the gas supply by eliminating gas\n            flaring; 2) both the quality of operations and their cost\n            effectiveness by contracting specialized field service\n            companies to perform some of the key field maintenance\n            operations; 3) the project's economic viability and\n            implementation performance by avoiding delay of the\n            co-financing agreements; 4) project performance by using\n            technical assistance for on-site managerial and operational\n            expertise; 5) offshore oil and gas reserves development by\n            developing safety and environmental protection legislation\n            and setting up an independent agency to enforce it; 6) a\n            more economic allocation of resources by eliminating gas\n            price distortions; 7) achieving policy objectives by\n            requiring regular consultations between the government and\n            the Bank; and 8) restructuring the sector entities by\n            requiring that transformed companies be autonomous."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
