Some lessons learned included:\n            project implementation in a conflict affected environment,\n            requires flexibility in deploying and redeploying staff;\n            good understanding of local social structures; an ability to\n            work with community leaders to ensure access to project\n            sites and security; good capacity to manage and supervise\n            community-based contracting, which, in volatile areas, might\n            be the most appropriate solution and the provision of\n            visible benefits to the population through short lead times,\n            employment creation, and quality infrastructure. Rapid\n            rotation of staff on both the client and the Bank sides\n            increases the need for robust fiduciary systems; and yet it\n            is difficult to attract to the country quality staff that\n            can develop and update such systems. Management expectations\n            need to be realistic. Risk is inherently higher in these\n            contexts, and expectations need to be adjusted in line with\n            what can be reasonably achieved during the initial\n            reconstruction

- National Emergency Employment\n            Program for Rural Access Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The National Emergency Employment\n            Program for Rural Access Project for Afghanistan, which\n            forms a part of the Government's National Emergency\n            Employment Program (NEEP), will assist the Government in\n            providing targeted social protection, and improving key\n            rural access infrastructure to improve the livelihoods of\n            the rural poor in the Government's territory by\n            providing: (i) emergency short term employment opportunities\n            for the poor on labor-based rural access infrastructure\n            improvement subprojects; and (ii) technical assistance for\n            the implementation of NEEP. The Credit portion will finance\n            the reconstruction of secondary rural access\n            infrastructure--primarily bridges. The Grant will finance\n            the rehabilitation of tertiary rural access infrastructure\n            and technical assistance to the Government for implementing\n            its NEEP. The project will comprise two components: A)\n            labor-based rural access rehabilitation reconstruction\n            subprojects; and, B) technical assistance to support the\n            Government's overall NEEP. The Project is expected to\n            create a minimum of 6,000,000 unskilled labor days of\n            employment, and to rehabilitate a minimum of 2000 km of\n            rural roads and 2300 m of bridges. The labor-based\n            sub-projects are expected to provide high social returns in\n            the short run and contribute to economic progress in the\n            long-term. The employment generated will reduce income\n            vulnerability levels and create infrastructure which will\n            improve access to markets and services. By removing access\n            bottlenecks, the project will help integrate the village\n            economy with the regional and national markets. The\n            technical assistance component will lead to better\n            allocation of resources, higher productivity and outputs,\n            and help mobilize further donor resources for productive\n            employment creation. The project builds upon working\n            implementation arrangements, but even so its implementation\n            is  expected to be difficult. The security situation could\n            deteriorate, derailing reconstruction efforts. This is\n            outside the scope of the project design. However, the\n            project's modular design will allow activities in one\n            or more unstable provinces to cease without stopping work in\n            provinces where there are no or few security risks. The\n            Credit and Grant are expected to be fully disbursed in a 39\n            month period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - National Emergency Employment\n            Program for Rural
