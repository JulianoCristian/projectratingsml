The project\n            partially achieved its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was partially successful,\n            sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, in situations where\n            difficult technical problems prevail, specialists in the\n            technical field should be used extensively. Second,\n            unreliable water supply for any reason destroys farmer\n            confidence in the ability of irrigation authorities and\n            leads to weak cooperation in construction and O&M works.\n            Third, participation of beneficiaries in the design,\n            construction, implementation, and O&M is very important,\n            especially in large public irrigation systems. Fourth,\n            training farmers to understand the design of the water\n            system and its performance is necessary for large public\n            irrigation systems where they have to share according to\n            agreed time and quantity. Fifth, the design adopted for a\n            large public irrigation system must be flexible, simple, and\n            socially acceptable by small farmers and their communities.\n            Sixth, service charges to cover full O&M costs of public\n            utilities after improvement must be imposed. Also, this\n            should be considered as a country-wide issue in any\n            investment project. Finally, public and government awareness\n            of proper utilization of natural resources must be\n            instigated through various means of investment lending."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal -

The project to be implemented over a\n            seven-year period includes:  (i) improvements to the Chatra\n            Main Canal including provisions for improved desilting; (ii)\n            the rehabilitation and improvement of irrigation\n            distribution and drainage works on 16,700 ha; (iii) further\n            minor improvements to the irrigation and drainage system in\n            the Stage I area (9,750 ha), and (iv) the construction of\n            buildings for offices, and staff quarters.  It further\n            involves (v) the provision of equipment and vehicles for\n            O&M, and equipment for the project workshop; (vi)\n            institutional strengthening through technical assistance,\n            training, and studies; and (vii) financial support for the\n            costs of incremental project establishment and maintenance.\n            One of the important irrigation management improvements will\n            be the extension of the distribution system to reach 4-5 ha\n            blocks.  This feature is expected to:  (i) enable farmers to\n            construct channels to individual fields; (ii) simplify the\n            allocation of water, and (iii) lead to more effective water\n            users' groups."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Sunsari Morang Second Irrigation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Sunsari Morang Second\n            Irrigation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1987/05/740509/nepal-sunsari-morang-second-irrigation-project","projn":"NP-Sunsary-Morang II -- P010278","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Water Use,Water Supply and Systems,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry,Town Water Supply and Sanitation","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Nepal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926080445"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"acre-feet,Agricultural\n            Development,AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION,agronomy,annual\n            rainfall,aquifer,canals,community wells,Competitive\n            Bidding,Construction,conveying,Cost Recovery,Crop\n            Yields,cubic meter,cubic meters,cultivated area,distribution\n            systems,drainage,drainage\n            system,Engineering,gravity,groundwater,groundwater\n            development,groundwater irrigation,groundwater\n            resource,groundwater resources,Hydrology,investment\n            costs,investment program,Irrigation Adviser,Irrigation\n            Development,irrigation investment,irrigation\n            management,Irrigation Project,irrigation scheme,irrigation\n            systems,irrigation water,Land Tenure,Maintenance\n            Costs,Ministry of Water,Natural\n            Resources,nutrients,operational management,operators,organic\n            matter,population density,population growth,private\n            wells,quantity of water,rain,river water,rivers,surface\n            water,surface water for irrigation,surface water\n            irrigation,Surface Water Resources,surface water\n            supply,towns,use of water,Water Charges,water control,water\n            distribution,water flows,water management,Water\n            Requirements,Water Resources,water schemes,water\n            sources,Water Supply,Water User,water users,weirs,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"acre-feet,Agricultural\n            Development,AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION,agronomy,annual\n            rainfall,aquifer,canals,community wells,Competitive\n            Bidding,Construction,conveying,Cost Recovery,Crop\n            Yields,cubic meter,cubic meters,cultivated area,distribution\n            systems,drainage,drainage\n            system,Engineering,gravity,groundwater,groundwater\n            development,groundwater irrigation,groundwater\n            resource,groundwater resources,Hydrology,investment\n            costs,investment program,Irrigation Adviser,Irrigation\n            Development,irrigation investment,irrigation\n            management,Irrigation Project,irrigation scheme,irrigation\n            systems,irrigation water,Land Tenure,Maintenance\n            Costs,Ministry of Water,Natural\n            Resources,nutrients,operational management,operators,organic\n            matter,population density,population growth,private\n            wells,quantity of water,rain,river water,rivers,surface\n            water,surface water for irrigation,surface water\n            irrigation,Surface Water Resources,surface water\n            supply,towns,use of water,Water Charges,water control,water\n            distribution,water flows,water management,Water\n            Requirements,Water Resources,water schemes,water\n            sources,Water Supply,Water User,water users,weirs,wells"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"6655"},"facets":{}}}
