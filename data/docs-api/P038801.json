While the overall Emergency Recovery Program (ERP)\n            proved to be too optimistic, the general objectives of the\n            more modest EAP were achieved, despite the unstable\n            environment during its implementation. The EAP succeeded in\n            its primary objective to direct emergency resources to the\n            sectors most in need, and it is likely that without the EAP,\n            it would have been very difficult to prevent further\n            deterioration in the economic and social conditions.\n            However, the EAP was not very successful in its secondary\n            objective to act as a catalyst for mobilizing donor support\n            for the broader ERP. The ERP's failure can be\n            attributed to: (i) its design, specifically to the fact that\n            donor technical work and participation in preparing the ERP\n            were very limited, and more extensive consultations were\n            needed to identify the priority activities for the targeted\n            sectors prior to the Paris meeting; and (ii) to the\n            deterioration of the political situation which discouraged\n            donors from carrying out their pledges in the context of the\n            ERP. Overall, any operation --development or otherwise--\n            implemented in an environment where a stable socio-political\n            setting is lacking, has limited chances of achieving\n            sustainable results. Close evaluation of the situation,\n            careful program design, and the need of realism are\n            necessary before committing to such broad recovery programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Emergency Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi - Emergency Assistance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/03/731998/burundi-emergency-assistance-project","projn":"BI-Emerg.
