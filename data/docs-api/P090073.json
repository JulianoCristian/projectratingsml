- Second Pollution Abatement Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Second Pollution Abatement Project\n            for Egypt received a satisfactory outcome rating with\n            moderate risk to development outcome. The Bank received a\n            moderately satisfactory outcome rating while the Borrower\n            received a satisfactory outcome rating. The Project was\n            restructured twice. The first restructuring was a level 2\n            restructuring to extend the closing date by 18 months due to\n            the delays caused by the global financial crisis and due to\n            the political events in Egypt. The second restructuring was\n            also a level 2 restructuring to (a) extend the closing date\n            by another 12 months to properly complete project\n            activities, and (b) revise two intermediate performance\n            indicators to take into account that the CDM projects did\n            not move forward in a timely manner. There were several\n            lessons learned from this project and are as follows: (1) as\n            the Bank becomes increasingly involved with private sector\n            entities, there is a need to improve the capacity of the\n            Bank to handle common commercial procurement practices, (2)\n            the value added of issuing loans in local currency should be\n            considered at the preparation stage, (3) use of concessional\n            finance has proved effective in triggering private\n            investments in pollution abatement and the approach should\n            be scaled-up and replicated in other countries, (4) internal\n            rates of return (IRR) evaluation for pollution abatement\n            investments could be used in the future to develop a\n            differential scheme, (5) installation of continuous\n            monitoring systems should form an integral part of grant\n            funded sub-projects, (6) carbon finance-linked projects\n            require careful preparation with contractual commitments upfront."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Second Pollution Abatement
