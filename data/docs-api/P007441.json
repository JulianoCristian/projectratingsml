adjustment. It will include programs to further enhance\n            actions taken under the first two SALs, plus the energy\n            sector. Overall, the third SAL aims at achieving export\n            development and economic deregulation.  More particularly,\n            the program will focus on the following problem areas: 1)\n            the balance of payments situation; 2) fiscal imbalances\n            caused by inadequate public sector savings; and 3) the\n            sluggish performance of both the agricultural and\n            manufacturing sectors. It will alson center on: 4)\n            inadequacies in public administration, particularly in the\n            areas of financial and personnel management; and 5)\n            excessive petroleum imports. The loan will finance imports\n            of raw materials, intermediate goods, non-luxury consumer\n            goods, capital equipment and spare parts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Third
