Some lessons\n            learned included: a careful definition of targets during\n            appraisal facilitates project implementation and ultimate\n            evaluation. Institutional arrangements, such as the\n            frequency of executive committee meetings, as well as the\n            policy environment need to be monitored more closely during\n            supervision missions. This will enable remedial measures,\n            including sanctions, to be introduced to facilitate\n            implementation. It should focus on a few priority\n            interventions in agriculture at a time, especially in the\n            face of dwindling public resources, and the private sector\n            should be encouraged to participate in project activities in\n            order to take the pressure off lean public resources.\n            Publicity and the maintenance of good external relations are\n            vital for the survival of the ADP system in the competitive\n            environment of multiple government interventions in the\n            agricultural sector.
