The lessons learned indicate that the Bank\n            needs to improve its monitoring and course correcting during\n            implementation and this process begins with a clear and\n            unambiguous statement of project objectives. Project\n            objectives need to be clearly defined to enable the borrower\n            and the Bank to supervise the project. Bank teams should\n            address all major issues highlighted in these reports and\n            justify to the management one way or another on all major\n            concerns. It is important to set up a good system of M&E\n            for a project. It is even more essential to help a client\n            build an M&E system which can be sustainable after the\n            project closes. The Bank needs to review and assess all of\n            the components which contribute to development objectives,\n            including the ones that are not financed by the Bank.\n            Triggers should be policy-oriented and results-focused. The\n            Bank and the borrower should agree on the outcomes and the\n            monitorable performance measures for Information and\n            Communication Technology (ICT) investments. It is important\n            to assess the institutional capacity of the implementation\n            agency during preparation of the project, and make\n            arrangements to ensure the management structure would meet\n            the demand of the project implementation. Milestones and\n            targets for implementation need to be agreed and strictly\n            followed by the borrower and the Bank. Realistic risk\n            assessment in project design and measures to mitigate them\n            are essential. Lessons from APL1 were not assessed in time\n            in order to incorporate them during the preparation of the\n            APL2. This has led to deficiencies in the design of APL2."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Basic Education Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Basic Education Program

First, expanded\n            basic education coverage will support the training and\n            recruitment of additional teachers and the design,\n            construction, expansion, and upgrading of basic education\n            schools.
