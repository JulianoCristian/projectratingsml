The primary objective of\n            the project was to assist the government in rehabilitating,\n            maintaining, and improving its road system. It aimed to\n            conserve and develop economic resources, prevent potentially\n            high road reconstruction and vehicle operating costs, and\n            repair flood damage to important road links. Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower's performance\n            was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows:\n            (i) need to assess early on potential Borrower problems with\n            procurement and other Bank or International Development\n            Association (IDA) procedures and provide close supervision\n            when difficulties are anticipated; (ii) complex\n            institutional changes are often not carried out successfully\n            unless the Borrower is strongly committed to them and there\n            is an appropriate constituency supporting their\n            implementation; and (iii) on the technical side, the\n            experience with the Harad bridge points out the importance\n            of frequent on-site supervision and taking early action if\n            the assumptions underlying design standards need to be\n            changed to take account of changed circumstances."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic of Yemen - Sana'a - Hodeidah\n            Road Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Republic of Yemen - Sana'a -\n            Hodeidah Road Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/06/733866/republic-yemen-sanaa-hodeidah-road-rehabilitation-project","topic":"Road Funds m1326663 1816,Transport Economics m1326662 162,Transport Employment m1326664 1820,Roads and Highways m1327398 168,Transport Efficiency m1327162 1819,Transport Equipment m1326014 1812,Road Transport m1327629 1801,Transport Governance m1327401 1823","projn":"RY-Sanaa-Hodeidah Rd.
