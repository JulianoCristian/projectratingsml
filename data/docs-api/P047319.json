The government's commitment is essential for\n            the implementation of an education sector program. The Bank\n            is still having difficulties to implement successful reform\n            in higher education in Senegal. It is extremely difficult to\n            have a precise planning of an entire sector, especially in a\n            context where the information system is weak. The program\n            was implemented fully through Government's departments,\n            which has resulted in considerably strengthening ownership\n            during the implementation of the program and also allowing\n            the education sector to develop strong capacities, notably\n            in fiduciary management at the central and deconcentrated\n            levels. The implementation of the first phase of QEFA\n            suffered from conflicts between Educational Planning and\n            Reform Department (DPRE) in charge of the coordination and\n            education directorates because of a lack of clearly\n            hierarchical relationship established between them.\n            Outsourcing to national research institutions can help\n            enhance monitoring and evaluation and curtail shortcomings\n            in classical State entities. These transfers permitted\n            administrative directorates and schools to be in More\n            attention to particular areas of concern, such as the\n            financing of textbooks,
