Several lessons have been learned from\n            this pilot project in both policy and operational\n            perspectives. A broader set of lessons are: first, putting\n            in place a rational and enabling labor market policy\n            framework is key to reducing labor market rigidity and\n            segregation and increasing labor mobility and employment\n            flexibility; second, when an economy continues to grow\n            rapidly and jobs are being created, active labor market\n            policies, especially employment services and training\n            including retraining could have a positive impact on\n            employment and reemployment if they were well targeted and\n            integrated; third, information is essential to help equip\n            workers in transition between jobs and to seize\n            opportunities to acquire new skills; and fourth, the\n            trainability and employability of workers depend largely on\n            their education background. More specific lessons learned\n            are: (1) building a bridge between the labor market, service\n            providers, job seekers, and employers can be facilitated by\n            a LMDP; (2) the experience of implementation of employment\n            services and in-service training, has proven that such\n            integration contributes to higher placement/employment rate\n            and increased relevance and effectiveness of the training\n            provided; (3) the LMDP experience suggests that a complex\n            pilot project that depends upon the effective implementation\n            of policy and legal reforms to achieve its objectives\n            requires the involvement of all key stakeholders at the\n            outset of its preparation and design to ensure their\n            commitment to, and perseverance in, successfully completing\n            the execution of all project activities; (4) effective\n            institutional development through technology transfer can be\n            realized when a foreign firm and a local enterprise are able\n            to work collaboratively to achieve an agreed objective\n            within a given timeframe; (5) the LMDP has reinforced the\n            principle that project implementation success and the\n            sustainability of its investments in legal and policy\n            reforms depend crucially upon the integration of systematic\n            staff training and its timing with key activities relating\n            to those reforms; and (6) the successful implementation of a\n            project involving complex policy and legal reforms aimed at\n            changing the structure of a key sector of the economy is\n            best assured when the objectives are in line with the\n            borrower's sector policies and the implementation\n            timing and strategies harmonize with the government's\n            readiness for change to quicken economic and social development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Labor Market Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Labor Market Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/12/7322587/china-labor-market-development-project","projn":"CN-Labor Market Development -- P034618","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Labor Standards,Banks & Banking Reform,Labor Markets,Education For All,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Information and Communication Technologies,Social Protections and Labor,Education","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070116093721"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Vocational training,Sub-national government administration,Law and justice","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Information and Communication Technologies,Social Protections and Labor,Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"active labor, active labor market, active\n            labor market policies, Advanced Skills, advanced training,\n            business processes, cities, collaboration, Competitive\n            Bidding, computer equipment, computer software, consulting\n            services, contractors, corporate governance, educated\n            workers, education attainment, education system,\n            employability, employment promotion, employment services,\n            employment training, Exchange Rate, financial management,\n            in-service training, Institutional Development, Instruction,\n            job placement, Job Seekers, job vacancies, jobs, knowledge\n            economy, Labor Bureau, Labor Bureaus, labor demand, Labor\n            Law, labor legislation, LABOR MARKET, LABOR MARKET\n            DEVELOPMENT, Labor Market Information, labor market policy,\n            labor market reform, labor market rigidity, labor market\n            service, labor market services, labor markets, labor\n            mobility, labor offices, labor productivity, labor\n            shortages, labor statistics, labour, laid-off workers, laws,\n            legal framework, level of education, level playing field,\n            local labor markets, migrant labor, migration,\n            Municipalities, Occupational Classification, Occupational\n            Skills, Pass rate, pensions, primary cause, private\n            providers, public finance, re-employment rate, regulatory\n            framework, rural workers, savings, seed money, service,\n            service providers, skill development, skill mix, skill\n            shortages, skilled labor, skilled workers, Skilled Workers\n            School, skills development, Skills Training, social\n            protection, Social Security, social services, State-owned\n            Enterprise, State-owned Enterprises, technical assistance,\n            Technology Transfer, trainees, Training Agency, Training\n            Center, training centers, Training Component, training\n            courses, Training Placement, training programs, transition\n            economies, unemployed, Unemployment, Unemployment Insurance,\n            unskilled labor, urban employment, vocational skills,\n            Vocational Training, wages, workers"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF022211-CANADIAN GENERAL CTF II-CHINA,TF026781-JSDF-CHINA: EMPOWERING THE POOR\n            WOMEN IN THE WESTERN REGION,TF029225-PHRD -LABOR MARKET DEV.
