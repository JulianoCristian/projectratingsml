with the pace of economic reform.\n            The main lessons learned from the project are: (a)\n            establishment of Industrial Liaison Committees is a useful\n            vehicle in promoting increased participation of industries;\n            (b) a monitoring and evaluation system is essential to track\n            implementation and assess project impact; and (c) under the\n
