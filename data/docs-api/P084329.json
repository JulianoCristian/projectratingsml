In\n            late 2001, after the fall of the Taliban and almost three\n            decades of conflict, Afghanistan faced a daunting set of\n            challenges. World Bank programs were aligned with and in\n            support of the National Priority Programs, identified by the\n            Afghan Government as key to the development of Afghanistan\n            and the transition process. Afghanistan had made remarkable\n            progress in many areas. Important development results had\n            been achieved in areas such as health, education,\n            microfinance, irrigation and rural livelihoods, as well as\n            in public financial management.

Some lessons learned\n            included: that in a difficult post-conflict situation\n            characterized by limited government capacity, the\n            project's choice of institutional arrangements\n            featuring performance based contracting of service providers\n            for management assistance and field implementation lends\n            itself to a rapid scaling up of project outreach. The\n            challenge of maintaining engineering quality of\n            sub-projects, which has been and remains an issue in the\n            project and nationally across other projects and programs,\n            needs to be managed. However, this can not be effectively\n            addressed at the level of a project implementing agency, but\n            requires a broader effort aimed at building capacity for\n            small and medium contractors coupled with a certification\n            process to establish a list of pre-qualified contractors.\n            Monitoring and evaluation needs to be strengthened in\n            several areas including: (a) entry of baseline data into the\n            Management Information System (MIS); (b) periodic audits of\n            Community Development Council (CDC) financial management and\n            procurement; (c) assessments of livelihoods activities in\n            terms of sustainable income increases; (d) entry into the\n            MIS and analysis of data on CDC composition to enable an\n            assessment of the governance outputs of National Solidarity\n            Project (NSP) in terms of inclusiveness versus elite\n            capture; (e)

National Solidarity\n            Project (NSP) constitutes the backbone of the\n            Government's National Solidarity Program (NSP), co\n            financed by several donors through the Bank managed\n            Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund. This additional\n            financing would provide funds needed to scale-up activities\n            under a successful emergency program in the social sector\n            that has exceeded the original implementation (including\n            disbursement) expectations. The funds to be added through\n            this additional grant were not available under IDA 13 in\n            June 2005. The scaled up activities are expected to be\n            implemented by the original closing date, and are within the\n            original project objectives, subject to the same\n            implementation arrangements. The additional financing will\n            require an amendment to the Development Grant Agreement to\n            increase the amount of Block Grants category by US$24.4\n            million, Consultants Services, facilitation and training by\n            US$15.0 million, Goods by 0.5 million, and Incremental\n            Operating Costs by 0.1 million. It is expected the\n            additional financing will further community-led\n            reconstruction and development of rural infrastructure.\n            Approximately 70 percent of program funds return to local\n            labor, and virtually all of the benefits from the physical\n            works accrue to primary producers. Sub-project choices by\n            villagers include physical infrastructure, direct asset\n            transfers (e.g. tools and equipment for income generation\n            activities) for vulnerable women and disabled people, and\n            the use of block grants for income generation activities.\n            While premature to estimate economic and financial benefits\n            in the current Afghanistan disrupted environment, NSP data\n            are being collected however, to enable an estimate of\n            expected returns on individual subproject investments. This\n            additional grant faces the same implementation risks as the\n            overall program, and specific risk and mitigation measures\n            that currently apply to NSP remain
