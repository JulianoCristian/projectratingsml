Some lessons learned included: close\n            coordination with other development partners, both with\n            regard to substance of the program and timing, has been\n            indispensable to mitigate risks and improve the leverage in\n            the policy dialogue. It also provided some scope for\n            dividing responsibilities according to the main strengths of\n            each partner. Coordination between the ERGG, the\n            International Monetary Fund (IMF) Poverty Reduction and\n            Growth Facility (PRGF) and the African Development Bank\n            (AfDB) budget support operation created a critical mass and\n            proved particularly important. Given the capacity\n            bottlenecks in the country and the fragile political\n            situation, it was necessary to ensure that the arrears\n            clearance and development policy operation were accompanied\n            by appropriately targeted technical assistance, by the Bank\n            and other donors. In this case, the ERGG was supported by\n            the low income countries under stress (LICUS) grants and the\n            Financial Sector and Governance Reform Technical Assistance\n            (TA) Project. In fragile country situations, it is\n            particularly important to select a focused number of prior\n            actions that are deemed essential to supporting the\n            Government's broader reform program. Selectivity not\n            only reduces transaction costs for the Government that is\n            burdened by multiple management demands while the capacity\n            is weak, but also increases the likelihood that these\n            reforms are successfully implemented and the reform program\n            moves forward."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Togo - Economic Recovery and Governance\n

Governance Grant (ERGG) for Togo are to: (i) facilitate\n            the clearance of Togo's arrears to International\n            Development Association (IDA), which is required to restore\n            normal relations between the country and the World Bank; and\n            (ii) support Togo in its economic and social recovery. Given\n            the complex and still fragile socio-political environment\n            and governance and transparency issues facing the\n            government, the second objective is pursued by supporting\n            government-owned reforms to improve governance, transparency\n            and efficiency in public expenditure management as well as\n            advance structural reforms aimed at strengthening governance\n            and transparency in the key sectors of the economy\n            (phosphates, energy, cotton and financial sectors). This\n            program will lead over time to strengthened fiscal\n            sustainability, enhanced transparency of state institutions\n            and processes, improved economic governance and increased\n            economic growth. Based on current projections of debt ratios\n            for end-2007, Togo will qualify for debt relief under the\n            enhanced heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative.\n            The operation will then pave the way for HIPC debt relief\n            with attainment of the decision point expected, assuming\n            continued program performance, toward the end of CY2008. The\n            ERGG is expected to have a positive impact on poverty\n            reduction. Specifically, efforts to improve the capacity of\n            the state to implement its budget priorities and strengthen\n            public financial management will enhance efficiency,\n            transparency and accountability in public resource use, and\n            increase the country's absorption capacity for external\n            resources. Strengthening governance, transparency and\n            efficiency in the phosphates sector will help improve\n            government revenues and contribute to a more transparent\n            utilization of resources in this sector. Strengthening\n            governance and transparency in the cotton sector will\n            facilitate a rebound in cotton production in the short term,\n            there by improving the livelihood of an important segment of\n            the population (which relies on this cash crop as dominant\n            source of earnings). Improving governance and efficiency in\n            the energy sector will help stimulate economic activity and\n            reduce government expenditures (the savings can be used for\n            increased expenditures for basic social services). Reforming\n            the financial sector will help strengthen the financial\n            situation of institutions affected by the crisis and improve\n            the soundness of the banking sector, as well as of\n            microfinance institutions which benefit the poorer and more\n            vulnerable part of the population. The grant will also help\n            fund the provision of basic public services with a\n            beneficial impact on the poor in the period immediately\n            after arrears clearance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Togo -
