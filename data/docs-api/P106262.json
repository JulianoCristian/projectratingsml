Bicol Power Restoration Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Bicol Power Restoration\n            Project for Philippines were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to global environment outcome was low\n            or negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: while it is a general tenet that project\n            quality is a reflection of project readiness, the need for\n            strong upstream collaboration becomes even more critical in\n            an emergency project. The project provides a good example of\n            how borrowers and the Bank can efficiently and effectively\n            work together to respond to emergency situation, based on a\n            clear assessment of its capacity and agreed processes,\n            resulted in fast and generally problem-free implementation.\n            There are four aspects that shaped the success of the\n            project: (i) effective collaboration with a receptive\n            institution; (ii) bank flexibility and responsiveness, but\n            applied with careful assessment of agency capabilities, and\n            clear application of Bank financial and governance\n            requirements; (iii) effective safeguards management; and\n            (iv) complementarity of bank assistance with sector reform\n            processes. Land acquisition in any project often raises\n            complex issues. In an emergency project, the possibility of\n            such issues makes project implementation more vulnerable to\n            delays and even stoppages. The key to success is that early\n            in processing, detailed assessments have to be carried out,\n            problems identified, and solutions developed. It was\n            recognized that the project did need to expedite clearance\n            and settlement of right-of-way (ROW) issues to avoid any\n            delays. While assessment, consultation, information\n            dissemination, negotiation, and payments were expedited for\n            the most part, the legacy of pending claims came up in some\n            cases in which tower occupancy fees had not been paid during\n            original construction. Pending claims associated with one\n            tower eventually did cause a delay in project completion of\n            about two months, but this did not have a substantive impact\n            on overall project implementation. National Transmission\n            Corporations (Transco's) range of options in dealing\n            with land acquisition and ROW issues, from the payment of\n            occupancy fees to full purchase of properties, allowed for\n            flexibility in resolving problems. Nonetheless, there still\n            remain national-level issues in land valuation techniques,\n            tenurial documentation, and transaction costs in property\n            and land titling that are beyond the scope of the project,\n            but simplification and careful review of which have been\n            recommended to acquiring agencies. Overall, the lesson is\n            that even in emergency situations, resettlement planning\n            cannot be overlooked."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Bicol Power Restoration

The projects objective is to\n            support the stabilization of power supply in the Bicol\n            region by replacing or repairing critical electricity\n            transmission infrastructure damaged by typhoons in 2006. The\n            projects components: (i) restoration; and (ii) initial\n            preparedness. The Bank's strategy for emergency support\n            is to support financing of critical assets of investments in\n            the power transmission system serving the Bicol region, thus\n            assisting in the removal of infrastructure constraints to\n            the region's economic development. The projects\n            financial plan for provision has been made for a 10 percent\n            contingency to ensure that there should be some funds\n            available in case of further emergencies or cost overrun.\n            The Implementing Agency for the project, TransCo, is a\n            government- owned and controlled corporation, created in\n            2000. The appraisal activities applicable to the project are\n            ; (i) a review of lessons learned from past projects and\n            their incorporation in project design; (ii) economic\n            analysis of the financed investments; (iii) assessment of\n            the institutional capability of TransCo to manage the\n            project; and (iv) evaluation of environmental and social
