Lessons learned are as\n            follows. Since the risk that Congress would not enact all of\n            the envisaged legislation was not only recognized, but was\n            actually a main subject of discussion during negotiations,\n            the explicit mention (on the President Report) of such risks\n            should have specified the enactment of contentious\n            legislation into the conditionality of the operation.\n            Moreover, given that monitoring, and enforcement of\n            implementation is particularly difficult in a complex,\n            multi-tranche adjustment operation, specifically in light of\n            uncertain supportive legislative reforms, the effectiveness\n            of some regulatory changes related to large banks remains\n            questionable, possibly the credibility itself of such\n            changes. Thus it is fair to say, that cutting losses, and\n            canceling should be readily employed, much preferable if\n            solutions are unlikely to achieve the development objective,\n            a conclusion which should have been reached much earlier.\n            While restructuring is also an option to consider,\n            preferable to allowing difficult issues to continue, it is\n            suggested that single-tranche operations may be preferable\n            to multi-tranche operations, to avoid actions beyond the\n            control of the executive."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Banking System Reform Loan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Banking System\n            Reform

system and enable it to better\n            withstand current difficulties and future shocks. The focus\n            of this program is to: a) improve on an ongoing basis the\n            incentives for supervisors, bank owners, and the market to\n            strengthen the framework for prudent banking; b) enhance the\n            framework and the authorities' preparedness for early\n            intervention and resolution of troubled banks; c) strengthen\n            Philippine National Bank towards the standards maintained by\n            the top tier banks in the country; and d) reduce the\n            incentives for regulatory and tax arbitrage across financial\n            institutions, and between the peso and foreign currencies.\n            The loan provides balance of payments support to the\n            Philippines when the country's access to private\n            capital has been sharply reduced. It will also build\n            international reserves, reduce the pressure on domestic\n            resources to finance the budget deficit, and enhance market\n            confidence in the banking program. A loan of US$ 300 million\n            will be disbursed in three equal tranches. However, the risk\n            is that the economy remains vulnerable to a deterioration in\n            the regional environment. Also the banking system faces\n            continuing risks from economic slowdown, tighter credit,\n            peso depreciation, and weaker real estate prices. By\n            engaging the authorities in an ongoing dialogue, the Bank\n            can strengthen the program and enhance the investor\n            confidence in the program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Banking System Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Banking System\n            Reform
