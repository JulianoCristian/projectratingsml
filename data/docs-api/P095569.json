The risk to dvelopment outcome was moderate;\n            the bank performance was satisfactory; and the\n            borrower's performance was moderately satisfactory. The\n            objectives of the Project are: (a) to further preserve the\n            Non-Concessioned National Road Network, through the\n            expansion of CREMA Contracts for said network; and (b) to\n            further strengthen the National Highways Directorate's\n            road sector management capacity. No formal revision of the\n            original Project Development Objectives was made during\n            project implementation. Other significant changes made\n            during project implementation include the following: (a) the\n            closing date of the project was extended twice during\n            project implementation; (b) the project was first\n            restructured in order to accommodate the need to introduce\n            in the Loan Agreement specific clauses on safeguard policies\n            that were not considered applicable in the original\n            documents; (c) partly because of the high inflation in the\n            Argentine economy since 2003; and (d) some minor\n            reallocations of funds among Categories of the Loan were\n            deemed necessary and executed through a second\n            restructuration of the project. The following key lessons\n            were learned during the execution of the Loan: 1) this\n            project fell victim, once again, of a scope of tasks not\n            fully committed to by a client;  2) the policy of\n            independent technical audits during project implementation\n            proved to be extremely valuable and should be widely\n            institutionalized for this type of interventions; 3) the\n            assessment done by the World Bank of use of Rehabilitation\n            and Maintenance Contract (Contrato de Recuperaci\u00f3n y\n            Mantenimiento, CREMA) in Argentina found that the overall\n            cost effectiveness of these type of contracts in comparison\n            to traditional ad-measurement or input contracts is 24\n            percent; 4) one additional advantage of the CREMA system\n            that is rarely mentioned and yet became, once again,\n            apparent during project execution, is that it allows\n            reasonably swift disbursement of Bank's funds, since\n            payments are not linked to time-consuming measurements and\n            testing as is the case in traditional inputs-based\n            contracting systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Second Adaptable Program Loan\n            (APL) for the National Highway Asset Management
