Some lessons learned included:  first, in\n            the event of a hiatus in project implementation, the project\n            should be completely reformulated or canceled at the end of\n            the hiatus. Second, to ensure proper implementation, someone\n            should be deployed full-time to manage the project. Third,\n            project salaries of locally recruited consultants  should be\n            such as not to demoralize non-project staff and one that the\n            country can comfortably support even without donor funding,\n            by maintaining a unified, but rewarding pay structure.\n            Fourth, a monitoring unit working with measurable indicators\n            is essential to guide implementation and ensure success of\n            the project. Fifth, effective project supervision from the\n            Bank is indispensable to project success, by clearly\n            identifying and addressing problems.
