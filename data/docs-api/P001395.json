The lessons learned are: a) In a\n            capacity constrained environment, implementation experience\n            suggests that project/program designs be simplified and\n            focus on fundamentals. b) Accountability, ownership, and\n            borrower oversight problems could be partly addressed by\n            integrating the Project Management Unit into the Ministry of\n            Health and Social Welfare structures; and securing\n            broadbased support, ownership, and commitment to the project\n            from a wider range of stakeholders. c) Broader stakeholder\n            involvement in project identification and preparation is\n            required to buffer against changes in leadership and staff\n            turnover. d) Sustainable improvements in the health system\n            demand attention to institutional capacity. e) Supervision\n            of financial management also requires specialized inputs. f)\n            Bank supervision was highly valued. g) Task teams are\n            required to ensure continuity on the part of the Bank. h)\n            Impact assessment is not possible without baseline data. i)\n            The Bank should distinguish between activities which simply\n            require more time for completion and those which have not\n            progressed due to institutional constraints."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho -
