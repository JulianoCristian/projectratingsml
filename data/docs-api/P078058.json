Some lessons learned included:\n            putting in place flexible institutional arrangements that\n            development partners can use to channel support quickly,\n            before climate emergencies occur, can help to improve\n            coordination and efficiency. Implementation arrangements\n            need to allow climate-stressed communities 'time\n            out' to cope with emergencies. Community-driven\n            development projects, or components, through the emphasis on\n            beneficiary participation and empowerment, can be\n            instruments for reducing the risks of corruption and poor\n            governance, especially at the local level, provided that\n            social accountability arrangements are properly designed and\n            implemented by the Borrower and closely supervised. There is\n            a particular need to design workable disclosure and\n            complaints handling mechanisms, assign responsibilities for\n            implementing them, and ensure that this takes place. The\n            first phase of ALRMP did not include conflict resolution,\n            but it very quickly became necessary and the project\n            responded creatively. With this experience, ALRMP II\n            designers planned to integrate conflict management into the\n            natural resource management component. Beneficiaries and\n            other stakeholders point to the resulting activities as\n            having been among the project's most important\n            contributions. Addressing conflicts over natural resources\n            needs to be an integral part of projects in fragile\n            locations that are experiencing in-migration or are\n            over-populated (in relation to the resource base) and\n            subject to increasingly adverse climate change impacts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Second Phase of the Arid Lands\n

districts and communities in the Arid and\n            Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) to plan and implement climate change\n            adaptation measures. There are three components to the\n            project. The first component of the project is climate\n            information products, policy, and advocacy. This component\n            will strengthen capacities among national institutions to\n            better assess and respond to current and future climate\n            risks. It will generate and disseminate climate-related\n            knowledge and strengthen institutional coordination among\n            currently fragmented agencies managing disaster and climate\n            risk. National stakeholders will be trained to further\n            disseminate the knowledge that is generated to the district\n            and community levels. The second component of the project is\n            climate risk management at the district level. This\n            component will promote the integration of a climate risk\n            management perspective into district planning processes and\n            programs. The component will build capacity related to\n            climate change among major stakeholders at the district\n            level and support public and private climate-smart\n            investments. The third component of the project is\n            community-driven initiatives for climate resilience. This\n            component will help communities to adopt climate change\n            adaptation strategies and investments. It will complement\n            Arid Lands Resource Management Project (ALRMP)/ASAL\n            Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) activities in reducing\n            vulnerability among the ASAL population
