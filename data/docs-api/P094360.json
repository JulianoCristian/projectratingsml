Some lessons learned included: substantive\n            alterations to projects late in the preparation process\n            should be avoided. Although the polio component of the\n            project contributed to the elimination of polio in India,\n            there was not adequate opportunity for appraisal of the\n            component which may have led to an overestimation of the\n            required budget. Monitoring and evaluation needs to be given\n            highest priority. The delay in implementation of the\n            baseline population based household survey and the complete\n            absence of mid-term and end of project survey data for\n            comparison is clearly not acceptable. Projects need controls\n            in place to ensure that key monitoring and evaluation\n            activities are conducted in a timely manner. This may\n            include conditions of effectiveness or dated covenants.\n            Community-based service delivery models can work. This\n            project has contributed further evidence that\n            community-based health workers with limited training can\n            effectively manage biological confirmation and treatment of\n            malaria and kala-azar and contribute to epidemiologic and\n            program monitoring. Operational research can have a very\n            positive impact on policy and practice. By incorporating\n            routine drug and insecticide resistance monitoring, batch\n            testing of rapid diagnostic tests, pharmaco-vigilance and\n            impact evaluation into the Monitoring and Evaluation\n            (M&E) framework for the project, new data were\n            continually being generated for consideration by technical\n            experts, state-level and
