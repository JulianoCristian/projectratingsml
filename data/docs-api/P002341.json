The project achieved its\n            objectives in the institutional and financial aspects, and\n            the physical objectives were largely met. Therefore, the\n            project's outcome can be rated satisfactory. The Bank\n            performance was considered satisfactory; and the performance\n            of the borrower was mixed. The major objectives of the\n            project were to: (i) develop the organizational, technical,\n            and financial capacities of the local governments of the\n            Greater Dakar area; and (ii) expand the efficiency of the\n            housing sector by removing financial and institutional\n            constraints to the Housing Bank of Senegal (BHS), and\n            improving the operation of the urban land market through\n            annual supply of a significant number of serviced and titled\n            plots. The major lessons learned from this project are as\n            follows: for a project to be manageable, it is crucial to\n            keep it as simple as possible. This project was highly\n            complicated and therefore difficult to implement and\n            supervise. Components such as the fiscal cadastre are too\n            complex and costly. Both costs and complexities are often\n            driven by suppliers eager to sell their high tech products."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Municipal and Housing Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Municipal and Housing\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/11/732115/senegal-municipal-housing-development-project","projn":"SN-Municipal Housing De -- P002341","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Urban Economics,Banks & Banking Reform,Municipal Financial Management,Public Sector Economics,Public & Municipal Finance","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Urban Development","count":"Senegal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980203114926"},"subsc":"(Historic)Urban development adjustment,(Historic)Urban housing","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Urban Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Urban Development","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"auditors,Bank Performance,Bank\n            supervision,bankruptcy,Banque Centrale des Etats de\n            l'Afrique de l'Ouest,cities,debt,debt\n            service,Decentralization,down payments,Employment,FISCAL\n            YEAR,Housing,housing policy,illegal\n            settlements,Institutional Development,interest rates,Land\n            Development,legislation,local government,Local\n            Governments,local taxes,low cost\n            housing,maturity,migration,Municipal Credit,Municipal\n            Development,municipal finance,municipal\n            investments,municipal management,municipal\n            taxes,municipalities,Private Sector,privatization,public\n            procurement,Public Sector,Public Transport,Public\n            Works,recapitalization,Resource\n            Mobilization,roads,savings,streets,Tax,tax collection,tax\n            revenues,technical assistance,traffic\n            management,Treasury,Urban Development,urban growth,Urban\n            Management,urban services"},"1":{"cdata!":"auditors,Bank Performance,Bank\n            supervision,bankruptcy,Banque Centrale des Etats de\n            l'Afrique de l'Ouest,cities,debt,debt\n            service,Decentralization,down payments,Employment,FISCAL\n            YEAR,Housing,housing policy,illegal\n            settlements,Institutional Development,interest rates,Land\n            Development,legislation,local government,Local\n            Governments,local taxes,low cost\n            housing,maturity,migration,Municipal Credit,Municipal\n            Development,municipal finance,municipal\n            investments,municipal management,municipal\n            taxes,municipalities,Private Sector,privatization,public\n            procurement,Public Sector,Public Transport,Public\n            Works,recapitalization,Resource\n            Mobilization,roads,savings,streets,Tax,tax collection,tax\n            revenues,technical assistance,traffic\n            management,Treasury,Urban Development,urban growth,Urban\n            Management,urban services"}},"owner":"WB:Dakar-FmcAFR1:SN/CV/CM/GW/MR (AFCF1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF027990-SENEGAL - MUNICIPAL &\n            HOUSE/DEV.
