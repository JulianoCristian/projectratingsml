This policy based operation supported the\n            program objectives as follows:  (a) the restoration and\n            increase of central government funding for key social\n            programs; (b) an expansion of key social and safety net\n            programs into districts in India that are especially\n            disadvantaged and/or especially at risk of suffering\n            negative consequences as a result of stabilization and\n            adjustment; (c) the carrying out of selected measures for a\n            number of social and safety net programs that set a\n            foundation for and initiated some improvements in the\n            quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of those programs;\n            and (d) the funding of the National Renewal Fund (NRF) to\n            facilitate industrial restructuring and the reintegration of\n            retrenched labor into the economy. The specific components\n            of the Social Safety Net Sector adjustment program (SSN)\n            focused on policy change and activities in the areas of\n            primary education, primary health care, disease control,\n            nutrition, and employment and income generation. Several\n            major lessons emerge from a review of this operation:\n            Bank's reviews of adjustment lending, the adjustment\n            process can be used to have a positive influence on both the\n            amount and the composition of expenditure for the social\n            sectors. Despite initial skepticism within the Bank, the SSN\n            program suggests that operations of this type can be used to\n            promote medium-term developments in the social sectors, as\n            took place under the program, particularly in the education\n            and health sectors. In order to maximize the impact of\n            cross-sectoral operations like the SSN, it is imperative\n            that each sectoral program be embedded in the ongoing\n            collaboration of the Bank and the client and be linked, as\n            well, to specific investment operations to follow. Programs\n            meant to assist retrenched workers should establish\n            institutional mechanisms for counseling, retraining, and\n            redeployment at an early stage to avoid a mismatch between\n            the timing of retrenchment and the provision of these\n            important services to those who have lost their jobs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Social Safety Net
