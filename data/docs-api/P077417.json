Lessons\n            learned from the project: For an emergency operation to be\n            effective in a severely damaged post-conflict environment,\n            the project design needs to be simple and the goals need to\n            be realistic. Critical operations functions need to be\n            separated from capacity building activities to ensure that\n            both are performed simultaneously. The expectations for\n            capacity building and institutional strengthening need to be\n            closely aligned with the availability and skill levels of\n            the government counterparts. The government needs to\n            continue to engage the services of the advisors for as long\n            as it takes to build sufficient, demonstrable capacity in\n            core public administration areas even as the roles of the\n            advisors become increasingly transitional. It is essential\n            that the Agents' contracts be maintained continuously.\n            International consultants are very expensive to retain over\n            a long period and often the incentives for them to\n            effectively train their counterparts are inadequate. Cash\n            handling and management procedures need to be carefully\n            articulated and put in place due to the potential need to\n            move large amounts of currency
