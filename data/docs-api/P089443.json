Some lessons learned included: Colombia's\n            social safety net system was strengthened by the project\n            because both development objectives were achieved. The\n            consolidation and expansion of the Familias en Accion\n            conditional cash transfer program involved a quadrupling of\n            the number of beneficiaries relative to the beginning of the\n            project. The targets on uptake and compliance were not fully\n            reached due to the scale-up in urban areas. A much wider\n            group of government officials in key agencies and ministries\n            understands the link between the strategic vision of the\n            social protection system and the results indicators in all\n            related programs and relevant agencies led by the Ministry\n            of Social Protection (MSP). The expansion of Conditional\n            Cash Transfers (CCT) programs from rural areas to large\n            urban centers presents challenges that must be addressed at\n            both design and implementation stages. The urban poor do not\n            have the same needs as the rural poor in terms of access to\n            basic health and education services for their children.\n            Moreover, they have weaker social networks and frequently\n            face higher opportunity costs of time. Low-cost systems to\n            manage and monitor large-scale CCT programs are essential to\n            keep the marginal cost of expansion low. The availability of\n            adequate technologies made Familias en Accion monitoring and\n            management feasible and cost-effective as it expanded.\n            Making impact evaluation results widely and continuously\n            available can help to shore up borrower commitment to a\n            program and can be particularly important when new\n            administrations come into power and are under pressure to\n            show results. Major changes in the Monitoring and Evaluation\n            (M&E) system at the Ministry of Social Protection\n            required changes not only in information systems, but also\n            within the whole institution. Improvements in M&E\n            require changes in organizational culture that acknowledge\n            the relevance and validity of the indicators and the\n            anticipated use of evidence in the decision-making process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Social Safety Net Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Social Safety Net

development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: importance of strong Borrower commitment,\n            ownership and leadership. Since its creation in 2001, the\n            objectives and coverage of Familias have evolved. The\n            Government has expanded the program to cover the entire\n            country and in the National Development Plan (2006-2010),\n            defines its role in the social protection system and in the\n            strategy to reduce extreme poverty. The operations of\n            Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programs in indigenous\n            communities may require adjustments in the standard\n            procedures. Modifications may be necessary in targeting\n            instruments, the negotiations process, and the types of\n            agreements signed with local authorities. A pro-active role\n            of the government in donor coordination can be effective in\n            providing an overall framework for cooperation. Given the\n            complexity of the social protection system (social security,\n            social promotion, and labor market and employment) and the\n            numerous entities involved each with different institutional\n            structures, the task of articulating a design should have\n            envisaged much more time than the 2 years envisaged. This\n            was particularly the case for the Ministry of Social\n            Protection (MSP), given that the design process implied\n            continuous training and capacity strengthening

The additional loan will help finance the costs\n            associated with the further scaling-up of activities in\n            order to enhance the impact of this well-performing project,\n            starting early in 2007, sooner than had been envisaged when\n            the Project was prepared and negotiated.

The project\n            objective would be to support the design and development of\n            a social protection system by co-financing the Familias\n            Conditional Cash Transfers Program, expanding it to new\n            areas, and developing it further to become a crisis response\n            instrument, and, strengthening the Ministry of Social\n            Protection (MSP) to improve the basic architecture of the\n            social protection system, in addition to improving the\n            monitoring and evaluation capacity of the MSP, as part of a\n            broader Government effort. In line with the country's\n            legislation, and the Bank's social safeguards, this\n            Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) identifies issues, to ensure\n            indigenous peoples, and ethnic minorities, are included in\n            sharing the benefits of project implementation, and in\n            addition, that their rights are respected, including their\n            cultural identity. The following actions are included in the\n            plan which has been agreed upon with the Colombian\n            authorities: development of a program strategy study on\n            ethnic populations, with special focus on the program's\n            promotion activities; training for municipal staff (enlaces\n            municipales) to be more aware of the ethnic\n            population's specific characteristics. and their own\n            behaviors toward this population group; Promotion of a more\n            cooperative program with health facilities, particularly in\n            the program's training activities (encuentros de\n            cuidado); Further data collection and analysis should be\n            gathered to better understand some of the problems\n            identified by the social assessment, while an action plan\n            will be formulated to address issues; Inclusion of\n            information on ethnicity in the impact surveys."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -
