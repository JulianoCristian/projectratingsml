Key lessons address the\n            following issues. 1) The beneficial impact of long-distance\n            trade, was enhanced by the inter-provincial cooperation, an\n            ambitious undertaking, but successful due to strong\n            preparation, and management, which has subsequently been\n            financed in national highways projects. 2) Delays in the\n            implementation of electrical, and mechanical systems,\n            hindered an optimal operation of assets built under the\n            project, (similar to delays under other projects implemented\n            during the 1990s); thus stricter control of procurement\n            schedules concerning these components, needs to be enforced\n            by implementing agencies, and the many central government\n            agencies involved in the clearance process. 3) The\n            constraints posed by operating the expressway under one\n            specific branch of government, hinders the financial\n            viability of the project, but in order to enhance\n            sustainability, both Hebei and Henan Provinces have agreed\n            to take steps for further commercialization of their\n            respective expressway management companies. 4) Taking into\n            consideration the five main cities along the SAXE corridor,\n            coordination of expressway planning, with city plans\n            requires further review, including mechanisms to improve\n            coordination with municipalities, and the Provincial\n            Communications Department."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

In the case of acquisition of sub-urban\n            vegetable plots, State regulations require payment from the\n            project unit. Compensation fees for cultivated land should\n            be based on an estimated annual production value, per an\n            average three year period, prior to acquisition, and,\n            resettlement grants should at least, maintain the living\n            standards of the affected population. Likewise, affected\n            collective units must use land compensation, and\n            resettlement grants to develop production, and/or create\n            jobs, for vulnerable groups. The county land administration\n            department, in coordination with the project owner and the\n            affected populations, should engage in an effort to provide\n            labor, through agricultural production, and township\n            enterprise development, under strict land control for\n            township construction. In consultation with the affected\n            population, the following are avenues of participation in\n            the resettlement process: 1) selection of specific\n            residential sites for housing locations; 2) choice for\n            affected people to either build their own houses, or select\n            government built houses; 3) ability to elect employment\n            opportunities; and, 4) grievance mechanisms will be\n            available, during resettlement implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

During the planning and design stage,\n            potentially negative environmental impacts include:\n            reduction of flood discharge ability; removal and\n            resettlement of residents in the right of way; loss of land\n            resources; and the erosion of roadbed soil caused by\n            wastewater from ditches. These will be mitigated\n            respectively by rationally selecting alignment; executing a\n            reasonable resettlement plan providing suitable\n            compensation; restricting the amount of farmland acquired;\n            increasing the number of waterspouts, and avoiding the\n            waterfall effect by adjusting their positions; and paving\n            road surfaces with stone or concrete. During the\n            construction stage, potential impacts anticipated are: 1)\n            increased river residue caused by litter and erosion in the\n            construction site and in the new road; 2) air, water, and\n            soil pollution caused by oil, gas, fuel, or paint in\n            equipment, asphalt-mixing or cement-mixing stations; 3) dust\n            and noise pollution around construction sites; 4) bad\n            drainage conditions; and 5) mosquito-breeding conditions,\n            such as that caused by still water ponds. These impacts will\n            be alleviated by: 1) covering and protecting topsoil with\n            green plants; 2) collecting and recycling lubricants to\n            avoid spillage and leakage; 3) installing equipment to\n            control air pollution, and removing asphalt-mixing equipment\n            to safe distances from inhabited areas on the leeward side;\n            4) regularly spraying the temporary road with water, and\n            installing and setting up sound barriers; 5) building\n            suitable toilet facilities; and 6) taking measures to reduce\n            mosquito-breeding environments. During the operational\n            stage: 1) air pollution will be further reduced by\n            controlling vehicle emissions; 2) water pollution caused by\n            road runoff into irrigation systems and water sources will\n            be avoided; 3) litter processing equipment and appropriate\n            legislation will inhibit/prohibit littering; 4) injuries and\n            deaths caused by toxic spills and leakages produced by\n            transport will be headed off by planning and managing a\n            program to reduce such accidents."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

During the planning and design stage,\n            potentially negative environmental impacts include:\n            reduction of flood discharge ability; removal and\n            resettlement of residents in the right of way; loss of land\n            resources; and the erosion of roadbed soil caused by\n            wastewater from ditches. These will be mitigated\n            respectively by rationally selecting alignment; executing a\n            reasonable resettlement plan providing suitable\n            compensation; restricting the amount of farmland acquired;\n            increasing the number of waterspouts, and avoiding the\n            waterfall effect by adjusting their positions; and paving\n            road surfaces with stone or concrete.

During the planning and design stage,\n            potentially negative environmental impacts include:\n            reduction of flood discharge ability; removal and\n            resettlement of residents in the right of way; loss of land\n            resources; and the erosion of roadbed soil caused by\n            wastewater from ditches. These will be mitigated\n            respectively by rationally selecting alignment; executing a\n            reasonable resettlement plan providing suitable\n            compensation; restricting the amount of farmland acquired;\n            increasing the number of waterspouts, and avoiding the\n            waterfall effect by adjusting their positions; and paving\n            road surfaces with stone or concrete. During the\n            construction stage, potential impacts anticipated are: 1)\n            increased river residue caused by litter and erosion in the\n            construction site and in the new road; 2) air, water, and\n            soil pollution caused by oil, gas, fuel, or paint in\n            equipment, asphalt-mixing or cement-mixing stations; 3) dust\n            and noise pollution around construction sites; 4) bad\n            drainage conditions; and 5) mosquito-breeding conditions,\n            such as that caused by still water ponds. These impacts will\n            be alleviated by: 1) covering and protecting topsoil with\n            green plants; 2) collecting and recycling lubricants to\n            avoid spillage and leakage; 3) installing equipment to\n            control air pollution, and removing asphalt-mixing equipment\n            to safe distances from inhabited areas on the leeward side;\n            4) regularly spraying the temporary road with water, and\n            installing and setting up sound barriers; 5) building\n            suitable toilet facilities; and 6) taking measures to reduce\n            mosquito-breeding environments. During the operational\n            stage: 1) air pollution will be further reduced by\n            controlling vehicle emissions; 2) water pollution caused by\n            road runoff into irrigation systems and water sources will\n            be avoided; 3) litter processing equipment and appropriate\n            legislation will inhibit/prohibit littering; 4) injuries and\n            deaths caused by toxic spills and leakages produced by\n            transport will be headed off by planning and managing a\n            program to reduce such accidents."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
