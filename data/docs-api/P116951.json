increase social\n            assistance to the poor, while reducing the fiscal deficit\n            and creating fiscal space for poverty-reducing growth; (ii)\n            to improve the structure and efficiency of public\n            expenditures; and (iii) to reduce social contribution rates\n            and pressures on private sector wages from faster wage\n            growth in the public sector, thereby enhancing private\n            sector competitiveness. The program supports the\n            authorities' public expenditure reform efforts, with\n            blended loans and credits. The first loan and credit will be\n            for an amount equivalent to US$111 million, of which US$66\n            million is International Development Association (IDA)\n            credit and US$45 million is International Bank for\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan.
