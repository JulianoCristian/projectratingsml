The following lessons are drawn from the\n            experience of these two projects: 1) in designing\n            institutional development (ID) project components, the\n            incentives for those directly concerned by proposed changes\n            should be well aligned with the project objectives. In\n            particular, the staffing and remuneration implications of\n            major institutional reorganizations (such as the creation of\n            GTCL), need to be well understood, and explicitly addressed,\n            if reorganizations are to be successfully implemented; 2)\n            building a strong gas industry of international standard,\n            requires a major ID effort: better management, greatly\n            increased training, better remuneration, and more autonomy;\n            3) the Bank should take a less dogmatic approach to sector\n            reforms, and practice greater sensitivity to local,\n            socio-political constraints, if it is to achieve\n            collaborative dialog, and succeed in obtaining the Borrower\n            'buy-in' to its proposals; and, 4) when the Bank\n            finds it difficult to justify its support for a particular\n            sector, due to policy differences, it should - strategically\n            - weigh the benefits of maintaining a flexible form of\n            engagement against the consequences of full withdrawal.\n            Repeated sharp changes in the Bank's involvement could\n            be damaging to its credibility, and could constrain its\n            ability to seek policy reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Second Gas Development, and Gas\n            Infrastructure Development Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Second Gas\n            Development, and Gas Infrastructure Development Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/07/4993332/bangladesh-second-gas-development-gas-infrastructure-development-projects","projn":"BD-Gas Infrastructure Development -- P009533,BD-Gas Development Ii-114489 -- P009448","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Oil Refining & Gas Industry,Transport and Environment,Oil & Gas,Energy Trade,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20040803093648"},"subsc":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development,Telecommunications,Oil and gas,Central government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Information and communications,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"broad range,construction,energy\n            consumption,energy portfolio,Energy Sector,energy\n            supply,energy use,Gas,Gas Development,Gas Development\n            project,gas exports,gas field,gas field development,Gas\n            Fields,gas flow,gas industry,Gas Infrastructure,Gas\n            Infrastructure Development,gas pipeline,gas pipelines,gas\n            price,gas prices,Gas pricing,gas processing,gas\n            production,gas projects,gas reserves,gas resources,gas\n            sector,gas supplies,gas supply,Gas Transmission,Gas\n            Transmission Company,gas transmission network,gas\n            treatment,Gas Utilization,Gas Utilization\n            Study,gas-producing countries,hydrocarbons,Mineral,Natural\n            gas,natural gas prices,natural resources,offshore\n            gas,Oil,oil and gas,oil and gas sector,oil companies,Oil\n            Company,oil imports,petroleum,petroleum\n            sector,pipeline,pipelines,power generation,sustainable\n            use,transmission system,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"broad range,construction,energy\n            consumption,energy portfolio,Energy Sector,energy\n            supply,energy use,Gas,Gas Development,Gas Development\n            project,gas exports,gas field,gas field development,Gas\n            Fields,gas flow,gas industry,Gas Infrastructure,Gas\n            Infrastructure Development,gas pipeline,gas pipelines,gas\n            price,gas prices,Gas pricing,gas processing,gas\n            production,gas projects,gas reserves,gas resources,gas\n            sector,gas supplies,gas supply,Gas Transmission,Gas\n            Transmission Company,gas transmission network,gas\n            treatment,Gas Utilization,Gas Utilization\n            Study,gas-producing countries,hydrocarbons,Mineral,Natural\n            gas,natural gas prices,natural resources,offshore\n            gas,Oil,oil and gas,oil and gas sector,oil companies,Oil\n            Company,oil imports,petroleum,petroleum\n            sector,pipeline,pipelines,power generation,sustainable\n            use,transmission system,wells"}},"owner":"Knowledge and Information Servs. (IMTKI),Energy (SASDE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF020350-DANISH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF023450-CANADIAN CONSULTANT TF FOR ENVIRONMENT,TF025180-PHRD-GAS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT,TF026081-USTDA CTF,TF028184-REG.
