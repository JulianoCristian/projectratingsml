Lessons learned from the projects included:\n            There is a clear need for stronger monitoring and evaluation\n            of research projects. The lack of hard evidence about the\n            results of Competitive Grant Schemes (CGS) investments in\n            research and extension is a considerable shortcoming of all\n            but one project. In each of these countries, agricultural\n            productivity has risen since the mid 1990s, with growth\n            increasingly based on intensification rather than area\n            expansion. All institutions need a portion of the budget\n            that is core funded to cover costs of maintenance and\n            upgrading of physical and human resource infrastructure. CGS\n            usually only fund operating costs and the subprojects they\n            finance have only 2-3 years' duration. The CGS model is\n            more likely to strengthen the strongest agencies providing\n            research and extension services than it is to reduce the\n            disparities between the strong and the weak. The principle\n            of competition between alternative service providers breaks\n            down where the range of providers is limited and many of the\n            potential providers lack the skills needed to prepare viable\n            sub-project proposals."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Agricultural Technology and\n            Rural Education Project; Peru - Agricultural Research

- Agriculture Technology\n            Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The ratings for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that the model of\n            Competitive Grants is viable in the Colombian context.\n            Processes have to be public, transparent and consistent\n            throughout the life of the subproject and are the only way\n            of ensuring credibility. Modern research systems depend on a\n            wide variety of sources of technology and funding and this\n            experience in Colombia has shown that a competitive grant is\n            an effective way to leverage idle resources for the science\n            and technology sectors. Demand driven research that is\n            competitively funded runs the risk of only solving short\n            term problems, and may not allow for a strategic vision or\n            program. In the selection and approval of subprojects care\n            has to be taken that certain strategic areas are covered\n            with a critical mass of subprojects. Because of the\n            dispersion of subprojects care has to be taken that\n            experiences, progress and results are communicated both\n            horizontally and vertically across the Project. Suitable\n            environment for competitive funds: a) require an intensive\n            level of monitoring and evaluation. b) competitive funding\n            has to be accompanied with a long-term strategy of\n            sustainability for core funding of research institutions. c)\n            competitive grants are suitable instruments to reduce\n            regional inequity. d) competitive funding is a good\n            instrument to promote alliances among the different actors\n            in the system. Processes that aim to change the culture of\n            allocation and implementation of public resources in\n            technology development require time for the institutional\n            structure to understand and utilize these instruments; and\n            adopt them as permanent components of technology development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -

Traditionally, this has been\n            public sector dominated, conservative, elite and driven by\n            supply rather than demand. As part of the Government's\n            National Agricultural Technology Transfer Program, the\n            Project will achieve the following: (a) introduce a new\n            approach, in support of the National System for Agricultural\n            Technology Development and Transfer, including with measures\n            to build institutional capacity, which would promote the\n            development and testing of technical packages especially\n            appropriate for small farmers, and to divulge new\n            technology; (b) promoting private sector participation in\n            agricultural research; (c) improving the quality and\n            efficiency of agricultural research by introducing a demand\n            driven, competitive selection system that will cofinance\n            projects with universities and private and public sector\n            entities; (d) supporting decentralization of agricultural\n            research and extension activities by strengthening regional\n            centers, training agricultural extensions, and disseminating\n            information; and (e) revitalizing underused assets, both\n            physical and human, that presently exist within\n            Colombia's research services system. Research funded\n            under the Project will ultimately help to reduce rural\n            poverty, increase rural employment, and improve the\n            competitiveness of Colombia's agricultural producers.\n            The project will finance a four year program with the\n            following two components: (a) technology development and\n            adaptation; and, (b)

agricultural research culture. Traditionally, this has been\n            public sector dominated, conservative, elite and driven by\n            supply rather than demand. As part of the Government's\n            National Agricultural Technology Transfer Program, the\n            Project will achieve the following: (a) introduce a new\n            approach, in support of the National System for Agricultural\n            Technology Development and Transfer, including with measures\n            to build institutional capacity, which would promote the\n            development and testing of technical packages especially\n            appropriate for small farmers, and to divulge new\n            technology; (b) promoting private sector participation in\n            agricultural research; (c) improving the quality and\n            efficiency of agricultural research by introducing a demand\n            driven, competitive selection system that will cofinance\n            projects with universities and private and public sector\n            entities; (d) supporting decentralization of agricultural\n            research and extension activities by strengthening regional\n            centers, training agricultural extensions, and disseminating\n            information; and (e) revitalizing underused assets, both\n            physical and human, that presently exist within\n            Colombia's research services system. Research funded\n            under the Project will ultimately help to reduce rural\n            poverty, increase rural employment, and improve the\n            competitiveness of Colombia's agricultural producers.\n            The project will finance a four year program with the\n            following two components: (a) technology development and\n            adaptation; and, (b) institutional development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Agricultural Technology\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Agricultural\n            Technology Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/03/732716/colombia-agricultural-technology-development-project","projn":"CO-Agriculture Technology Development\n            Project -- P006880","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,ICT Policy and Strategies,Agricultural Research,General Technology,Health Monitoring & Evaluation","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Colombia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970311121259"},"subsc":"Sub-national government administration,Central government administration,Agricultural extension and research","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adaptation,adaptive research,agricultural\n            development,agricultural research,Agricultural\n            Technology,Agricultural Technology Development,Agricultural\n            Technology Transfer,Agriculture,Audit\n            Reports,crops,decentralization,environmentally sound\n            technologies,Environmentally Sustainable\n            Development,Equipment,Exchange Rate,Extension,Extension\n            services,extensionists,farm\n            practices,Farmers,fisheries,forestry,IDB,incomes,Irrigation,marketing,MOA,new\n            technology,NGOs,Participatory Approach,pests,plant\n            diseases,poverty alleviation,Poverty Reduction,private\n            sector,programs,public sector,quality control,research\n            projects,research results,Rural Development,rural\n            employment,rural population,rural poverty,rural\n            roads,screening,technical assistance,technicians,universities,violence,Waste"},"1":{"cdata!":"adaptation,adaptive research,agricultural\n            development,agricultural research,Agricultural\n            Technology,Agricultural Technology Development,Agricultural\n            Technology Transfer,Agriculture,Audit\n            Reports,crops,decentralization,environmentally sound\n            technologies,Environmentally Sustainable\n            Development,Equipment,Exchange Rate,Extension,Extension\n            services,extensionists,farm\n            practices,Farmers,fisheries,forestry,IDB,incomes,Irrigation,marketing,MOA,new\n            technology,NGOs,Participatory Approach,pests,plant\n            diseases,poverty alleviation,Poverty Reduction,private\n            sector,programs,public sector,quality control,research\n            projects,research results,Rural Development,rural\n            employment,rural population,rural poverty,rural\n            roads,screening,technical assistance,technicians,universities,violence,Waste"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF037975-COLOMBIA - AGRICULTURE\n            TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT,TF037071-COLOMBIA - AGRICULTURE\n            TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT,TF035851-COLOMBIA - AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGY,TF035180-COLOMBIA - AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGY,TF034541-COLOMBIA - AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGY,TF034538-COLOMBIA - AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGY,TF032886-COLOMBIA - AGRICULTURE,TF021505-WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT,TF020400-NETHERLANDS' CONSULTANTS\n            TRUST FUND","repnb":"P6575"},"facets":{}}}
