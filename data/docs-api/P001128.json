The project\n            achieved many of its objectives, institutional development\n            was modest, sustainability is likely, and the performance of\n            both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, it is important to\n            provide training and orientation to the managerial staff in\n            the areas of the use and maintenance of CAFOP facilities in\n            order to prevent inefficiency. Second, the budgetary and\n            staffing arrangements for the maintenance of equipment and\n            physical facilities are not working well in all cases and\n            some study of this situation is warranted. Third, in order\n            to retain the services of good local staff, a balance will\n            have to be reached between better remuneration for the work\n            performed and a successful integration into existing\n            structures. Finally, as a pre-condition for launching\n            project implementation, it is important to establish the\n            design of arrangements to ensure the eventual provision of\n            permanent capacity for the implementation of development programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ivory Coast -
