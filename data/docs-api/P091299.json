The\n            service providers were reluctant to enter the communities\n            based on internal financial and technical constraints as\n            well as the communities\u0092 low capacity to pay for services.\n            The sectionalized approach caused tension within the\n            communities given that at times houses along one side of the\n            road were receiving access to a new service and houses on\n            the other side of were not.
