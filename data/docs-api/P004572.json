The many lessons convey\n            mainly, that small-scale communal irrigation schemes are\n            cost effective, economically viable, and, may contribute to\n            poverty alleviation, thus, providing communal responsibility\n            is an effective way to ensure sustainable irrigation. But,\n            successful communal irrigation require clear guidelines on\n            the roles, and responsibilities of each stakeholder,\n            including a comprehensive institution building program.\n            There is the need for a national-level agreement among LGUs,\n            central agencies, and the National Irrigation Administration\n            - regarding financing arrangements, in particular, and, the\n            respective roles, including design, construction, and,\n            operation and maintenance (O&M) to be clearly defined.\n            In addition, the need to implement a self-sustaining system\n            for operation and maintenance, is paramount, to avoid\n            dependency on Government funds. Hence, the establishment of\n            earmarked O&M funds, financed from the Irrigators\n            Associations' share of service fee collection, and,\n            trust funds, financed from amortization payments by communal\n            schemes, should be seriously considered for sustained\n            communal irrigation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Second Communal Irrigation\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Second Communal\n            Irrigation Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/05/728696/philippines-second-communal-irrigation-development-project","projn":"PH-Communal Irrig.
