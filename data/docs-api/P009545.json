Among the general lessons, it is\n            conveyed that the use of Independent Panel of Experts\n            (IPOEs) is effective, provided both the implementing\n            agencies (IAs), and the IPOEs clearly understand the\n            intended terms of reference, and the IAs adequately manage\n            the panel's outputs. This reinforces, that in order to\n            ensure cost-effectiveness, and maximize the benefit of\n            technical assistance (TA), a proactive management of the\n            consultants' assignment by the contracting project\n            agency, must be enforced. Furthermore, payment terms of TA\n            contracts should be linked, as possible, to measurable\n            contract outputs, rather than relying on time-based\n            payments, to reduce potential cost overruns, and/or delayed\n            outputs. As well, international competitive bidding\n            procedures are highly advantageous, when undertaking civil\n            works in difficult physical situations, such as riverbank\n            protection, particularly when contract management operates\n            in an independent professional manner, unconstrained by\n            outside interests. Specific lessons address the need to\n            strengthen the procurement management capacity of the\n            Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), to avoid\n            fragmentation of works, by developing a core of\n            professionals within the implementing agency to supervise\n            procurement matters, including as well, built-in periodic\n            procurement audits for future designs. BWDB financial\n            management should in addition, be strengthened through\n            institutional arrangements to build capacity, assessed in\n            the context of BWDB's institutional reform program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - River Bank Protection Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - River Bank\n            Protection Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/06/1936412/bangladesh-river-bank-protection-project","projn":"BD-River Bank Protection -- P009545","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Business Environment","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02070404010188"},"subsc":"Other social services,Flood protection,Central government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,Accounting,acquisition,agricultural\n            production,Audit reports,auditors,audits,capacity\n            building,community organizations,community\n            participation,Competitive\n            Bidding,construction,contractors,cost estimates,cost\n            overruns,cost recovery,depreciation,economic\n            activity,economic analysis,employment,Environmental\n            Impact,Environmental Impact Assessment,environmental\n            impacts,environmental issues,Environmental\n            Management,erosion,Exchange Rate,fish,fisheries,Flood\n            Control,Flood Damage,flood damages,flood management,flood\n            protection,groyne,households,investment program,local\n            community,maintenance activities,market\n            prices,National,National Water Management Plan,National\n            Water Policy,National Water Resources,Natural\n            Resources,operational capacity,participatory\n            approaches,policy instruments,Present\n            Value,procurement,programs,Quality Assurance,Quality\n            Assurance Group,resource conservation,riparian,river\n            management,Rivers,sanitation services,stakeholder\n            participation,Surface Water,town,transparency,urban\n            areas,Water Development,Water Management,Water Policy,Water\n            Policy,water resource,water resource management,Water\n            Resources,water resources management,water sector,water\n            sector development,water sector investments,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,Accounting,acquisition,agricultural\n            production,Audit reports,auditors,audits,capacity\n            building,community organizations,community\n            participation,Competitive\n            Bidding,construction,contractors,cost estimates,cost\n            overruns,cost recovery,depreciation,economic\n            activity,economic analysis,employment,Environmental\n            Impact,Environmental Impact Assessment,environmental\n            impacts,environmental issues,Environmental\n            Management,erosion,Exchange Rate,fish,fisheries,Flood\n            Control,Flood Damage,flood damages,flood management,flood\n            protection,groyne,households,investment program,local\n            community,maintenance activities,market\n            prices,National,National Water Management Plan,National\n            Water Policy,National Water Resources,Natural\n            Resources,operational capacity,participatory\n            approaches,policy instruments,Present\n            Value,procurement,programs,Quality Assurance,Quality\n            Assurance Group,resource conservation,riparian,river\n            management,Rivers,sanitation services,stakeholder\n            participation,Surface Water,town,transparency,urban\n            areas,Water Development,Water Management,Water Policy,Water\n            Policy,water resource,water resource management,Water\n            Resources,water resources management,water sector,water\n            sector development,water sector investments,water supply"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF028184-REG.

A further\n            objective is to assist the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) in\n            developing permanent institutions for improved water sector\n            planning, preserving the institutional capacity developed\n            under the Flood Action Plan (FAP) and making\n            multi-disciplinary planning part of Bangladesh's normal\n            water sector planning processes. The project's\n            components are: 1) rehabilitation and construction of\n            river-bank protection works at two sites on the Brahmaputra\n            River's west bank; 2) land acquisition and a program of\n            resettlement for people displaced by project works;
