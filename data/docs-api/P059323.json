The\n            SAL's main contribution has been to help Pakistan\n            implement a strong program of reforms. As a result, the\n            Paris and London Club creditors agreed to reschedule\n            Pakistan's debt service, providing the Government with\n            much-needed breathing space. The SAL thus helped Pakistan\n            stabilize its macroeconomic position and strengthen its\n            external position. Several lessons have been drawn from this\n            project. By strengthening governance and deepening the\n            reforms in the banking and power sectors, the project has\n            helped Pakistan focus on its medium-term reform program to\n            improve human development and build a competitive\n            environment for private sector development and sustainable\n            growth. They include: 1) A series of quick-disbursing\n            single-tranche adjustment operations is an effective tool\n            for managing risks. 2) Close coordination with other\n            international financial institutions can benefit borrowers.\n            3) Adjustment operations can be implemented rapidly when the\n            client has a clear vision and a strong sense of ownership of\n            the reform program. 4) Strong field presence greatly\n            facilitated dialogue and response."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Structural Adjustment Loan
