Recovery and Reform Support Credit Program\n            (RRSC) for SDR33.4 million (US$50 million equivalent) to the\n            Republic of Mali. This stand-alone development policy\n            operation supports the authorities' efforts to (i)\n            deepen executive accountability, (ii) protect poverty\n            reduction progress made in recent years, and (iii) prepare\n            for a rapid economic recovery as the political transition\n            ends and the security situation improves. While the credit\n            will primarily translate into financing programs from the\n            emergency priority action plan 2013-14, particular attention\n            is given to the policy actions aimed at: (i) strengthening\n            controls on budget and transparency, (ii) protecting\n            pro-poor expenditures, (iii) restoring financial\n            sustainability and investment capacity in power and\n            irrigation sectors, and (iv) improving public financial and\n            investment management. The operation fully shares the\n            objectives of the World Bank Group's interim strategy\n            note for FY14-15, and is aligned with the World Bank's\n            Strategy for Africa. The operation is also part of a larger\n            regional response to the crisis in the Sahel. While Mali is\n            at the epicenter of the crisis, it is broadly understood\n            that some of its causes, and the responses, have to be found\n            at the regional Sahelian level. Thus, development policy\n            operations are also being processed in Niger and Burkina\n            Faso. A World Bank regional response, taking the form of\n            projects to strengthen resilience and promote regional\n            integration, while building knowledge on demographic and\n            spatial Sahelian challenges was also in the making by May 2013."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Recovery and Reform Support Credit Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali - Recovery and
