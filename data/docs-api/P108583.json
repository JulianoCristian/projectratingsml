Some lessons\n            learned includes: the justification of the overall outcome\n            rating for the project put more weight to International\n            Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) audits recommendations.\n            The effectiveness of this project was delayed significantly\n            for Senegal due to the multiplicity of effectiveness\n            conditions. There should therefore be a consideration for\n            the elimination of effectiveness conditions to avoid delays\n            in effectiveness by making sure that all conditions are met\n            prior to negotiations. The performance of one country during\n            implementation had a great impact on the overall performance\n            of the project. There was lack of a realistic assessment of\n            the initial cost of various activities which resulted in\n            overestimation of these activities. Similar future projects\n            should avoid any complex and over design of activities.\n            There is a need to engage and receive strong support from\n            country management units to ensure stronger ownership by the\n            countries involved and to resolve policy related an issue as\n            this was found helpful in this project. Project design\n            should include an agreed exit strategy with an action plan\n            which defines clear responsibilities during all stages of\n            implementation to ensure that each agency concerned has a\n            good grasp of its role and is committed to its implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin and Senegal - West and Central Africa\n            Air Transport
