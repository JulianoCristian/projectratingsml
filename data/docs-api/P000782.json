of petroleum prices. Specifically, the loan would\n            support the consolidation of a recently initiated financial\n            stabilization program, help lay the foundations for\n            restructuring the economy and promote the growth and\n            competitveness of the non-oil sectors. The first phase of\n            the adjustment program focuses on reinforcing public sector\n            resource management by tightening the investment budget, and\n            by limiting public sector expenditures to available\n            resources. Rationalizing the public enterprise sector\n            through liquidation, privatization, and rehabilitation.\n            Also, by instilling financial discipline and regulating the\n            relationship between the State and public enterprise.\n            Thirdly, the loan will enable initiative policies to promote\n            private sector activities, especially small and medium\n            scale. Lastly, through the reformulation of sectoral\n            policies to promote agriculture, forestry, and related\n            productive activities on an environmentally sound
