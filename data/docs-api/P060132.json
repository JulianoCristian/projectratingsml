Four primary lessons were learned.  In a\n            post conflict, country unification situation additional risk\n            analysis is appropriate to ensure that the government is\n            fully committed to the reforms proposed and the timetable\n            for the reform agenda.

The lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            baseline data on the key performance indicators that help in\n            measuring outcome and outputs should be gathered for each\n            area to be targeted by the Project. This will help first\n            establish good practices for regular and reliable data\n            collection; provide baseline data against which performance\n            can be better measured and help reduce the cost for carrying\n            out the usual impact assessment studies: (ii) through\n            confirmation of upstream and downstream activities, upfront\n            mitigation measures should be adopted. For water supply\n            subprojects proper assessment of aquifer resources need to\n            be addressed; for wastewater/sanitation subprojects,\n            existence of downstream facilities (wastewater treatment\n            facilities or other appropriate disposal facilities) should\n            be verified. (iii) an effective MIS system on monitoring\n            M&E is already in place. The systems and procedures\n            developed for monitoring, evaluation and control will need\n            to be expanded further to evaluate the periodic social\n            impact and beneficiary assessment surveys. (iv) during\n            subproject selection, strict screening of environmental\n            impacts is necessary which will also determine investment\n            needs to provide appropriate mitigation measures. (v)\n            sustainability through: (a) Financing - In order to ensure\n            sustainability, subproject selection should be based on\n            confirmation of adequate sources of funds needed from\n            government's budgetary allocation for operations and\n            maintenance of completed facilities. Also, in cases where\n            functioning of completed infrastructure is dependent upon\n            external support (other agencies, charitable trusts\n            providing equipment, furniture etc.), necessary confirmation\n            should be sought prior to start of implementation; (b)\n            Community participation - community involvement is crucial\n            in subproject identification and preparation and in securing\n            community contribution in cash or kind. This helps build a\n            sense of ownership which provides additional assurance on\n            sustainability for future operations and maintenance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen, Republic of - Second Public Works Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen, Republic of - Second\n            Public Works Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/12/2850222/yemen-republic-second-public-works-project","projn":"RY-Public Works II -- P060132","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Urban Services to the Poor,Health Economics & Finance,Town Water Supply and Sanitation","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Yemen, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040107141606"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Roads and highways,Other social services,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General education sector","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to services,adverse effects,basic\n            services,capacity building,Central government,clean\n            water,communities,community contribution,community\n            development,Community Infrastructure,community\n            involvement,community participation,construction\n            industry,contract management,cost effectiveness,counterpart\n            funding,decision making,drinking water,economic\n            analysis,financial viability,girls,health,health care,health\n            sector,households,immunization,income,infrastructure\n            services,investment costs,investment decisions,investment\n            program,isolation,living conditions,local\n            governments,malaria,medical care,Performance\n            indicators,private sector,public sector,Public Works,quality\n            of service,quality of service delivery,Roads,rural\n            water,sanitation,sanitation,Sanitation\n            Authority,school,schools,screening,secondary cities,service\n            delivery,service provider,service quality,social\n            development,social\n            services,surgery,unemployment,vaccination,vaccinations,water,water\n            consumption,Water resource,Water resource management,water\n            supply,water user,wells,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to services,adverse effects,basic\n            services,capacity building,Central government,clean\n            water,communities,community contribution,community\n            development,Community Infrastructure,community\n            involvement,community participation,construction\n            industry,contract management,cost effectiveness,counterpart\n            funding,decision making,drinking water,economic\n            analysis,financial viability,girls,health,health care,health\n            sector,households,immunization,income,infrastructure\n            services,investment costs,investment decisions,investment\n            program,isolation,living conditions,local\n            governments,malaria,medical care,Performance\n            indicators,private sector,public sector,Public Works,quality\n            of service,quality of service delivery,Roads,rural\n            water,sanitation,sanitation,Sanitation\n            Authority,school,schools,screening,secondary cities,service\n            delivery,service provider,service quality,social\n            development,social\n            services,surgery,unemployment,vaccination,vaccinations,water,water\n            consumption,Water resource,Water resource management,water\n            supply,water user,wells,workers"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF037102-YEMEN - SANA'S WS.,\n            NAT'L COM.
