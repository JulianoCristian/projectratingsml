Zoonoses Control Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Zoonoses Control Project\n            for Nepal were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was Moderate, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: Government commitment to the continuation of the\n            investment made through other HPAI projects was a crucial\n            factor in achieving NZCP\u0092s PDOs in spite of the very short\n            implementation period (2 years according to PAD. The\n            Contributing factors to this success is the dedication of\n            the Project Manager and his close collaboration with the\n            WB\u0092s Team and continuity of the AICP project management and\n            staff; commitment of the GoN and its provision of advance\n            resources to allow for project startup and planning; and the\n            recruitment of capable subject matter consultants specially\n            the M & E senior consultant. Centralized and strong M\n            & E and Planning Unit is crucial for effective technical\n            support. The centralized system at the PMU level in\n            Kathmandu provided two benefits; reduction of transaction\n            cost and enhancement of intersectoral collaboration; both\n            being crucial for the development of a cost effective OH\n            approach. The KAP survey could be a strategic M&E tool.\n            Intersectoral collaboration and high level GoN commitment\n            are crucial for the development and installation of the One\n            Health Approach. Keeping just one agency as the primary\n            implementing partner, which is responsible for streamlining,\n            consolidating and submitting the budgets requests,\n            procurement plans, and audit reports have mitigated many\n            coordination issues and delays. The concluding workshop\n            organized by Massey University in Bhutan played an\n            instrumental role in bringing the key regional stakeholders\n            together and raising high level awareness on OH approach.\n            Similar events are necessary in order to reinforce the need\n            to form and institutionalize the OH approach to address\n            zoonotic diseases."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Zoonoses Control Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Zoonoses Control
