Some lessons learned included: the Bank played\n            a catalytic role in supporting an innovative initiative by\n            taking high risks. The project documents indicate that at\n            initiation, with the exception of Joint United Nations\n            Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), other development partners did\n            not show interest in joining the project. On the other hand,\n            UNAIDS, on behalf of other United Nations (UN) agencies,\n            provided a solid technical and financial support to bring\n            the project concept to fruition. Strong partnership between\n            the Bank and UNAIDS was a critical factor in the design and\n            delivery of the project. It is critical that strong\n            partnership is built prior to initiating the project design.\n            Emphasizing the facilitation and coordination role of the\n            Executive Secretariat was essential for ensuring that civil\n            society organizations be empowered. Contracting out the\n            fiduciary and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) aspects of\n            project implementation to a management consultant proved\n            highly positive. The Executive Secretariat focused heavily\n            on community development, training staff, and disseminating\n            management tools. This was the recipe for success and highly\n            appreciated by all stakeholders. Preparation of the baseline\n            survey was delayed for a variety of reasons, including two\n            failed attempts to contract consultants before project\n            appraisal and, the delay to set up the institutional\n            framework for project implementation. In the absence of a\n            survey before appraisal of the project, it was difficult to\n            set a realistic value for project indicators in the project\n            appraisal document (PAD)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - HIV/AIDS Abidjan - Lagos Transport\n            Corridor Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - HIV/AIDS Abidjan - Lagos\n            Transport

- HIV/AIDS Abidjan - Lagos Transport\n            Corridor Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project's objective is to\n            increase access along the Abidjan-Lagos transport corridor,\n            to HIV/AIDS prevention, basic treatment, support and care\n            services by underserved vulnerable groups. Particular\n            attention is to be given to the transport sector workers,\n            the migrant population, commercial sex workers and the local\n            populations living along the corridor, especially at the\n            border towns. The project has the following three\n            components: Component 1) will support: (a) the\n            implementation of an integrated HIV/AIDS Information,\n            Education, and Communication/Behavior change communication\n            (IEC/BCC) policy along the transport corridor; and (b) the\n            social marketing of condoms in the 8 geographic border\n            communities and along the entire corridor. Both public\n            sector and civil society organizations including NGOs and\n            the private sector will participate in the implementation of\n            both parts of this component. Component 2) will support: (a)\n            strengthening of public and private (where applicable)\n            health care facilities identified along the corridor to\n            provide services in the areas of Voluntary Counseling and\n            Testing (VCT), treatment of Sexually Transmitted Infections\n            (STIs) (with promotion of the syndromic approach) and\n            HIV/AIDS opportunistic infections; and (b) the provision of\n            grants to Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), including NGOs\n            and the private sector, to undertake community based\n            initiatives in HIV/AIDS care and support and; (c) support\n            the disposal of medical waste related to the project. Due to\n            the complexity of the logistical and organizational\n            requirements for anti-retroviral drugs, this project, with\n            its regional nature and type of target groups, will not\n            provide these drugs to the target groups. The project will\n            also support the collection and analysis of information (not\n            including private patient identifiable information) on\n            patterns of utilization of HIV/AIDS treatment, care and\n            support services along the corridor. Component 3) will\n            support: (a) the development of strong HIV/AIDS\n            inter-country coordination and partnerships among the\n            governments and other project stakeholders of the five\n            participating countries; (b) capacity building among\n            implementing partners and (c) the implementation of\n            transport sector policies favorable to arresting the erosion\n            of social capital, including for smooth movement of\n            commercial traffic along the corridor."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin -

It\n            suggests as well that the countries improve the processes\n            for medical waste management in health facilities at the\n            project site by supplying equipment for collection and\n            storage, constructing incinerators and borrow pits for\n            burning and burying waste, and providing protective clothing\n            to health personnel. Also the population will be sensitized\n            to the dangers posed by contact with medical waste, and\n            health and support personnel as well as patients will\n            receive training. The plan also calls for identifying all\n            the actors, determining their domains for intervention, and\n            designating responsibilities. Contractors will be engaged\n            for waste collection and disposal. Best practices will be\n            identified and followed.
