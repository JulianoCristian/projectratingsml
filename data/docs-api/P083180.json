Some lessons learned include:\n            capacity building for results: the lack of capacity in\n            Angola during the period of project implementation needs to\n            be recognized and a review of performance and results\n            achieved needs to take this firmly into account.\n            Implementation arrangements: the establishment of a PCU in\n            the Ministry of Health (MoH), and not the National AIDS\n            Council Multi - Sectoral AIDS project (as with other MAP\n            projects) was positive and relevant at the time. It allowed\n            the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) to develop strong links\n            with each of the three disease programs. Integration and\n            efficiency: looking ahead Angola should focus more on\n            integration of disease specific programs and do more to\n            address system wide constraints. Also further attention\n            should be given to the efficiency and cost effectiveness of\n            services delivered, to maximize value for money.\n            Geographical targeting: any geographical targeting of most\n            in need populations by the project should be documented and\n            accompanied by a clear rationale. Flexibility but with a\n            focus on desired results: the project provided a good degree\n            of flexibility to respond to the rapidly evolving needs and\n            also provided support to fill critical gaps in the national\n            plans. However in supporting new activities the project gave\n            up and missed opportunities to fund some critical\n            interventions (in the original plans) which would have\n            provided a more direct contribution to the projects desired\n            results. (M and E) Monitoring and Evaluation. The Angolan\n            context requires that special attention and support be given\n            in all projects to M and E, especially to establish the\n            baseline and end line data for the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Angola - HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis\n            Control (HAMSET) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Angola - HIV/AIDS, Malaria and\n            Tuberculosis Control (HAMSET) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/12/15650512/angola-hivaids-malaria-tuberculosis-control-hamset-project","projn":"AO-Hiv/Aids, Malaria And Tb Control Project\n            (Hamset) -- P083180","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Early Child and Children's Health,Health Economics & Finance,HIV AIDS,Adolescent Health","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Angola","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20120123003344"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, adults,\n            aged, AIDS epidemic, births, blood banks, Blood safety, case\n            management, Child Health, child mortality, Child Survival,\n            cities, clinics, community development, Community\n            participation, condoms, detection, diagnosis, Disease,\n            Disease Control, economic analysis, Endemic Diseases,\n            epidemics, Epidemiology, essential drugs, FAS, Financial\n            Analysis, Health Care, health facilities, health\n            information, health information systems, health sector,\n            health services, HIV, HIV positive, HIV prevention, HIV\n            transmission, hospitals, Human Development, Human\n            Immunodeficiency Virus, Immune Deficiency, Immunization,\n            Immunodeficiency, Infant Mortality, Infection, infectious\n            diseases, information systems, innovation, institutional\n            capacity, intervention, Lessons learned, live births,\n            MALARIA, Malaria Control, malaria prevention, mass media,\n            Maternal and Child Health, Maternal Mortality, MCH,\n            Medicine, midwifes, morbidity, morbidity and mortality,\n            nurses, opportunistic infections, parents, partnership,\n            patients, Pharmacists, physicians, pregnant women,\n            prevalence, private sector, project implementation, Project\n            Preparation, Public Health, Public Sector, rehabilitation,\n            Reproductive health, risk groups, safe blood, safe\n            motherhood, safety, screening, sex workers, social\n            marketing, social services, transaction costs, Treatment,\n            TUBERCULOSIS, TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL, Waste, Waste Management, widowers"}},"owner":"Hlth, Nutr & Pop.
