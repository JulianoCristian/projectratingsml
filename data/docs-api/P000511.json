The principal objectives of this phase of the\n            program are to improve resource use in two important areas\n            of the economy; public finance and the cotton sector. The\n            measures in public finance are designed to increase\n            budgetary revenues, augment development oriented current\n            expenditures, and improve investment programming. The\n            economic and financial viability of the cotton sector will\n            be improved through measures to reduce costs of the cotton\n            parastatal, improve extension and research, strengthen the\n            sector's institutional set-up, and reform pricing\n            policy. The Financial Rehabilitation Credit also resolve the\n            problem of COTONTCHAD's arrears to the banking system.\n            In addition, the program includes studies to prepare future\n
