Instead of growing wheat or barley,\n            thousands of the country's small farmers have been\n            planting crops that need more water but ultimately yield\n            more cash. The transformation comes thanks to investments\n            supported by the World Bank over many years in the\n            country's irrigation and water rights systems.\n            Investments have also been made in building new, gravity-fed\n            irrigation systems that do not need pumps and save a lot of\n            money on fuel, almost $ 35 million. As the global financial\n            crisis hit, the World Bank invested emergency funds for\n            renovation of around 90 km of sections of the main Armavir\n            and Talin, helping to create 12,000 temporary jobs. As a\n            result, water losses in two important main canals have\n            reduced from almost 23 percent to 7 percent. That allows\n            7,000 more hectares to be irrigated. A follow-up project has\n            already been topped up so that more canals in six provinces\n            can be repaired, encouraging further agricultural\n            development and the possibility of increased incomes for\n            Armenia's farmers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"The new landscape of Armenia's agriculture"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"The new landscape of\n            Armenia's agriculture"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/05/24428494/new-landscape-armenias-agriculture","count":"Armenia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Transportation,Information and communications,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"wells, water users associations, pumping,\n            water management, irrigation systems, water projects, water\n            needs, irrigation, wua, water user, transparency, irrigation\n            networks, meters, orchards, water users, water resource\n            management, irrigation rehabilitation, dams, irrigation\n            infrastructure, pumps, access to irrigation, agricultural\n            development, water, canals, programs, water resource,\n            irrigation development, reservoirs, water fees, irrigation\n            water, farmers, irrigation canals, water losses, bilateral\n            agreement, pumping stations, water rights, gravity, artesian wells"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"majtheme":"Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Environment and natural resource management,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Financial and private sector development","projn":"AM-Irrigation Rehabilitation Emergency\n            Project -- P116681,AM-Additional Financing To Irep -- P126509,AM-Irrigation Development Additional\n            Financing -- P105171,AM-Irrigation Dam Safety 2 Project -- P088499,AM-Irrigation Development Project -- P055022,AM-Irrigation Dam Safety -- P064879,AM-Irrigation Rehabilitation Project -- P008277","topic":"Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Agricultural Innovation Systems m1327588 196,Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171,Agricultural Credit m1327605 1962","docty":"Working Paper","subtopic":"Water Use,Irrigation and Drainage,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water Supply and Systems","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b082e1d99d_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","theme":"Rural policies and institutions,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural policies and institutions,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Natural disaster management,Rural services and infrastructure,Water resource management,Rural policies and institutions,Other social protection and risk management,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Natural disaster management,Rural services and infrastructure,Infrastructure services for private sector development,Water resource management,Rural services and infrastructure,Water resource management","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Agricultural Innovation Systems m1327588 196,Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171,Agricultural Credit m1327605 1962","owner":"Water - GP (GWADR)","trustfund":"TF025793-PHRD-IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT,BBFAO-BB FAO,TF029549-PHRD-AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT\n            SERVICES PROJ.(BANK-EXEC.),TF036016-ECA REGION - WATER AND\n            AGRICULTURE (ARMENIA, UZBEKISTAN),BBFAO-BB FAO,TF032683-ARMENIA - IRRIGATION\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF031092-ARMENIA IRRIGATION REHABILITATION,TF033283-ECA REGION (LITHUANIA AND\n            LATVIA) AGRICULTURE DEV.

Both the Bank and the borrower performances were\n            highly satisfactory. The main lessons learned were: (1)\n            Assessment of dam safety is complicated. For countries such\n            as Armenia, to identify a problem in a dam, assess its\n            potential impact, and propose measures to improve dam safety\n            are difficult. It needs a deep level of experience which\n            most often can be provided largely by international experts.\n            (2) Training is essential for the staff of the project\n            implementation unit and Water Supply Agency (WSA) on dam\n            safety aspects especially as this is a very specialized\n            field. (3) Establishing a separate dam agency for operation\n            and maintenance or a separate unit within the WSA is\n            recommendable because dam operation and maintenance is a\n            very specialized task which requires significant experience\n            and high professional skills. (4) Improving dam safety\n            promotes private investment downstream the rehabilitated\n            dams as result of potentially more reliable water supply and\n            more effective safety structures. (5) Improvement of dam\n            management and optimization of water utilization is still\n            needed in the country. This would involve computer based\n            operation and maintenance and may be construction of new\n            dams especially on the rivers which have the potential for\n            cascade dams."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Dam Safety Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Armenia - Dam Safety

If it is not watered on\n            time - and 10 to 12 times until the autumn harvest - its\n            apples remain small and fall to ground without ever\n            ripening. This is a lesson Armenian farmers learned the hard\n            way when the country\u0092s irrigation system disintegrated under\n            the weight of management chaos and physical neglect\n            following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Erratic water\n            supplies and decrepit canals threatened the livelihoods not\n            only of apple growers but farmers all over the country: 80\n            percent of Armenia\u0092s agricultural output comes from\n            irrigated land. When their orchards died, some farmers in\n            the Ararat valley, the country\u0092s rich-soiled agricultural\n            food basket, were forced to switch to wheat, a less valuable\n            crop which can make do with rain. So today, when orchards\n            are making a come-back, those who revived Armenia\u0092s\n            irrigation system are justifiably proud. Each new sapling is\n            a sign of farmers\u0092 trust that renovated water canals and\n            well-managed water users\u0092 associations will keep the apple\n            business alive."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Water on demand helps farmers\n            expand their orchards"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Armenia - Water on demand helps\n            farmers expand their orchards"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/03/23979784/armenia-water-demand-helps-farmers-expand-orchards","count":"Armenia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services,Information and communications,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Access to irrigation, agricultural output,\n            canals, Cost recovery, covering, cut off, drip irrigation,\n            farmer, Farmers, food basket, irrigation, Irrigation\n            Development, management of water, Orchards, rain,\n            transparency, Water Association, water associations, Water\n            Reservoirs, water sector, water sector development, water\n            supplies, water users, Water Users Associations"}},"majtheme":"Financial and private sector development,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Rural development,Environment and natural resource management,Social protection and risk management","projn":"AM-Irrigation Dam Safety -- P064879,AM-Irrigation Development Project -- P055022,AM-Irrigation Rehabilitation Project -- P008277,AM-Irrigation Dam Safety 2 Project -- P088499","topic":"Rural Poverty and Livelihoods m1326688 1947,Governance m1327255 831,Poverty Measurement and Analysis m1326941 707,Water Supply and Sanitation m1327240 1199,Water Supply m1326961 138","subtopic":"Water Supply and Systems,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Rural Poverty Reduction","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction,Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation","entityids":{"entityid":"000470435_20150210103946"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Sub-national government administration,Law and justice,Water supply,Other social services,Telecommunications,Roads and highways,Irrigation and drainage,Central government administration","theme":"Infrastructure services for private sector development,Rural policies and institutions,Participation and civic engagement,Other social protection and risk management,Water resource management,Rural services and infrastructure,Natural disaster management","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction,Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Rural Poverty and Livelihoods m1326688 1947,Governance m1327255 831,Poverty Measurement and Analysis m1326941 707,Water Supply and Sanitation m1327240 1199,Water Supply m1326961 138","owner":"Water - GP (GWADR)","Environmental Category":["B"],"trustfund":"BBFAO-BB FAO,TF031092-ARMENIA IRRIGATION REHABILITATION,TF032000-ARMENNIA - IRRIGATION REHABILITATION,TF032683-ARMENIA - IRRIGATION\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF033283-ECA REGION (LITHUANIA AND\n            LATVIA) AGRICULTURE DEV.

- Dam Safety Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Three complete dam failures occurred in\n            Armenia in 1974, 1979, and 1994 respectively. All reported\n            accidents could have been avoided if proper surveillance and\n            operation and Maintenance procedures were in place. Such\n            observations suggest that other failures cannot be rules out\n            if the situation of dam safety in Armenia is allowed to\n            remain out of control. Considering that no dam is reported\n            to have a functioning instrumentation system and that\n            country-wide around 460,000 people are at risk, the\n            situation should be regarded as an emergency. Accordingly,\n            the Dam Safety Project aims to protect the population and\n            the socio-economic infrastructure downstream of the dams\n            facing the highest risk of failure. This project has two\n            main components. The first component supports repair work on\n            primary irrigation dams including design and supervision,\n            field tests, civil works, hydraulic steel structures.\n            Rehabilitation consists of upstream protection works,\n            spillway structural repairs, leakage reduction, and\n            irrigation/bottom outlet repair. The second component\n            prepares, operates, and supervises dam safety plans for\n            operation and maintenance and an emergency preparedness\n            plan; finances dam safety site installations, which include\n            instruments and monitoring devices and early warning\n            systems; strengthens the capacity of the Dam Maintenance\n            Enterprise; and supports safety investigations into all\n            remaining dams in Armenia."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Dam Safety Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Armenia - Dam Safety Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/05/439719/armenia-dam-safety-project","projn":"AM-Irrigation Dam Safety -- P064879","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Water Resources Law,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Engineering,Health Economics & Finance,Water Law","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Armenia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99061205302685"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accidents,dam failures,Dam Safety,dam safety\n            projects,dams,drainage,Economic\n            Analysis,engineers,Environmental issues,Environmental\n            Management,environmental\n            studies,erosion,expenditures,flexibility,floods,hazards,income,international\n            standards,Intervention,irrigated\n            agriculture,Irrigation,irrigation water,low income,power\n            generation,private sector,programs,quality\n            control,reservoirs,Riparian,rivers,safety\n            measures,spillways,structures,unsafe dams,water\n            conveyance,water flow,Water Resources,water storage,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"accidents,dam failures,Dam Safety,dam safety\n            projects,dams,drainage,Economic\n            Analysis,engineers,Environmental issues,Environmental\n            Management,environmental\n            studies,erosion,expenditures,flexibility,floods,hazards,income,international\n            standards,Intervention,irrigated\n            agriculture,Irrigation,irrigation water,low income,power\n            generation,private sector,programs,quality\n            control,reservoirs,Riparian,rivers,safety\n            measures,spillways,structures,unsafe dams,water\n            conveyance,water flow,Water Resources,water storage,water supply"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"1":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"2":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"3":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"}},"repnb":"19362"},"facets":{}}}
