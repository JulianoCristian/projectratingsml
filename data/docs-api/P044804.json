In order to reduce poverty and\n            unemployment, and to support the development of rural\n            economy and expansion of alternative income earning\n            opportunities, the World Bank and the Government of Latvia\n            launched the rural development project late 1998. Under the\n            agriculture development project only commercial credits were\n            issued, while the goal of the second project is to give\n            assistance also to those who need special support to access\n            commercial credits for the first time. Alongside with the\n            credit line, financing under the rural development project\n            was assigned also to drafting the rural development policy\n            and has been used in building a national integrated\n            computerized land register.

Lessons learned suggest that\n            for successful rural finance, four key elements play a\n            significant role: legally based property ownership;\n            functional legal systems; functional financial institutions;\n            and, a system of effective farm advisory and business\n            development support. To this end, prerequisites, such as the\n            development of a property registration system, land markets,\n            collateral registration, and mortgages, should be\n            synchronized for the development of physical assets, and\n            financial markets. However, in the provision of financial\n            subsidies to the rural sector - through innovative hybrid\n            grant-loans - such loans should be restricted to first-time\n            borrowers only, with the understanding that the subsidy is a\n            one-time catalyst, and not a recurring government handout.\n            Additionally, tying the grant to a bank loan, conditions\n            sub-borrowers to the discipline of loan payments, allowing\n            the establishment of a credit history.
