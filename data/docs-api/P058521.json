Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) need for high quality feasibility\n            studies for preparation of investments within an overall\n            plan that is agreed by the stakeholders, and a transparent\n            criteria for selection of schemes; 2) sector reforms and\n            restructuring should be based on high quality analytical\n            work, meaningful consultation and participation of\n            stakeholders, and should be backed by political commitment;\n            3) design of sector restructuring and the pace of its\n            implementation should be owned and endorsed by the major\n            stakeholders; and 4) the success of Financial Management\n            Information System (FMIS) indicates that pilots for\n            demonstration, and familiarization of the staff with new\n            technologies, should be carried out before introducing a\n            major change in business processes and sophisticated\n

There are seven project\n            components. The first rehabilitates high voltage\n            transmission network lines started under the Second Electric\n            Power Reconstruction Project (report no. 20167). The second\n            component finances reconstruction of key transmission\n            substations. The third component establishes a supervisory\n            control and data acquisition system and associated\n            telecommunications facilities. The fourth component funds\n            investments at hydropower stations to improve safety and\n            availabilty. The fifth component makes investments in\n            thermal power stations to control pollution. The sixth\n            component supports distribution substation investments\n            focusing on areas identified for refugee return, heavily\n            damaged and cut-off areas which have little or no\n            electricity supply, areas with war damage where many\n            connections are of a temporary nature and power supply is\n            unreliable and unsafe, and areas with seriously overloaded\n            networks, due to refugee resettlement. The seventh component\n            provides technical assistance and training in support of\n            procurement and implementation of the physical components,\n            among other sub-components."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Third Electric\n            Power Reconstruction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Third\n            Electric Power Reconstruction Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/05/1346278/bosnia-herzegovina-third-electric-power-reconstruction-project","projn":"BA-Electric Power Reconstruction 3 Project\n            -- P058521","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Energy and Poverty Alleviation,Energy Technology & Transmission,Power & Energy Conversion,Banks & Banking Reform,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01060904004220"},"subsc":"Power,Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to electricity,Accounting,accounting\n            standards,auditors,audits,availability of\n            electricity,banking system,coal,coal sector,Cost Benefit\n            Analysis,dams,deficits,distribution companies,distribution\n            losses,distribution systems,economic activity,economies of\n            scale,EIB,Electric Power,Electric Power\n            Industry,Electricity,Electricity consumption,electricity\n            industry,Electricity Policy,electricity supply,electricity\n            tariff,emissions,employment,Energy Sector,Environmental\n            Management,environmental protection,Exchange Rate,Financial\n            Management,FISCAL YEAR,fuel,grid,high\n            voltage,imports,income,insulators,internal\n            controls,International Accounting Standards,Key performance\n            indicators,kilowatt hour,laws,legislation,LRMC,management\n            information systems,Management Reports,marginal\n            cost,mines,operating costs,pollution,pollution control,power\n            companies,power company,power demand,power\n            distribution,power generation,Power Industry,Power\n            Plant,power projects,power sector,Power sector reform,power\n            sector restructuring,power stations,power supply,power\n            system,power transmission,power transmission\n            system,privatization,regulatory\n            framework,savings,Subsidiary,supply of power,Technical\n            assistance,thermal power plants,thermal power\n            stations,transmission costs,Transmission of Electricity,voltage"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to electricity,Accounting,accounting\n            standards,auditors,audits,availability of\n            electricity,banking system,coal,coal sector,Cost Benefit\n            Analysis,dams,deficits,distribution companies,distribution\n            losses,distribution systems,economic activity,economies of\n            scale,EIB,Electric Power,Electric Power\n            Industry,Electricity,Electricity consumption,electricity\n            industry,Electricity Policy,electricity supply,electricity\n            tariff,emissions,employment,Energy Sector,Environmental\n            Management,environmental protection,Exchange Rate,Financial\n            Management,FISCAL YEAR,fuel,grid,high\n            voltage,imports,income,insulators,internal\n            controls,International Accounting Standards,Key performance\n            indicators,kilowatt hour,laws,legislation,LRMC,management\n            information systems,Management Reports,marginal\n            cost,mines,operating costs,pollution,pollution control,power\n            companies,power company,power demand,power\n            distribution,power generation,Power Industry,Power\n            Plant,power projects,power sector,Power sector reform,power\n            sector restructuring,power stations,power supply,power\n            system,power transmission,power transmission\n            system,privatization,regulatory\n            framework,savings,Subsidiary,supply of power,Technical\n            assistance,thermal power plants,thermal power\n            stations,transmission costs,Transmission of Electricity,voltage"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF038816-BOSNIA - SUPERVISION OF POWER\n            SECTOR PROJECTS,TF039744-BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA - THIRD\n            ELECTRIC POWER RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT,TF039162-BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA - THIRD\n            ELECTRIC POWER RECONSTRUCTION,TF037343-BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA - ELEC.
