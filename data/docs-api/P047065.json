Lessons drawn from the\n            project experience convey the following: 1) A project with\n            mutually reinforcing components should secure financing of\n            all components at the project's inception, i.e., when\n            implementation of one, or more components is dependent on\n            the completion, or substantial implementation of other\n            components to succeed. In this case, while the design of the\n            three mutually reinforcing components - on-lending to\n            micro-enterprises, technical assistance (TA) to banks, and\n            TA to micro-enterprises - was sound, its sequencing did not\n            enable the TA components to be linked effectively with the\n            on-lending component. Instead, coordination in the delivery\n            of assistance should have ensured that training, and\n            counseling services to be provided, reinforced and supported\n            the small business lending programs. 2) Projects that are\n            largely managed by the private sector, should require\n            explicit arrangements with the borrower, in order to monitor\n            social indicators, e.g., job creation. Such arrangements\n            could have allowed better assessment of the public good\n            element of the project, and ensured greater objectivity in\n            assessing performance, since it can be argued that\n            commercial banks have little incentive to collect, or\n            intensively monitor job creation data. 3) Commitment by\n            senior management of the participating banks was not secured\n            at the outset (in spite of Bank discussions reiterating that\n            further disbursements be conditional on actions by\n            management, such as developing a project coordinating\n            strategy), which precluded the full advantage of TA, and the\n            appropriate focus on business actions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza -
