ICICI\n            remains a credit worthy borrower and it is a financial\n            intermediary through which the Bank can continue to play an\n            important role in providing assistance to Indian industry.\n            The amount of the loan has been proposed in relation to\n            ICICI's financing requirements. The use of the proposed\n            loan would be limited to expenditures abroad; the terms\n            would follow those of recent Bank loans to development\n            finance companies, including the standard commitment charge.\n            As in the previous loan, only those projects which need more\n            than US $4 million of ICICI's resources, including Bank\n            funds, will require the approval of the Bank."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Tenth Industrial Credit and\n            Investment Corporation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Tenth Industrial Credit\n            and Investment Corporation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1973/05/1558018/india-tenth-industrial-credit-investment-corporation-project","projn":"IN-Dfc-Icici X -- P009675","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,International Terrorism & Counterterrorism","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101902204035"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"affiliate,Agricultural\n            Credit,Agriculture,arable land,autonomy,balance of\n            payments,Bank lending,Bank\n            loans,bid,bidding,borrowing,Capital Expenditures,capital\n            goods,capital markets,capital requirements,Coal,Commercial\n            banks,Debt,devaluation,Domestic Investment,economic\n            analysis,economic criteria,economic development,economic\n            rate of return,employment,exchange rate,exchange\n            rates,EXPORTS,external capital requirements,financial\n            institutions,financial services,FISCAL\n            YEAR,forecasts,foreign capital,foreign currency,foreign\n            exchange,Foreign shareholders,GDP,GNP,GNP PER\n            CAPITA,Imports,industrialization,Insurance,interest\n            rate,Labor Force,lender of last resort,liquidity,Market\n            Prices,merchant banking,Oil,Portfolio,portfolios,Reserve\n            Bank of India,resource\n            mobilization,Telecommunications,tenders,term finance,Value Added"},"1":{"cdata!":"affiliate,Agricultural\n            Credit,Agriculture,arable land,autonomy,balance of\n            payments,Bank lending,Bank\n            loans,bid,bidding,borrowing,Capital Expenditures,capital\n            goods,capital markets,capital requirements,Coal,Commercial\n            banks,Debt,devaluation,Domestic Investment,economic\n            analysis,economic criteria,economic development,economic\n            rate of return,employment,exchange rate,exchange\n            rates,EXPORTS,external capital requirements,financial\n            institutions,financial services,FISCAL\n            YEAR,forecasts,foreign capital,foreign currency,foreign\n            exchange,Foreign shareholders,GDP,GNP,GNP PER\n            CAPITA,Imports,industrialization,Insurance,interest\n            rate,Labor Force,lender of last resort,liquidity,Market\n            Prices,merchant banking,Oil,Portfolio,portfolios,Reserve\n            Bank of India,resource\n            mobilization,Telecommunications,tenders,term finance,Value Added"}},"owner":"Finance & PSD Unit (SASFP)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"P1269"},"facets":{}}}
