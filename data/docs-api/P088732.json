Bank support to\n            national programs in a country like Mexico, with\n            well-established rules about funding and targeting of public\n            resources, must be based on the Bank's endorsement of\n            the Program's rules at the time of approval and not on\n            the expectation of making substantive changes to these\n            rules. Considering the potential gains from Bank support to\n            the PJERFT Program, the Bank-financed pilot Project should\n            have been restricted to a handful of states at the most,\n            with intensive monitoring and supervision, and effective\n            isolation from national political pressures. Target\n            beneficiaries of access to land projects need to be well\n            identified to ensure project sustainability. This type of\n            project should not target the poorest segments of the rural\n            population. To be sustainable over time, the target\n            population should have proven farming experience and an\n            entrepreneurial approach to production and marketing. The\n            Project's performance and impact was clearly enhanced\n            when young farmers and their communities could benefit from\n            the additional support of state-level institutions or local\n            governments in a coordinated fashion with the PJERFT\n            Program. Unfortunately, this happened only in a small number\n            of cases. The establishment of new agro-enterprises requires\n            the provision of high quality technical services for an\n            extended period of time. The certification system set up\n            under the Project was not effective in ensuring high quality\n            of technical services. The training phase should focus on\n            the validation of several viable technological packages, so\n            that potential young entrepreneurs can learn and experiment\n            with various options, rather than promoting a single\n            business model."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Access to Land for Young Farmers\n            Pilot
