The\n            project successfully achieved its physical objectives, its\n            impact on institutional development was marginally\n            successful, and sustainability is likely. However, both the\n            Bank and Borrower performed less than satisfactorily\n            overall. Several lessons can be learned from this project.\n            First, the successful operation of the Marsyangdi plant\n            suggests that the detailed planning, execution, and\n            monitoring of operation and maintenance carried out in this\n            plant should be applied in other facilities in NEA's\n            system. Second, projects with large, lumpy physical\n            components should be submitted to Board consideration only\n            after bidding for the main components has taken place.\n            Third, the project illustrates the fact that borrowers and\n            beneficiaries tend to own physical project components of IDA\n            projects more clearly than institutional ones. Fourth, a new\n            strategy in line with the current power sector policy\n            guidelines of the Bank Group needs to be developed. Fifth,\n            IDA created a precedent that when HMG and NEA were not in\n            compliance with their commitments, these covenants were\n            shifted to the next projects. Lastly, IDA should ensure that\n            the necessity to undertake rehabilitation and restoration of\n            livelihood of project affected families be accepted as a\n            principle by HMG."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Marsyangdi Hydroelectric Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Marsyangdi Hydroelectric\n            Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/05/733522/nepal-marsyangdi-hydroelectric-power-project","projn":"NP-Power II (Marsyangdi -- P010200","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Development Economics & Aid Effectiveness,Business in Development,Business Environment","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Nepal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961214140403"},"subsc":"(Historic)Electric power and other energy adjustment","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,accountability,accounting,accounts\n            receivable,Acquisition,ADB,Aid,Aide Memoire,Audited\n            Accounts,auditing,auditors,autonomy,balance\n            sheet,billing,coal,contractors,cost containment,cost\n            estimates,cost overruns,cost savings,debt,development\n            programs,Economic Development,environmental\n            guidelines,expenditure,exports,financial covenants,financial\n            performance,Fiscal Year,imports,institution\n            building,institutional development,internal cash\n            generation,International Development,LRMC,Marginal\n            Cost,market value,net imports,operating costs,operating\n            expenditures,operating income,power\n            plants,procurement,revenue\n            covenants,sales,savings,Subsidiary,Sustainability,Technical\n            Assistance,valuation of fixed assets,willingness to pay"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,accountability,accounting,accounts\n            receivable,Acquisition,ADB,Aid,Aide Memoire,Audited\n            Accounts,auditing,auditors,autonomy,balance\n            sheet,billing,coal,contractors,cost containment,cost\n            estimates,cost overruns,cost savings,debt,development\n            programs,Economic Development,environmental\n            guidelines,expenditure,exports,financial covenants,financial\n            performance,Fiscal Year,imports,institution\n            building,institutional development,internal cash\n            generation,International Development,LRMC,Marginal\n            Cost,market value,net imports,operating costs,operating\n            expenditures,operating income,power\n            plants,procurement,revenue\n            covenants,sales,savings,Subsidiary,Sustainability,Technical\n            Assistance,valuation of fixed assets,willingness to pay"}},"owner":"SAS","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"15653"},"722801":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1984/05/722801/nepal-marsyangdi-hydroelectric-power-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1984/05/722801/nepal-marsyangdi-hydroelectric-power-project","new_url":"1984/05/722801/nepal-marsyangdi-hydroelectric-power-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/02/09/000178830_98101902442699/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/02/09/000178830_98101902442699/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"1478","datestored":"2000-02-09T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1984-05-31T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Marsyangdi Hydroelectric Power Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Marsyangdi Hydroelectric Power\n            Project seeks to meet the forecasted demand for electricity\n            in Nepal for the medium term and to strengthen the\n            Borrower's power sector.
