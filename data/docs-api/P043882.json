Some lessons\n            learned included: (1) given the large attitudinal shift\n            involved in the agricultural transition, government\n            officials and project staff need substantial technical\n            assistance and training before operations can be expected to\n            succeed; (2) in the complex and rapidly changing ECA\n            environment, sound donor coordination was critical; (3) with\n            respect to agriculture and agribusiness services, project\n            experience demonstrated that farmers and rural business\n            owners will respond enthusiastically to innovative\n            technologies corresponding to their needs; (4) on land\n            administration, the Bank\u0092s international experience\n            strengthened the design of projects in ECA, and these\n            projects showed the importance of avoiding a\n            'one-size-fits- all' approach and the sound payoff\n            to adopting a unified approach to develop property registry\n            and cadaster; and (5) the rural finance operations showed\n            that with appropriate regulation, technical advice and staff\n            training banks that lend to rural areas can operate\n            sustainably; also, non-bank financial intermediaries have an\n            important role to play in rural areas; but it is

The project has demonstrated the high response from\n            farmers to innovative technologies corresponding to their\n            needs. It has also demonstrated the high response from\n            farmers associations and Research Institutes to partnership\n            opportunities, and the beneficial impact of such\n            partnerships on efficiency and client relevance of\n            agricultural research and extension.

It has also confirmed that, in order to\n            become fully responsive to the demand for new technologies,\n            the agricultural research and extension system needs\n            institutional strengthening, and an in-depth restructuring.\n            As regards management of agricultural research and extension\n            projects, it has shown that a Project Management Unit (PMU)\n            contributes to the success of such projects in Romania,\n            provided it is deeply integrated within the Ministry as the\n            implementing agency. The PMU facilitated a close monitoring\n            of activities, linkages with the private sector, and an\n            inter-ministerial approach. Finally, the project has further\n            confirmed the importance of a well designed monitoring and\n            evaluation system, which should be set up at an early\n            project

providing needed technology, information, and\n            training for private farmers, and agro-processors. The two\n            main components: 1) applied research, and extension, will\n            support agricultural research, and extension on priority\n            problems, by means of a Competitive Grant Scheme (CGS). It\n            will ensure a close association between research\n            scientist/extension specialists, and the needs of newly\n            emerged private farmers, particularly in the formulation,\n            and evaluation of research, and extension proposals. CGS\n            will extend the range of research and extension grant\n            participants, to include universities, NGOs, private\n            industry, and extension services. Funding will be provided\n            to meet priority needs, marketing, and efficient input, and\n            low cost options, for production, and processing.\n            Proposals' evaluation criteria will include farm\n            utility, experience, and transfer of technology, as well as\n            environmental impacts; 2) institution building, will\n            administer the CGS, and implement a rapid impact program to\n            deliver extension messages, and conduct applied research.\n            Technical assistance, and training will be delivered for\n            capacity building, and future restructuring services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Agricultural Support Services Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Agricultural Support\n
