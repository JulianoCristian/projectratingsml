Since gains achieved by\n            the intervention may be lost after it ends, even apparently\n            successful interventions may not result in long-term\n            conservation benefits, a problem known as that of\n            permanence. This paper uses a unique dataset to examine the\n            permanence of land use change induced by a short-term PES\n            program implemented in Quind\u00edo, Colombia, between 2003 and\n            2008. This the first PES program to have a control group for\n            comparison. Under this program, PES had been found to have a\n            positive and highly significant impact on land use. To\n            assess the long-term permanence of these changes, both PES\n            recipients and control households were re-surveyed in 2011,\n            four years after the last payment was made. We find that the\n            land use changes that had been induced by PES were broadly\n            sustained in intervening years, with minor differences\n            across specific practices and sub-groups of participants.\n            The patterns of change in the period after the PES program\n            was completed also help better understand the reasons for\n            the program\u0092s success. These results suggest that, at least\n            in the case of productive land uses such as silvopastoral\n            practices, PES programs can be effective at encouraging land\n            owners to adopt environmentally-beneficial management\n            practices and that the benefits will persist after payments cease."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Evaluation of the permanence of land use\n

This paper uses\n            data from a PES mechanism implemented in Quind\u00edo, Colombia,\n            to examine the impact of PES on land use change. Alone among\n            all early PES initiatives, the Silvopastoral Project\n            included a control group of nonparticipants, whose land use\n            changes were monitored throughout the project period, as\n            well as detailed baseline data on both PES recipients and\n            control group members. By comparing the land use changes\n            undertaken by PES recipients to those undertaken by control\n            group members, we can distinguish the impact of PES from\n            that of other factors. The results show that payments had a\n            positive and highly significant impact on land use change,\n            under a variety of model formulations. PES recipients\n            converted over 40 percent of their farms to\n            environmentally-friendly land uses over 4 years, increasing\n            environmental service provision by almost 50 percent. In\n            contrast, control group members converted less than 20\n            percent of their farms, increasing environmental service\n            provision by only 7

Some lessons\n            learned included: the indices developed by the project were\n            very useful tools that farmers quickly related to. They were\n            able to relate their activity to a direct level of\n            compensation, allowing each individual to reach his or her\n            own comfort level. Contracts with farmers specifying amounts\n            per land use change made annual payments easier. There was a\n            high correlation between the indicators measured for on-site\n            biodiversity and carbon with the values assigned to the\n            ecological index, an indication that the land use index was\n            a good proxy for Payment for Environmental Services (PES).\n            The index had to be adjusted only for overestimated values\n            assigned to fodder banks, as they were frequently harvested.\n            The project has developed a large database on biodiversity\n            and found two main variables explaining its presence:\n            diversity of tree species and tree cover.

introduction\n            of payment incentives for environmental services to farmers\n            on their adoption of integrated silvopastoral farming\n            systems in degraded pasture lands; and b) the resulting\n            improvements in eco-systems functioning, global\n            environmental benefits, and local socio-economic gains\n            resulting from the provision of said services. There are\n            four project components. The first component strengthens\n            local development organizations to assist farmers in\n            establishing and maintaining improved silvopastoral systems,\n            and in the technical and institutional aspects of\n            silvopastoral systems. The second component develops and\n            implements an improved monitoring system to provide accurate\n            information and understanding on the potential of\n            intensified silvopastoral systems in providing global\n            ecological services and local socio-economic benefits. The\n            third component creates and implements an eco-services\n            payment mechanism to provide incentives for establishing and\n            maintaining improved silvopastoral systems on farms. The\n            fourth component supports policy formulation and\n            dissemination, specifically developing a replication\n            strategy, including exploration of potential
