The water sector project resulted in\n            significantly better services and financial health for the\n            sector. Approximately one million extra people got water\n            supply services. Social connections, changed billing\n            practices, and more stand posts ensured the poor benefited\n            from service expansion. Existing customers got more water of\n            better quality. In addition, the utility is better run, with\n            lower water losses and higher bill recovery.

Some lessons learned\n            included: large investment programs can attract more bidders\n            and the increased competition can generate cost savings that\n            may be used to reinforce the impact of the project. The\n            technical quality of reforms that are designed to match\n            improvement of services with the financial efforts required\n            from beneficiaries strengthens their social acceptability\n            and prevents to a large extent political interference in\n            their implementation. Effective targeting of the poor can be\n            reached by using a simple eligibility criterion based on the\n            location of households. Whenever country conditions cannot\n            allow identifying robust income criteria at household level,\n            targeting low-income neighborhoods is a good proxy.

There are seven project components. The first\n            improves the reliability, quality, quantity, and coverage of\n            water supply services by increasing production capacity to\n            meet demand, increasing the number of connections,\n            restructuring and balancing water distribution, and\n            increasing storage capacity. The second component expands\n            and reinforces drinking water networks. The third component\n            increases the number of households connected to sewer\n            networks, improves demand management and reduces wastewater\n            and septic pollution, and limits severity and duration of\n            flooding. the fourth component targets peri-urban and\n            low-income settlements so as to improve sanitary conditions\n            of households. This component includes an investment program\n            and a capacity building and demand generation program. The\n            fifth component improves the role of the executing agency in\n            regulating water resources and develops an action plan for\n            integrated management. The sixth component incorporates\n            environmental concerns in the project to increase quality,\n            and to follow safeguard policies and national regulations.\n            The seventh component increases the efficiency of public\n            entities involved in the water and sewerage sector by\n            strengthening their capacity and the capacity of small\n

potential negative impacts on the\n            environment, as a result of the Long Term Water Supply\n            Project in Senegal, namely, the fragility of underground\n            water resources; the water supply deficit in the Greater\n            Dakar area - surface water resources with multiple uses;\n            and, the negligent waste water collection, and treatment\n            systems - a social situation aggravated by sanitary risks,\n            due to the limited access to infrastructure sanitation by\n            the population. Mitigating measures include: 1) Although\n            underground effluents will progressively diminish,\n            benefiting the Lake Guiers surface waters, measures suggest\n            monitoring and evaluation of the underground effluents in\n            Dakar and the Northern region, following the temporary\n            exploitation phase, and, establish formal control\n            procedures, building management capacity to better service\n            water resources. 2) Concerning surface waters, the creation\n            of a local authority is recommended, to manage the lake\n            water resources, and, establish legal, and regulatory\n            frameworks to control water pollution, through an\n            operational management plan, which should include costs,\n            financial management, and taxation systems. 3) Waste\n            disposal should be addressed in the technical specifications\n            of procurement documents, emphasizing environmental\n            management as it concerns, industrial pollution,\n            agricultural land, and, noise, and air pollution control. 4)\n            To avoid potential controversies, community consultations\n            should be established, to include financial compensation for\n            land losses, and, public health issues should also be\n            integrated in the procurement documents."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Etude d ' impact (Main report)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"S\u00e9n\u00e9gal \u2013 Projet\n            d\u2019approvisionnement en eau potable \u00e0 long terme : \u00e9tude\n            d\u2019impact (Vol. 2) : \u00c9tude d\u2019impact (Rapport principal)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/07/436985/senegal-projet-dapprovisionnement-en-eau-potable-long-terme-etude-dimpact-vol-2-etude-d-impact-main-report","projn":"SN-Long Term Water Sec Sil (Fy01) -- P041528","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Senegal","authors":{"authr":"Pigeon, Jean-Luc"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00072905350321"},"subsc":"Sewerage,Sanitation,Water supply","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Water supply & sanitation; Environmental\n            assessment; Underground water pollution; Effluents; Surface\n            waters; Waste water treatment; Sanitation education; Public\n            health surveillance; Access to water; Social protection\n            systems; Monitoring & evaluation; Pollution control\n            regulations; Pollution control in industry; Capacity\n            building; Environmental management; Legal & regulatory\n            framework; Operations management; Financial management;\n            Taxation; Technical specifications; Procurement guidelines;\n            Noise abatement; Air pollution control; Community\n            participation; Compensation; Public awareness"}},"owner":"AFT:  Urban/Water Francophone (AFTU2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF037700-SENEGAL - LONG TERM WATER SECTOR,TF037699-SENEGAL - LONG TERM WATER SECTOR,TF037645-SENEGAL - LONG TERM WATER SECTOR,TF036955-SENEGAL - LONG TERM WATER SECTOR,TF036937-SENEGAL - CAPACITY BUILDING FOR ENVIRONMENT,TF036710-SENEGAL - LONG TERM WATER\n            SUPPLY PROJECT,TF036705-SENEGAL - LONG TERM WATER\n            SUPPLY PROJECT,TF035842-AFRICA - WATER SUPPLY PROJECT(\n            SENEGAL, MAURITANIA)","repnb":"E343","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Long Term Water Supply Project\n            : environmental assessment"}}},"facets":{}}}
