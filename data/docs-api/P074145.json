Technical assistance (TA) supporting\n            politically difficult, transition reforms have a higher\n            chance of success if designed as an integral part of the\n            Bank's broader sector assistance strategy, and at the\n            policy level if supporting relevant conditions in adjustment\n            operation(s). However, the reverse is also true - as\n            observed in the Implementation Completion Reports on both\n            Private and Financial Sector Adjustment Credits (PFSAC)\n            (I/II), the Bank's ability to provide extensive\n            technical assistance on a timely basis, has been enormously\n            important in enabling the PFSAC program achieve its\n            objectives on enterprise sector reform, and further recorded\n            in relevant policy conditions on privatization of\n            State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), and measures to improve the\n            business environment. Therefore, implementation of a complex\n            and politically sensitive TA program does not only require a\n            fully functioning implementing agency, but also constant\n            support at the level of senior policy-making. In this case,\n            from the very inception the Project enjoyed full support of\n            the reform-minded Ministry of Economy and Privatization\n            (MOEP), who protected the implementing agencies from\n            political risks.

There\n            are three main project components. The first supports the\n            rapid privatization of about 27 important firms through\n            internationally accepted methods, using best practices that\n            ensure transparency, competitive tendering, and appropriate\n            sales techniques for the companies being privatized. The\n            second component strengthens the capacity of the Republic of\n            Serbia Agency for Privatization to undertake a complex\n            privatization program using best practices. the third\n            component supports foreign investment and the deregulation\n            of the business environment by strengthening the\n            institutional capacity of the Republic of Agencies for\n            Foreign Investment, for Small and Medium Enterprise (SME)\n            Development, and the SME Department of the Ministry of\n            Economy and
