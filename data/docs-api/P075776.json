Tunisia was\n            chosen among the seven (7) first African countries to\n            benefit from assistance under this program in its first\n            phase (2005-2009) in terms of promoting prevention and\n            elimination. The fundamental objectives of the project\n            ASP-Tunisia are: 1) Clean Tunisia stocks of obsolete\n            pesticides without harming the environment and human health;\n            2) Contribute to the prevention of recurrence of unwanted\n            stock by the introduction of preventive measures; 3)\n            Contribute to the protection of human health and\n            environmental exposure to pesticides; and 4) Ensuring\n            capacity building of Tunisian institutions on all important\n            matters concerning chemicals in general and pesticides in\n            particular. The project may cause many negative impacts\n            including: a) The possible evacuation of affected\n            populations; b) The emanation of odors and toxic fumes; c)\n            The emission of dust;
