The\n            main lessons from these credits suggest: 1) Upon the need to\n            drastically reduce the scope of a quick-disbursement\n            operation, given practical and political difficulties, this\n            should provide the opportunity for an operation\n            reassessment, in particular the credit amount, to ensure\n            that a relationship remain between that amount and the\n            policy adjustments being supported. 2) Providing general\n            budget support under circumstances where there is virtually\n            no auditing of, or accountability for government\n            expenditures, is unwise, particularly in the absence of a\n            strong, monitorable agreement with the borrower on the use\n            of those funds. 3) Providing budget support, in light of\n            major tax evasion and excessive government expenditures, can\n            be potentially counter-productive, in the absence of an\n            agreed, concerted direct attack on those elements. The\n            presence of budget support reduces the natural pressure on\n            governments to take urgent and meaningful action. 4) In a\n            situation where there is no clear borrower commitment to a\n            course of action, or there is a history of back-tracking or\n            non-implementation of laws and regulations, the mere passage\n            of legislation is not usually a good basis for tranche\n            release conditionality. There also needs to be a period of\n            implementation or, better still, conditionality based on\n            actual results achieved. Given a long, complicated reform\n            agenda, careful sequencing of operations is required. This\n            was the case for PFSAC and PFSAC2, to be followed by the\n            proposed Economic Management SAC; and for SOSAC, to be\n            followed by the proposed SOSAC2, examples of good practice.\n            In contrast, there was no immediate follow-up to TAC,\n            compounding its poor design as a one-tranche operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -

World Bank performance\n            overall is rated as highly satisfactory. Borrower\n            performance overall was satisfactory. There were three\n            lessons learned from this experience. First, the Bank was\n            effective in understanding the political economy of change:\n            Many aspects of the project required a keen undrstanding of\n            the process of change, and the Bank was adept at\n            facilitating solutions that were acceptable to many\n            stakeholders. In the intensive process of drafting the new\n            labor legislation, the Bank played an important role in\n            tempering the demands of some groups, for example, the trade\n            unions, to retain more of the privileges they were accorded\n            by the old law. Second, a substantial shift in\n            officials' attitudes was key to successful reform: The\n            active participation of officials at all levels in this\n            process led to a substantial shift in attitude, as they\n            confronted key issues and the severe constraints within\n            which they had to work. In the area of labor relations,\n            attitudes shifted from those rooted in the principles of a\n            centrally-controlled economy to those more suitable to a\n            market economy. Third, collaboration with the International\n            Labor Organization (ILO) facilitated reform. In addition to\n            their technical contribution, ILO participation provided\n            important credibility for the process, as they were\n            perceived as sympathetic to worker rights."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia-Herzegovina - Social Sector\n            Adjustment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia-Herzegovina - Social\n            Sector Adjustment

prioritization of social protection policy\n            and programs in Bosnia-Herzegovina; 2) improve the policy\n            framework for generating productive employment\n            opportunities; 3) initiate improvements in the impact and\n            efficiency of the social safety net, in particular focusing\n            programs on the needs of the poorest; and 4) strengthen the\n            social statistics base in order to ensure that social policy\n            is formulated on a well-informed basis.
