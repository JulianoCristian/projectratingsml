Third Municipal Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The rating summary for the Third\n            Municipal Development Project in Tunisia are as follows:\n            Outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory and borrower performance: was moderately\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned during this project\n            include: increasing the percentage of the urban population\n            with access to basic services and infrastructure requires a\n            wholesale approach and a long-term strategic plan. In\n            Tunisia, the improvement of access to basic services is\n            facilitated by the centrally guided inter-government\n            long-term planning system. Municipal investments are\n            implemented to cover the basic needs of all 264\n            municipalities, with equitable regional distribution. The\n            sustainability of the effort is supported by: (i) the\n            provision of sufficient and reliable sources of financing;\n            and (ii) the strengthening of the municipal development\n            institution which channels the funds. The MDP III (Third\n            Municipal Development Project) experience offers many\n            lessons regarding how to finance municipal infrastructure in\n            order to increase the rate of urban services with equitable\n            regional distribution. Municipal development funds can work\n            well within centralized countries. Tunisia\u0092s well-structured\n            approach to financing basic municipal infrastructure (PIC),\n            shows positive results to successfully promoting access to a\n            sound level of infrastructure in the entire country.\n            Institutional reforms require a strong political will and\n            sustained monitoring of different phases of the\n            implementation by the institutions involved. Institutional\n            reforms represent complex medium- to long-term endeavors,\n            particularly in Tunisia, where the GoT is very cautious\n            about undertaking reforms. Projects with institutional\n            reform components in Tunisia should remain modest and\n            flexible in terms of the scope of reforms. Municipal\n            restructuring plans and information systems to monitor\n            municipal budget and expenses can be efficient tools to\n            improve municipal financial management. The project approach\n            and its tools can be used to effectively link infrastructure\n            financing, maintenance, and capacity-building. In the case\n            of MDP III, the timing of availability of these tools has\n            been satisfactory, as they were ready almost simultaneously.\n            However, the tools were implemented late and thus had little\n            impact at the time of project closing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Third Municipal Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia
