This project proposes to help meet\n            Indonesia's Drinking Water Decade target of providing\n            piped water supply to 75% of the urban population by 1990.\n            Its principal objectives are to: (a) provide low cost safe\n            water supply to almost 720,000 persons by 1988, half of\n            which are in the poverty group; (b) maintain tariffs\n            affordable to all, including the poor; (c) develop\n            financially autonomous water enterprises (PDAMs) to operate\n            completed systems; and (d) train management, administrative\n            and operations staff of the water sector. The proposed loan\n            also includes provision of: (i) piped water supply systems;\n            (ii) development of management and financial systems for\n            eight water enterprises; (iii) training for water supply\n            staff; and (iv) consulting services. Because it provides\n            safe, potable water the project will have a positive\n            environmental impact and improve the quality of life of\n            persons in the beneficiary

- East Java Water Supply Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Government of Indonesia hopes to\n            provide at least cost, essential and safe water supply\n            service to a previously unserved population in East Java and\n            to strengthen its water supply sector institutions and\n            policies. This project proposes to help meet\n            Indonesia's Drinking Water Decade target of providing\n            piped water supply to 75% of the urban population by 1990.\n            Its principal objectives are to: (a) provide low cost safe\n            water supply to almost 720,000 persons by 1988, half of\n            which are in the poverty group; (b) maintain tariffs\n            affordable to all, including the poor; (c) develop\n            financially autonomous water enterprises (PDAMs) to operate\n            completed systems; and (d) train management, administrative\n            and operations staff of the water sector. The proposed loan\n            also includes provision of: (i) piped water supply systems;\n            (ii) development of management and financial systems for\n            eight water enterprises; (iii) training for water supply\n            staff; and (iv) consulting services. Because it provides\n            safe, potable water the project will have a positive\n            environmental impact and improve the quality of life of\n            persons in the beneficiary cities and towns."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
