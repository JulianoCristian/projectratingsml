In future phases the requirements on\n            member states to pay contributions will need to be\n            increased, for example through dated legal covenants, and\n            linking payments to clearly defined activities. Costing of\n            activities should be based on actual contracts, wherever\n            possible, or on more detailed market reviews even if it\n            leads to taking studies out of the project to be funded from\n            other sources. Close collaboration between the project\n            executing agencies and with the beneficiaries can mitigate\n            the negative effects of national civil strife on project\n            implementation. Introduction of a more nuanced selection\n            process among potential project beneficiaries is good\n            practice, however a capacity requirement may conflict with\n            the focus of the project on the poorest communities in the\n            basin. Increased capacity building for beneficiaries before\n            and after handing over assets is recommended. Rapid increase\n            of production may lead to bottlenecks unless the whole value\n            chain is considered, including processing, storage, and\n            marketing. An appropriate value chain should be analyzed as\n            part of project preparation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa - Senegal River Basin Multi-purpose\n            Water Resources Development
