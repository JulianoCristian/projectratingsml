Several lessons were drawn from the\n            project as follows. The project implementation arrangement\n            was uniquely carried through the Education Secretariat in\n            Minas Gerais, which proved beneficial in promoting the\n            development of institutional memory, allowing a small\n            project unit to perform efficiently the role of project\n            coordinator unit (PCU), rather than choosing a large\n            separate PCU structure. However, the absence of a monitoring\n            and evaluation criteria was not fully implemented, making it\n            difficult to link precise project activities to the observed\n            improvements in the state's quality of education, thus\n            missing an opportunity for stronger support from education\n            authorities, and civil society, based on pertinent project\n            data, and analysis. To this end, it is suggested to build a\n            strong technical capacity in the field - through training\n            and dissemination mechanisms - to guarantee the development\n            of monitoring and evaluation systems. Other lessons address\n            issues concerning the need a) to assess the implementing\n            agencies' capacity for handling the scope of projects;\n            b) to carefully consider the political environment in\n            project planning; c) to integrate project financial\n            management into the accounting system of the implementing\n            agency; and, d) to further develop the state level student\n            learning assessment by having test results amply\n            disseminated to the civil society, promoting public support\n            for quality education."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Minas Gerais Basic Education\n            Quality Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Minas Gerais Basic\n            Education
