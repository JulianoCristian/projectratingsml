Lessons learned included:\n            it is important for the Bank to carefully assess the merits\n            of its demands on the Borrower when there are clear signs of\n            resistance. In the particular case of the Bank's\n            insistence that the Lviv Vodokanal employ a foreign, private\n            management operator it was obvious that the Client did not\n            favor such a solution. The subsequent substitute of a\n            management contract by expensive, foreign management\n            advisory services was not well advised either given the\n            explicit, strong reluctance of the Borrower to employ a\n            management operator. In middle-income countries where the\n            development of Bank business is not assured the Bank would\n            benefit from being closely attuned to the demands and\n            preferences of prospective borrowers. By the same token, the\n            Bank might wish to consider longer-term client relationships\n            as afforded by follow-up operations since it is highly\n            unlikely that reforms will be possible to define, let alone\n            implement, under one isolated operation. The choice of\n            performance indicators and the level of technical, economic\n            and financial analysis should be guided by the quality of\n            baseline data. In the particular case of water supply and\n            wastewater projects the quality of production and\n            consumption data is suspect in the absence of widespread and\n            careful metering. In the case of the technical analysis such\n            uncertainties in data argue in favor of flexible and robust\n            project designs as in rehabilitation projects. In the case\n            of economic analysis may be sufficient to concentrate on\n            flexible least-cost analysis rather than engage in economic\n            cost-benefit analysis where the results could well be\n            spurious when the baseline data are of poor quality and\n            subject to considerable change."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - Lviv Water and Wastewater
