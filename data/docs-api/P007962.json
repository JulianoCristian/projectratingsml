On May 17, 1979,\n            the Bank signed a $115 million program loan with the\n            Republic of Peru which had been approved by the Board on May\n            1. The loan was designed to help meet foreign exchange\n            requirements for high priority imports and technical\n            assistance in support of the Government's Economic\n            Recovery Program (ERP), a comprehensive package of\n            short-term and structural economic policy measures.\n            Disbursement of the loan was completed on July 15, 1981.\n            Over 95 percent of the loan, however, had been disbursed by\n            June 30, 1980, the original closing date. Three supervision\n            missions visited Peru to determine whether progress under\n            the ERP was satisfactory, as a basis for release of loan\n            tranches.
