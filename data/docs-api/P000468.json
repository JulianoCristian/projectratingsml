Contrary to the benefits expected at\n            appraisal time, institutional benefits were limited, while\n            socio-economic benefits were not properly evaluated, and\n            remain seemingly limited. Furthermore, although monitoring\n            and evaluation does indicate some increase in crops'\n            productivity, the establishment of agricultural production\n            benefits was not clearly defined, and, such increase may not\n            be attributed to the adoption of improved technology\n            methods. Likewise, the project did not provide indicators to\n            measure the impact from environmental benefits. The major\n            lessons suggest, that while this project raises questions\n            regarding supervision accessibility in a country suffering\n            civil unrest, still, project design should address more\n            precise monitoring and evaluation indicators. Special\n            attention should be given, when considering centralized\n            technical ministries for execution of crucial agricultural\n            research and extension projects, as efficiency may be poor,\n            whereas, decentralized, autonomous agencies may prove more\n            efficient. In addition, project design may need to phase the\n            project progressively, i.e., 1) institutional set-up; 2)\n            capacity building; 3) research and extension operations,\n            and, procurement work. The responsibility for operational\n            costs should be clearly stated, particularly, when\n            suspension occurs, to avoid exceptional expenses."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central African Republic - Agricultural\n            Services Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Central African Republic -\n            Agricultural Services Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/06/728463/central-african-republic-agricultural-services-development-project","projn":"CF-Ag.

Project benefits are of two orders: first,\n            the building of stronger, better coordinated agricultural\n            institutions which will operate at lower costs than the sum\n            total of the fragmented, sometimes overlapping donor-funded\n            interventions that prevailed so far; second, improvements in\n            the livelihood of rural people, made possible by project\n            actions designed to increase agricultural productivity and\n            create artisanal employment.  Since women provide the\n            majority of labor for crop maintenance and processing, the\n            successful extension of labor saving technologies will be of\n            particular benefit to them by reducing their workload.\n            Through the community participation approach, villages will\n            become increasingly more efficient at managing their own\n            affairs.  The educated rural youths are expected to gain\n            responsibility and social status as a result.  Other equally\n            significant benefits are expected to arise from the\n            emergence of numerous, varied trading and artisanal\n            activities which will stimulate exchanges and monetize the\n            economy in the project area."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central African Republic - Agricultural\n            Services Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Central African Republic -\n            Agricultural Services Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/04/735505/central-african-republic-agricultural-services-development-project","projn":"CF-Ag.

cost to\n            Government that will eventually become sustainable without\n            outside assistance and, (ii) to support the tendency among\n            local people to organize themselves in groups to manage\n            village affairs.  Project benefits are of two orders: first,\n            the building of stronger, better coordinated agricultural\n            institutions which will operate at lower costs than the sum\n            total of the fragmented, sometimes overlapping donor-funded\n            interventions that prevailed so far; second, improvements in\n            the livelihood of rural people, made possible by project\n            actions designed to increase agricultural productivity and\n            create artisanal employment.  Since women provide the\n            majority of labor for crop maintenance and processing, the\n            successful extension of labor saving technologies will be of\n            particular benefit to them by reducing their workload.\n            Through the community participation approach, villages will\n            become increasingly more efficient at managing their own\n            affairs.  The educated rural youths are expected to gain\n            responsibility and social status as a result.  Other equally\n            significant benefits are expected to arise from the\n            emergence of numerous, varied trading and artisanal\n            activities which will stimulate exchanges and monetize the\n            economy in the project area."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central African Republic - Agricultural\n            Services Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Central African Republic -\n            Agricultural Services Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/04/736625/central-african-republic-agricultural-services-development-project","projn":"CF-Ag.
