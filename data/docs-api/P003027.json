The Project provides for the planting of 12,215 ha\n            of oil palm, renewing the equipment of three oil mills,\n            procuring earth moving equipment, trucks, tractors, staff\n            vehicles; constructing or repairing staff and workers\n            housing, schools, clinics; and technical assistance and\n            training.

- Oil Palm Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Project seeks to reverse the trend\n            of rapidly declining production of palm oil and to forestall\n            the need for Zaire to import this commodity in the near\n            future. The Project provides for the planting of 12,215 ha\n            of oil palm, renewing the equipment of three oil mills,\n            procuring earth moving equipment, trucks, tractors, staff\n            vehicles; constructing or repairing staff and workers\n            housing, schools, clinics; and technical assistance and\n            training. The Project also provides for feasibility studies\n            and pilot programs for the development of smallholders\n            cultivation to raise the standard of living and increase the\n            agricultural production of the rural population in the\n            Project areas. The major risk facing the Project is the\n            shortage of plantation workers due principally to the\n            inadequate level of incomes they secure from present levels\n            of wages. Their provision with supplementary income earning\n            opportunities from small scale cultivation, the increase in\n            wages, the improvement of social services and housing, and\n            the mechanization of land clearing operations in some of the\n            Project areas are expected to reduce this risk to a minimum."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zaire - Oil Palm Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zaire - Oil Palm Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/03/727192/zaire-oil-palm-development-project","projn":"ZR-Oil Palm Development -- P003027","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Wetlands,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Economic Theory & Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Congo, Democratic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912073011"},"subsc":"(Historic)Perennial crops","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            output,agricultural policy,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,Audits,average annual\n            rainfall,balance of payments,cacao,cash\n            crops,cassava,climate,climatic conditions,coffee,coffee\n            plantations,commodity,Cotton,crops,cultivation,dates,dry\n            season,Economic Analysis,Economic Development,economic\n            growth,Economic Rate of Return,employment,End\n            Use,equipment,expenditures,export\n            crops,Exports,extension,extension\n            services,FAO,farm,farmer,farms,feasibility\n            studies,fertilizers,fish,food crops,forests,fresh\n            fruit,fruits,GDP,grasslands,Harvesting,herbicides,high\n            yielding\n            varieties,housing,imports,income,inflation,integration,interest\n            rate,lakes,land areas,Livestock,living\n            standards,maize,market prices,Marketing,marshes,oil,Oil\n            Palm,oil palms,overhead costs,palm,Palm Oil,Palm Oil\n            Production,palm products,palms,Per capita\n            income,Plantation,plantations,planting,private\n            sector,produce,Producers,production\n            increases,quotas,replanting,rice,Rural\n            Development,seedlings,seeds,soils,tea,technical\n            assistance,tree crops,trees,wages,waterways,wilt"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            output,agricultural policy,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,Audits,average annual\n            rainfall,balance of payments,cacao,cash\n            crops,cassava,climate,climatic conditions,coffee,coffee\n            plantations,commodity,Cotton,crops,cultivation,dates,dry\n            season,Economic Analysis,Economic Development,economic\n            growth,Economic Rate of Return,employment,End\n            Use,equipment,expenditures,export\n            crops,Exports,extension,extension\n            services,FAO,farm,farmer,farms,feasibility\n            studies,fertilizers,fish,food crops,forests,fresh\n            fruit,fruits,GDP,grasslands,Harvesting,herbicides,high\n            yielding\n            varieties,housing,imports,income,inflation,integration,interest\n            rate,lakes,land areas,Livestock,living\n            standards,maize,market prices,Marketing,marshes,oil,Oil\n            Palm,oil palms,overhead costs,palm,Palm Oil,Palm Oil\n            Production,palm products,palms,Per capita\n            income,Plantation,plantations,planting,private\n            sector,produce,Producers,production\n            increases,quotas,replanting,rice,Rural\n            Development,seedlings,seeds,soils,tea,technical\n            assistance,tree crops,trees,wages,waterways,wilt"}},"owner":"WBOff:Kinshasa-CC2:DRC/CG(Braz) (AFCC2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"1592","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"EVALUATION DU PROJET DE DEVELOPPEMENT DE\n            PALMIER A HUILE - ZAIRE"}}},"facets":{}}}
