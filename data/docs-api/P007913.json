Among the lessons\n            learned, project design and policy implications outline the\n            project complexity, reflected by in-experiences in civil\n            works, and services, and failure to appropriately apply the\n            Bank's safeguard policies. Instead, a two-phase project\n            design could have better included less complex civil works\n            in the first phase, with a second phase including the\n            Asuncion ring-road, thus providing time for a thorough\n            preparation of the ring-road component. Moreover,\n            construction costs were underestimated in the design phase,\n            which lead to cost overruns; this could have been prevented\n            by preparing the engineering design studies prior to the\n            bidding process, to avoid construction delays. Project\n            implementation highlights the need to establish early on,\n            performance indicators, and key measurable institutional\n            indicators, to avoid difficulties in proposing timely\n            remedial measures, while organizational capacity should be\n            assessed prior to the start of project implementation. In\n            addition, the resettlement plan should be prepared well in\n            advance of project appraisal, to avoid delays due to a lack\n            of financial resources, institutional weakness, and poor\n            land tenure and registry systems. Finally, political\n            stability should be considered, to attain easy access to\n            decision making, and dialogue."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Eighth Highway

and\n            promoting team-work at its highest level, thus, improving\n            its capacity to deliver good roads and a well maintained\n            network.  The project includes three components.  The first\n            component, civil works includes:  (i) road improvements;\n            (ii) road rehabilitation; and (iii) a pilot unpaved-road\n            stabilization program to treat 80 km of unpaved roads with\n            sulfonated oils to test whether the process adapts and is\n            implementable in Paraguay.  The second component, consulting\n            services, includes:  (i) engineering services to supervise\n            the civil works, engineer the pilot unpaved road\n            stabilization program, design the resurfacing works, and\n            engineer and design improvements to Ytay and Lambare creeks;\n            (ii) studies for the Asuncion Transporation Master Plan; and\n            (iii) technical assistance, including a management review of\n            MOPC, assistance to the environmental unit, strengthening\n            the Department of Highway's highway design and roadwork\n            planning capabilities, and implementation of a national\n            vehicle registry.  The third component, procurement of\n            equipment, including computers to implement the national\n            vehicle registry, and equipment and machines for a soils and\n            materials laboratory."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Eighth Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Paraguay - Eighth Highway
