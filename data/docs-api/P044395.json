Sixteen of these projects were processed as\n            'emergency' operations, one of which is the\n            subject of this evaluation The only previous OED report on\n            the country to date is a case study of post- conflict\n            reconstruction, published in 2000, but based on fieldwork\n            carried out in 1997. The Emergency Electric Power\n            Reconstruction Project has had a highly satisfactory overall\n            outcome. Project sustainability is assessed as likely, while\n            the institutional development impact was substantial. Bank\n            and borrower performance during the project are rated as\n            highly satisfactory because rapid and efficient\n            implementation by both the Bank and borrower staff meant\n            that the project was completed and fully disbursed only\n            three years from identification. The outcome of the Second\n            Electric Power Reconstruction Project is rated as\n            satisfactory and the project's sustainability as\n            likely. The institutional development impact of the project\n            is rated as substantial, because of the progress recorded in\n            bringing staff from the three utilities to work together on\n            common is- sues, especially power trading, and in raising\n            awareness of the importance of the environ- mental aspects\n            of power generation. Bank and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. The key finding from these projects is that\n            when electricity supply cannot be organized in a manner that\n            is technically and economically optimal, there are high\n            costs to a country in terms of lost efficiency and economies\n            of scale. The project experience offers two lessons: 1)\n            Power sector restructuring in a heavily coal-based power\n            system cannot be delinked from reform of the coal industry\n            because of the predominance of coal in the cost of producing\n            electricity from it. Reforms in both sectors should be\n            addressed in parallel, or preferably coal sector reforms\n            should precede electricity, but not lag behind. 2)\n            Experience with tariff increases and improved revenue\n            collection in the immediate aftermath of the peace accord\n            shows that consumers are willing to contribute to the cost\n            of the rapid restoration of electricity supply."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -

Most of its physical, financial, and\n            institutional objectives were met, with a highly\n            satisfactory rate of return. Sustainability of the power\n            sector components is likely, while that of the coal sector\n            components, depend on bridge financing, and sector\n            restructuring, to be provided under a future operation. The\n            key lessons suggest that even under early post-war\n            conditions, revenue collection rates may be raised, almost\n            near normal levels, as indicated by Elektroprivreda Bosnia\n            and Herzegovina's (EPBiH) experience. However, project\n            co-financing, consisting of a small number of co-financiers\n            or parallel financiers, with firm commitments made prior to\n            the Board presentation, would have proved a better\n            financing, in contrast to the financing gaps, and, project\n            alterations during implementation, thus resulting in a\n            difficult, and, time consuming accounting operation.\n            Although the Project Start-Up Advance facilitated\n            procurement prior to Board approval, some difficulties among\n            inter-agency transfers and adjustments did occur. Therefore,\n            since advance funding under emergency projects is vital, a\n            better consideration would be the use of enlarged Project\n            Preparation Facilities, to avoid inter-agency difficulties.\n            Project effectiveness was partly due to a strong Project\n            Implementation Unit, who provided adequate coordination\n            during implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Emergency Electric\n            Power Reconstruction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -\n            Emergency Electric Power Reconstruction Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/06/728345/bosnia-herzegovina-emergency-electric-power-reconstruction-project","projn":"BA-Emg Elec Power Rec -- P044395","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Energy Technology & Transmission,Energy and Poverty Alleviation,Power & Energy Conversion,Energy and Environment,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99072307320255"},"subsc":"Power,Central government administration,Mining and other extractive","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"administrative procedures,adverse impact,air\n            quality,Coal,coal mining,coal power stations,coal\n            production,coal sector,continuous monitoring,cost\n            savings,distribution losses,District Heating,economic\n            growth,economies of scale,Electric Power,electric power\n            sector,electricity,electricity bills,electricity\n            consumption,Electricity generation,electricity\n            sales,electricity supply,electricity tariff,emissions,energy\n            consumption,energy losses,Energy Sector,environmental\n            action,environmental action plan,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,fuel,generation,generation\n            capacity,generation units,generator,heat,Heating,high\n            voltage,lights,meter\n            reading,Mines,pollutants,pollution,power companies,power\n            company,power generation,power plant,Power Projects,power\n            sector,power sector restructuring,power stations,power\n            supply,power supply system,power system,power\n            transmission,power transmission\n            system,productivity,pumping,remedial actions,savings,thermal\n            plants,thermal power,thermal power plants,thermal power\n            stations,transmission,transmission\n            networks,voltage,waste,willingness to pay"},"1":{"cdata!":"administrative procedures,adverse impact,air\n            quality,Coal,coal mining,coal power stations,coal\n            production,coal sector,continuous monitoring,cost\n            savings,distribution losses,District Heating,economic\n            growth,economies of scale,Electric Power,electric power\n            sector,electricity,electricity bills,electricity\n            consumption,Electricity generation,electricity\n            sales,electricity supply,electricity tariff,emissions,energy\n            consumption,energy losses,Energy Sector,environmental\n            action,environmental action plan,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,fuel,generation,generation\n            capacity,generation units,generator,heat,Heating,high\n            voltage,lights,meter\n            reading,Mines,pollutants,pollution,power companies,power\n            company,power generation,power plant,Power Projects,power\n            sector,power sector restructuring,power stations,power\n            supply,power supply system,power system,power\n            transmission,power transmission\n            system,productivity,pumping,remedial actions,savings,thermal\n            plants,thermal power,thermal power plants,thermal power\n            stations,transmission,transmission\n            networks,voltage,waste,willingness to pay"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF037787-ECA REGION - DISTRICT HEATING\n            AND POWER PROJECTS,TF037654-BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA - EMERGENCY\n            ELECTRIC POWER REC.,TF037371-BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA - EMG.\n            ELEC.
