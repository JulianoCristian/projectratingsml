relevant project information is critical to\n            the success of the implementation process. c) Dissemination\n            of project information and effective consultations with\n            market players is important during project implementations.\n            d) Flexibility in conditionality assures continuity of the\n            project while avoiding tense relations between the Bank and\n            the borrower. e) The establishment of environmental\n            screening mechanisms is a common strategy now used in the\n            Bank for financial investment loans and sectoral investment\n            operations. f) The design of labor adjustment assistance\n            programs may utilize a strategy which focuses exclusively on\n            workers following layoff decisions or more upstream as part\n            of firms' efforts to regain market competitiveness and\n            forestall layoffs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Industrial Restructuring
