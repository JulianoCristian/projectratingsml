The project provides a\n            series of lessons concerning ownership, particularly in a\n            society with low social capital. It is clear that ownership\n            will be constantly challenged in a project overseen by seven\n            different ministers, four Bank task managers, and two\n            project managers operating in a weak agricultural policy\n            environment and affected by the political instability of\n            Macedonia. The lessons include: unforeseeable political\n            events can powerfully affect project outcomes, the project\n            management team needed to be able, flexible and independent\n            of day-to-day politics, and project adjustments should occur\n            in response to real government commitments, and project\n            management capability.

The project will change mechanisms for provision of\n            technical services to private farmers and initiate important\n            changes in the public institutions providing such services.\n            It will be implemented over three and a half years. Project\n            funds will be used for technical specialists, training,\n            equipment, vehicles, and small support grants. The project\n            will include the following main components: 1) pilot\n            initiatives to develop cost-sharing arrangements with farmer\n            associations, to decentralize extension management and\n            responsibility for support to farmers, and to strengthen\n            Macedonian Extension Service's extension capacity; 2)\n            support for applied
