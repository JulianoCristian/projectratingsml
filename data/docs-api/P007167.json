Once again,\n            experience confirms that institutional reforms are more\n            successful when supported by strong government commitments,\n            for a sustained period of time, and reforms implemented\n            incrementally, and in sequence. Regardless of success, it is\n            suggested that institutional reforms are better handled as a\n            technical assistance activity, or a stand-alone project\n            separate from sectoral investments. In this case, the\n            project might have been better designed as two inter-related\n            and successive stages, and in addition, include a full\n            assessment of local capacity to implement, and process\n            project activities, and requirements. Nevertheless, the\n            dynamic, changing nature of agricultural research and\n            extension priorities, requires a system embodied in project\n            design, so as to adjust focus, and priorities accordingly.\n            This was particularly important because the project was\n            implemented immediately after the end of the civil war, and\n            later on, because farmers demonstrated interest in\n            diversifying their production to higher value crops.\n            Particularly because of post-conflict circumstances, due\n            consideration should be given to other financers in the\n            sector, clearly defining areas of intervention, either\n            geographically or by task, to prevent overlap, and avoid\n            driving down standards. Other lessons also address\n            institutional arrangements, agreements with beneficiaries,\n            training, and adequate performance indicators."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador -
