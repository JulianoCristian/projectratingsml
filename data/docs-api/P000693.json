agricultural minimum package program over a two-year period.\n            The project has been designed to: (i) increase the\n            productivity and incomes of small farmers by introducing\n            them to fertilizer, improved seeds and other agricultural\n            inputs; (ii) strengthen the institutional and technical\n            framework to progressively expand and improve the minimum\n            package program; and (iii) help to ensure long-term\n            productivity of the land by expanding the Borrower's\n            soil and water conservation efforts. By the end of the\n            project period, an additional 150,000 farm families are\n            expected to be served by the minimum package program. After\n            about thirteen years, an estimated 2.0 million farm families\n            will have benefitted from the program and smallholder\n            foodgrain production is expected to have increased\n            substantially. The project primarily faces risks of delays\n            and of possible reductions in scale. However, in view of the\n            importance and high potential of the project for the mostly\n            very low-income Ethiopian farmers, the risks are considered

agricultural minimum package program over a two-year period.\n            The project has been designed to: (i) increase the\n            productivity and incomes of small farmers by introducing\n            them to fertilizer, improved seeds and other agricultural\n            inputs; (ii) strengthen the institutional and technical\n            framework to progressively expand and improve the minimum\n            package program; and (iii) help to ensure long-term\n            productivity of the land by expanding the Borrower's\n            soil and water conservation efforts. By the end of the\n            project period, an additional 150,000 farm families are\n            expected to be served by the minimum package program. After\n            about thirteen years, an estimated 2.0 million farm families\n            will have benefitted from the program and smallholder\n            foodgrain production is expected to have increased\n            substantially. The project primarily faces risks of delays\n            and of possible reductions in scale. However, in view of the\n            importance and high potential of the project for the mostly\n            very low-income Ethiopian farmers, the risks are considered acceptable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Second Agricultural Minimum\n            Package Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Second Agricultural\n            Minimum Package Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/11/727029/ethiopia-second-agricultural-minimum-package-project","projn":"ET-Mpp II -- P000693","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Economic Theory & Research,Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"Ethiopia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912293634"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural chemicals,Agricultural\n            Development,agricultural engineering,Agricultural\n            Extension,agricultural inputs,Agricultural\n            Marketing,agricultural production,Agricultural\n            Research,agricultural training,Agriculture,animal\n            health,animal husbandry,animal nutrition,Animal\n            Resources,animals,barley,base year,Central Planning,cereal\n            yields,cereals,climatic\n            conditions,Coffee,Cooperatives,Crop,crop losses,crop\n            production,crop\n            protection,cropping,Crops,cultivation,decentralization,development\n            strategy,ecological conditions,economic\n            development,equipment,exports,extension\n            services,FAO,Farm,farmer,Farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,Farms,fertilizer,fertilizer use,fertilizers,field\n            crops,forestry,foundation seed,GDP,Government\n            Bonds,grain,grain production,Grain Storage,grains,gross\n            value,horticulture,Income,Income\n            Distribution,innovation,Land\n            Reform,lands,legislation,livestock,livestock\n            products,maize,Marketing,millet,MOA,mulch,oilseeds,pest\n            control,pesticides,plant protection,planting,price\n            increases,produce,producers,pulses,Rural Development,rural\n            roads,Seed,Seeds,small farmers,soil conservation,soil\n            degradation,Soil Fertility,soils,sorghum,Swedish\n            International Development Authority,Tea,technical\n            assistance,United States Agency for International\n            Development,USAID,veterinary services,wheat"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural chemicals,Agricultural\n            Development,agricultural engineering,Agricultural\n            Extension,agricultural inputs,Agricultural\n            Marketing,agricultural production,Agricultural\n            Research,agricultural training,Agriculture,animal\n            health,animal husbandry,animal nutrition,Animal\n            Resources,animals,barley,base year,Central Planning,cereal\n            yields,cereals,climatic\n            conditions,Coffee,Cooperatives,Crop,crop losses,crop\n            production,crop\n            protection,cropping,Crops,cultivation,decentralization,development\n            strategy,ecological conditions,economic\n            development,equipment,exports,extension\n            services,FAO,Farm,farmer,Farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,Farms,fertilizer,fertilizer use,fertilizers,field\n            crops,forestry,foundation seed,GDP,Government\n            Bonds,grain,grain production,Grain Storage,grains,gross\n            value,horticulture,Income,Income\n            Distribution,innovation,Land\n            Reform,lands,legislation,livestock,livestock\n            products,maize,Marketing,millet,MOA,mulch,oilseeds,pest\n            control,pesticides,plant protection,planting,price\n            increases,produce,producers,pulses,Rural Development,rural\n            roads,Seed,Seeds,small farmers,soil conservation,soil\n            degradation,Soil Fertility,soils,sorghum,Swedish\n            International Development Authority,Tea,technical\n            assistance,United States Agency for International\n            Development,USAID,veterinary services,wheat"}},"owner":"HQ Anchor: Ethiopia (AFCET)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"1774"},"facets":{}}}
