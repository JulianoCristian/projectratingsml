The project, judged as\n            satisfactory with a likely sustainability, learned the\n            following lessons: a) there was an underestimation of time\n            required to reach consensus among the 22 involved countries;\n            b) better definition of respective responsibilities for\n            supervision and procurement were needed prior to signing; c)\n            more intensive involvement of the Bank's legal and\n            environmental specialists would have improved preparation;\n            d) the IMO's appointment as executing agency imposed a\n            barrier between the Bank and the beneficiary countries; e)\n            in the absence of a region-wide suitable institution,\n            special attention should have been given to the involvement\n            of suitable sub-regional institutions; f) when a project\n            represents a new area of work for the Bank, a formal\n            mid-term review should have been included in the Project\n            Document; g) the decision to close was based on the\n            Bank's judgement that agreed deadlines were not\n            achieved and in the face of the \"inability\" of the\n            IMO to follow agreed procedures and action; and h) the Bank\n            should continue to support the efforts of IMO and\n            governments to implement and sustain MARPOL 73/78."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Developing Countries of the Wider Caribbean\n            Region - The Wider Caribbean Initiative on Ship Generated\n            Waste Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Developing Countries of the Wider\n            Caribbean Region - The Wider Caribbean Initiative on Ship\n            Generated Waste Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/06/728376/developing-countries-wider-caribbean-region-wider-caribbean-initiative-ship-generated-waste-project","projn":"6R-Wider Crb Initiative -- P006956","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Ports & Waterways,Business in Development,Business Environment,Legal Products","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Law and Development,Transport,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Caribbean","entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99072807530825"},"subsc":"General public administration sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Law and Development,Transport,Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,actions,adequate port reception\n            facilities,audit reports,auditors,audits,authority,cost\n            recovery,Covenants,environmental\n            protection,expenditure,expenditures,garbage from\n            ships,IMO,International Maritime Organization,legal\n            aspects,Legal Framework,legal implementation,legal\n            systems,legal training,legislation,Marine Environment,Marine\n            Pollution,national legislation,noise\n            pollution,Pollution,Pollution from Ships,port reception\n            facilities,Prevention of Pollution,Private\n            Sector,procurement,project evaluation,public health,Ship\n            Generated Waste,UNDP,Waste"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,actions,adequate port reception\n            facilities,audit reports,auditors,audits,authority,cost\n            recovery,Covenants,environmental\n            protection,expenditure,expenditures,garbage from\n            ships,IMO,International Maritime Organization,legal\n            aspects,Legal Framework,legal implementation,legal\n            systems,legal training,legislation,Marine Environment,Marine\n            Pollution,national legislation,noise\n            pollution,Pollution,Pollution from Ships,port reception\n            facilities,Prevention of Pollution,Private\n            Sector,procurement,project evaluation,public health,Ship\n            Generated Waste,UNDP,Waste"}},"owner":"Environment (LCSEN)","trustfund":"TF023410-SIDA CTF FOR ENVIRONMENT,TF028606-GET-PPA FOR WCISW,TF028653-GET-CARIBBEAN INITIATIVE FOR\n            SHIP WASTE","repnb":"19494"},"698296":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1994/06/698296/developing-countries-wider-caribbean-region-wider-caribbean-initiative-ship-generated-waste","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1994/06/698296/developing-countries-wider-caribbean-region-wider-caribbean-initiative-ship-generated-waste","new_url":"1994/06/698296/developing-countries-wider-caribbean-region-wider-caribbean-initiative-ship-generated-waste","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1994/06/01/000009265_3970702134037/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1994/06/01/000009265_3970702134037/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","datestored":"2001-04-10T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1994-06-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Developing Countries of the Wider Caribbean\n            Region - Wider Caribbean Initiative for Ship-Generated Waste"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Wider Caribbean Initiative for Ship\n            Generated Solid Wastes Project is conceived as the first\n            phase of a longer term process of cleaning up and protecting\n            the Caribbean Sea.
