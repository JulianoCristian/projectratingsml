The\n            unsatisfactory marketing arrangements for inputs and outputs\n            was a major problem of the project. This was also the main\n            reason why the credit Closing Date was not extended by the\n            International Development Association (IDA) and a large\n            amount of credit funds was cancelled. IDA' s\n            performance was unduly optimistic about their timely and\n            successful resolution. The unsatisfactory results appear to\n            be mainly due to the inappropriate development strategy,\n            ineffective extension service and absence of a viable\n            marketing system. Towards the end of the project, IDA\n            missions had recognized that given the small size of the\n            family farms and their low technological levels, increases\n            in productivity could be obtained in the early stages from\n            better husbandry methods, and without the use of cash inputs\n            such as fertilizers, pesticides or
