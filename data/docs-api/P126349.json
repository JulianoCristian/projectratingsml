Some lessons\n            learned included: success was more noticeable in areas which\n            coincided with Government's own priorities and where\n            Bank had other instruments to engage outside the Poverty\n            Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) framework. This is quite\n            evident in the declining overall performance of the\n            Government on Performance Assessment Framework (PAF)\n            indicators in the past few years. There are several reasons\n            behind this conclusion. One, the PAF document itself is the\n            outcome of protracted negotiations and compromises between\n            different groups of donors and the Government. As such it\n            reflects the minimum common denominator as to what can be\n            achieved and is unlikely to be a true reflection of\n            Government's most strongly held priorities. Two, the\n            context of budget support in Zambia has changed; ODA has\n            declined dramatically as a share of Government's\n            resources and unless the PAF mimics Government's\n            strongly held priorities, it will have limited impact. The\n            Bank should manage transitions within the Bank team more\n            systematically. This is indeed a very general point but in\n            this particular case it became very important. The\n            Bank's absence from key PAF revision discussions due to\n            staff transition had significant implications for the PRSC.\n            It led to a misalignment between PAF and PRSC and strained\n            relations between the Bank, donors and government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - First, Second, and Third Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credits

approved in March 2010\n            and PRSC-2 (US$30 million equivalent) in February 2011. The\n            PRSC credits provide support to a policy and institutional\n            reform program emanating from government's development\n            strategy articulated in the Fifth National Development Plan\n            (FNDP) for the period 2006-2010 and other strategic\n            documents and reform programs prepared by the government.\n            The successor to the FNDP, the Sixth National Development\n            Plan (SNDP) for the period 2011-2015, was prepared by the\n            outgoing government and adopted in February 2011. The PRSC\n            program is in good alignment with SNDP as well. Policy\n            preferences of the new Patriotic Front (PF) government that\n            assumed office in September 2011 display commitment to the\n            reform activities monitored by the PRSC series. This was\n            evidenced in the team's policy discussions with the\n            government and progress being made on the activities. The\n            Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) identified budget support\n            as the primary instrument towards implementing Bank's\n            macroeconomic program over the period 2008-11. It provided a\n            resource envelope of 15-20 percent of the International\n            Development Association (IDA) country allocation for budget\n            support. The objectives of the Bank's macroeconomic\n            program identified in the CAS are to help Zambia in better\n            management of its financial resources, in improving\n            accountability and transparency in the use of financial\n            resources, and in implementing its reform programs to\n            improve public sector efficiency and business environment.\n            The PRSC process also provides a forum for broader policy\n            dialogue with the government and other major stakeholders."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - Third Poverty Reduction Support\n
