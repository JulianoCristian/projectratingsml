Among the many\n            lessons learned, and in the context of financial\n            sustainability, political priorities should have taken\n            place, to reflect ownership of the program by health sector\n            leaders, emphasizing, at the provincial ministries level,\n            institutional arrangements for the execution, operation, and\n            expansion of the program, an emphasis which would have\n            forced a resolution to the issue of institutional isolation\n            of child development activities, long before the end of the\n            project. Regarding investments, and although Argentina is\n            among the region's richest nations, the health sector\n            remains in a poor state of physical, and technical\n            development; thus investments in civil work, equipment, and\n            training have not been enough to infuse changes in the\n            culture of health care provision. Rather, project design\n            should have focused on a long-term health system, aligning\n            organization, and financing to achieve results in response\n            to demand, and partly, in a reform-oriented vision.\n            Monitoring, and evaluation should have been strengthened,\n            considering that the knowledge output of the project, was as\n            important as physical outputs, and, structuring financing,\n            but contingent on producing monitoring data."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Maternal and Child Health and\n

- Maternal and Child Health and\n            Nutrition Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project will assist the government\n            in improving the health and nutrition status of poor mothers\n            and children and promoting comprehensive care and\n            development of preschoolers in participating municipalities\n            in six provinces. The project will also support government\n            efforts to decentralize social service management and\n            financing from the provinces to the municipalities. The\n            project will be targeted to promote efficiency and service\n            quality improvements in existing maternal, child health,\n            nutrition and early childhood development programs. The\n            project has three principal components. The first one,\n            maternal, child health, and nutrition will reinforce the\n            capacity of maternal and child health and nutrition programs\n            to provide appropriate and timely care to low-income mothers\n            and children, both on an ambulatory basis and in maternity\n            wards and neonatal units of local hospitals. To this end,\n            the project will support the delivery of a package of basic\n            health and nutrition services that integrate health\n            promotion, disease prevention, early detection, and\n            treatment interventions. The second component, early\n            childhood development aims to support mental and social\n            development of children between the ages of 2 and 5 years.\n            To this end, the project will support the progressive\n            transformation of preschool feeding programs and\n            kindergartens into child development centers where services\n            would be offered, including nutrition, motivational\n            activities, and preschool education. The third component,\n            institutional strengthening will enhance the long-term\n            capacity of provinces and municipalities for planning,\n            managing, and implementing mother and child-related\n            activities. Under this component the project will finance\n            training activities, information systems, social\n            communication, technical assistance for reorganizing school\n            feeding programs, and studies. The project will also finance\n            the preparation of a second operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Maternal and Child Health and\n            Nutrition Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Maternal and Child\n            Health and Nutrition Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/07/734628/argentina-maternal-child-health-nutrition-project","projn":"AR-Maternal & Child Hlth & Nutrition\n            -- P006025","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Gender and Health,Health Systems Development & Reform,Health Economics & Finance","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Argentina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961004132923"},"subsc":"Health,Central government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"abortion,aged,aging,basic health care,basic\n            health services,beds,Birth Rate,cancer,child\n            development,childbirth,childhood,clinics,communicable\n            diseases,contraceptives,Death\n            Rate,deaths,diabetes,diet,employment,equipment,families,health\n            care,health care financing,health conditions,Health\n            education,health expenditures,health financing,health\n            insurance,health insurance plans,health policy,health\n            posts,health programs,health sector,health services,hospital\n            admission,hospital\n            admissions,hospitals,housing,Immunization,income,incomes,infants,insurance,insurance\n            companies,insurers,labor force,life\n            expectancy,managers,measles,media,medical\n            care,medicine,meningitis,migration,morbidity,Mortality,mothers,Nutrition,old\n            age,parasitic diseases,physicians,pregnancy,pregnant\n            women,primary health care,private sector,public\n            health,public sector,public services,schools,social\n            development,unemployment,urban areas,violence,waste"},"1":{"cdata!":"abortion,aged,aging,basic health care,basic\n            health services,beds,Birth Rate,cancer,child\n            development,childbirth,childhood,clinics,communicable\n            diseases,contraceptives,Death\n            Rate,deaths,diabetes,diet,employment,equipment,families,health\n            care,health care financing,health conditions,Health\n            education,health expenditures,health financing,health\n            insurance,health insurance plans,health policy,health\n            posts,health programs,health sector,health services,hospital\n            admission,hospital\n            admissions,hospitals,housing,Immunization,income,incomes,infants,insurance,insurance\n            companies,insurers,labor force,life\n            expectancy,managers,measles,media,medical\n            care,medicine,meningitis,migration,morbidity,Mortality,mothers,Nutrition,old\n            age,parasitic diseases,physicians,pregnancy,pregnant\n            women,primary health care,private sector,public\n            health,public sector,public services,schools,social\n            development,unemployment,urban areas,violence,waste"}},"owner":"Health Sector (LCSHH)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"11790"},"facets":{}}}
