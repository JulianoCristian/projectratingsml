(1) A project\n            supporting mandatory targets should carefully time project\n            support with the targets' timeline. (2) Early\n            communication to the final borrowers of the Bank's\n            project cycle and timing of availability of funding is\n            needed, especially when working with corporations. (3)\n            Advance procurement of technical assistance, on a\n            retroactively financed basis, and greater attention to final\n            recipients of the technical assistance could mitigate risks\n            of poor loan-financed TA execution. (4) Strong project\n            management units are needed to support finance bureaus in\n            supervising multiple subprojects. (5) The Bank needs to be\n            more proactive and clearer on initiating project restructuring."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Shandong Power Plant Flue Gas\n            Desulfurization
