All power\n            generating units which can be converted to fuel oil should\n            be modified to operate on dual firing, using gas in summer\n            and fuel oil in winter. In view of the constraints in future\n            gas supply GOP should take concrete measures to limit growth\n            in gas demand by curtailing future use of gas in thermal\n            power generation and exercise peak load shaving during peak\n            demand.
