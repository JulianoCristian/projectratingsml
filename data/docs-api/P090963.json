rural livelihoods and\n            health, and, facilitating an equitable, environmental,\n            social, and economic sustainable development. The Global\n            Environment Facility (GEF) will manage the Grant provided to\n            the World Fish Center (International Center for Living\n            Aquatic Resource Management - ICLARM), the International\n            Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry areas, the\n            African Center for Technology Studies, and the\n            Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture. The\n            project five components will: 1) develop a conceptual\n            framework and set of outlines for the global, and sub-global\n            assessments on the role of agricultural KST in reducing\n            poverty and hunger, improving rural livelihoods and health,\n            and facilitating an equitable, environmental, social, and\n            economic sustainable development; 2) prepare, peer review,\n            and approve a global assessment on the role of agricultural\n            science and technology for development, comprised of four\n            sections: a) context and concepts; b) plausible futures; c)\n            options for making agricultural KST work more effectively to\n            achieve the development, and sustainability goals; and, d)\n            options for making agricultural KST effective in achieving\n            the development and sustainability goals, i.e., investment\n            and policy; 3) prepare, peer review, and approve five\n            sub-global assessments on the role of agricultural science\n            and technology for development - Central and West Asia and\n            North Africa; East and South Asia and the Pacific; Latin\n            America and the Caribbean; North America and Europe; and,\n            Sub-Saharan Africa; 4) develop and implement a comprehensive\n            outreach and communications strategy; and, 5) implement an\n            effective project management and administration strategy to\n            support the inter-governmental process with a\n
