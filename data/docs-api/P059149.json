The experience\n            of both Economic Restructuring operations in Karnataka,\n            supports the conclusion that a series of single-tranche\n            adjustment operations, anchored through a medium-term reform\n            framework at the state-level, can be an effective instrument\n            to support reforms in India, through a demonstration effect.\n            It is suggested that smaller loans/credits foster\n            effectiveness, adding impetus to the reform program. Lessons\n            include the following. 1) undoubtedly, having a consolidated\n            fiscal target forced the government to look beyond the\n            budget, and introduce fiscal discipline into the power\n            sector. The falling financial losses of the sector bear\n            testimony to the success of this approach, and, clear\n            milestones for power sector reform also helped monitor\n            progress in this very difficult reform area. 2) Fiscal\n            targeting with respect to the budget needs to allow for\n            volatile growth given the dependence of states on\n            agriculture, and the dependence of agriculture on an\n            uncertain rainfall. Thus, nominal (Rupee) targets should be\n            adhered to wherever possible, at least until the fiscal\n            position is consolidated. Other lessons reinforce the notion\n            that institutional reforms take time, and difficult reforms\n            require cooperation across departments, such as the\n            industrial deregulation, which required the input from\n            departments as diverse as Environment, Labor and the\n            Inspectorate of Factories."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Second Karnataka
