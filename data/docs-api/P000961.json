Project sustainability for all five\n            projects is unlikely or non-evaluable.

The project\n            audits provide the building blocks for the sector review,\n            which finds impressive improvement. The projects offer six\n            main lessons: 1) Borrower capacity to provide counterpart\n            funding should be projected and realistically assessed, and\n            program design should be adjusted to match the findings of\n            that assessment. 2) There are opportunities for relatively\n            minor adjustments in project strategy and mechanisms which\n            can enhance poverty focus without risk to growth. 3)\n            Publicly funded agricultural research needs to focus not\n            simply on yield maximization but on financial profitability,\n            returns to labor, and the low input technology needs of the\n            poorer farmers. 4) to improve the efficiency of extension\n            services, a phased strategy is needed to increase the role\n            of cost recovery, private sector, community groups, and\n            nongovernmental organizations. 5) Regarding community\n            infrastructure investments, approaches that specifically\n            target the poor. 6) Likely impacts need to be addressed\n            through some form of short-term safety net."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -

will\n            be based on the principle of assisting farmers to increase\n            productivity of their presently cultivated farm lands, in\n            the low or marginal rainfall areas of Ghana.  The irrigation\n            investment should be operationally and economically\n            sustainable and, for this purpose, would be farmer-owned and\n            managed and appropriate in scale.  Where group operation is\n            not necessary, the schemes would be restricted to group\n            units of not more than thirty farmers, each farmer managing\n            about one hectare of irrigated crops on land which is\n            already under cropping.  A key aspect of the project would\n            be the training of farmers in proper and safe methods of\n            abstracting, distributing and managing the application of\n            water to the soil with due consideration for possible\n            hazards, such as damage to the soil, transmission of\n            water-borne diseases, pollution for chemicals used in crop\n            and soil management practices, excessive abstraction of\n            water from streams and aquifers, or restricting the use of\n            land and water to traditional user and not displacing\n            legitimate users."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Agricultural Sector Investment\n            Project : environmental impact of irrigation development\n            & mitigation measures"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Agricultural Sector\n            Investment Project : environmental impact of irrigation\n            development & mitigation measures"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/04/699036/ghana-agricultural-sector-investment-project-environmental-impact-irrigation-development-mitigation-measures","projn":"GH-Ghana:Agric Sector Invest -- P000961","subtopic":"Sanitation and Sewerage,Water Conservation,Drylands & Desertification,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Ghana","authors":{"authr":"Storm, E.P."},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970702135610"},"subsc":"Water supply,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Agro-industry, marketing, and trade,Central government administration,Roads and highways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"animals,aquifers,catchment,catchment\n            areas,channels,construction,crop production,downstream\n            users,environmental impact,erosion,Erosion\n            Control,farmers,farming,filtration,flooding,forage,forests,grasslands,grazing,irrigation,irrigation\n            channels,irrigation development,irrigation water,irrigation\n            water management,land\n            use,logging,mosquitos,orchards,pesticides,pollution,rainfall,reduced\n            flows,reservoirs,riparian,rivers,runoff,small-scale\n            irrigation,soil,soil fertility,soil management,soil\n            management practices,soils,surplus rainfall,toxic\n            chemicals,transportation,trees,valley bottoms,Water\n            abstraction,water conservation,water conservation\n            measures,water management,Water Quality,water\n            shortages,water supply,Water Uses,wells,woodland"},"1":{"cdata!":"animals,aquifers,catchment,catchment\n            areas,channels,construction,crop production,downstream\n            users,environmental impact,erosion,Erosion\n            Control,farmers,farming,filtration,flooding,forage,forests,grasslands,grazing,irrigation,irrigation\n            channels,irrigation development,irrigation water,irrigation\n            water management,land\n            use,logging,mosquitos,orchards,pesticides,pollution,rainfall,reduced\n            flows,reservoirs,riparian,rivers,runoff,small-scale\n            irrigation,soil,soil fertility,soil management,soil\n            management practices,soils,surplus rainfall,toxic\n            chemicals,transportation,trees,valley bottoms,Water\n            abstraction,water conservation,water conservation\n            measures,water management,Water Quality,water\n            shortages,water supply,Water Uses,wells,woodland"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 2 (AFTS2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF022173-PHRD 2-PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM II/PSDPS,TF020091-BELGIAN CTF/SDA II,TF020090-BELGIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF036258-GHANA - AGRICULTURE EXPORT PROMOTION","repnb":"E6"},"facets":{}}}
