The Bank\n            and borrower performance ratings were moderately\n            satisfactory.  The risk to development outcome was moderate.\n            Significant changes include a re-design of the Foshan sludge\n            treatment component and the restructuring paper amended the\n            project description of Part A.2.  Other changes included:\n            (a) reallocation of funds; (b) an increase in the\n            disbursement percentages; (c) a one year extension of the\n            loan closing date; and (d) amendments to the subsidiary loan\n            agreements.  Several lessons were learned. Projects that fit\n            into a broader government program can more easily maintain\n            relevance over time. The project remained relevant because\n            it fed into an active, broader government program to clean\n            up the Pearl River Delta (PRD).  It is important to be\n            realistic when defining the conditions that need to be in\n            place to ensure the financial and institutional\n            sustainability of project investments. Although raising\n            wastewater tariffs is necessary to improve cost recovery,\n            the Bank was too dogmatic about requiring full cost recovery\n            in utilities of the wastewater sector, and in trying to\n            promote an institutional model that was not accepted in the\n            case of Jiangmen. A better analysis of influent\n            characteristics is needed at the appraisal stage to avoid\n            overdesigning the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP).\n            Collection of wastewater is as important as treatment.\n            While in principle centralized approaches are preferred for\n            sludge treatment facilities to achieve economies of scale,\n            the analysis should be case specific and conducted using\n            real data rather than estimates and assumptions. Local\n            factors should be carefully considered such as gas prices,\n            distances from the different WWTPs to the centralized\n            treatment facility, the effect of the dilution problem in\n            the amount of sludge to be produced and policy restrictions\n            and/or market access issues related to the reuse of sludge\n            by-products. There is potential for extending collaboration\n            with the Bank to support innovative investments to keep\n            working on the environmental quality of the urban waterways\n            of the PRD and other similar regions in China."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Second Guangdong Pearl River Delta\n            Urban Environment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China -
