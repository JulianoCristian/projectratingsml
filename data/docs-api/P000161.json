Project\n            components comprise the following : 1) construction of the\n            Sefophe-Martin's Drift road, 134 km, to bitumen\n            standard, and village access roads; 2) construction of the\n            Bobonong-Lekkerpoet road, 66 km, including two short access\n            roads to the villages of Molalatau and Mathathane; and 3)\n            consulting services for construction supervision and for\n            preparation of a study for a new maintenance management /\n            organization system for roads, combined with a network\n            planning study."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Botswana - Tuli Block Roads Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Botswana - Tuli Block Roads Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1990/06/739170/botswana-tuli-block-roads-project","projn":"BW-Tuli Block Roads -- P000161","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Regional Rural Development,Banks & Banking Reform,Roads & Highways,Business in Development,Health Economics & Finance","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Botswana","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960929035617"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access roads,access to\n            markets,accessibility,agriculture,commercial property,cost\n            recovery,economic growth,employment,employment\n            opportunities,expenditures,housing,main\n            roads,marketing,marketing costs,Procurement,rate of\n            return,road infrastructure,Road investment,road\n            maintenance,road planning,road user charges,Roads,Technical\n            Assistance,traffic,traffic growth,Transport,water resources"},"1":{"cdata!":"access roads,access to\n            markets,accessibility,agriculture,commercial property,cost\n            recovery,economic growth,employment,employment\n            opportunities,expenditures,housing,main\n            roads,marketing,marketing costs,Procurement,rate of\n            return,road infrastructure,Road investment,road\n            maintenance,road planning,road user charges,Roads,Technical\n            Assistance,traffic,traffic growth,Transport,water resources"}},"owner":"WB Off:Pretoria - Southern AFR 1 (AFCS1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"P5303"},"441514":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1989/05/441514/botswana-tuli-block-roads-project-sefophe-martins-drift-road-environmental-impact-assessment","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1989/05/441514/botswana-tuli-block-roads-project-sefophe-martins-drift-road-environmental-impact-assessment","new_url":"1989/05/441514/botswana-tuli-block-roads-project-sefophe-martins-drift-road-environmental-impact-assessment","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/08/15/000094946_99040705592964/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/08/15/000094946_99040705592964/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"3248","docdt":"1989-05-31T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1999-08-15T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Botswana - Tuli Block Roads Project :\n            Sefophe-Martin's Drift Road - environmental impact assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This environmental impact statement\n            concerns the predetermined centre-line for the\n            Sefophe-Martin's Drift Road, a component of the Tuli\n            Block Roads Project in Botswana.
