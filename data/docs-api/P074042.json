There were five lessons learned:\n            1) Modification of consumer behavior is a lengthy process\n            that must be accounted for in the design and implementation\n            of projects. 2) The implementation of political reforms is a\n            complex process to which project results should be\n            cautiously linked. 3) Operations in conflict environments\n            require particular additional attention to the design of the\n            monitoring and evaluation framework. 4) Strong and sustained\n            leadership as an essential driver for institutional\n            development. 5) A procurement coordinator dedicated to the\n            project is essential for processing standard procedures and\n            facilitating timely
