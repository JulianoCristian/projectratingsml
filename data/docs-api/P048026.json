The design and preparation of\n            these projects must be based on broad-based stakeholder\n            participation, especially the project beneficiaries, and\n            must reflect national priorities, to help establish full\n            borrower ownership. In addition, project preparation should\n            include a thorough institutional and organizational analysis\n            of potential project agencies, to ensure appropriate project\n            implementation arrangements. Major institutional reform and\n            the adoption of new management systems require long-term\n            support and are only possible when there is broad commitment\n            from the borrower. The need for a project coordination unit\n            should be carefully assessed on a project by project basis\n            to ensure line agencies take full responsibility for project\n            implementation. Credit funds should be cancelled judiciously\n            in institutional reform projects, and only after it is\n            certain they will not be needed. The need for technical\n            assistance, especially long term consultancies, must be\n            critically assessed, and where it is needed, it must be\n            fielded on time, and preferably be grant financed.

improving the technology delivery system. The project\n            consists of two components: agricultural research and\n            extension service. The first component will: 1) strengthen\n            the agricultural research institutions by improving the\n            management information system, priority setting of research\n            programs, and monitoring implementation and evaluating\n            impact; 2) support human resource development by training\n            research scientists, and introduce a results-oriented and\n            performance-based reward system; 3) expand on-farm adaptive\n            research responsive to farmers needs; and 4) provide\n            facilities, infrastructure, and working capital for research\n            institutions. The second component will: 1) strengthen the\n            extension service by decentralizing to the grass roots level\n            and strengthening farmer self-help groups; 2) develop human\n            capital by training extension staff, and implement a reward\n            system based on results and performance; and 3) provide\n            facilities, infrastructure, and working capital for\n
