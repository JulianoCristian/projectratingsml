Lessons convey the\n            following. Research and experience suggest that reform\n            programs are more likely to succeed when owned, and designed\n            by the countries themselves, furthermore if supported by a\n            series of single-tranche adjustment operations, which are\n            better suited for supporting a multiple-year reform process.\n            Although this entails higher administrative costs for the\n            Bank, the process supports the required incentive mechanism,\n            and, facilitates an exit strategy for the Bank, if the\n            reform program falters. For example in this case, a\n            follow-up adjustment operation will be based on the\n            continuation of the reform program. However the pace of\n            progress of different components of a government-owned\n            reform program varies, thus it is important to determine the\n            critical elements of the program, where progress is needed,\n            and how would the pace sustain the credibility of the\n            overall program; i.e., in Andhra Pradesh, unless the\n            financial performance of the power sector is improved on a\n            sustained basis, the fiscal reform will remain tentative. A\n            possibility could have been to agree on specific actions\n            that would have helped improve the power sector financial\n            performance. Finally, it is highlighted that partnerships,\n            particularly with other external agencies, bring useful\n            technical, and financial resources, regardless of its higher costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Andhra Pradesh Economic Reform\n            Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Andhra Pradesh Economic\n            Reform Program

The\n            fiscal reform program aims for fiscal stabilization to\n            reduce the debt burden and restore sustainability to public\n            finances, improve public resource mobilization, and\n            restructure public spending toward priority development\n            areas. This is accompanied by public expenditure management\n            reform to strengthen financial management capacity and\n            institutions, improve the realism and credibility of the\n            budget, enhance fiscal transparency and accountability, and\n            introduce greater efficiency to operational management. The\n            program of governance reform includes strengthening\n            anti-corruption efforts, civil service reform, electronic\n            governance, public enterprise reform, and a program of\n            poverty monitoring and analysis.

The expected beenfits proceeding from this\n            project are: 1) strengthening the government's fiscal\n            and financial health; 2) a more conducive investment climate\n            for private sector growth; 30 more efficient and effective\n            public service delivery; and 4) improved social outcomes and\n            reduced poverty.
