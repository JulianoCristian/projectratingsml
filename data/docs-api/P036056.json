Ratings for the Judicial Reform Project for\n            Guatemala are as follows: outcome was satisfactory; risk to\n            the development outcome was negligible; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and Borrower performance\n            satisfactory. Ratings for the Judicial Conflict Resolution\n            Improvement Project for Colombia are as follows: outcome was\n            unsatisfactory; risk to the development outcome was\n            significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. This Project\n            Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) suggests three broad\n            lessons. The first is that it is important to adapt the\n            objectives and design of the project to local law,\n            conditions, and peculiarities. The second lesson highlights\n            the need for flexibility in overall approach in the\n            conception of the project. In addition, it is essential to\n            solicit local knowledge as well as input from specific\n            beneficiaries in the process of selecting project\n            objectives, design, and implementation arrangements. The\n            third lesson is that it is unwise to rely exclusively on\n            by-products of case management software to generate the data\n            needed for adequate monitoring and evaluation. The key\n            recommendation for initiatives in judicial reform is that\n            more resources should be invested in identifying local\n            experts to give them a leading role in the design,\n            execution, and evaluation of projects. This will facilitate\n            greater adaptation to the specific conditions of each\n            country, and ultimately ensure ownership and sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Judicial Reform Project, Guatemala\n            -

Judicial Reform Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project outcome is satisfactory,\n            sustainability likely, and institutional development impacts\n            are substantial. Lessons suggest the following. The\n            combination of a top-down and bottom-up approach has ensured\n            Ecuador's dialogue on the rule of law, expanded to\n            non-judicial and non-governmental groups. This participation\n            ensured that new areas be placed on the government's\n            reform agenda. Most notable, is that the Judiciary has been\n            generally receptive to maintaining a dialogue with civil\n            society on the rule of law, while the absence of strong\n            governmental actors meant the momentum for reform has been\n            concentrated within the Judiciary. This perhaps, is unique\n            to Ecuador, but by building on small steps, the\n            project's objective gradually encouraged the\n            judiciary's understanding of, and interest in, the\n            reforms. However, while the project concentrated on formal\n            justice in Ecuador's most populous cities, the\n            Ecuadorian Judiciary should ensure that future reforms be\n            implemented throughout the nation's courts, to ensure\n            that second class justice does not arise between urban, and\n            rural populations. Furthermore, while the project also\n            demonstrated the tremendous effort the Judiciary will still\n            need to uniformly implement the changes to the criminal\n            procedure code, the Bank project has provided the Judiciary\n            with concrete experience in implementing major judicial\n            reforms, though the country simply does not have the\n            capacity to carry out these reforms, and the short-term\n            effect of this will be an erosion of public confidence in\n            the judiciary--diminishing many gains made during the\n            project. Notwithstanding, given that new judicial\n            institutions are slow in building credibility; it is in this\n            framework that projects should not place undue emphasis on\n            their potential leadership."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador -
