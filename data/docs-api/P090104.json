The first lesson\n            learned in this project is to leverage IDA financing,\n            creating scalable islands of excellence.   Secondly, because\n            the privatization program is expected to trigger\n            dramatically increased investments in distribution\n            infrastructure, new operators will look for solutions to the\n            same challenges addressed under NEDP. Some of these best\n            practices that could be widely replicated in other\n            operations include: cluster approach, customized\n            specifications (transformers and PPMs), PPM split design,\n            stakeholder engagement, project readiness for implementation\n            during preparation, flexibility in project design, use Bank\n            projects to pilot
