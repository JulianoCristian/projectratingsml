Some lessons learned included:\n            Aceh's experience in the aftermath of the tsunami\n            illustrates both the critical importance of land rights in\n            reconstruction and reconstruction efforts, as well as the\n            vulnerability of land administration systems, particularly\n            those relying on paper records. Countries need to have\n            systems and policies for recovery in place prior to\n            disasters in order to be able to respond quickly and\n            effectively to natural disasters and other emergencies. In\n            the case of Indonesia, this is particularly prone to natural\n            disasters, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, volcanoes, and\n            forest fires, BPN (National Land Agency - Badan Pertanahan\n            Nasional) should seriously consider developing and legally\n            adopting a post-disaster strategy to guide rehabilitation\n            and reconstruction efforts with regard to land. A clear\n            commitment on the part of national authorities to protect\n            property rights is critical in avoiding large-scale land\n            grabbing and speculation. Moreover, customary land practices\n            are often designed as safety nets to protect the most\n            vulnerable groups, including women. Thus, it is of utmost\n            importance not to undermine these safety nets when\n            transitioning from customary rights to state-provided land\n            tenure and administration systems. Reconstruction efforts\n            can often open new opportunities. The damage to land records\n            as a result of the tsunami underscores the need to have\n            back-up systems. A further reminder of this occurred during\n            implementation when one of the field team base camps burned\n            down and records were lost."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Reconstruction of Aceh Land\n            Administration System Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Reconstruction of\n            Aceh Land Administration System Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/05/12685732/indonesia-reconstruction-aceh-land-administration-system-project","projn":"ID-Reconstruction Of Aceh Land\n            Administration System Project -- P095883","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Rural Land Policies for Poverty Reduction,Common Property Resource Development,Land Use and Policies,Urban Housing,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Urban Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Rural Development","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20100824005719"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Urban Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Rural Development","prdln":"Recipient Executed Activities","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, Audits, autonomy, Bank Ratings,\n            climate, commercial banks, communities, compensation,\n            conflict resolution mechanisms, construction,\n            decentralization, Financial Management, Habitat, housing,\n            housing construction, internal controls, land acquisition,\n            LAND ADMINISTRATION, land books, land grabbers, land\n            grabbing, Land Management, land market, land owners, land\n            ownership, land parcels, land property, land records, land\n            registers, land registration, land rights, land speculation,\n            land tenure, land title, land titles, land titling, land\n            transfers, land value, land values, landowner, landowners,\n            laws, legislation, local governments, military forces, oil,\n            private land, property ownership, property rights, real\n            estate, real estate developers, real estate markets,\n            renovation, resettlement, risk management, Rural\n            Development, sea, sites, Technical Assistance, urban areas, villages"}},"owner":"Indonesia Sustainable Devlpmnt (EASIS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF055353-RECONSTRUCTION OF ACEH LAND\n            ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM PROJECT,TF055432-RECONSTRUCTION OF ACEH LAND\n            ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM PROJECT","repnb":"ICR1306"},"23963218":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2006/04/23963218/reconstruction-aceh-land-administration-system-ralas","available_in":"English","virt_coll":"Results Profile","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2006/04/23963218/reconstruction-aceh-land-administration-system-ralas","new_url":"2006/04/23963218/reconstruction-aceh-land-administration-system-ralas","disclosure_date":"2015-02-05T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2015-02-05T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2015-02-05T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/02/05/000470435_20150205143536/Rendered/INDEX/9243302006Apr50S0PUBLIC0Box0385367B.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/02/05/000470435_20150205143536/Rendered/PDF/9243302006Apr50S0PUBLIC0Box0385367B.pdf","docdt":"2006-04-05T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2015-02-05T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Reconstruction of Aceh Land Administration\n            System (RALAS)"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"In much of Aceh, the tsunami and debris\n            obliterated all traces of property boundaries, so it is very\n            unsafe to start building houses because people might come\n            forward and claim rightful ownership of land on which\n            someone else has built a house. Also, reestablishing land\n            ownership is a major precondition for rebuilding\n            settlements. At the household level, secure tenure provides\n            access to credit and other benefits. The Reconstruction of\n            Aceh Land Administration System (RALAS) project seeks to\n            restore property rights using participatory processes. A\n            number of civil society organizations (big international\n            groups as well as Aceh-based ones) have been trained by this\n            World Bank-administered program to conduct Community Mapping\n            and Community Driven Adjudication processes. The survivors\n            of the community are brought together as a \"human\n            archive\" to discuss and agree whose property was where,\n            the shape of the property boundaries, and so forth. Then a\n            map is drawn up and all survivors and community leaders sign\n            the map - to say that this is indeed the record of the\n            village. This is then posted for a defined period in a\n            prominent place so that anyone who has a counter claim can\n            lodge it. If they do, there is adjudication by the whole\n            community but eventually the record is agreed to be true.\n            The Land Administration Agency, much of which was destroyed,\n            then comes in and draws up highly detailed maps and marks\n            out the property boundaries as the community indicated with\n            surveyor\u0092s poles. The next step is to give over legal title\n            to that land, which is very important because most of these\n            people, especially the poorest, have never had title deeds\n            to their lands. Even before the tsunami, only at most 25\n            percent of land ownership had been registered."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Reconstruction of Aceh Land Administration\n            System
