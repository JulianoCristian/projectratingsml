The lessons\n            learned indicate that support, ownership and commitment of\n            the top leadership of the government is critical not only\n            during project preparation but also during the crucial stage\n            of implementation. Appropriate institutional arrangements\n            for implementation - an inter-ministerial committee led by a\n            politically powerful policymaker/leader - should be\n            established so that it can manage coordination across\n            ministries, and when necessary overcome resistance to\n            implementation of agreed reforms. In a low-income country,\n            it is often difficult for outsiders like Bank staff to\n            distinguish between a commitment-related problem of\n            implementation and a capacity-related one. At the same time,\n            the urgency and importance of reform implementation created\n            situations where the top leadership was encouraged to move\n            Lao PDR officials with more competence and more capacity to\n            agencies/ministries that were charged with Financial\n            Management Adjustment Credit (FMAC) implementation. A\n            strong, knowledgeable and well-staffed PIU (in MOF for FMAC)\n            under the guidance of a senior competent official, empowered\n            to coordinate with other agencies, proved to be key in\n            ensuring follow-up and monitoring of actions by other\n            agencies and ministries involved in the FMAC-supported\n            reform areas. In the Lao PDR, disbursement of the second\n            tranche suffered from delays and slippages apparently due in\n            many ways to the less focused attention from the Borrower -\n            vs. the highly focused period of appraisal and negotiations\n            and the momentum built up for Board presentation. Capacity\n            building and institutional development activities that\n            effectively address critical needs of an economy in\n            transition in general and of the banking sector in\n            particular require a strong technical assistance program.\n            The integration of microfinance in the project helps to\n            create a poverty focus in the financial sector reform and\n            promotes microfinance as an integral part of the financial\n            sector activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lao - Financial Management Adjustment

Also supported by this component is natural\n            resources management; 2) the state-owned enterprise (SOE)\n            component focuses on strengthening oversight of financial,\n            and operational performance of SOEs, enterprise\n            restructuring, and rationalizing the regulatory framework.\n            Relevant issues in the power sector are also addressed in\n            this component; and, 3) the financial sector component seeks\n            to stabilize the financial conditions of the banks, to\n            strengthen them, and to launch micro-rural finance for\n            poverty reduction. Nonetheless, potential risks may occur\n            due to insufficient political will to complete reforms, to\n            lack of capacity and weak administrative incentives to\n            improve performance, and, to the possible political backlash\n            from electricity tariff, and other SOE price\n            liberalizations. However, benefits outweigh potential risks,\n            and, efforts to minimize risks include strong commitments to\n            reform, technical assistance to be provided under the\n            Financial Management Capacity Building Project, and, close\n            collaboration with the International Monetary Fund and major\n            bilateral donors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Laos -
