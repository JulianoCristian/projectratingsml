The overall performances of\n            both the Bank and the Borrower are rated satisfactory as\n            well. Some of the many lessons learned include the\n            following:1) This project demonstrates how a relatively\n            small investment (50 percent less than originally allocated)\n            can generate useful breakthroughs and innovations in teacher\n            education, a field generally considered to be conservative\n            and resistant to change. The project's model of using\n            centers of innovation to create and try out, on a limited\n            scale, new curricula, student screening and enrichment\n            programs, stronger linkages to secondary schools, improved\n            student teaching approaches, action research related to\n            instructional improvement, and in-service teaching turned\n            out to be a cost effective way to stimulate new ways of\n            doing things. 2) Although the main development objective of\n            the project was to enhance the teaching learning processes\n            in secondary schools through the improvement of teacher\n            education, the project never clearly demonstrated where\n            teacher education fits within a larger model of change\n            (improvement) in teaching and learning. Future projects\n            would do well to describe such a model of change and\n            describe how the other crucial determinants are also\n            supported. 3) A major design weakness in the project -- one\n            to be avoided in any further teacher training projects -- is\n            its failure to effectively use outcome measures to document\n            and assure project impact. Ultimately, efforts to improve\n            teacher education should be judged in terms of improved\n            knowledge and skills of training program graduates. Tracking\n            these throughout a change program is means of quality\n            assurance. The current project, with its \"entry level\n            assessment\" laid down an important baseline for student\n            change, but failed to use it effectively to demonstrate the\n            impact of remediation and the overall impact of the teacher\n            training through exit level testing. For practicing\n            teachers, the in-service training that was offered, and the\n            partnering with lecturers for action research and other\n            professional growth opportunities, were never assessed in\n            terms of observed changes in teacher performance; similarly\n            those university lecturers who completed masters or doctors\n            degrees were never called upon to demonstrate objectively\n            improvements in their own instruction. In the future,\n            teacher training programs need to have built-in mechanisms\n            for tracking and assuring changes in valued outcomes. 4)\n            Curricular revision of the kind envisioned in the Project --\n            geared to vertical, horizontal and external flexibility\n            allowing graduates to teach at both secondary levels (lower\n            and upper), to teach comfortably in more than one subject\n            area, and to compete for jobs outside the field of education\n            is a heavy and difficult task, more like structural reform\n            than curricular revision. The project's efforts created\n            some useful curricular materials but fell short of\n            establishing such reforms, largely because they were focused\n            too narrowly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Secondary School Teacher\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Secondary School\n            Teacher Development

teaching-learning processes in secondary schools through the\n            improvement of teacher education in 31 public teacher\n            training institutions (LPTKs). The project will support\n            activities in these institutions that promote quality and\n            efficiency in the preservice and inservice programs; build\n            educational research capacity; and enhance effective\n            management. Further, the project will support activities to\n            establish sustainable linkages between LTPKs and secondary\n            schools and to define a wider mandate, toward conversion to\n            university status for selected LTPKs. To achieve the above,\n            the project will have the following components: 1) improving\n            preservice and inservice teacher education; 2) strengthening\n            linkages to secondary schools; 3) raising the qualifications\n            of teacher educators; 4) building educational research\n            capacity; and 5) preparing for a wider mandate."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Secondary School Teacher\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Secondary School\n            Teacher Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/01/732611/indonesia-secondary-school-teacher-development-project","projn":"ID-Secondary School Teacher Development -- P004003","subtopic":"Gender and Education,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Primary Education,Curriculum & Instruction,Teaching and Learning","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","teratopic":"Education,Gender,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961008071919"},"subsc":"Tertiary education,Central Government,Secondary education","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education,Gender,Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ACADEMIC YEAR,accreditation,addition,basic\n            education,call,Community\n            Health,curricula,curriculum,curriculum content,distance\n            education,education,education activities,education\n            projects,Education Quality,educational\n            environments,educational levels,educational\n            research,employment,enrollment,families,female\n            teachers,Formal Education,Inservice Teacher\n            Education,inservice training,interventions,investment in\n            education,languages,learning,learning materials,learning\n            processes,library books,Non-Formal Education,Nutrition,Open\n            University,performance indicators,practicum,Primary\n            Education,Primary School,primary schools,Private\n            Sector,projects,Public institutions,quality\n            control,Reading,refresher courses,research capacity,rural\n            areas,rural schools,Safety,Scholarships,school\n            enrollments,Secondary Education,secondary school\n            students,secondary school teachers,secondary schools,social\n            studies,social studies curriculum,staff development,student\n            achievement,student enrollments,Teacher,Teacher\n            Development,teacher education,teacher educators,Teacher\n            training,teachers,teaching,teaching assignments,teaching\n            materials,teaching practice,teaching programs,teaching staff,textbooks,translation,youth"},"1":{"cdata!":"ACADEMIC YEAR,accreditation,addition,basic\n            education,call,Community\n            Health,curricula,curriculum,curriculum content,distance\n            education,education,education activities,education\n            projects,Education Quality,educational\n            environments,educational levels,educational\n            research,employment,enrollment,families,female\n            teachers,Formal Education,Inservice Teacher\n            Education,inservice training,interventions,investment in\n            education,languages,learning,learning materials,learning\n            processes,library books,Non-Formal Education,Nutrition,Open\n            University,performance indicators,practicum,Primary\n            Education,Primary School,primary schools,Private\n            Sector,projects,Public institutions,quality\n            control,Reading,refresher courses,research capacity,rural\n            areas,rural schools,Safety,Scholarships,school\n            enrollments,Secondary Education,secondary school\n            students,secondary school teachers,secondary schools,social\n            studies,social studies curriculum,staff development,student\n            achievement,student enrollments,Teacher,Teacher\n            Development,teacher education,teacher educators,Teacher\n            training,teachers,teaching,teaching assignments,teaching\n            materials,teaching practice,teaching programs,teaching staff,textbooks,translation,youth"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF021251-PHRD-JAPANESE CTF (USD ACCOUNT),TF032654-INDONESIA - EDUCATION,TF025209-PHRD-SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHER DEV.","repnb":"P6718"},"facets":{}}}
