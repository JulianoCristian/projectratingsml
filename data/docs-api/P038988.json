Heilongjiang Agriculture\n            Development Project centering on livestock and breeding,\n            aquatic production, livestock product processing,\n            agroprocessing, linseed processing, and seed coating. The\n            mitigation measures planned for projects of aquatic products\n            and livestock breeding are to: (1) Level, restore, and plant\n            trees and grass on the destroyed topsoil and vegetation in\n            the neighborhood to prevent erosion; (2) Keep and improve\n            soil fertility and increase output by growing, breeding, and\n            processing project production, and by using animal\n            fertilizer in the fields; (3) Adopt rotation of planting\n            grass and raising animals to avoid soil erosion of grazing\n            pasture, particularly on grass mountains and hills; (4)\n            Educate people not to hunt illegally or kill recklessly; (5)\n            Clean and remove excreta, form them into field fertilizer,\n            and set up veterinary stations to prevent and treat animal\n            and fowl diseases; (6) Control fishing waters and reduce fly\n            and mosquito breeding and disease spreading; (7) Strengthen\n            ecological cultivation technology to reduce chemical\n            fertilizer impact on soil; (8) Stop building fish ponds in\n            winter and restore vegetation on destroyed topsoil; and (9)\n            set up protected areas preventing livestock breeding, cash\n            crop growing, fishing, or factory processing. Waste water,\n            gas, noise, and cinder pose environmental problems in farm\n            and animal products processing to be mitigated by: (1)\n            Aerobically and chemically treating waste water, leakage\n            prevention measures in the factory to prevent underground\n            water pollution including a ban on water storage ponds; (2)\n            Using a multi-tubing high efficiency dust with or without\n            waterfilm; (3) treating solid wastes from animal husbandry\n            products processing or transporting them to other factories\n            for use; (4) disposing of solid wastes from grain and crop\n            processing by burying or mixing them for carbon fuels, and\n            sending them to the boiler to burn or to the forage factory;\n            (5) Transporting cinder to brickmaking factories; (6) Using\n            the anoxybiotic method on dirty mud and animal excrement to\n            produce farm fertilizer; and (7) Using sound insulating,\n            vibration reducing measures, and a sound eliminating device\n            as well as afforestation to reduce noise."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Heilongjiang Agriculture Development\n            Project : summary report on environment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Heilongjiang Agriculture\n            Development Project : summary report on environment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/12/441307/china-heilongjiang-agriculture-development-project-summary-report-environment","projn":"CN-Heilongjiang Agricultural Development -- P038988","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Sanitation and Sewerage,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"China","authors":{"authr":"Heilongjiang Province Environmental\n            Protection Institute"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980429110118"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Animal production,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,General public administration sector,Agro-industry","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"activated sludge,air pollution,air\n            quality,anaerobic treatment,animal\n            husbandry,animals,Atmospheric\n            Pollutants,BOD,Boilers,bones,canals,chemical\n            treatment,coal,COD,condensation,Construction,discharge,Domestic\n            use,effluent,Environmental Protection,environmental\n            quality,excreta,farms,fe,fish,fish\n            ponds,fishing,freezing,gas,grazing,heat,heating,hydrogen,livestock\n            produCtion,oil,organic\n            matter,oxidation,oxygen,pH,pollution,pond,pond water,Project\n            Management,public health,quality\n            standards,sand,screening,sea,sedimentation,sewage,soil\n            erosion,soil fertility,solid waste,Solid Waste\n            Disposal,solid wastes,sulfur,Surface\n            Water,tanks,trees,waste,waste disposal,waste water,waste\n            water treatment,wastes,wastewater,water film,Water\n            Pollution,water quality,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"activated sludge,air pollution,air\n            quality,anaerobic treatment,animal\n            husbandry,animals,Atmospheric\n            Pollutants,BOD,Boilers,bones,canals,chemical\n            treatment,coal,COD,condensation,Construction,discharge,Domestic\n            use,effluent,Environmental Protection,environmental\n            quality,excreta,farms,fe,fish,fish\n            ponds,fishing,freezing,gas,grazing,heat,heating,hydrogen,livestock\n            produCtion,oil,organic\n            matter,oxidation,oxygen,pH,pollution,pond,pond water,Project\n            Management,public health,quality\n            standards,sand,screening,sea,sedimentation,sewage,soil\n            erosion,soil fertility,solid waste,Solid Waste\n            Disposal,solid wastes,sulfur,Surface\n            Water,tanks,trees,waste,waste disposal,waste water,waste\n            water treatment,wastes,wastewater,water film,Water\n            Pollution,water quality,wells"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF022211-CANADIAN GENERAL CTF II-CHINA,TF029272-PHRD-HEILONGJIANG AGRICULTURAL\n            DEVELOPMENT PROJECT --,TF029388-PHRD-HEILONGJIANG AGRICULTURAL\n            DEVELOPMENT PROJECT --","repnb":"E167"},"facets":{}}}
