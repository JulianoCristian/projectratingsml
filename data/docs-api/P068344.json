Due to the impact\n            of the severe macroeconomic developments in Argentina, the\n            CPRL is being reformulated in terms of amendments to\n            individual conditions and its tranching. The proposed\n            amendment would allow the Province of Cordoba to meet the\n            overall objectives of its reform program, as previously\n            approved by the Board, by taking into account the impact of\n            subsequent and fundamental changes in the macroeconomic and\n            investment environment and social conditions in Argentina.\n            The proposed amendment remains firmly grounded in the\n            overall objectives of the loan to promote fiscal stability\n            at the provincial level, strengthen the role of private\n            capital and the business climate, and promote structural\n            reforms to improve the efficiency, quality and equity of\n            public spending, particularly in the social sectors, in\n            Cordoba.The proposed reformulation would amend the original\n            second and third tranches of $100 million each, while\n            splitting the original third tranche into a revised third\n            tranche of $25 million and a new fourth tranche of $75\n            million. This approach reflects the substantial progress\n            made so far in the implementation of the reform program, and\n            it provides for the reframing of a consistent program in\n            response to the changes in the country environment through\n            an upfront agreement on revised targets to achieve the\n            agreed development goals. Upon the Board's approval of\n            the proposed reformulation, and the declaration of\n            effectiveness of the legal amendment, the Bank would advise\n            the authorities that the revised second and third tranches\n            for a total amount of $125 million would be available for withdrawal."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina Proposed Amendments/Waivers of the\n
