Some lessons learned included:\n            coordination with other multilaterals and bilateral\n            institutions enhances the impact of Bank operations. FSDPL I\n            was part of a package of support for the Jamaica Debt\n            Exchange (JDX) by International Financial Institutions\n            (IFIs) and bilateral donors, and its impact was amplified by\n            complementary programs by the International Monetary Fund\n            (IMF) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). Use of\n            high level outcome indicators to measure progress can be\n            problematic. Since this was an operation that was meant to\n            enhance debt and fiscal sustainability, it made sense, a\n            priori, to include quantitative measures such as the primary\n            balance to gross domestic product (GDP) and debt to GDP. In\n            hindsight, however, it was clear that these outcomes are\n            well beyond the control of the Bank or the Government. The\n            impact of the global crisis, the Supreme Court ruling on\n            wages, and an early election on these indicators was\n            something that was difficult to counter with the measures\n            envisaged in the FSDPL series. The use of technical\n            assistance and/or investment lending to bolster capacity can\n            help achieve results on reforms. Including privatization of\n            specific enterprises as an outcome indicator is problematic."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Program of Development Policy\n            Loans for Fiscal Sustainability"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jamaica - Program of Development\n            Policy Loans for Fiscal Sustainability"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/09/17002174/jamaica-program-development-policy-loans-fiscal-sustainability","projn":"JM-2nd.

Executive\n            Directors expressed support for the DPL and the overall\n            design of the program, and that its three main policy areas\n            are an adequate foundation for the Government's\n            long-term development strategy. Executive Directors observed\n            that the DPL builds upon progress made under the previous\n            operation and that the DPL's coverage of fiscal reforms\n            is a key determinant of economic stability and a foundation\n            for inclusive growth. Executive Directors also noted the\n            delays in the IMF program and encouraged the Jamaican\n            authorities to take steps to conclude the fourth and fifth\n            reviews under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Stand-By\n            Arrangement. Executive Directors acknowledged the external\n            and internal challenges that remain and encouraged further\n            efforts by the authorities in improving fiscal and debt\n            sustainability. They urged continued collaboration among\n            development partners to ensure successful implementation of\n            this project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Second Programmatic Fiscal\n            Sustainability Development Policy Loan Project : summary of discussion"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jamaica - Second Programmatic\n            Fiscal Sustainability Development Policy Loan Project :\n            summary of discussion"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/09/15024135/jamaica-second-programmatic-fiscal-sustainability-development-policy-loan-project-summary-discussion","projn":"JM-2nd.

This program document describes\n            the single-tranche FSDPL2 in the amount of US$100 million\n            for Jamaica. The operation builds on the progress made under\n            the Bank's previous FSDPL and the FSDPL1, February\n            2010. The reform program supported by the DPL is the\n            manifestation of the Jamaican Government's strategy to\n            increase fiscal and debt sustainability, improve\n            macroeconomic stability, and accelerate growth. Reflecting\n            the most pressing concerns at the time of operation\n            preparation, the focus of the Government's program has\n            been primarily on the first objective of fiscal and debt\n            sustainability. However, the Government of Jamaica (GoJ) has\n            made significant progress towards achievement of its\n            objectives in each of these three areas, despite the\n            difficult external environment and the slow pace of recovery\n            from the adverse effects of the global crisis. The GoJ\n            remains committed to its medium term reform program under a\n            challenging environment. The GoJ recognizes the importance\n            of improving macroeconomic stability and paving the way for\n            accelerated growth while protecting the poor. The\n            macroeconomic environment was strengthened substantially by\n            the successful implementation of Government's reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Second Programmatic Debt and\n            Fiscal Sustainability Development Policy Loan Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jamaica - Second Programmatic\n            Debt and Fiscal Sustainability Development Policy Loan Program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/08/14813245/jamaica-second-programmatic-debt-fiscal-sustainability-development-policy-loan-program","projn":"JM-2nd.
