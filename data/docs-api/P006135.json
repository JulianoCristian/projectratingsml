The project consists of: (a) a 14-well appraisal\n            drilling program; (b) an initial phase oil secondary\n            recovery project plant in Monteagudo; (c) a 1,600 line-km\n            seismic survey, with data processing and interpretation of\n            such 1,600 line-km and of additional 700 line-km of previous\n            seismic surveys, reprocessing and reinterpretation of an\n            additional 250 line-km seismic survey, all for certification\n            of gas reserves; and (d) a study of Bolivia's domestic\n            gas market and a pre-feasibility study of a gas export\n            project.
