Borrower performance is satisfactory based on the\n            ratings of project preparation, implementation, and\n            outcomes. Lessons learned include the following points:\n            Programmatic adjustment lending to selected states of India\n            can be an effective instrument for supporting fiscal reforms\n            at the state level. When policy formulation and reform\n            implementation capacity is weak, as in the case of Uttar\n            Pradesh, a more strategic design can lead to a more focused\n            but deeper dialogue. Detailed listing and auditing of a\n            subset of line items within the expenditure budget,\n            identified as High Priority Development Expenditures, tends\n            to create a \"budget within a budget\"--a better\n            approach would encourage reprioritization within the budget,\n            in the context of an improved budget process, while avoiding\n            micro-management. In establishing an effective poverty and\n            social monitoring system, emphasis should be placed from the\n            outset on a) institutionalizing a system of periodic\n            collection and analysis of data; and b) fostering demand for\n            the use of such data, both within and outside the government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Uttar Pradesh Fiscal Reform and\n

This\n            will be achieved by transforming the role of Government,\n            through civil service reforms, which will prod transparency,\n            deregulation, and will strengthen anti-corruption\n            institutions, through decentralization, and improved\n            financial management, and accountability. The credit/loan\n            will be disbursed in one tranche, being the first operation\n            within a proposed sequence of operations. Improved fiscal\n            adjustments, and social services delivery, are benefits\n            which will prod economic growth, while reducing poverty, in\n            addition to the beneficial contributions in the overall\n            reduction of public sector borrowing requirements. However,\n            the possible reverse in the reform agenda due to political\n            opposition, and, the weak institutional capacity, are major\n            risks to be taken into
