The primary development objectives of the project\n            were defined as follows: (a) to assist the GOI in improving\n            overall management of the sector; (b) enhance Perusahaan\n            Umum Telekomuinikasi, PERUMTEL\u2019s (Telecommunications Public\n            Corporation) institutional capability; and (c) support\n            cost-effective and efficient implementation of a large\n            investment program. The performance of the Borrower, the\n            Beneficiary and of the Bank were all highly satisfactory.\n            Three important lessons were learned during the\n            implementation of the project : (i) first,is active\n            participation and commitment of all stakeholders not only\n            during implementation but also preparation are prerequisites\n            for success in reforming of public utilities operating in\n            monopoly environment; (ii) second lesson, continuity of\n            competent and committed personnel, with proper skill mix, at\n            the Borrower, Project Entity, and the Bank, and above all,\n            decisive leadership by the Borrower are critical to the\n            creation of mutual trust and understanding for resolving the\n            many sensitive issues involved in sector reform of large\n            public utilities; (iii) third, inclusion of policy\n            conditionality\u2019s in loan

3) computerized\n            network administration system; 4) outside plant maintenance\n            center ( OPMC ); and 5) capacity utilization of all existing\n            telecommunications facilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Third Telecommunications Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Third\n            Telecommunications Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1990/03/738266/indonesia-third-telecommunications-project","projn":"ID-Telecom.Iii -- P003973","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Telecommunications Infrastructure,ICT Policy and Strategies,Economic Theory & Research,Rural Communications,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Public Sector Development","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960928134354"},"subsc":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Public Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Information and communications","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting,calls,carrier\n            systems,circuits,cities,coaxial\n            cables,collaboration,competitive bidding,computer\n            systems,contractors,cost\n            effectiveness,decision-making,digital switching,digital\n            switching equipment,earth stations,Economic\n            Cooperation,Electricity,electronic maiL,facsimile,fiber\n            optic transmission,Financial\n            Management,forecasts,GDP,gentex,government\n            regulation,government regulations,Gross domestic\n            product,interest rate,International Telecommunication\n            Union,municipalities,new technologies,organizational\n            structure,private networks,private sector,private sector\n            participation,programs,public sector,Quality of\n            Service,radio,revenue sharing,Satellites,service\n            providers,service quality,submarine\n            cables,subscribers,switching systems,Technical\n            Assistance,Telecommunication,telecommunication\n            services,Telecommunications,telecommunications\n            company,telecommunications equipment,telecommunications\n            facilities,Telecommunications Investment,telecommunications\n            legislation,telecommunications networks,telecommunications\n            operations,TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR,telecommunications\n            services,telegraph,telegraph offices,Telephone,telephone\n            density,Telephone Lines,telephone service,telephone\n            services,telephones,TEXT,training\n            centers,transmission,transmission systems,VHF,VSAT"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounting,calls,carrier\n            systems,circuits,cities,coaxial\n            cables,collaboration,competitive bidding,computer\n            systems,contractors,cost\n            effectiveness,decision-making,digital switching,digital\n            switching equipment,earth stations,Economic\n            Cooperation,Electricity,electronic maiL,facsimile,fiber\n            optic transmission,Financial\n            Management,forecasts,GDP,gentex,government\n            regulation,government regulations,Gross domestic\n            product,interest rate,International Telecommunication\n            Union,municipalities,new technologies,organizational\n            structure,private networks,private sector,private sector\n            participation,programs,public sector,Quality of\n            Service,radio,revenue sharing,Satellites,service\n            providers,service quality,submarine\n            cables,subscribers,switching systems,Technical\n            Assistance,Telecommunication,telecommunication\n            services,Telecommunications,telecommunications\n            company,telecommunications equipment,telecommunications\n            facilities,Telecommunications Investment,telecommunications\n            legislation,telecommunications networks,telecommunications\n            operations,TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR,telecommunications\n            services,telegraph,telegraph offices,Telephone,telephone\n            density,Telephone Lines,telephone service,telephone\n            services,telephones,TEXT,training\n            centers,transmission,transmission systems,VHF,VSAT"}},"owner":"Indonesia Headquarters Unit (EACIQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"8251"},"facets":{}}}
