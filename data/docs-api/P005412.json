 agriculture within the overall constraints in public\n            resources. To achieve this objective, actions have been\n            taken and others will be implemented in the following 18\n            months, to:  (i) complete a restructuring of the investment\n            program; (ii) re-orient the prices and incentives framework;\n            (iii) strengthen agricultural support services including\n            rationalizing the role of the private sector; and (iv) build\n            institutional capacity for agricultural planning and policy\n            analysis. The adjustment program is described in the\n            Government's letter to the Bank of Sector Development\n            Policies. The foreign exchange provided by the Loan would be\n            used to finance an agreed program of imports of inputs\n            needed for stimulating agricultural production, including\n
