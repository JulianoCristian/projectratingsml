Some lessons\n            learned included: Under current practice, the employer has\n            no recourse for negligence by service providers. Chongqing\n            Drainage Company (CDC) incurred additional costs that can be\n            rightfully assigned to weak designs, investigations, and\n            construction supervision in the implementation of the\n            drainage component. Similarly, the solid waste company\n            incurred additional costs due to inaccurate geotechnical\n            investigations for the landfill that were done by a\n            specialized design institute. There is no mechanism or\n            regulations for the clients to seek any form of compensation\n            for professional negligence by the service providers. It may\n            be opportune for the Government to consider introduction\n            professional liability requirements along with clear\n            accountability and professional insurance from domestic\n            service providers. The emerging Chinese institutional model\n            for the water sector comprises a holding company owning all\n            wastewater and water supply assets, and providing a\n            treatment fee to the wastewater company as a service\n            provider; hence the traditional covenants cannot be applied\n            as the company has no revenues other than the treatment fee,\n            and at times, no assets. The model has also been adopted in\n            Beijing, Foshan, and Liaoning Province. The traditional\n            wastewater utility institutional model used by the Bank;\n            needs to be reviewed and modified in future projects in the\n            light of this development. The financial performance\n            covenants would have little relevance if this issue is not addressed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Chongqing Urban Environment

Project components include wastewater management\n            and municipal solid waste management; urban water supply;\n            water quality monitoring and management; and institutional\n            strengthening. Surface water may be polluted as a result of\n            leachate discharge at the landfill site. This will be\n            mitigated by minimizing the area exposed to air. Wastewater\n            produced by construction will be collected and performed\n            sedimentation on it before discharge. Air pollution produced\n            by gas and dust at the landfill site will be mitigated by\n            planting trees to isolate the site.

The risk of altering traditional soil usage will be\n            reduced by reserving the upper layer of the landfill site.\n            Using refuse and sludge generated from the sewage plant as\n            fertilizer will be considered after an analysis of the\n            sludge composition.

Project components include wastewater management\n            and municipal solid waste management; urban water supply;\n            water quality monitoring and management; and institutional\n            strengthening. Surface water may be polluted as a result of\n            leachate discharge at the landfill site. This will be\n            mitigated by minimizing the area exposed to air. Wastewater\n            produced by construction will be collected and performed\n            sedimentation on it before discharge. Air pollution produced\n            by gas and dust at the landfill site will be mitigated by\n            planting trees to isolate the site. Noise during\n            construction will be mitigated by logically arranging\n            construction time and selecting low noise equipment.\n            Destruction of vegetation during construction will be\n            mitigated by planting trees and preventing water and soil\n            runoff. The risk of altering traditional soil usage will be\n            reduced by reserving the upper layer of the landfill site.\n            Using refuse and sludge generated from the sewage plant as\n            fertilizer will be considered after an analysis of the\n            sludge composition. By arranging pipe projects into\n            subsections during construction, the risk of large scale\n            soil runoff from the discarded soil will be
