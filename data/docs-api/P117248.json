Both the Bank and the Borrower received\n            highly unsatisfactory ratings for their respective\n            performances. There were four Level 2 restructurings of the\n            project. These restructurings involved changes in project\n            design, the revision of the results framework, an increase\n            in the funding allocation from, and a closing date extension\n            by two months, which applied only to one specific project\n            activity to allow students in an ongoing Masters program to\n            finish their program. There were several lessons learned\n            from this project and include the following: (1) project\n            goals could have been less ambitious, more prioritized and\n            sequenced, and better informed by previous projects and\n            known capacity constraints, (2) more effective consultation\n            with government about their priorities and more active\n            questioning of paper commitments would also likely have led\n            to a less ambitious project, (3) the consequences of the\n            lack of a results framework, and results chain analysis was\n            evident in the design and implementation. In the absence of\n            a more logical explanation of why the public financial\n            management (PFM) reforms were being prioritized the links\n            between activities to the objectives were ill defined, (4)\n            greater use could have been made of the available resources\n            to supplement the technical knowledge of the task team,\n            especially to provide more intensive oversight of critical\n            activities, (5) more up front work to clarify the (PFM) IT\n            strategy, system architecture and user requirements, is\n            advised before committing large amounts of funding to a\n            financial management information system (FMIS) Project, and\n            (6) allowing the normal rules preventing officials being\n            hired as consultants to be circumvented carries significant risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Deepening Medium Term Budget\n            Framework (MTBF) and Strengthening

This\n            restructuring paper discusses two changes to the project: 1)\n            a revision of the results framework for the project to\n            adequately capture the achievement of project development\n            objectives, intermediate results; and 2) an amendment of the\n            grant agreement to enable the project to extend the terms of\n            the position as communications specialist from 24 months to\n            45 months and to remove from the grant agreement specific\n            terms of contracts for specialist positions under the\n            Project Management Coordination Unit (PMCU). During the 2012\n            restructuring, a revision of the result framework was\n            initiated to simplify the original framework, which\n            contained more than sixty indicators, and reflect the change\n            in component structure. The results framework is to be\n            revised for the project to adequately capture the\n            achievement of project development objectives, intermediate results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Deepening Medium\n            Term Budget Framework (MTBF) and Strengthening Financial\n            Accountability Project : restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2013/07/18041825/bangladesh-deepening-medium-term-budget-framework-mtbf-strengthening-financial-accountability-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"BD-Deepening Mtbf And Strengthening\n            Financial Accountability -- P117248","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Urban Economics,Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Labor Policies,Debt Markets,Public Financial Management","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Social Protections and Labor,Urban Development","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20130726115959"},"theme":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","subsc":"Public administration- Financial Sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Social Protections and Labor,Urban Development","prdln":"Recipient Executed Activities","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accountability, Bank policies, Borrower,\n            budget management, budget process, Disbursement, expenditure\n            management, financial accountability, Ministry of Finance,\n            public expenditure, public expenditure management, public services"}},"owner":"Governance & Public Sector (SASGP)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF095283-Deepening Medium Term Budget\n            Framework and Strengthening Financial Acco,TF095284-Deepening MTBF and\n            Strengthening Financial Accountability Project- Bank","majtheme":"Public sector governance","repnb":"79766"},"facets":{}}}
