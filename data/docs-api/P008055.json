The key lessons learned are: a) Considering\n            the political and administrative context of projects is\n            important in order to minimize the risks of transition or\n            administration changes. b) It is important to develop an\n            evaluation culture among staff at different levels. c) There\n            is a need to focus on the school autonomy concept in an\n            operational way. d) To achieve a better integration of the\n            various components during implementation, it would have been\n            necessary to rely on gradual interventions and pilot\n            experiences. e) The quality of training institutions and\n            programs needs to be improved. f) This project is able to\n            finance the quality improvement component with not just Bank\n            funding, but also national counterpart funds. g) The absence\n            of a single authority in charge of defining and implementing\n            education policies and regulations for the entire education\n            system hinders the proper function of the system. h)\n            Stronger supervision and monitoring mechanisms are needed
