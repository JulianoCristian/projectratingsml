This project demonstrates\n            the financial viability of small and medium-sized loans for\n            agricultural enterprises at market rates of interest, and\n            the potential for the commercial banks to play an increasing\n            role in servicing this emerging market. At the same time,\n            the present situation of very high real and nominal interest\n            rates does not demonstrate that market rates are preferable\n            to the subsidized climate. Bank performance is in part\n            deficient and in part satisfactory while Borrower\n            performance is satisfactory overall. Lessons learned\n            specific to the project include: A project design relying\n            upon case by case analyses of loans in certain subsectors or\n            involving some commodities should be avoided if possible.\n            The role of commercial banks in environmentally screening of\n            projects submitted to them for financing would be better\n            backed by a national code governing all their lending\n            activities. The degree of convergence between government and\n            Bank policies should not be overstated: the lesson here is\n            that when full consensus is lacking, different views should\n            be discussed and operational issues addressed. The principle\n            of a government passing public debt to private interests and\n            necessitating a government guarantee of private sector\n            activities should be scrutinized. Any financial sector\n            project should review the continuing soundness of the institutions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Agricultural Financing Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia -
