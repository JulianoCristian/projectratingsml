The project faces\n            few risks, although the implementation schedule is dependent\n            on the timely acquisition of seed nuts from other coconut\n            growing countries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Coconut Pilot Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Coconut Pilot Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/08/726329/tanzania-coconut-pilot-project","projn":"TZ-Coconut Pilot -- P002731","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Tanzania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912492777"},"subsc":"(Historic)Perennial crops","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural commodities,agricultural\n            extension,agricultural inputs,Agricultural\n            Marketing,agricultural production,Agricultural\n            Products,agricultural research institutes,Agriculture,Audit\n            Reports,availability of seed,average yields,capita\n            consumption,cash crops,cassava,cattle,CGIAR,Coconut,coconut\n            industry,coconut oil,Coconut Products,coconut\n            research,coconuts,coffee,Cooperatives,copra,copra,cotton,crop,crop\n            production,cultivation,dairy products,demand for\n            food,development projects,diet,Diseases,dry\n            season,eggs,equipment,export crops,extension\n            services,families,farm,farmer,farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,farms,fertilizer,fish,fisheries,food crops,food\n            grains,food\n            production,foodgrains,forestry,fruits,fungi,GNP,harvests,husbandry,hybrid\n            seed,hybrids,hygiene,imports,income,income\n            distribution,Intercropping,international agricultural\n            research,livestock,livestock research,maize,Managers,market\n            prices,meat,MOA,nematodes,nurseries,Palm oil,palms,pest\n            control,Pests,Plant Breeding,plant\n            protection,plantations,planting,population\n            growth,prices,produce,producers,production costs,public\n            sector,replanting,rice,Rural Development,rural\n            population,rural roads,schools,Seed,seedlings,sisal,social\n            services,soils,sugar,tea,the Consultative\n            Group,tobacco,UNDP,vegetables,water supply,wheat,yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural commodities,agricultural\n            extension,agricultural inputs,Agricultural\n            Marketing,agricultural production,Agricultural\n            Products,agricultural research institutes,Agriculture,Audit\n            Reports,availability of seed,average yields,capita\n            consumption,cash crops,cassava,cattle,CGIAR,Coconut,coconut\n            industry,coconut oil,Coconut Products,coconut\n            research,coconuts,coffee,Cooperatives,copra,copra,cotton,crop,crop\n            production,cultivation,dairy products,demand for\n            food,development projects,diet,Diseases,dry\n            season,eggs,equipment,export crops,extension\n            services,families,farm,farmer,farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,farms,fertilizer,fish,fisheries,food crops,food\n            grains,food\n            production,foodgrains,forestry,fruits,fungi,GNP,harvests,husbandry,hybrid\n            seed,hybrids,hygiene,imports,income,income\n            distribution,Intercropping,international agricultural\n            research,livestock,livestock research,maize,Managers,market\n            prices,meat,MOA,nematodes,nurseries,Palm oil,palms,pest\n            control,Pests,Plant Breeding,plant\n            protection,plantations,planting,population\n            growth,prices,produce,producers,production costs,public\n            sector,replanting,rice,Rural Development,rural\n            population,rural roads,schools,Seed,seedlings,sisal,social\n            services,soils,sugar,tea,the Consultative\n            Group,tobacco,UNDP,vegetables,water supply,wheat,yields"}},"owner":"WB Off:DaresSalaam-Eastern AFR 1 (AFCE1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"2906"},"facets":{}}}
