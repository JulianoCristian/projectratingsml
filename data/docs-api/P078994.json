Ratings for\n            the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Poverty Reduction Credit\n            Project for Burkina Faso are as follows: outcomes of the\n            project were satisfactory, sustainability is moderate, and\n            the performance of the Bank and the Borrower was also rated\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned from the report are: 1)\n            PRSCs are useful instruments to help the borrower assume\n            increased responsibility in managing its public resources in\n            an efficient manner, notably by providing more flexibility\n            and predictability; however, there is a risk of complacency\n            and of dependence on continued foreign budget support; 2)\n            issues of attribution are inevitable when the reform\n            programs are supported by several donors; 3) since outcomes\n            are to be assessed after several years, the quality of the\n            relevant statistical data is critical; if insufficient,\n            preparation should include remedial actions, including the\n            selection and definition of baseline data; 4) since reforms\n            are of medium-to long-term nature, early identification of\n            institutional weaknesses and capacity constraints is of\n            paramount importance; and 5) to assess outcome of a\n            medium-term program, it is essential that the different\n            documents of a PRSC series be consistent in content and\n            format,

Fifth, and Sixth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC) for Burkina Faso\n            are as follows: overall outcome of the all three PRSC's\n            series was satisfactory, risk to development outcome for all\n            three series was moderate, and the performance of the Bank\n            and the Borrower was also rated satisfactory for all three\n            series. Key lessons drawn from the implementation of PRSC-4\n            to 6 are follows: (i) country ownership. The use of the PRSC\n            instrument to support implementation of the poverty\n            reduction strategy has contributed to strengthen country\n            ownership. Specifically, this PRSC series greatly reinforced\n            the importance of the budget and the country's own\n            capacity for the success of government policies; (ii)\n            harmonization of budget support among donors. The creation\n            of the Cadre General d'Organisation des Appuis\n            Budgetaires (General Framework for Budget Support) (CGAB)\n            and its unified framework for budget support and joint\n            performance matrix provided an effective framework to\n            harmonize the dialogue and efforts of Burkina Faso's\n            development partners, including this PRSC series, with the\n            government's own strategy. In particular, it allowed\n            for early entry points in the policy dialogue with the\n            government and the identification of corrective measures or\n            solution to implementation bottlenecks. It also allowed for\n            all actors to make good use of analytical work. Furthermore,\n            close and continuous dialogue with the government allowed\n            CGAB members to better understand the constraints on the\n            reform process and build government ownership. This was\n            particularly relevant for some complex reform areas, like\n            cotton, decentralization, privatization and the reduction of\n            factor costs; and (iii) primacy of the cotton sector. Recent\n            developments in the cotton sector have highlighted the\n            importance of the sector for the country's\n            macroeconomic stability and growth, the need to adjust the\n            government strategy in the cotton sector to reflect recent\n            exogenous shocks and the importance of continued Bank\n            involvement in this sector. The increased focus of the third\n            PRSC series on reforms in the cotton sector reflects the\n            need to flexibly adjust the strategic orientation and\n            emphasis of the PRSCs. The lessons drawn from the experience\n            with cotton sector reform also show the need to broaden the\n            analysis of the risks inherent in the development of this sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credits"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso - Fourth, Fifth, and\n

Lessons learned from the\n            project: In assessing overall progress in the implementation\n            of reforms sought under Poverty Reduction Support Credits\n            (PRSCs), one should take into account the track-record\n            established by a country. One continuous lesson from\n            PRSCs' implementation in Burkina is the need for\n            strengthening the PRSC-related sectoral dialogue by\n            involving more actively line ministries as well as Bank\n            sector teams. An important issue is how Bank's teams\n            could get better involved in budget preparation whether\n            formally or informally.

Consistent with the\n            four strategic pillars of the PRSP-accelerating broad-based\n            growth, promoting access to social services, increasing\n            employment and income- generating activities for the poor,\n            and promoting good governance- PRSC-4 supports the\n            implementation of key reforms to accelerate growth and\n            income creation, improve social service delivery, and\n            strengthen budget management and governance. There are three\n            project components. Under the growth and income creation\n            component, the operation supports reforms in the cotton,\n            telecommunication, and energy sectors as well as the labor\n            market to lower factor costs, increase productivity, and\n            favor new investments. The second component of the credit\n            includes policies in the education, health, and water\n            sectors to build infrastructure, lower the cost of services,\n            improve service quality, and reinforce monitoring and\n            evaluation. The third component encompasses policy measures\n            to strengthen budget execution, procurement, budget control,\n            public sector performance, decentralization, and\n

environmental impacts linked to the\n            reforms supported by the Fourth Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Project, resulting from its sectoral adjustment,\n            mostly those measures linked to rural development, but also\n            due to the privatization of ONATEL (telecommunications\n            utility) and the energy sector reforms, including as well,\n            those investments in education and health. Rural development\n            entails actions focused on agricultural diversification, and\n            the liberalization of the cotton sub-sector. Although\n            diversification efforts will likely improve agricultural\n            extension and production, due to improved soil fertility\n            through the adoption of nutritional substances, the use of\n            pesticides may threaten the environment. Thus, it is\n            recommended that appropriate use of pesticides be\n            implemented, in accordance with standard international best\n            practices, following training and capacity building as\n            necessary. Soil and water conservation is being pursued at a\n            national level, through community participation and village\n            groups, who contribute their resources and efforts.\n            Concerning the cotton sub-sector, the parastatal enterprise\n            SOFITEX, conducted an environmental audit of its\n            establishment and cotton gins, to determine cost estimates\n            for an environmental management, and identify best\n            practices. Similarly, Onatel conducted an environmental\n            audit prior to privatization, whose recommendations are\n            being incorporated in procurement and contract documents, to\n            be enforced during implementation. Construction for, and\n            installation of power lines and interconnections, as well as\n            new central power stations, should comply with standard\n            international regulations. As for improvements in the\n            education and health sectors, specific environmental\n            management measures will apply for schools construction,\n            with adequate infrastructure (water supply and sanitation\n            measures), while particular attention will be given to\n            medical wastes disposal."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Quatrieme Credit d'appui\n            a la reduction de la Pauvrete : analyse environnmentale et sociale"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso \u2013 Quatri\u00e8me Projet\n            de cr\u00e9dit d\u2019aide \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 : \u00e9valuation\n            environnementale : Burkina Faso\u00a0- Quatri\u00e8me Cr\u00e9dit d\u2019appui \u00e0\n            la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9\u00a0: analyse environnementale et sociale"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/01/3108807/burkina-faso-fourth-poverty-reduction-support-credit-project-environmental-assessment-burkina-faso-quatrieme-credit-dappui-la-reduction-de-la-pauvrete-analyse-environnmentale-sociale","projn":"BF-Poverty Reduction Support Credit (4) -- P078994","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Burkina Faso","authors":{"authr":"S.N."},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20040407141144"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Primary education,Other industry,Health,General public administration sector","lang":"French","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Education,Industry and trade,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental management; Sectoral\n            adjustment; Agricultural extension; Agricultural\n            productivity; Soil conservation; Water resources\n            conservation; Community participation; Public awareness;\n            Environmental training & management programs; Regulatory\n            framework; Environmental legislation; Cotton industry;\n            Cotton gins; Privatization; Energy sector reform;\n            Environmental auditing; Water supply & sanitation;\n            School construction; Medical wastes; Training assistance;\n            Capacity building; Monitoring criteria; Bidding documents;\n            Precautionary principle;"}},"owner":"AFT: PREM 4 (AFTP4)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Poverty Reduction Support Credit"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"E919","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Quatrieme Credit\n            d'Appui a la Reduction de la Pauvrete : analyse\n            environnementale et sociale"}}},"facets":{}}}
