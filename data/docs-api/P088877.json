Some lessons learned included: reforms have\n            been undertaken after a process of close and continuous\n            consultation with all stakeholders. This participative\n            process with wider involvement not only encouraged a more\n            informed evaluation of underlying content of policies but\n            also enhanced the credibility of policies and generated\n            expectations that the reform process will be sustained.\n            Reasons advanced for the inability to fully implement the\n            financial sector reform measures in the past did include the\n            lack of public support for the measures, and the need for\n            strengthening public sector banks prior to their\n            privatization. The one-tranche operation, as opposed to a\n            programmatic loan, aiming at the first phase of the\n            financial sector reform program was effective. It responded\n            effectively to the needs of the authorities by providing\n            them timely support based on clearly established prior\n            actions. It provides quicker feedback and momentum to the\n            reforms that enables follow up and making early adjustments\n            if necessary. It allows continuity in the dialogue with the\n            authorities. Single tranche operations define benchmarks\n            based on information available at the time of implementation\n            and not on some future developments which might not\n            materialize. Moreover, the well defined policy matrix owned\n            by the government and endorsed by the Bank and partners is\n            an essential implementation roadmap for the authorities to\n            move the agenda forward."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Financial Sector Development Policy\n            Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - Financial Sector\n

The operation would assist Egypt move forward in\n            strengthening the enabling environment for financial\n            intermediation, resource mobilization and risk management,\n            and for increasing the private sector role in the provision\n            of financial services. The project will support policy\n            reforms in the following three areas: 1) strengthened\n            domestic banking system, inter-alia, by fully divesting\n            public sector bank shares in joint venture banks,\n            privatizing one of the large state-owned commercial banks,\n            defining a framework to implement institutional,\n            operational, and financial restructuring of the remaining\n            public banks, and, consolidating and merging small banks in\n            an over banked market; 2)development of a contractual\n            savings system, and restructured insurance industry, so as\n            to play an effective role in the management and transfer of\n            risk and mobilization of long-term savings; and, 3)\n            strengthened regulatory and supervisory framework for banks\n            and non-bank financial institutions, ensuring compliance\n            with international standards and effective enforcement.\n            However, main risks include a slowdown of the reform\n            momentum thus preventing a genuine change towards\n            market-based, risk-taking business patterns in the public\n            financial institutions. This relates particularly to the\n            government's commitment to, and decisiveness in\n            restructuring the remaining two large public sector banks -\n            and until such time as their capital can be open to private\n            sector entry, instilling the governance, culture and\n            incentives that would weed out past business practices - the\n            government capacity to manage the related fiscal\n            implications, and the ability to build an independent and\n            credible regulatory apparatus."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt -
