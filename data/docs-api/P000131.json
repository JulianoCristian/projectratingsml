Two main lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, in order to encourage the creation of\n            entrepreneurship and employment in Botswana, the BDC could\n            have worked out a scheme with the Government whereby the\n            latter would subsidize or underwrite a portion of the risks\n            on assisting projects which BDC considered\n            \"sub-commercial\". Second, since the BDC has yet to\n            go a long way in training the local staff to assume higher\n            responsibilities in the future, the need for operations and\n            accounting manuals cannot be overemphasized."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Botswana -
