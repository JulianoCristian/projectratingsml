Some lessons learned included:\n            the Bank's policy for project restructuring offers a\n            vehicle for adjusting project activities and indicators when\n            implementation experience shows that either there was a\n            problem with the original definition, or there is a need to\n            adjust them to realistically achieve the project's\n            development objectives. Despite the flexibility that has\n            been introduced into the process recently, formal\n            restructuring is not always seen as feasible because of the\n            time and approval processes involved, both on the side of\n            governments and of the Bank. This was the case for this\n            project, when, at the time, restructuring was being\n            considered a possibility. There needs to be either a more\n            flexible vehicle for adjusting project indicators and\n            activities, both in the Bank and in Governments, or an\n            attempt to define project objectives and indicators in more\n            general, flexible manner so that activities and indicators\n            can be adapted and adjusted without the need for formal\n            restructuring, all within the framework of governments'\n            and the Bank's requirements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
