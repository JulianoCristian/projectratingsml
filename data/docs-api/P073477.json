Some lessons learned included: proper\n            sequencing of sector policy dialogue and investment support\n            is important for success when the two are closely connected.\n            The Bank has an important role in ensuring that investment\n            decisions are made based on technical, financial, and\n            economic merits. Where a country's political timetable\n            is liable to bring significant shifts in policy, a keen\n            appreciation of political economy is necessary. The Bank has\n            much to gain from locating key operational staff in the\n            field, particularly where a continuous and intense dialogue\n            is required, such as Senegal's energy sector.\n            Inattention to the good practice principles for the\n            application of conditionality can result in policy-based\n            operations that are unbalanced and lack focus.

as\n            follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was high; Bank performance was unsatisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: small but too ambitious project with\n            regard to significant sector needs. The electricity sector\n            in Senegal has gone through significant transformation. The\n            institutional arrangement should have been designed in\n            accordance with the beneficiaries of the main activities and\n            the roles and responsibilities of each entity. An important\n            lesson learned in many projects implemented by field based\n            staff is that the rapidly changing circumstances of the\n            sector required an intensive and continuous dialogue which\n            becomes easier with the presence of sector teams in the\n            field office. Another lesson learned through this project is\n            that appropriate field based dialogue and supervision is\n            only possible if human resources are adequate. When the team\n            is overloaded, the quality of implementation of smaller\n            projects could suffer. It serves no useful purpose to impose\n            financial covenants that have little chance of being\n            achieved. Financial covenants imposed on utilities in Bank\n            supported projects often were not met."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Electricity Sector Efficiency\n            Enhancement (APL)
