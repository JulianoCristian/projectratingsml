Some lessons learned included:\n            close coordination of policy lending and investment lending\n            can greatly facilitate achievement of reforms. Although the\n            policy lending included reforms across several sectors,\n            there was a sustained sector focus on health that was\n            central to achieving important synergies with the investment\n            operations. Political obstacles can be overcome with\n            effective planning and consultation, but will be\n            insurmountable otherwise. The project manager should be\n            chosen by agreement between the Bank and the Ministry of\n            Health (MOH) as a bridge person, someone with political\n            access but who is not reporting and subject to the MOH on a\n            daily basis. Information technology (IT) components of\n            health sector reform frequently encounter delays, whose risk\n            can be mitigated through careful planning and flexibility.\n            Qualified regional experts can be extremely effective as\n            consultants and trainers.

- Health Sector Management Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Health Sector Management\n            Project for Macedonia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: reform does not only concern\n            technical health-related changes, but relies heavily on the\n            political process. Government ownership and commitment were\n            critical in the passage/amendments of key laws such as the\n            Public Health Law and the Health Care Law and the adoption\n            of the health sector strategy and the privatization\n            strategy. Health sector reforms are complex and often take\n            5-10 years. The Bank should adopt a longer-term approach in\n            its support. Unfortunately this was not the case in the\n            country as the first health Bank-supported project did not\n            focus much on reforms and with the closing of this Loan the\n            momentum gained will be lost. While supporting the Ministry\n            of Health (MOH) in its role of priority setting and policy\n            making, Bank teams promoted strong coordination between MOH\n            and Health Insurance Fund (HIF). With membership from both\n            institutions and joint training in various areas of the\n            reform, World Banks (WGs) helped the two institutions better\n            understand their roles. Health reforms supported by the\n            project and the health aspects of the adjustment operations\n            were supervised closely by the same health team ensuring\n            that the policy dialogue with the authorities was consistent\n            and linked to the overall macro level dialogue between the\n            Government of Macedonia (GOM) and the Bank. Given the\n            different players in the system, it was essential to aim at\n            establishing early during project implementation a culture\n            of better understanding the benefits of information for\n            policy making. As noted earlier, team composition should\n            have been strengthened earlier in the implementation process\n            by the inclusion of a Health Information Management\n            Specialist with international experience in health systems\n            to guide the conceptualization and planning, and not only\n            procurement processes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia -
