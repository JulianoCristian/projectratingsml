The Learning and Innovation\n            nature of LILs strongly suggests the need for a separate\n            subcomponent in the project design, and providing adequate\n            resources for an effective M&E system with appropriate\n            baselines established at the outset. 2. Creating an open and\n            direct line of communication between the management of\n            implementing agencies / project management team and the task\n            team leaders is essential for effective implementation. 3.\n            Bank management needs to carefully monitor the performance\n            of projects with short life-spans (3 years) or with less\n            than three years remaining, to ensure that decisions for\n            corrective action can be taken early enough to allow\n            effective implementation. 4. Task Teams and Clients need to\n            agree on a system of incentives to ensure that key personnel\n            remain on the payroll of the project and that frequent\n            change of staff is avoided. 5. Management could have been\n            more proactive during the first two years of implementation\n            and could have re-organized the Bank team at an earlier\n            stage. 6. The Bank missed the opportunity during the first\n            two years of implementation to (a) identify project\n            difficulties and provide adequate implementation support to\n            the Borrower; and (b) to restructure the project much\n            earlier to improve its performance. 7. Distance Education\n            projects that plan to include the use of modern information\n            and communication technologies need to focus strongly on\n            assessing the institutional capacity and the technology\n            options available on the ground. Ensuring that the required\n            institutional capacity, high level political support,\n            capable human resources, and technical infrastructure are in\n            place - or can be readily developed - are essential for success."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Distance Learning LIL Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Distance Learning LIL Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/03/7582624/ethiopia-distance-learning-lil-project","projn":"ET-Ethiopia Distance Learning Lil -- P069083","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Teaching and Learning,Access & Equity in Basic Education,Education For All,Tertiary Education,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Information and Communication Technologies,Education","count":"Ethiopia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070503144253"},"subsc":"Information technology,Tertiary education,Telecommunications","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Information and Communication Technologies,Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Information and communications,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"academic year, achievement, achievements,\n            Civil Service, classroom, classrooms, Communication\n            Technology, communications infrastructure, Competitive\n            Bidding, computer labs, computer literacy, content\n            development, correspondence courses, course, course\n            delivery, course materials, Decentralization, decision\n            making, delivery, Distance Education, distance education\n            courses, distance education programs, distance education\n            projects, DISTANCE LEARNING, distance learning course\n            materials, distance learning materials, distance teaching,\n            education courses, education materials, education programs,\n            Ethics, Exchange Rate, human resources, Information\n            technology, Institutional capacity building, knowledge\n            economy, learner support, learners, Learning achievement,\n            learning activities, learning approaches, Learning capacity,\n            learning centers, learning materials, learning outcomes,\n            Learning strategies, literacy training, media, Open\n            University, pedagogy, Performance Indicators, printing,\n            Project Evaluation, provision of technical, Quality\n            Assurance, Quality of teaching, service training, teaching,\n            teaching materials, Telecommunications, Tertiary education,\n            tertiary level, training programs, tutorial support,\n            tutoring, tutors, video conferencing, visual equipment"}},"owner":"AFTOS: Dev.

The\n            components include a range of distance learning approaches,\n            developed by the Institute of Distance Education (IDE), so\n            as to reach a potential audience of civil servants needing\n            training.

The\n            components include a range of distance learning approaches,\n            developed by the Institute of Distance Education (IDE), so\n            as to reach a potential audience of civil servants needing\n            training. The existing Global Distance Learning Network\n            (GDLN) videoconferencing, and internet link at the Civil\n            Service College (CSC) will be upgraded in accordance with\n            international standards. Modified GDLN links with five\n            regional centers will be established, and beaming programs\n            will be developed at the IDE. These centers are considered\n            extensions of the IDE/GDLN, which should offer equal\n            programs to regional students by July 2001, and will be\n            established in existing tertiary level institutions, with\n            provision of computers, and audiovisual equipment. Satellite\n            rental, facility maintenance, and operational costs will be\n            partly financed, through tuition percentages generated by\n            students during 2001-2003. Printed distance learning\n            material will be developed in three disciplines,\n            administered by trained tutors at regional centers, in\n            addition to provision of training in computer literacy, and\n            English courses.
