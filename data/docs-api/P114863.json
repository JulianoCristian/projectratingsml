Some lessons learned included: conditional\n            cash transfer (CCT) and community based nutrition (CBN)\n            messaging delivered by trained local volunteers can\n            effectively improve utilization of key maternal and child\n            health (MCH) services and improve critical nutrition\n            behaviors, especially among poor households, living in\n            remote areas. A combination of community-based approach and\n            free health service provision, with incentives to offset\n            opportunity and transport costs (a major barrier for poor\n            vulnerable households to accessing health services) is an\n            effective way to increase utilization of MCH and nutrition\n            services. The CBN model is a flexible one that provides\n            opportunity to incrementally add interventions. For cash\n            payments against CCT, it is more efficient to use a third\n            party arrangement rather than the use of health center (HC)\n            staff. Funds flow arrangements must be well defined and\n            standards must be set and enforced for the number of days\n            within which transfer of funds (to the next level or to\n            another entity at a parallel level) must occur. Training\n            must be offered on a regular basis in the case of village\n            facilitators (VFs) who are not highly educated and have\n            little or no skills to deliver health and nutrition\n            messages. With careful implementation support and technical\n            assistance (TA), it is possible to building institutional\n            capacity even in weak capacity settings. The project further\n            reinforces that effective project management requires\n            proactivity, including undertaking necessary restructuring\n            to respond to on-ground realities and align project\n            activities, timelines, resources to address implementation,\n            and other challenges."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lao People's Democratic Republic -\n
