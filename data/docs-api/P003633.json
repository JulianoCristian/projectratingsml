The Bank performance is rated\n            satisfactory, having provided substantial advice to the\n            Government on cost-based tariffs, and, the Borrower's\n            performance is assessed as highly satisfactory, given the\n            outstanding performance of implementing agencies,\n            particularly regarding the timely procurement\n            implementation.
