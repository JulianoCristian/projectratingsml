The\n            DPL program overall is a broad, cross-cutting program that\n            has been designed to focus on strengthening government\n            systems for improved policy implementation, in line with the\n            World Bank's Country Partnership Strategy for\n            Indonesia. The DPLs are seen by the Indonesian government\n            not only as a financing instrument, but more as a tool for\n            accelerating its own critical reforms. In November 2011, the\n            World Bank approved the Eighth Development Policy Loan\n            (DPL-8) aimed at building on progress made in improving the\n            investment climate, strengthening public financial\n            management, and enhancing poverty alleviation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Respaldo a esfuerzos de reformas en materia\n            de inversiones, gesti\u00f3n financiera p\u00fablica, y mitigaci\u00f3n de\n            la pobreza"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Reforming policies and\n            transforming Indonesia - Supporting reform efforts in\n            investments, public financial management, and poverty\n            alleviation : Respaldo a esfuerzos de reformas en materia de\n            inversiones, gesti\u00f3n financiera p\u00fablica, y mitigaci\u00f3n de la pobreza"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/04/25096738/reforming-policies-transforming-indonesia-supporting-reform-efforts-investments-public-financial-management-poverty-alleviation-respaldo-esfuerzos-de-reformas-en-materia-de-inversiones-gesti\u00f3n-financiera-p\u00fablica-y-mitigaci\u00f3n-de-la-pobreza","topic":"Poverty Measurement and Analysis m1326941 707,Investment Law m1326734 977,Public Finance m1326315 713,Investment Policy m1327700 771,Investment Funds m1326718 341","projn":"ID-Community-Based Settlement Rehabilitation\n            And Reconstruction Pr -- P125648,ID-Indonesia Sixth Development Policy Loan\n            -- P113638","docty":"Brief","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08310d63a_1_0"},"theme":"Natural disaster management,Export development and competitiveness,Tax policy and administration,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Regulation and competition policy,Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"Housing construction,Other social services,Other domestic and international trade,SME Finance,General public administration sector,Other social services","colti":"Results profile","lang":"Spanish","prdln":"Recipient Executed Activities,IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","topicv3":"Poverty Measurement and Analysis m1326941 707,Investment Law m1326734 977,Public Finance m1326315 713,Investment Policy m1327700 771,Investment Funds m1326718 341","sectr":"Health and other social services,Industry and trade,Health and other social services,Finance,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Publications & Research","owner":"Macro & Fiscal Mgmt - GP (GMFDR),Urban, DRM EAP (GSU08)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Development Policy Lending"},"1":{"cdata!":"Development Policy Lending"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF098869-Settlement Rehabilitation And\n            Reconstruction Project (Rekompak),TF098863-Settlement Rehabilitation and\n            Reconstruction Project (Rekompak)","majtheme":"Financial and private sector development,Public sector governance,Social protection and risk management,Trade and integration","repnb":"94142","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Mereformasi Kebijakan, mengubah\n            Indonesia - Mendukung upaya reformasi dalam investasi,\n            manajemen keuangan publik, dan penanggulangan kemiskinan"}}},"15973480":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2010/10/15973480/indonesia-fifth-development-policy-loan-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2010/10/15973480/indonesia-fifth-development-policy-loan-project","new_url":"2010/10/15973480/indonesia-fifth-development-policy-loan-project","disclosure_date":"2012-03-22T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-03-22T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-03-22T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/03/25/000333038_20120325233036/Rendered/INDEX/ICR16770P110190C0disclosed030220120.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/03/25/000333038_20120325233036/Rendered/PDF/ICR16770P110190C0disclosed030220120.pdf","loan_no":"7784;7610","docdt":"2010-10-11T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2012-03-25T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Fifth and Sixth Development\n            Policy Loan Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Fifth Development Policy\n            Loan (DPL) Project for Indonesia were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: constant collaboration and dialogue\n            between the Government and the Bank continued to be\n            fundamental for the success of the DPL program. The\n            Bank's strong field presence continued to facilitate\n            constant collaboration and dialogue with the Government, not\n            only on the DPL but also on other engagements that provide\n            synergies with the DPL. Such collaboration and dialogue also\n            benefited from the involvement of key reform champions, both\n            within the Government and the Bank, who were able to\n            complete actions in the timeframe agreed upon and ensure the\n            successful delivery of the DPL program. Mapping out a reform\n            program provides meaningful direction and substantive\n            results down the road, but a degree of flexibility is still\n            needed, especially to ensure sustained government ownership.\n            The continued policy dialogue under the DPL has strengthened\n            the knowledge base and allowed the Government to move\n            proactively and take precautionary measures at the time of\n            crisis. Establishment of the Financial System Stability\n            Forum (FSSF), for instance, has formed the basis for the\n            financial sector safety net and allowed the Government to\n            swiftly address systemic risks in the financial system. The\n            Government was also able to proceed quickly in requesting\n            for the Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO)-DPL, which eventually\n            helped in restoring public confidence and advancing other\n            policy reforms, particularly those under public financial\n            management and investment climate. Had the DPL been\n            non-existent, the swift resolution of the financial systemic\n            risks and quick delivery of the DDO-DPL at the time of\n            crisis would not have been possible. DPLs are only one\n            instrument among many that are available in a multi-faceted\n            engagement, and the choice of instrument should be\n            contingent on the issue, the political context and the\n            institutional circumstances. This is particularly applicable\n            in the Indonesian case because of the size and scope of the\n            World Bank program in Indonesia. The Bank program in\n            Indonesia is one of the largest of any country in terms of\n            number of staff and overall resources. Large teams are\n            working closely on a daily basis with government\n            counterparts at often very senior levels on a wide range of\n            issues from public financial management and trade and\n            investment, finance, public expenditures and poverty. In\n            this context, the DPL is not the only instrument for\n            supporting reform, but rather complementary to other\n            instruments such as investment projects, Technical\n            Assistance (TA) and Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Fifth and Sixth Development\n            Policy Loan
