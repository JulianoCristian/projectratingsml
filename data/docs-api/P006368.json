Lessons on project design, and policy\n            implications suggest that: although project companies\n            improved performance, sustained improvements require\n            profound institutional, and regulatory reform, because\n            performance agreements did not provide incentives for the\n            utilities, nor did loan proceeds help in striving for better\n            performance, and, the supply-driven nature of sub-borrower\n            selection hindered further performance improvements. In\n            addition, there was a degree of disconnect between the\n            institutional, and investment components, because although\n            limited technical assistance was provided under the\n            institutional component, it stopped short of providing\n            further support for implementation of complementary\n            regulatory reform. Based on these lessons, in the follow-up\n            project, participating utilities shall be selected based on\n            demand. Lessons on project implementation indicate that:\n            difficulties encountered with the Bank's procurement\n            guidelines, were minimized by a workshop organized by the\n            supervision team, which helped accelerate the procurement\n            process. However, the terms of reference for consulting\n            services on operational development programs, or the tariff\n            studies, could have been developed during preparation, to\n            avoid contract delays. And, despite the originally foreseen\n            creation of a Federal technical team, to manage the\n            institutional component, delays of the investment component\n            hampered expected benefits among the public companies;\n            instead, the Federal management unit could have facilitated\n            learning, and introduced competitive mechanisms among those companies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Water Sector Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Water Sector\n            Modernization
