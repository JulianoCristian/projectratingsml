The main objectives of the Health Services\n            Development Project were to (a) strengthen basic health and\n            family planning services; (b) help formulate national health\n            and population policies and promote their application; and\n            (c) strengthen the Ministry of Health's (MOH)\n            institutional capacity in planning, evaluation, and project\n            implementation and monitoring. In the absence of an\n            implementation plan and a strong Government commitment, a\n            number of these objectives turned out to be ambitious and\n            difficult to implement. The main objectives of the projects\n            were met. Despite early delays in project implementation,\n            the Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The\n            project's outcome can be rated as satisfactory. A first\n            important lesson for future projects in the population and\n            health sectors in Burkina Faso is that policy reforms should\n            be in place prior to starting project investments. A second\n            lesson is that a detailed implementation plan is absolutely\n            essential to keep track of project progress. A third lesson\n            is that stakeholder participation throughout the project\n            cycle is essential to ensure a better sense of ownership and\n            build commitment. A fourth lesson is that future projects\n            would need to dramatically expand public education programs\n            on health and population issues, in order to increase\n            acceptance rates. A fifth lesson is that adequate emphasis\n            needs to be given to institution strengthening and human\n            resource development. A sixth lesson is that projects in the\n            health and population sectors cannot be solely supervised by Headquarters."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Health Services Development
