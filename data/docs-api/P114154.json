The original\n            project development objective was not revised. The reason\n            for the restructuring enables the withdrawals to be more\n            aligned with the implementation of the Royal Thai\n            Government's (RTG) investment plans for FY2013. The\n            extension also helps lower the cost of swapping the project\n            proceeds from US dollars to Thai Baht for the RTG. The baht\n            swap market is quite thin and is therefore volatile. Lessons\n            learned included, 1) reforms with wide support can be\n            implemented and maintained even during periods of\n            substantial political turmoil; 2) while it is common to\n            observe that political turmoil and/or political transitions\n            can affect the pace of DPL program implementation, the Thai\n            case shows something different: these problems can also\n            substantially delay loan utilization well past the date of\n            Board approval even when the macroeconomic framework is\n            acceptable; 3) Sustained engagement with the Thai\n            authorities over many years, despite the lack of a borrowing\n            program since 1999, allowed Bank to quickly respond to the\n            emerging global financial crisis and recession; and 4) it is\n            important to avoid using outcome indicators that are not\n            under the full control of the authorities. This is evident\n            in from the lack of a second Public Expenditure and\n            Financial Accountability exercise which would have yielded\n            the data needed for some of the outcome indicators."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Public Sector Development Policy Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand - Public Sector\n            Development Policy

The\n            extension of the PSRDPL closing date to June 2013 will make\n            it difficult for speculative investors to predict when the\n            Ministry of Finance (MOF) will make the swaps and how much\n            each time. The extension will also allow the MOF to make\n            swaps in smaller amounts at a time - which will not swing\n            the swap market by too much which is undesirable by (and may\n            hurt) other non-speculative clients in the swap market (e.g.\n            exporters). This will be the second extension of the\n            project, and a cumulative extension of nine months."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand - Public Sector Reform\n            Development Policy Loan Project : restructuring  : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/11/17058473/thailand-public-sector-reform-development-policy-loan-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"TH-Public Sector Development Policy -- P114154","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations and\n            Local Finance Management,Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Public Sector Management and Reform,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Debt Markets","teratopic":"Public Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Thailand","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20121210232718"},"theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Managing for development results,Macroeconomic management,Infrastructure services for private sector development","subsc":"Central government administration,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Public Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, exporters, financial crisis,\n            financial management, institutional development, LOAN,\n            PUBLIC, public financial management, PUBLIC SECTOR, PUBLIC\n            SECTOR REFORM, service delivery, swap, swap market, swaps"}},"owner":"Southeast Asia PREM Sector (EASPT)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Development Policy Lending"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance,Economic management,Financial and private sector development","repnb":"74311"},"16425183":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/06/16425183/thailand-public-sector-development-policy-p114154-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-01","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/06/16425183/thailand-public-sector-development-policy-p114154-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-01","new_url":"2012/06/16425183/thailand-public-sector-development-policy-p114154-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-01","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-06-25T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-06-25T00:00:00Z","docm_id":"090224b0814f7820","chronical_docm_id":"090224b0814f7820","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/EAP/2012/06/25/006191FE42B4BA9185257A280081B6BF/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/ISR0Disclosabl025201201340667409169.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/EAP/2012/06/25/006191FE42B4BA9185257A280081B6BF/1_0/Rendered/PDF/ISR0Disclosabl025201201340667409169.pdf","loan_no":"IBRD77230","docdt":"2012-06-25T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2012-06-25T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Thailand -

The RTG is requesting\n            this US$1 billion PSRDPL to sustain economic recovery from\n            the global financial crisis. During loan preparation in late\n            2008 and early 2009, Thailand became one of the countries in\n            Asia most affected by the global financial crisis making\n            more urgent the need for resources. Around this time, the\n            political climate also deteriorated significantly. The loan\n            was negotiated in May 2009, but the government did not\n            submit it to Parliament as the political situation did not\n            allow parliamentary discussion as required by the\n            Constitution. The economy began to recover in late 2009, and\n            there has been a period of relative political calm since\n            June 2010. As a result, the government initiated the process\n            for parliamentary discussion of the loan, Parliament\n            approved the loan in August, and the Government has now\n            requested the Bank for final approval. The delay in\n            Parliamentary approval meant a relatively long gap between\n            negotiations and final board consideration. During this\n            period, the government continued to make significant\n            progress in implementation of the forward-looking reform\n            program discussed during negotiations, in addition to the\n            standard consideration of implementation of the prior actions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Public Sector Reform Development\n            Policy Loan
