provides investment\n            loans for small- and medium-size industrial projects needing\n            foreign exchange. The objective will be to help raise\n            investment efficiency through import of technology and the\n            introduction of improved project design and selection\n            methodology. Subborrowers will be some 60-80 state and\n            collective enterprises primarily in coastal provinces and\n            municipalities. Based on the experience under CIB I, the\n            investments are expected to have high financial and economic\n            returns. The main project risks relate to the capacity of\n            CIB, which is a young institution, to strengthen its\n            appraisal standards, especially in the technical, economic\n            and marketing areas, and to the need for continued\n            government commitment to CIB within the process of economic\n            reform. However, the project provides for recruitment of\n            additional technical and economic staff, plus training and\n            marketing consultancy for CIB's ability to identify and\n            evaluate projects.

provides investment\n            loans for small- and medium-size industrial projects needing\n            foreign exchange. The objective will be to help raise\n            investment efficiency through import of technology and the\n            introduction of improved project design and selection\n            methodology.  Subborrowers will be some 60-80 state and\n            collective enterprises primarily in coastal provinces and\n            municipalities. Based on the experience under CIB I, the\n            investments are expected to have high financial and economic\n            returns. The main project risks relate to the capacity of\n            CIB, which is a young institution, to strengthen its\n            appraisal standards, especially  in the technical, economic\n            and marketing areas, and to the need for continued\n            government commitment to CIB within the process of economic\n            reform.  However, the project provides for recruitment of\n            additional technical and economic staff, plus training and\n            marketing consultancy for CIB's ability to identify and\n            evaluate projects.  Furthermore, the Government's\n            commitment to economic reforms and to CIB remain firm."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Second Industrial Credit (Second\n            China Investment Bank) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Second Industrial Credit\n            (Second China Investment Bank) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1984/05/741660/china-second-industrial-credit-second-china-investment-bank-project","projn":"CN-China Invest.Bk.Ii -- P003420","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,International Terrorism & Counterterrorism,Financial Intermediation","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980203114805"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting,bank loans,banking\n            system,Bidding,borrowing,capital loans,central\n            bank,coal,comparative advantage,demand\n            deposits,deposits,depreciation allowances,development\n            banking,Development Strategy,economic analysis,Economic\n            Development,economic rate of return,economic reform,Economic\n            Relations,economics,economists,employment,energy\n            consumption,exchange rate,exports,feasibility\n            studies,financial institutions,Financial\n            Management,FINANCIAL SECTOR,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            currency,foreign exchange,foreign exchange\n            investment,GDP,Gross Domestic\n            Product,housing,imports,income,inflation,inflation\n            rates,institutional development,interest rate,interest\n            rates,inventories,Lending rates,local authorities,local\n            governments,low interest rates,market economies,middle\n            income countries,municipalities,Onlending,output per\n            capita,planned economies,price changes,producers,production\n            costs,productivity,profitability,reorganization,savings,scarce\n            capital,shadow prices,specialized banks,state banks,State\n            enterprises,Statements,supervisory agencies,technical\n            assistance,term finance,time deposits,total factor\n            productivity,transport,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounting,bank loans,banking\n            system,Bidding,borrowing,capital loans,central\n            bank,coal,comparative advantage,demand\n            deposits,deposits,depreciation allowances,development\n            banking,Development Strategy,economic analysis,Economic\n            Development,economic rate of return,economic reform,Economic\n            Relations,economics,economists,employment,energy\n            consumption,exchange rate,exports,feasibility\n            studies,financial institutions,Financial\n            Management,FINANCIAL SECTOR,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            currency,foreign exchange,foreign exchange\n            investment,GDP,Gross Domestic\n            Product,housing,imports,income,inflation,inflation\n            rates,institutional development,interest rate,interest\n            rates,inventories,Lending rates,local authorities,local\n            governments,low interest rates,market economies,middle\n            income countries,municipalities,Onlending,output per\n            capita,planned economies,price changes,producers,production\n            costs,productivity,profitability,reorganization,savings,scarce\n            capital,shadow prices,specialized banks,state banks,State\n            enterprises,Statements,supervisory agencies,technical\n            assistance,term finance,time deposits,total factor\n            productivity,transport,working capital"}},"owner":"China & Mongolia HQ Unit (EACCQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"repnb":"4897"},"facets":{}}}
