Some lessons learned included: the\n            capacity of a power utility management contractor for\n            project implementation may well be limited unless provisions\n            for the management of capital projects are included in its\n            contract. Thus, utility management contracts should include\n            management of foreseen capital projects and capacity\n            building of utility staff in their scope of\n            responsibilities. Timely and professional supervision of the\n            management contract is essential. A recent consultant review\n            of the performance under the first management contract\n            highlighted the failure to monitor the contract properly, as\n            well as the

Because the newly\n            acquired engine is made with recent technology is expected\n            to have better environmental performance with respect to\n            exhaust gases, emissions, and noise that conform to World\n            Bank standards. Sulphur content will likely be lower with\n            lower fuel consumption, lower lube oil consumption, exhaust\n            gases will have lower temperatures and concentrations of\n            nitrous oxide particles and carbon dioxide, as well. Since\n            it is only the diesel engine that is being replaced, the\n            other peripheral systems have to be maintained: they will\n            need to be flushed clean, to prevent oil spills. Waste oil\n            will be collected and stored in proper containers in the\n            power plant for now and properly disposed of. Training will\n            be provided in order to help workers adapt to the new\n            engine's operational demands."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor-Leste - Power Sector Priority\n            Investments Project : environmental management plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Timor-Leste -
