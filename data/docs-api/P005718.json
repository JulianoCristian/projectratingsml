Seventh Plan (1987-91). The SAL will,\n            in particular, support the establishment of an efficient\n            structure of incentives through action in three domains.\n            Firstly, it will support liberalization of external trade,\n            notably the reduction of import restrictions, and the\n            decontrol of prices. Secondly, it will help improve the\n            efficiency of financial intermediation by bringing interest\n            rates closer to market levels, improving the treatment of\n            foreign exchange risk, and increasing competition among\n            financial institutions. Thirdly, it will support reform of\n            direct and indirect taxation.
