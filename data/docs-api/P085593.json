Some lessons\n            learned included: it is important to ensure that objectives\n            and targets are realistic and carefully set at the onset. In\n            the absence of an adequately designed monitoring and\n            evaluation (M&E) framework, early adjustment of\n            baselines and targets is desirable. It is also important to\n            ensure that the M&E framework is aligned with the\n            implementing agency's capacity. Where capacity is\n            insufficient, a concerted effort should be undertaken in the\n            first year of project implementation to strengthen\n            management information systems, refine the baselines and\n            monitoring indicators, and determine the methodology for\n            assessing them. For this project, there were widely\n            acknowledged issues regarding the precision and reliability\n            of data that were not addressed until late during\n            implementation of the project. More care is need to mitigate\n            against the impact on projects due to a change in\n            administration (as happened with respect to this project in\n            2006) that is often accompanied by changes that reach far\n            down into the executive. Rather than rush to ensure that\n            projects are effective before a new administration takes\n            office without attention to risk mitigating measures,\n            project design should anticipate and mitigate against\n            capacity disruptions that are often inevitable with a change\n            in government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - First Phase of the Tertiary\n
