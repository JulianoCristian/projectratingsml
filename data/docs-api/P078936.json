The two key\n            outcome indicators for the project development objective\n            are: (i) incremental irrigated area resulting from\n            rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure; and (ii)\n            increase in crop yields. Monitoring data show that as of\n            October 31, 2010, the incremental irrigated area achieved\n            was over 138,000 hectares compared to the end-of project\n            target of 145,000 hectares. The latest annual crop survey\n            carried out in 2010 also shows substantial increases\n            (ranging from 21 percent to 86 percent) in crop yields as\n            compared to the control group. Another significant outcome\n            of irrigation rehabilitation is that water related disputes\n            have reduced by 50 percent to 95 percent in rehabilitated\n            schemes. The total number of project beneficiaries now\n            exceeds 600,000 people. The project closing date was\n            extended by one year when the first additional financing was\n            approved, and by a further two and a half years when the\n            second additional financing was approved, resulting in a\n            cumulative extension of three and a half years.

Most of the country\u2019s basic irrigation\n            infrastructure was damaged during the conflict years, with\n            only about one-third intact. As a result, the country and\n            its rural inhabitants were caught in a vicious cycle, the\n            productivity and incomes remained low, while food insecurity\n            and rural poverty loomed large. Given the critical\n            importance of irrigation water in raising the incomes of\n            Afghanistan\u2019s people, the World Bank assisted the government\n            to rehabilitate and restore its irrigation systems. The\n            Emergency Irrigation Rehabilitation Project  had introduced\n            innovative way of supervising schemes in insecure areas.\n            Under the project, local communities participated actively\n            in the rehabilitation of the irrigation systems.
