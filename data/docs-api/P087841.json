The SSPSAC I has a satisfactory\n            outcome, and is likely to be sustainable. Both the\n            Bank's and Borrower's performance are\n            satisfactory. The outcome of the SSPCII is moderately\n            unsatisfactory and there is a significant risk to\n            development outcome. The performance of the Bank and\n            Borrower is moderately satisfactory. Among the lessons cited\n            for both operations were the following: 1) the programmatic\n            approach was a suitable instrument to help anchor policy in\n            a period of growing uncertainty and instability; 2) using\n            progress in a few selected Millennium Development Goals\n            (MDGs) as a theme provided a well focused overall objective;\n            3) clearer guidelines are needed for the role of supervision\n            when a Development Policy Lending (DPL) program is\n            interrupted; 4) the design of the monitoring system for this\n            operation could have been improved; 5) a stronger alliance\n            between the Ministry of Finance and line ministries and\n            agencies is critical for meeting agreed benchmarks; and 6)\n            the Bolivian context requires support for broad-based consensus-building."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Second Social Programmatic\n            Development Policy

The CAS clearly identified\n            the role of this series of Social Sectors Programmatic\n            Structural Adjustment Credits (SSPSACs) in supporting\n            progress in the social sectors, highlighting that particular\n            attention would be paid to reducing inequality in education,\n            health and nutrition, and water and sanitation outcomes\n            across municipalities, ethnic groups and income classes. As\n            reflected in the CAS, if at subsequent stages of preparation\n            Bolivia has made progress in formulating its revised Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), the second and/or third\n            SSPSACs in this series could be converted into a broader\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC). This series of\n            SSPSACs have been prepared closely with other international\n            donors. Germany (through KfW and GTZ) has actively\n            participated with technical assistance and joint missions\n            with the Bank in its preparation and has formally announced\n            its interest in co-financing the first Credit in this series\n            with Euros 8 million. Meetings with the donor community were\n            held in La Paz to ensure coordination around the proposed\n            social program and the areas to be supported by the SSPSACs,\n            and seek synergism with other ongoing efforts. Various\n            countries have contributed significantly with their\n            experience and technical assistance in the design of\n            specific components of this operation. Lastly, this series\n            of SSPSACs has been closely linked to an overall\n            intemational donor effort in Bolivia to support monitoring\n            and evaluation of progress made to attain the Millenium\n            Development Goals (MDGs)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Social Sectors Programmatic\n            Structural Adjustment
