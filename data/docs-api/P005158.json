Some\n            lessons learned included: it is costly to turn an\n            unsatisfactory project around during implementation, uses\n            more resources and requires a greater effort than if the\n            project had been fully prepared in the first place. The\n            project lacked several key requirements of a well prepared\n            project at its beginning and initial implementation progress\n            was very slow. The lesson is the importance of obtaining\n            high level Government commitment of all components of an\n            adjustment package and to ensure that Government is prepared\n            to commit the resources to get the project up and\n            operational. Project design and design of the SFD as an\n            institution turned out to be satisfactory. The freedom of\n            the SFD to recruit management and staff competitively and on\n            a performance contract basis, to have operational\n            flexibility and to make fast disbursements for subprojects\n            evaluated against clear criteria were decisively important.\n            Bank insistence on adhering to the design and the gradual\n            realization of senior Government that they had a tool for\n            effective delivery of social programs to the poor and their\n            subsequent ownership was important for subsequent\n            turnaround. The Egypt SFD experience validates generally\n            accepted principles developed by the Bank for a successful\n            Social Fund, including the placement of a micro enterprise\n            program in a Social Fund, as set out in its Review of the\n            Social Funds Portfolio report of March, 1997."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Social Fund

those most vulnerable to the reform process, in addition\n            to facilitating the reintegration of Egyptian workers\n            returning from Kuwait and Iraq.

In line with this\n            objective, the project will support six core programs : 1)\n            the provision of essential municipal services; 2)\n            improvements to essential public transport services; 3) a\n            community development program including improvements in\n            basic and primary health care provision, immunization\n            programs, and mother and
