Some lessons learned included:\n            one lesson is that ensuring progress in a stand-alone\n            Development Policy Operation (DPO), in an environment with\n            low capacity by the recipient, requires the ability to\n            supervise closely. A second lesson is that, in the face of\n            low recipient capacity, the Bank's team needs to remind\n            the authorities about the importance of the results\n            framework and the implications of not meeting indicators. A\n            third lesson regards the care that needs to be extended at\n            the definition of prior actions and results indicators. A\n            final lesson is that meaningful reforms (such as in cotton)\n            may take years to complete and are hard to support by annual\n            stand-alone DPOs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Togo - Fourth Economic Governance and\n            Recovery Grant Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Togo - Fourth Economic Governance\n            and Recovery Grant Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/06/16522923/togo-fourth-economic-governance-recovery-grant-project","projn":"TG-Economic Recovery & Gov.

Economic\n            Recovery and Governance Grant Program is to improve\n            governance, transparency and efficiency in public financial\n            management as well as advance structural reforms aimed at\n            strengthening key sectors of economy (phosphates, cotton and\n            energy). The operation directly supports two pillars of the\n            Interim Strategy Note (ISN) and provides financing for\n            budgeted fiscal needs during 2011. The reforms supported by\n            the operation are critical to the Government's ability\n            to use public resources efficiently and effectively to\n            support the country's economic and social recovery. The\n            reform policies supported by this grant are closely aligned\n            with Togo's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)\n            covering the period 2009-2011. The PRSP was adopted by the\n            Government in July 6, 2009 and presented to the\n            International Monetary Fund (IMF) and International\n            Development Association (IDA) boards in November and\n            December 2009, respectively. The grant is also in line with\n            the Bank's interim strategy note for Togo for the\n            period FY08-10 presented to the IDA board on May 29, 2008\n            and complements the assistance provided through the IMF\n            Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program, the African\n            Development Bank (AfDB) and the European Union (EU) budget\n            support operations, and the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor\n            Countries (HIPC) initiative. The operation will provide\n            financial support to the Government at a crucial juncture,\n            after the country has reached the HIPC completion point in\n            December 2010."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Togo - Fourth Economic Recovery and\n            Governance Grant Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Togo - Fourth Economic Recovery\n            and Governance Grant Program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/03/13876642/togo-fourth-economic-recovery-governance-grant-program","projn":"TG-Economic Recovery & Gov.
