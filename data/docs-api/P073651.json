Some lessons learned included:\n            Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) was a major contributor to\n            the overall burden of diseases in India even at the time\n            when the project was designed. It should have been treated\n            as a core and essential public health function or activity\n            rather than an undervalued, one-off research. However, NCD\n            risk factor surveillance survey was seriously delayed and\n            was implemented only in several provinces rather than as a\n            nationally representative activity. NCD surveillance was\n            eventually integrated inton the National NCD Program and\n            would be sustained. Diseases' risks and occurrences\n            exist unevenly among different subgroups or communities and\n            tend to impact more seriously on the socially and\n            economically vulnerable ones. Implementation of TDAP will\n            not only improve equity of the project but also efficiency.\n            Unfortunately, the importance of TDAP was undervalued and\n            its implementation seriously delayed which may potentially\n            reduce and delay benefit accruable to the tribal groups. The\n            restructuring in 2010, prioritized 9 best performing states\n            and their selection was based on the ranking of their\n            performance to date, based on a mix of process indicators\n            such as: (i) provision of trained staff dedicated to the\n            IDSP, (ii) establishment of surveillance mechanisms, (iii)\n            reporting coverage and effective outbreak response, and\n            fulfillment of the Bank's fiduciary requirements.\n            However, while this was a pragmatic decision, such\n            prioritization came at a cost of important equity\n            considerations and risk based surveillance rationale since\n            infectious diseases usually reside in the lagging states\n            that have lower capacity and which deserve more attention\n            and help instead of less. Also, 'best performing'\n            could and should be interpreted as the incremental progress\n            by comparing the measurements of performance and\n            achievements between the starting points and the end points,\n            rather than end points only."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Integrated Disease Surveillance\n            Project
