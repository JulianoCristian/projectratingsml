Some of the lessons learned from the\n            project are: 1) the efficient implementation of such\n            fertilizer projects requires special skills and management\n            systems that are quite different from those needed for\n            efficient production operation. At the time of project\n            preparation, arrangements should be agreed for the necessary\n            specialist assistance during the construction period so that\n            the operating company is not burdened with these\n            responsibilities, which then detract from the efforts that\n            the companies should be making to ensure good design and\n            construction quality control, and to prepare for the startup\n            and operating phase. In the case of the project, where the\n            companies had no prior experience of operating such complex\n            facilities, it is even more important that management\n            energies are free to concentrate on the operating phase and\n            that adequate technical assistance resources are provided\n            within the project for these purposes. Measures during\n            implementation to improve project management monitoring and\n            controls are likely to succeed only where these are\n            incremental to an already familiar and well established\n            project management system; and 2) project components, such\n            as the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) training, should have\n            a direct relevance to the project and external funding\n            should either be assured at appraisal or provisions made for\n            funding from the loan proceeds."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Hubei Phosphate Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Hubei Phosphate Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/06/732058/china-hubei-phosphate-project","projn":"CN-Phosphate II Hubei -- P003575","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Economic Theory & Research,Water Conservation,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980901092840"},"subsc":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,aluminum,Bank Loans,Bank\n            Performance,Construction,current costs,debt,debt\n            relief,deposits,discharge,discount rate,drainage,economic\n            objectives,Economic Rate of\n            Return,effluent,equipment,farming,fertilizers,Financial\n            restructuring,FISCAL YEAR,Gender,inflation,Institutional\n            Development,integration,interest rates,liquidity,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,aluminum,Bank Loans,Bank\n            Performance,Construction,current costs,debt,debt\n            relief,deposits,discharge,discount rate,drainage,economic\n            objectives,Economic Rate of\n            Return,effluent,equipment,farming,fertilizers,Financial\n            restructuring,FISCAL YEAR,Gender,inflation,Institutional\n            Development,integration,interest rates,liquidity,"}},"owner":"Financial & Private Sector Dept.
