This\n            memorandum seeks the approval of the Regional Vice President\n            (MNAVP) to extend the closing date of the project by 12\n            months from its current closing date of December 31, 2010 to\n            December 31, 2011. The performance of the recipients, in\n            particular the three implementing operators is satisfactory:\n            The project is rated satisfactory for progress towards\n            achievement of objective, Overall implementation progress,\n            project management, counterpart funding, monitoring and\n            evaluation and safeguards. The only change is the extension\n            of the closing date of the project by 12 months from its\n            current closing date of December 31, 2010 to December 31,\n            2011.  The extension is necessary to allow the full\n            utilization of the grants. The extension will also give\n            ample time to process remaining disbursements, which\n            committed their subsidy amount in full in the second and\n            third quarters of 2010, respectively. The change does not\n            impact the project performance indicators, which remain the\n            same. The changes described above do not have a significant\n            impact on the original economic, financial, technical,\n            institutional or safeguards aspects of the project. The\n            Project's development objective remains achievable. The\n            extension would give additional time to provide subsidized\n            access to services to about 1,870 poor households in the\n            Greater Casablanca area, which the remaining subsidy can\n            allow connecting under the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco -
