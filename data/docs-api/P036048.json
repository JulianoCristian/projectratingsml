The lessons learned indicate that projects\n            should adopt a broad ecosystem-based approach in addressing\n            coral reef conservation, focusing on fisheries. Communities\n            should be the focus of coral reef ecosystem and fisheries\n            management activities. Coral reef ecosystem and fisheries\n            management is a time-consuming process of consensus-building\n            among resource users and stakeholders. Coral reef ecosystem\n            and fisheries management will benefit from decentralization.\n            Communities and local government need central government or\n            other external partners to manage coral reef ecosystems and\n            fisheries. Coral reef MCS and enforcement measures must be\n            cost-effective and sustainable. In dealing with diverse and\n            dynamic communities, flexibility must be incorporated into\n            the design of all coral reef ecosystem and fisheries\n            management activities. Fully-protected marine reserves\n            should be selected based on some fisheries criteria. Marine\n            protected areas require long-term funding and institutional\n            commitments from both donors and governments. It is vital to\n            incorporate specific provisions for coordination among\n            components. It is important to begin working early with a\n            borrower on the preparation for the next Adaptable Program\n            Loan (APL) phase, most likely from the time of the mid-term\n            review, in order to avoid financing gaps and ensure\n            continuity between phases. Project designs should provide\n            for information exchange within the relevant scientific and\n            development agency communities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Coral Reef Rehabilitation and\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Coral Reef\n            Rehabilitation and Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/03/5707045/indonesia-coral-reef-rehabilitation-management-project","projn":"ID-Coral Reef Rehabilitation And Management\n            Project (Coremap) -- P036048","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Public Sector Economics,National Governance,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20050404100536"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,Law and justice,General education sector","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"administrative decentralization,\n            communities, community development, councils,\n            decentralization, economics, employment, equipment,\n            extension, families, financial management, fish, Fisheries,\n            health surveys, information centers, Institutional capacity,\n            institutional structures, Institutionalization, integration,\n            international best practices, leadership, legal framework,\n            Legislatures, Lessons Learned, living conditions, local\n            enterprises, Management Plans, management strategy, media,\n            Natural Resources, NGOs, Objectives, Outputs, organizational\n            structures, Pacific Region, partnership, performance\n            indicators, Performance Indicators, Log, poverty\n            alleviation, private sector, procurement, Program\n            Management, project implementation, Project Management,\n            project preparation, provincial levels, quality of life,\n            radio, radio programs, REHABILITATION, Resource Management,\n            Resources Management, Rural Development, schools, Social\n            Development, social services, strategic planning,\n            Supervision, universities"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF022985-SIDA CTF FOR ENVIRONMENT-MARINE ENVIRON.,TF029282-PHRD-CORAL REEF REHAB. &\n            MGMT.

The institutional development impact of the\n            project was substantial. The project supported the\n            Government of Indonesia (GOI's) decision to designate\n            the newly created Department of Marine Affairs and Fisheries\n            (DKP) as the agency responsible for the equitable and\n            sustainable management of coral reef resources, here there\n            had been none before. The sustainability of the project is\n            not evaluable at this time. Overall, while the economic\n            justification for Coral Reef Management Program (COREMAP) is\n            robust, not only because of the local benefits but also\n            because of the high global benefits of protecting\n            Indonesia's coral reef diversity, insufficient\n            information is available to judge the resilience to risk of\n            the other major factors that need to be considered. The\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory. The preparation of\n            the project was underpinned by extensive analytical papers\n            and surveys, and GOI ownership was strong. The design of the\n            project was unusually complex, but responded to the needs of\n            the proposed strategy and the lack of a robust institutional\n            counterpart. Supervision focused on development impact and\n            responded flexibly to drastic changes in institutional and\n            country conditions, although donor coordination could have\n            been better."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Coral Reef Rehabilitation and\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Coral Reef\n            Rehabilitation and Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/03/3126357/indonesia-coral-reef-rehabilitation-management-project","projn":"ID-Coral Reef Rehabilitation And Management\n            Project (Coremap) -- P036048","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Community Development and Empowerment,General Technology,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040409153141"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,Law and justice,General education sector","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"capacity\n            building,climate,communities,community\n            groups,decentralization,equipment,extension,fish,Fisheries,fishers,fishing,Institutionalization,Integration,laws,legislation,local\n            communities,managers,natural resources,NGOs,Performance\n            Assessment,Pilot Projects,Project Appraisal,Project\n            Implementation,technical aspects,transparency,universities"},"1":{"cdata!":"capacity\n            building,climate,communities,community\n            groups,decentralization,equipment,extension,fish,Fisheries,fishers,fishing,Institutionalization,Integration,laws,legislation,local\n            communities,managers,natural resources,NGOs,Performance\n            Assessment,Pilot Projects,Project Appraisal,Project\n            Implementation,technical aspects,transparency,universities"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF022985-SIDA CTF FOR ENVIRONMENT-MARINE ENVIRON.,TF029282-PHRD-CORAL REEF REHAB. &\n            MGMT.
