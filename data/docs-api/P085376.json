Some lessons learned included: the\n            project adopted an innovative design by forming a model of\n            intervention in addressing the needs faced by rural migrants\n            at different stages of the rural-to-urban migration in a\n            comprehensive manner.

The project was carefully\n            designed so that the public sector will not crowd out the\n            private sector service delivery. Various training modalities\n            were developed by paying special attention to migrant\n            workers\u2019 constraints. There is a need to incorporate gender\n            mainstreaming into the intervention model by understanding\n            gender perspectives in access to information, skills\n            development opportunities, employment services, and the\n            gender disparities in the jobs rural migrants aspire to\n            obtain. The monitoring and evaluation (M and E) framework\n            adopted by the project was innovative, adopting the best\n            practice design requiring strong capacity, commitment, and\n
