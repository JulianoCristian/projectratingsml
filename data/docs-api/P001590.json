Yield increases are expected to result\n            from the application of fertilizers, together with improved\n            cultivation and weeding practices. The introduction of these\n            techniques through extension will be supported by the\n            closely integrated development of rural infrastructure, the\n            provision of supervised farm credit service, reorganization\n            of holdings and registration of titles to land. About\n            one-third of the proposed credit would be directed towards\n            the financing of extension staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Lilongwe Agricultural Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malawi - Lilongwe Agricultural\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1968/01/1556678/malawi-lilongwe-agricultural-development-project","projn":"MW-Lilongwe Agric Devt -- P001590","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Agricultural Research,Economic Theory & Research,Banks & Banking Reform,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Malawi","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101903034267"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            equipment,agriculture,cost variations,crops,economic\n            growth,effective\n            use,equipment,extension,Farmers,fertilizers,foreign\n            exchange,housing,Imports,maize,Marketing,reorganization,rural\n            infrastructure,soil conservation,UNDP,United Nations,value added"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            equipment,agriculture,cost variations,crops,economic\n            growth,effective\n            use,equipment,extension,Farmers,fertilizers,foreign\n            exchange,housing,Imports,maize,Marketing,reorganization,rural\n            infrastructure,soil conservation,UNDP,United Nations,value added"}},"owner":"CD03: MW/ZM/ZW (AFC03)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"P582"},"facets":{}}}
