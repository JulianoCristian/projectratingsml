The key lessons learned are: 1)\n            Ambitious but realistic reform targets can be important\n            stimulus to action. Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) targets\n            were established that challenged the Government to act\n            boldly across a broad front. The lesson is that the setting\n            of less ambiguous targets, even if they might have had a\n            greater likelihood of attainment, would probably have\n            resulted in less progress in the end. 2) A participatory\n            approach can help the Government achieve consensus among its\n            own bodies. This involved major changes to strengthen\n            capacity for the management of public finances, as well as\n            development of a framework and associated action plan for\n            the reform of the public sector, although further action is\n            needed for the latter. 3) Setting realistic objectives and\n            working out their major elements with key civil servants in\n            transition economies such as Latvia can motivate the\n            professionals in the Government and can stimulate changes in\n            the way officials think about economic policy. 4) Public\n            sector reform is a delicate process which requires clear\n            vision, careful planning, and a schedule for implementation\n            over a number of years. It also requires strong leadership\n            from the top as such reform concerns every ministry and\n            agency in the Government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latvia - Structural Adjustment Loan

The main policy areas to be\n            supported by the SAL are: a) adopting and maintaining a\n            macroeconomic framework for stable growth; b) encouraging\n            efficient growth by expediting privatization, enforcing\n            financial discipline on banks and enterprises, and improving\n            market efficiency; and c) reforming public sector resources\n
