Some of the\n            lessons learned included: 1) subsidized credit and credit\n            delivered through non-financial institutions is not a\n            sustainable approach to rural finance and innovation. The\n            project design included three approaches to providing credit\n            in rural areas: (i) subsidized credit under the Pastoral\n            Risk Management (PRM) component; (ii) credit offered on\n            commercial terms under the Micro-Finance Development Fund\n            (MDF); and (iii) Revolving Loan Fund (RLFs) operated by\n            local authorities. Of these three approaches, only the MDF\n            approach proved viable and sustainable. The performance of\n            the subsidized credit and the RLFs was weak, the former\n            having low repayment rates and weak administration and the\n            latter dropped from the project due to weak performance; 2)\n            fostering community participation is a continuous on-going\n            task that requires explicit attention and resources; and 3)\n            information on project implementation and outcomes,\n            increasing public awareness of the project, and a strong\n            communications strategy are essential for successful\n            implementation. Project implementation was occasionally held\n            back by a lack of understanding of the project's\n            objectives and approach. Even though a monitoring and\n            evaluation system was established under the project, more\n            attention could have been provided to presenting and\n            disseminating information to a range of audiences, including\n            the beneficiary communities, the general public and\n            non-governmental organizations, Government and\n

(winter disasters), and other shocks through\n            risk forecasting and contingency planning, grazing and\n            pasture management, herder self-help initiatives, and hay\n            and fodder enterprise development. 2) Micro-finance outreach\n            will provide micro-finance services to targeted poor and\n            vulnerable non-poor households and individual achieved in\n            remote rural areas of the eight core aimags through the\n            creation of a micro-financed development fund and the\n            strengthening of revolving loan funds. 3) Local

implementation\n            of the Sustainable Livelihoods Project, whose objective is\n            to enhance capabilities of community groups, and poor,\n            vulnerable households to better manage risk, build income\n            generation assets, and participate in the improved community\n            infrastructure, and basic services. The social assessment\n            argues the project does not create conditions by which\n            ethnic minorities will benefit from the development process,\n            nor does any legal, or practical difference exist in the\n            entitlement of, or access by different ethnic groups to\n            natural resources. For this reason, rather than an\n            indigenous peoples plan, this EMDS is seemingly a more\n            appropriate instrument to benefit ethnic minorities. The\n            EMDS is based on the legal framework of the Constitution of\n            Mongolia, which stipulates the principles that all citizens\n            have equal rights, and on the policies of the Bank on\n            indigenous peoples. Under the Local Initiative Fund\n            component, particular flexibility will be allowed for ethnic\n            minorities. Areas for support will be on women's health\n            to reduce the high maternal mortality rates, in particular\n            among Kazakh minorities - an issue to be explored further,\n            since it is contradictory to the low infant mortality rates;\n            and, on education, and the medium of instruction - up to the\n            secondary level, instruction is in Kazakh language, a\n            conflicting issue upon accessing higher education, for the\n            official prevailing, language is Mongolian.

The social assessment\n            argues the project does not create conditions by which\n            ethnic minorities will benefit from the development process,\n            nor does any legal, or practical difference exist in the\n            entitlement of, or access by different ethnic groups to\n            natural resources. For this reason, rather than an\n            indigenous peoples plan, this EMDS is seemingly a more\n            appropriate instrument to benefit ethnic minorities. The\n            EMDS is based on the legal framework of the Constitution of\n            Mongolia, which stipulates the principles that all citizens\n            have equal rights, and on the policies of the Bank on\n            indigenous peoples. Under the Local Initiative Fund\n            component, particular flexibility will be allowed for ethnic\n            minorities. Areas for support will be on women's health\n            to reduce the high maternal mortality rates, in particular\n            among Kazakh minorities - an issue to be explored further,\n            since it is contradictory to the low infant mortality rates;\n            and, on education, and the medium of instruction - up to the\n            secondary level, instruction is in Kazakh language, a\n            conflicting issue upon accessing higher education, for the\n            official prevailing, language is Mongolian.

risk management\n            (PRM), supporting the preparation and implementation of an\n            integrated strategy to reduce herders' vulnerability to\n            drought; microfinance service outreach (MSO), supporting\n            structural change in commercial and civil society provision\n            of microfinance services; and local initiative funds (LIF),\n            supporting demand-driven mechanisms for beneficiary groups\n            to select, co-finance, and execute investments in basic\n            infrastructure and social services. This environmental and\n            social assessment suggests that the project has the\n            potential to deliver an overall positive environmental\n            impact through a contribution to reduced land degradation in\n            PRM. The environmental assessment has considered all of the\n            potential negative impacts of the project activities and\n            provides details on several activities that may have\n            negative impacts and proposes mitigation actions. These\n            activities include: community-based rodent control,\n            community-based control of predation, community-based\n            construction and rehabilitation of wells, emergency\n            restocking, haymaking, intersum/inter-aimag otor reserves,\n            and veterinary services. The potential of the project to\n            deliver positive improvements in reduced land degradation\n            should far outweigh any localized environmental impacts of\n            the project activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Social assessment of the World Bank\n            Sustainable Livelihoods Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mongolia -
