Similarly, the audit downgrades the Agricultural\n            Support Services Project (ASSP) ICR's ratings, to\n            moderately satisfactory project outcomes, and considers\n            sustainability as non-evaluable, while concurs with a modest\n            institutional development impact, and satisfactory\n            performances by the Bank, and Borrower. The lessons, largely\n            consistent with findings on research, and extension in other\n            countries, suggest the diagnosis of constraints emerging\n            during project preparation, should lead to a set of reforms\n            identifying the minimum for an effective project, clearly\n            articulated, within the evolving Bank management\n            documentation. In addition, the adoption of new unified\n            national extension approaches, should be based on evaluated\n            cost-effectiveness data, though it is important to maintain\n            experimentation with alternative approaches to further\n            pursue cost-effectiveness. While cutting research costs by\n            institutional rationalization (i.e., closing of stations) is\n            politically difficult, it is seldom addressed by neither the\n            Bank, nor the Borrower, yet should be pursued. Therefore, a\n            thorough analysis of project financial sustainability should\n            be considered at appraisal time, rather than focusing mainly\n            on funding during implementation. Other lessons address the\n            need to focus on procurement issues based on intensive early\n            supervision, and, introduction of computerized management\n            systems, should be matched to the level of computer skills,\n            and technical support capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Agricultural Support Services,\n            and Agricultural Research Management Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Agricultural Support\n            Services, and Agricultural Research Management Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/05/2362331/bangladesh-agricultural-support-services-agricultural-research-management-projects","projn":"BD-Agric.

Overall\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower is\n            evaluated as satisfactory. Lessons learned are the\n            following: 1) Sustainability of research projects with a\n            heavy emphasis on institutional development will not come\n            about simply by securing continuous donor funding.\n            Sustainability can only be achieved by research\n            organizations developing management skills and processes to\n            allow work on priority research to continue even in the face\n            of reduced budgets envelopes, through strict financial\n            management and by ensuring appropriate staffing levels are\n            maintained. 2) The effectiveness of technical assistance and\n            training would be increased if programs are well coordinated\n            and linked technically to ensure they complement each other,\n            and implemented early in the project to allow benefits\n            coming from these activities to be felt during\n            implementation and to allow new processes to be\n            institutionalized before the project ends. In some cases,\n            this might mean outsourcing management of these programs. 3)\n            Procurement management capacity must be assessed\n            realistically at appraisal. 4) Project implementation units\n            are neither necessary or desirable, as they tend to isolate\n            project activities from the mainstream operations of\n            implementing agencies, possibly depriving it of high-level\n            support needed for effective implementation and longer term sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Agricultural Research\n
