Public Service Performance\n            Enhancement Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Public Service Performance\n            Enhancement Project for Uganda received a moderately\n            unsatisfactory development outcome with substantial risk to\n            development outcome. The Bank received a moderately\n            unsatisfactory performance rating while the Borrower\u0092s\n            performance was deemed unsatisfactory. Two restructurings\n            took place during this project. The first restructuring\n            limited component 2 to three main activities, including (i)\n            establishment of a Civil Service College (CSC); (ii)\n            provision of targeted training and research in strategic\n            areas of the growth agenda; and (iii) equip top public\n            service managers with leadership skills, b. reducing the\n            Credit amount and, c. extending the closing date by 2 years.\n            The second restructuring pushed the closing date back one\n            more year. There were six key lessons taken from this\n            project and are as follows: (1) A first lesson learned is\n            the importance of investing time and effort in aligning and\n            securing both political and technical support for the life\n            of the project. (2) A second lesson learned is that\n            appropriate monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are\n            required to proactively track the impacts of reforms. (3) A\n            third lesson learned is the importance of focusing on\n            context and process in project design, taking into account\n            political economy factors as well as existing and potential\n            capacity constraints. (4) A fourth lesson learned is the\n            need for flexible and iterative approaches in project\n            implementation. (5) A fifth lesson learned is the importance\n            of adequate leadership, capacity, and authority in the\n            implementing agency. (6) A sixth lesson learned is that\n            clear and simple implementation arrangements are essential\n            to smooth implementation during the life of a project and to\n            the eventual achievement of project objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda -
