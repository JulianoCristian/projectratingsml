The lessons learned indicate that because of\n            the country's relative wealth (oil & gas revenues)\n            and its history of building State Owned Enterprises (SoEs)\n            after independence, most of the Algerian\n            officials/politicians and part of the population may still\n            have been convinced that, after all, the country can afford\n            to have poorly performing SoEs and does not need to\n            privatize. Intensive supervision can fix a project that may\n            have design flaws. In view of this, some regions invest more\n            resources in project supervision than in project appraisal,\n            given resource constraints. Since political support for\n            privatization was still fragile in Algeria, it might have\n            been better to distill quickly the benefits of privatization\n            achieved in transactions that occurred prior to the\n            Bank's loan and communicate these strategically to all\n            stakeholders. For institutional sustainability, a Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) set-up is not necessarily ideal.\n            The ambivalence of respective roles needs to be clarified\n            ahead of time. This would avoid the question as to what\n            extent the Bank should take a position in a specific\n            proposed transaction if there is a difference of opinion\n            between what an investment bank recommends and what the\n            Government is willing to accept in the course of preparing\n            bidding documents, particularly if they are deemed as being\n            to restrictive."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria -
