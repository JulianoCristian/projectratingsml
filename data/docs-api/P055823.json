Some\n            lessons learned included: The inclusion of the municipal\n            environmental management component was initially criticized\n            for being an add-on (i.e. putting two projects in one).\n            However, the emphasis on decentralized, local, and municipal\n            action in all the three of its subcomponents (municipal\n            environmental investment through a dedicated fund, Municipal\n            Environmental Facility (FAM); support for municipal\n            environmental management through legal staff working with\n            municipalities and development of municipal councils; and\n            creation of an environmental information system with\n            municipal and Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)\n            participation) was a key element to their success. It is\n            quite likely that without being linked to a larger effort in\n            support of decentralization to municipalities, these efforts\n            would not have developed so effectively. Also assisting in\n            the success of these efforts was: (i) consistency and\n            effectiveness in the leadership of the involved ministry,\n            Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA); and\n            (ii) consistency and effectiveness in the supervision by the\n            Bank of the most complex of the subcomponents, National\n            Environmental Information System of Nicaragua (SINIA), which\n            received substantial input from one specialized Bank staff\n            member throughout the life of the project. The participation\n            of volunteer organizations particularly youth was\n            unexpectedly very effective as they became partners in\n            solving some of the environmental problems and establishing\n            environmental programs. Many persons interviewed recommended\n            that any future projects spend significant investments in\n            environmental education combined with small grants to carry\n            out citizenship programs. One key ingredient for success was\n            the participation of Nicaraguan Association of\n            Municipalities (AMUNIC)  in several aspects of the project\n            (training, municipal plans, environmental commission, etc.)\n            that ensured the continuity of many of the programs despite\n            political changes which resulted in leadership and staff\n            changes in municipalities and national government alike. In\n            particular, AMUNIC played a strong role in the environmental\n            agenda with its environmental unit staffed with highly\n            qualified staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua -

This summary of\n            environmental analysis, and mitigation plan includes a\n            checklist to classify subprojects into two categories,\n            namely category I, where no impact is identified, to be\n            reviewed by the Technical Environmental Unit, and, category\n            II where minor environmental problems are identified, thus\n            requiring a limited environmental review, to be conducted by\n            the Technical Environmental Unit, and the Ministry of\n            Natural Resources and the Environment (MARENA). However,\n            those subprojects that fall under category III, i.e., with\n            irreversible environmental impacts, will not be financed\n            under FAM. The summary identifies the steps to be taken in\n            selecting subprojects: targeting, and promotion to ensure\n            environmental issues are introduced in project\n            implementation; project formulation to ensure environmental\n            issues are introduced to project implementation; appraisal,\n            to ensure environmental screening, and mitigation has been\n            addressed, particularly that contract clauses have been\n            enforced; and, monitoring, and evaluation to assess\n            environmental screening, and mitigation procedures. Detailed\n            mitigation plans are described in the Operational Manual."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Second Rural Municipalities\n            Development Project - summary of environmental analysis and\n            mitigation plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nicaragua -
