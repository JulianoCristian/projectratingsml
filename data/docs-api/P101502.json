Some lessons learned included: preparation and\n            effective implementation of an HIV/AIDS project in\n            Afghanistan demonstrated that innovative programming is\n            possible even in situations of extreme fragility and low\n            counterpart capacity; the use of Non-Government Organization\n            (NGO) contracting for service delivery, although challenged\n            by delays in defining and implementing a selection process\n            in a limited field of potential candidates, built on solid\n            experience in this innovative approach and helped form the\n            model for future projects; the efficiency of HIV prevention\n            programs is greatly enhanced by the generation of\n            epidemiological data to guide allocations to those\n            populations and regions at greatest risk; the effectiveness\n            of HIV prevention programs depends on technical strength of\n            evidence-based interventions, adequate coverage of target\n            populations with services and a permissive legal and policy\n            framework; and the World Bank has been a global leader in\n            providing services to vulnerable and marginalized\n            populations in the HIV epidemic."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - HIV/AIDS Prevention

The project has four\n            components: communications and advocacy activities will aim\n            to increase knowledge of HIV prevention among opinion\n            leaders and the general
