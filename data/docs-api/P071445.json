These projects are reviewed together because all\n            three dealt with aspects of public sector financial\n            management (PFM). However, the TA project and the SAC also\n            addressed many other policy and institutional issues. All\n            three projects suffered from flaws in project design and\n            supervision, and weak government commitment to certain\n            project objectives. The TA project and the D&R project\n            outcomes were rated unsatisfactory in Implementation\n            Completion Report (ICRs) and ICR reviews, and the SAC\n            outcome was rated unsatisfactory, and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower was also rated moderately\n            unsatisfactory for TA and SAC, and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower for D&R is rated moderately\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned from the projects are: (i)\n            a substantial share of donor aid to Cambodia has been\n            allocated to TA, but results have been generally\n            disappointing. Too much TA has been donor-driven without\n            adequate Government involvement. This is changing in the\n            Bank-led support for the Public Financial Management Reform\n            Program (PFMRP); (ii) all three projects suffered from flaws\n            in project design. The TA project and the SAC were overly\n            broad in attempting to resolve too many problems through a\n            single operation. The SAC had an excessive number of\n            conditions which delayed effectiveness and tranche releases.\n            The D&R project failed to heed the public complaints\n            about falsification of the number of military personnel and\n            corruption in handling the military payroll; (iii) the Bank\n            was unrealistic in its assessment of the Government's\n            commitment to many of the reforms in public administration\n            and governance supported by these projects; (iv) the Bank\n            should have carried out more intensive supervision of\n            fiduciary issues in the International Development\n            Association (IDA) portfolio. However, after the findings\n            that led the Bank to declare misprocurement in the D&R\n            project, the subsequent fiduciary review and the ensuing\n            World Bank Department of Institutional Integrity (INT)\n            investigations, the Bank has now taken appropriate steps to\n            address these problems; and (v) the Bank delayed for almost\n            ten years before building up an adequate field office\n            presence, contrary to the lessons of experience in\n            post-conflict countries. This had an adverse effect on the\n            Bank's ability to supervise complex projects, to\n            maintain regular contact with government officials, and to\n            work effectively with other donors. This deficiency has been\n            corrected since 2003."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Technical Assistance Project;\n            Structural Adjustment Credit; and Demobilization and\n

The Demobilization and Reintegration\n            Project objectives were (i) to assist the Government in its\n            effort to demobilize 30,000 soldiers and to promote their\n            successful adaptation to civilian life; and (ii) to\n            contribute to a reallocation of budgetary resources to the\n            social sectors in order to build human, social and economic\n            assets.  Lessons learned include: the issues which arose due\n            to the political environment highlight the need for good and\n            frank political analysis and assessment as part of project\n            preparation; for the Bank to assist in developing better\n            mechanisms of accountability in the government, makes sense\n            from the perspective of internal governance, as well as\n            ultimately helping to create a healthier environment; even\n            in the absence of formal mechanisms in the country, the Bank\n            and Implementing agency can do much to help build trust\n            between all parties from the outset by agreeing on process\n            and procedures to ensure transparency and encouraging broad\n            participation from a range of stakeholders at all stages in\n            the project; good knowledge and understanding of the\n            military issues and objectives of military reform should be\n            an essential element of designing demobilization;\n            registration of soldiers needs to be carried out with\n            extreme caution; demobilization projects need to be designed\n            so that they do not increase incentives for soldiers to stay\n            in the army in the hope of being included in a later stage,\n            but progressively offer encouragement to leave for those\n            that are no longer suitable to serve; increased monitoring\n            of outputs on the ground, and greater inclusion of civil\n            society and others in monitoring these outputs would be\n            beneficial; legal agreements and Terms of Reference for\n            consultants need to be carefully reviewed to ensure that\n            there is no doubt as to the level of responsibility\n            delegated to the consultants; strong leadership by Bank\n            management in difficult cases is essential."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia -
