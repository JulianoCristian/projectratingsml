The\n            Economic Recovery Credit Project had the following ratings:\n            outcome was highly satisfactory; sustainability was likely;\n            institutional development impact was not evaluable; Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. The Economic Management Credit Project had the\n            following ratings: outcome was moderately satisfactory;\n            sustainability was likely; institutional development impact\n            was modest; Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. The Third Structural\n            Adjustment Credit Project had the following ratings: outcome\n            was moderately unsatisfactory; sustainability was likely;\n            institutional development impact was modest; Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. The main lessons learned from this review are:\n            1) Country ownership matters very much. The components of\n            the loans that were owned by the country, such as the public\n            resource management and some of the structural adjustment\n            components were generally successfully implemented; 2) As a\n            general rule, it would be very useful for the Bank to listen\n            better and to go to extra lengths to explain it s positions,\n            and to solicit views and seek genuine agreement with country\n            authorities. This could improve country ownership of\n            programs; 3) It is important to keep a good and substantive\n            dialogue with the main development partners; again by\n            listening better to their view points, keeping them better\n            informed about those of the Bank, and seeking to reach\n            agreements when possible; and 4) As has happened already\n            with the Fourth Structural Adjustment Credit, it would be\n            preferable to keep the design of adjustment operations\n            simple and focused on a limited number of key policy areas,\n            whose implementation can be realistically expected within\n            the short disbursement period dictated by an adjustment operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - First

The project was intended to support the\n            government's adjustment efforts in two key areas of the\n            second year Policy Framework Paper (PFP): (i) improving the\n            economic incentive system; and (ii) improving public\n            resources management. Measures to improve the economic\n            incentive system included:( i) simplificationan d\n            rationalizatioonf foreign trade taxation; (ii) restructuring\n            of indirect and direct taxation; and (iii) removal of\n            regulatory constraints inhibiting private sector\n            development. Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) it was unrealistict o\n            hope to achieves ustainable overall growth of the economy in\n            the face of deteriorating terms of trade without a\n            substantial depreciation of the real exchange rate; (ii) a\n            longer term institutionald evelopmentp roject, in which\n            other donors participate, could be a better instrument han a\n            Technical Assistance (TA) component     that accompanies a\n            SAL; (iii) the extentt o which a countryh as met the general\n            tranche release criterion of maintaining an appropriate\n            macroeconomic framework may be difficult to evaluate\n            objectively; and (iv) while it is appropriate to set\n            quantitative targets for budget allocations to specific\n            sectors, budget execution could differ significantly from\n            budget allocations and, although the sectoral target may
