To that effect, IFC will participate in\n            SOFISEDIT's capital increase. In addition, the project\n            will provide: (a) SOFISEDIT with equity and term resources\n            to make sound investments in the industrial, fisheries and\n            tourism sectors; (b) technical assistance to strengthen\n            SOFISEDIT financially and institutionally; (c) support to\n            SONEPI and thereby improve the promotion of small- and\n            medium-scale enterprises; (d) funds to study and identify\n            appropriate changes in Government policies and procedures to\n            enhance productive investments; and (e) training for the\n            Ministry of Industrial Development and Artisans. By\n            providing technical and financial assistance to productive\n            investments, the project will help increase participation of\n            local entrepreneurs in the industrial sector and create\n            employment.

  promote productive investments, notably, in export-oriented\n            industries. To that effect, IFC will participate in\n            SOFISEDIT's capital increase. In addition, the project\n            will provide: (a) SOFISEDIT with equity and term resources\n            to make sound investments in the industrial, fisheries and\n            tourism sectors; (b) technical assistance to strengthen\n            SOFISEDIT financially and institutionally; (c) support to\n            SONEPI and thereby improve the promotion of small- and\n            medium-scale enterprises; (d) funds to study and identify\n            appropriate changes in Government policies and procedures to\n            enhance productive investments; and (e) training for the\n            Ministry of Industrial Development and Artisans. By\n            providing technical and financial assistance to productive\n            investments, the project will help increase participation of\n            local entrepreneurs in the industrial sector and create\n            employment. In the longer term, the project will build up\n            SOFISEDIT's capacity to promote and supervise\n            efficiently sub-projects in the industrial, fisheries and\n            tourism sectors and help the Government and SONEPI\n            streamline their investment promotion role."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Investment Promotion (Third\n            SOFISEDIT) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Investment Promotion\n            (Third SOFISEDIT) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1981/03/726162/senegal-investment-promotion-third-sofisedit-project","projn":"SN-Investment Promotion -- P002310","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,International Terrorism & Counterterrorism","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Senegal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912515226"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other finance","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,agriculture,Assets,auditors,bad\n            debts,Balance Sheets,Banking System,Banque Centrale des\n            Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest,budget\n            constraints,capacity utilization,Central Bank,commercial\n            banks,competitiveness,correspondent banks,Credit\n            Policies,debt,decentralization,Development\n            Agencies,development banks,development strategy,doubtful\n            loans,economic growth,Economic Impact,Economic\n            Trends,employment,equity capital,Equity\n            Investments,Exploitation,exports,financial\n            management,Financial Ratios,Financial Sector,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fish,fisheries,Fishing,Fixed Assets,foreign\n            exchange,Free Trade,GDP,GDP per capita,Gross Domestic\n            Product,gross earnings,growth\n            rate,housing,imports,Income,Inflation,Interest Rate,interest\n            rates,international competition,laws,liquidity,Management\n            reports,monetary policies,natural resource base,Net\n            Profit,Net Worth,oil,oil prices,operating costs,ownership\n            structure,population growth,portfolio,Price\n            increases,private housing,productivity,purchasing\n            power,state intervention,Statements,Technical\n            Assistance,transport,value added,value of output,wages"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,agriculture,Assets,auditors,bad\n            debts,Balance Sheets,Banking System,Banque Centrale des\n            Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest,budget\n            constraints,capacity utilization,Central Bank,commercial\n            banks,competitiveness,correspondent banks,Credit\n            Policies,debt,decentralization,Development\n            Agencies,development banks,development strategy,doubtful\n            loans,economic growth,Economic Impact,Economic\n            Trends,employment,equity capital,Equity\n            Investments,Exploitation,exports,financial\n            management,Financial Ratios,Financial Sector,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fish,fisheries,Fishing,Fixed Assets,foreign\n            exchange,Free Trade,GDP,GDP per capita,Gross Domestic\n            Product,gross earnings,growth\n            rate,housing,imports,Income,Inflation,Interest Rate,interest\n            rates,international competition,laws,liquidity,Management\n            reports,monetary policies,natural resource base,Net\n            Profit,Net Worth,oil,oil prices,operating costs,ownership\n            structure,population growth,portfolio,Price\n            increases,private housing,productivity,purchasing\n            power,state intervention,Statements,Technical\n            Assistance,transport,value added,value of output,wages"}},"owner":"WB:Dakar-FmcAFR1:SN/CV/CM/GW/MR (AFCF1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"3179"},"facets":{}}}
