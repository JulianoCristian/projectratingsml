The second objective was to promote\n            conservation of water resources and environmental\n            protection. In 2000, the Government of Tunisia's goals\n            in the sector were to further reduce vulnerability to\n            irregular rainfall and droughts, manage demand in order to\n            avoid water shortages in the future, and expand access to\n            drinking water for the rural population. An action plan\n            produced by the Ministry of Agriculture and Hydraulic\n            Resources identified five priority areas: management of\n            water demand; integrated water resource management;\n            completion of the water resource mobilization program;\n            development of non-conventional water resources; and\n            preservation and protection of water resources. As the first\n            of two consecutive projects, the Water Sector Investment\n            Project I (implemented from 2001 to 2007) was designed to\n            assist with the first phase of this action plan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Integrated water resources management in a\n            water-scarce region : Tunisia's First Water Sector\n            Investment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Integrated water resources\n            management in a water-scarce region : Tunisia's First\n            Water Sector Investment Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2008/10/9984881/integrated-water-resources-management-water-scarce-region-tunisias-first-water-sector-investment-project","projn":"1W-Feature Stories -- P111132,TN-Water Sector Investment -- P035707","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Systems,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Tunisia,World","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20081031045746"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Water supply,Irrigation and drainage,Crops","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa,The World Region,The World Region","colti":"Water feature stories ;

Some lessons\n            learned included: the outputs of this project are\n            significant and exceed expectations. Yet it is not possible\n            to show that those investments generated their intended\n            benefits because the objectives and results indicators do\n            not reflect the activities that absorbed the greatest share\n            of the funding. And the objectives that the project did have\n            are too imprecisely defined to be useful to stimulate better\n            integration, knowledge sharing and institutional change and\n            as such represent a missed opportunity. This imprecision\n            allowed those managing the project to focus on the component\n            outputs rather than the overall strategic objective. Greater\n            attention should have been given to social aspects in the\n            design and implementation of the project which would\n            probably have helped to improve the performance of certain\n            investments. For example, the demand for individual\n            household water supply connections should have better\n            estimated. Also, the complexity of socio-economic issues\n            should have been better addressed in the context of water\n            resource management issues. Reducing consumption of\n            groundwater is essentially an exercise in changing\n            incentives to farmers and thus the groundwater management\n            components would have benefited from the advice of a rural\n            sociologist. Similarly, technical assistance supporting the\n            associations of farmers managing irrigation schemes and of\n            households managing rural water supply would have benefited\n            from support from qualified sociologist."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Water Sector Investment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Water Sector Investment\n

surface erosion; avoid water logging, and improve\n            drainage to periodically flush spoils; prod cultivation of\n            salinity tolerance crops; ensure quality of waste water used\n            in irrigation; protect soil surfaces with mulch; establish\n            adequate drainage channels, and re-vegetate eroded surfaces;\n            include precautionary measures to collect, and recycle\n            lubricants to prevent accidental spillage; and, waste, and\n            sediments will be disposed of in accordance to environmental measures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Water
