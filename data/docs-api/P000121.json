The main lessons convey the following:\n            1) although the project made great strides in shifting\n            investment decisions from the Government to the community,\n            active engagement in project implementation by the\n            communities did not occur until completion of facilities,\n            and the subsequent transfer of operations, and management,\n            often taking two, to three years as of the initial request\n            submission for a water subproject, and obviously leading to\n            a sense of disempowerment among the communities. It is thus\n            suggested that the Directorate of Water Works may want to\n            learn from recent innovations in having communities more\n            involved in the procurement, and construction process; 2) a\n            clear assessment of the supply capacity, both in terms of\n            financial, and physical resources, and a flexible\n            communications campaign should not only generate community\n            demand, but provide supply responsiveness to reach targeted\n            areas; 3) while the project showed that subsidy-free\n            household sanitation is possible, new methods to replicate\n            this approach should be developed, enhancing the challenges\n            of coordinated work within the ministries of education,\n            health, and water, and defining clearer hygienic baseline\n            indicators; 4) social intermediation address the need to\n            guide communities on issues such as financial management,\n            tariff setting, hygiene and sanitation promotion, and\n            operations and maintenance, by improving linkages to\n            appropriate sources; and, 5) government, and donor\n            partnerships underline the fact that project success was\n            built on the basis of institutional partnerships, through a\n            programmatic approach."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - Rural Water Supply and\n            Sanitation
