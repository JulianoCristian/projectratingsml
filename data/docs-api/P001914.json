Key\n            lessons learned from the projects are: 1) To facilitate\n            implementation, projects should not be too complex or\n            involve too many different agencies and activities. 2) A\n            full-time project coordinator is needed to implement complex\n            projects involving many agencies, donors, and activities. 3)\n            For complex projects involving many agencies, regular\n            meetings of a ministerial level body demonstrates Government\n            commitment to environmental protection and the project. 4)\n            Regular monthly meetings chaired by the agency responsible\n            for project coordination improves communications and helps\n            in quickly identifying problems and finding solutions. 5)\n            Project implementation benefits from the use of action\n            plans. 6) All preparatory activities should be completed\n            prior to signing the legal agreement. 7) Individual project\n            components should not be overly designed, but should match\n            the technical capabilities of countries. 8) Operations and\n            maintenance requirements should be estimated and sources of\n            financing identified prior to undertaking investments. 9)\n            The participatory and open process of decision-making\n            adopted in the project helps prevent corruption within\n            government, and strengthens democratic institutions overall."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritius - Environmental Monitoring and\n            Development

        Investment Program, is to put in place the policy and\n            institutiional arrangements necessary to have physical\n            planning, land use control, infrastructure investments and\n            environmental protection managed in a coordinated and\n            rational way. The project would also enable the government\n            to take immediate remedial measures including selective\n            investments to reverse the trend of environmental\n            degradation and to develop a system of environmental\n            monitoring and analysis for setting environmental standards\n            and assessing the viability and cost-effectiveness of future\n            investments.  The components of the Environmental Investment\n            Proogram are 1) the National Physical Development Plan, 2)\n            environmental laboratories, 3) design and engineering\n            studies for an industrial park, 4) design and implementation\n            of a sanitary landfill site and rehabilitation of present\n            dumps, 5) integrated pest management and research, 6) marine\n            conservation, and 7) establishment of the Black River Gorges\n            National Park."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritius - Environmental Monitoring and\n            Development
