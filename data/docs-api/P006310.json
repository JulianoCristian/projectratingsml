The\n            overall objectives of both projects included: increasing\n            productivity and incomes; broadening employment\n            opportunities and generally improving the standard of living\n            of farm families and small-scale non-agricultural\n            enterprises; and increasing agriculture and rural industry\n            production for local and export markets; and improving\n            physical and social infrastructure. The Main lessons drawn\n            from the projects are: (a) the size and scope/complexity of\n            a project needs to be matched to existing institutional\n            capacities and to the available financial resources; (b) the\n            political, sociological and technical constraints to\n            facilitate changes, both in the effectiveness of public\n            sector institutions, as well as in behavior of\n            beneficiaries, need to be realistically assessed; (c)\n            success of investment projects depends critically on\n            availability of viable , agricultural technologies and, in\n            the case of small farmers, of credit; (d) successful land\n            distribution is a multi-faceted issue which cannot be\n            handled effectively as a minor project component, especially\n            in a politically volatile environment; (e) successful\n            project design and implementation requires the participation\n            of beneficiaries in project preparation; and (f) Bank\n            supervision needs to: (i) reinforce suitable impact\n            evaluation procedures including the establishment of\n            baseline data; and (ii) pay sufficient attention to\n            technical aspects of project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -

60,000 farm families and about 1,100 small-scale\n            entrepreneurs by providing: (a) agricultural extension,\n            experimentation, and land surveying, titling and purchase\n            services; (b) agricultural cooperative development; (c)\n            assistance to small non-agricultural enterprises; (d) feeder\n            roads, marketing facilities, and small irrigation systems;\n            (e) education, health, and sanitation services; and (f)\n            project coordination and management. The direct\n            beneficiaries comprise about 20% of the small farmer target\n            population in the state, almost all of whom fall below\n            Brazil's relative poverty level. The project will\n            develop the institutional capacity to plan and execute a\n            coordinated rural development program covering priority\n            areas throughout the State of Ceara. This rural development\n            project is the most comprehensive, in terms of geographical\n            area and coordination of programs, to be attempted so far in\n            northeast Brazil. It thus presents certain planning and\n            financial risks, in addition to those linked to agricultural development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Ceara Second Rural Development
