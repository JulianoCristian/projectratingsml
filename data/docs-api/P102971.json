Some lessons learned included: earmarking\n            funds from a DPO to specific agencies can partly undermine\n            the choice of instrument. There is a risk that in sectoral\n            DPOs with one-year operational cycles, technical and policy\n            advice to the client can be crowded out by processing\n            requirements. Program documents should clearly distinguish\n            between the description of policy areas and the program\n            being implemented, the specific prior actions and triggers,\n            and the indicators needed to assess performance. Sectoral\n            development policy operations may need complementary\n            technical assistance and support.

It can encourage\n            government agencies to focus on bilateral relationships with\n            individual development partners rather than engagement\n            through the harmonized mechanisms. Civil society can play a\n            useful role in natural resource management if government and\n            civil society groups are able to collaborate productively.\n            Creating and publishing environmental ratings of large\n            companies can help to provide public pressure on the private\n            sector to improve environmental performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -

Some lessons learned included: the\n            transition from financing individual projects to sector\n            budget support (SBS) rejuvenated ownership, and\n            revolutionized multi-agency dialogue. Although difficult to\n            quantify, the adoption of an SBS program based around a\n            government-led target-setting process resulted in a much\n            greater sense of ownership, empowerment and enthusiasm\n            amongst the implementing Ministries, Departments and\n            Agencies (MDA) than previous, discrete project investments.\n            It also engendered a far more active dialogue between the\n            sector MDAs, and more substantive engagement with both\n            Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP) and\n            National Development Planning Commission (NDPC).\n            Particularly in the case of the environment, this engagement\n            was considered crucial to improving the understanding of\n            environmental and climate change issues, and to\n            mainstreaming environment through e.g. development of\n            Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) tools for\n            government planning. It has also allowed effective\n            collaboration on financial performance, particularly in\n            regard to the work of the Revenue Management Task Force in\n            the mineral sector. NREG was worked in two parallel arenas,\n            policy reform (the primary focus of Development Policy\n            Operation, or DPOs) and strengthening sector management\n            systems (the primary focus of SBS). These should be\n            complementary, but delivery through a single instrument may\n            have complicated both. The SBS modality emphasized broad\n            engagement in sector activities rather than focusing on\n            select policy issues, whereas use of a World Bank DPO\n            template as the key program document encouraged the use of\n            the PAF as a primary planning tool and de-emphasized\n            specific investments in sector systems, such as monitoring\n            and evaluation (M&E) and technical assistance (TA). A\n            broad sector program, addressing challenges in institutional\n            capacity as well as policy reform, may be better supported\n            by a DPO in conjunction with other types of instruments. In\n            practice, sector DPOs, such as the forestry and environment\n            DPO in Cameroon, are often supported by an additional TA\n            facility. Structured TA support will have been especially\n            important in NREG as the initial analytical work established\n            a policy agenda, but not the detailed reforms needed to\n            pursue it."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - First, Second, and Third Development\n            Policy Operations for the Natural Resources and\n            Environmental Governance

Ghana. The challenges of the program were to improve\n            transparency in systems and procedures for natural resource\n            management, and improve surveillance of timber trade.\n            Government developed a five-year program of policy and\n            institutional reforms and capacity building to improve\n            natural resource and environmental governance. International\n            Development Association (IDA) and other development partners\n            were supporting government to implement this program through\n            sector budget support, and technical assistance. The\n            government had addressed important institutional reforms\n            that were enhancing its ability to address priority natural\n            resource management and environmental challenges. With NREG,\n            a one-stop shop for assistance to Ghana on natural resources\n            governance was a very significant achievement in itself.

of\n            three, development policy operation (DPO-1) to the Republic\n            of Ghana for special drawing rights to support the\n            Government of Ghana (GoG) as it implements reforms under its\n            Natural Resources and Environmental Governance (NREG)\n            program. The NREG program has been developed and is fully\n            owned by Ghana's relevant governmental agencies. This\n            first DPO focuses on a set of policies and reforms in the\n            inter-related sectors of forestry and wildlife, mining, and\n            environmental protection intended to: (a) ensure predictable\n            and sustainable financing of the forest and wildlife sectors\n            and effective forest law enforcement; (b) improve mining\n            sector revenue collection, management, and transparency; (c)\n            address social issues in forest and mining communities; and\n            (d) mainstream environment into growth through strategic\n            environmental assessment, environmental impact assessment,\n            and development of a climate change strategy. The DPO will\n            also support GoG's efforts to address the emerging oil\n            sector and to adopt a more holistic, integrated approach to\n            the management of its extractive industries. The\n            programmatic DPO series is expected to provide three types\n            of benefits. First, direct benefits expected at completion\n            of the series include: (a) improved management of government\n            revenues and finances in the forestry and mining sectors;\n            (b) reduced illegal logging; (c) reduced social conflict in\n            forestry and mining communities; and (d) integration of\n            environmental considerations into policy formulation and\n            implementation across government, including risks associated\n            with climate change. In addition, there are two intermediate\n            benefits. The first is providing the framework for\n            International Development Association (IDA) to deepen and\n            expand its engagement in Ghana's natural resources\n            governance reforms, which to date have been supported to a\n            more limited extent under the Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credits (PRSC)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -
