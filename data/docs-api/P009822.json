Some lessons learned\n            included: the original objectives of the project were very\n            narrow. They reflected the Bank's approach to power\n            sector lending in India at the time. The loan performance of\n            the subject project and other State Electricity Board (SEB)\n            projects has had the Bank to shift its strategy to advocate\n            radical restructuring of the state power sector in India.\n            Careful project preparation is important to the ultimate\n            success or failure of the Project. The design of the dam was\n            performed by Central Water Commission (CWC), but the\n            technical parameters and construction methodology were not\n            reviewed by an independent panel of experts. This review was\n            undertaken after project appraisal that resulted in the\n            recommendation by the committee to change the basic design\n            of the dam from rock-fill to concrete structure. This was\n            contested by CWC with resulting uncertainties and long\n            delays. Roles and responsibilities of stakeholders should be\n            fully defined at the project preparation stage. Overlapping\n            responsibilities created major confusion in the\n            implementation of the project. The responsibilities of CWC\n            and Central Electricity Authority (CEA) should have been\n            defined and their respective roles as central organizations\n            overseeing project implementation should have been fully\n            delineated to avoid the conflicting positions taken by these agencies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

electricity demand in the State of Madhya Pradesh and in the\n            Western Region of India through the addition of 500 MW of\n            hydro-power capacity and better use of the existing thermal\n            plants. The project comprises the construction of a 500 MW\n            (4 x 125 MW) hydro-power station including all equipment,\n            civil works and a transmission line to the Western Regional\n            grid. Main works include a 90 m high, 1650 m long combined\n            gravity and rock-fill dam, about 4500 m of tunnels and\n            shafts, a powerhouse, and 5 km of discharge channels. The\n            project also includes a pilot thermal plant rehabilitation\n            program designed to provide for more efficient use of\n            MPEB's thermal stations, which will serve as a basis\n            for eventual development of an India-wide rehabilitation\n            program, and improvement and expansion of MPEB's data\n            processing unit and services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Bodhghat (Indira Sarovar)\n            Hydroelectric Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Bodhghat (Indira Sarovar)\n            Hydroelectric Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1984/04/725095/india-bodhghat-indira-sarovar-hydroelectric-project","projn":"IN-Bodhghat - Hydro -- P009822","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Technology & Transmission,Energy and Environment,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Environment,Science and Technology Development,Energy","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101901074453"},"subsc":"(Historic)Hydro","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Science and Technology Development,Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural uses,charcoal,civil\n            engineering,coal,coal,Coal prices,commercial\n            energy,commercial energy\n            consumption,Construction,construction equipment,Cost Benefit\n            Analysis,covers,Distribution Losses,domestic use,ECONOMIC\n            ANALYSIS,economic development,economic growth,efficient\n            use,Electric Power,ELectricity,Electricity\n            Boards,electricity consumption,electricity\n            demand,electricity prices,electricity supply,energy\n            conservation,Energy Consumption,Energy Generation,energy\n            intensity,energy policy,energy prices,Energy Pricing,Energy\n            Resources,ENERGY SECTOR,energy\n            supply,Engineering,Engineers,Environmental\n            Aspects,Expenditures,fuel,fuel substitution,fuels,gas,gas\n            production,gas reserves,grid,grids,Hydro\n            Power,imports,Income,Insurance,irrigation,kerosene,labor\n            force,Legislation,Marginal Cost,natural gas,nuclear\n            power,oil,oil equivalent,petroleum,power consumption,power\n            development,power generation,power industry,power\n            plant,power plants,power projects,Power Sector,power\n            stations,Power Supply,power system,power\n            transmission,primary energy,producers,proven\n            reserves,Renewable energy,Renewable energy resources,Rural\n            Electrification,structures,Thermal Power,Thermal Power\n            Plants,utilities,voltage,waste,wholesale price index"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural uses,charcoal,civil\n            engineering,coal,coal,Coal prices,commercial\n            energy,commercial energy\n            consumption,Construction,construction equipment,Cost Benefit\n            Analysis,covers,Distribution Losses,domestic use,ECONOMIC\n            ANALYSIS,economic development,economic growth,efficient\n            use,Electric Power,ELectricity,Electricity\n            Boards,electricity consumption,electricity\n            demand,electricity prices,electricity supply,energy\n            conservation,Energy Consumption,Energy Generation,energy\n            intensity,energy policy,energy prices,Energy Pricing,Energy\n            Resources,ENERGY SECTOR,energy\n            supply,Engineering,Engineers,Environmental\n            Aspects,Expenditures,fuel,fuel substitution,fuels,gas,gas\n            production,gas reserves,grid,grids,Hydro\n            Power,imports,Income,Insurance,irrigation,kerosene,labor\n            force,Legislation,Marginal Cost,natural gas,nuclear\n            power,oil,oil equivalent,petroleum,power consumption,power\n            development,power generation,power industry,power\n            plant,power plants,power projects,Power Sector,power\n            stations,Power Supply,power system,power\n            transmission,primary energy,producers,proven\n            reserves,Renewable energy,Renewable energy resources,Rural\n            Electrification,structures,Thermal Power,Thermal Power\n            Plants,utilities,voltage,waste,wholesale price index"}},"owner":"South Asia Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"4909"},"facets":{}}}
