For all\n            three projects, inception was fast and preparation\n            problematic. Differences of opinion between the Bank and the\n            Borrower regarding objectives complicated both the\n            preparation and implementation phases, and led to\n            non-achievement of financial targets.  None of the three\n            projects benefitted from the experience of  preceding ones\n            partly because haste to proceed with the next lending\n            operation did not allow time for reflection, and partly\n            because neither the Bank nor the Borrower were convinced\n            that study of the past is useful in planning the future.\n            Little importance was attached to in-house review and,\n            indeed, it was the Bank who advised CYR, and CYR took the\n            advice that preparation of Project Completion report (PCRs)\n            ought to be done by outside consultants. The fact remains\n            that PCR preparation is an educational experience for those\n            who prepare them and this experience was lost to CYR and to\n            the Railway Transport Enterprise (RTEs). By the same token,\n            the leisurely, and somewhat too generous, editing in EMENA\n            of the Borrower's draft PCRs, demonstrates the limited\n            significance attached to lesson-learned from past mistakes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - Railway Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yugoslavia - Railway Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1990/06/727880/yugoslavia-railway-projects","projn":"Railways Iv-271845 -- P009164,Kosovo Railways -- P009195,Railways V-271860 -- P009180","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Adjustment and Lending,Municipal Financial Management,Roads & Highways,Railways Transport","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Urban Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"World","entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960924235456"},"subsc":"Railways","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Urban Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ACTUAL COST,ASSETS,auditing,Bank\n            lending,Bank supervision,benefit\n            analysis,Borrower,buses,carrying\n            capacity,cation,CTC,erosion,Financial performance,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fixed InstallationS,foreign exchange,Freight,freight\n            traffic,highway projects,Highways,Inflation,land\n            acquisition,lending operations,liquidity,LOAN,loan\n            agreement,locomotives,marshalling yards,motorcycles,multiple\n            unit trains,passenger,ports,Rail,rail\n            transport,railroad,railroads,Railway,railway\n            equipment,railway facilities,railway networks,railway\n            operations,railway performance,RAILWAY PROJECT,Railway\n            Projects,railway services,railway system,railway\n            traffic,Railway Transport,Railways,rain,Rate of\n            Return,resource allocation,retroactive financing,road\n            networks,road traffic,road transport,Rolling\n            stock,snow,stations,technical\n            assistance,track,tractors,Traffic Control,traffic\n            growth,traffic volumes,trucking,trucks,vehicles"},"1":{"cdata!":"ACTUAL COST,ASSETS,auditing,Bank\n            lending,Bank supervision,benefit\n            analysis,Borrower,buses,carrying\n            capacity,cation,CTC,erosion,Financial performance,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fixed InstallationS,foreign exchange,Freight,freight\n            traffic,highway projects,Highways,Inflation,land\n            acquisition,lending operations,liquidity,LOAN,loan\n            agreement,locomotives,marshalling yards,motorcycles,multiple\n            unit trains,passenger,ports,Rail,rail\n            transport,railroad,railroads,Railway,railway\n            equipment,railway facilities,railway networks,railway\n            operations,railway performance,RAILWAY PROJECT,Railway\n            Projects,railway services,railway system,railway\n            traffic,Railway Transport,Railways,rain,Rate of\n            Return,resource allocation,retroactive financing,road\n            networks,road traffic,road transport,Rolling\n            stock,snow,stations,technical\n            assistance,track,tractors,Traffic Control,traffic\n            growth,traffic volumes,trucking,trucks,vehicles"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","repnb":"8894"},"742141":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1990/02/742141/yugoslavia-kosovo-railway-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1990/02/742141/yugoslavia-kosovo-railway-project","new_url":"1990/02/742141/yugoslavia-kosovo-railway-project","disclosure_date":"2008-09-25T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1990/02/28/000009265_3960925063813/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1990/02/28/000009265_3960925063813/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"1977","datestored":"1990-02-28T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1990-02-28T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - Kosovo Railway Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Kosovo Railway Project results may\n            be summarized as follow: The project achieved its basic\n            objectives of modernizing the railway facilities of Kosovo.\n            However, the time taken to complete the project was over\n            seven years compared to the original timetable of three\n            years. On the management side, improvements were\n            successfully implemented in freight operations. The\n            management reorganization was completed at the end of the\n            project period so it is too early to evaluate its impact.\n            Most of the operational and financial targets set under the\n            loan were not achieved due mainly to: (i) delays in project\n            implementation; (ii) a fall in freight traffic; and (iii)\n            Government failure to authorize adequate tariff increases\n            during a period of high inflation. The overall evaluation of\n            the project is that it was marginally successful and that\n            the benefits will be sustained in the future. As in many\n            other railway projects, the Bank's expectations on the\n            financial performance were too optimistic. One of the main\n            causes of the poor financial performance has been the\n            Government's reluctance to raise railway tariffs to\n            compensate for rising costs at a time of rapid domestic\n            inflation. The PCR confirms the lessons drawn from previous\n            railway projects in Yugoslavia which demonstrated the need\n            for allowing sufficient time for implementation. Like\n            previous projects, this too illustrates the difficulties in\n            securing compliance with covenants to improve operating\n            efficiency and financial objectives and in recruitment of\n            qualified staff. Finally, it shows that institutional\n            development ought to be undertaken during a time frame much\n            longer than that of one Bank-financed project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia -
