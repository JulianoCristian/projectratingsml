Some lessons\n            learned included: in countries with limited capacity for\n            implementation, it is particularly important to select a few\n            focused actions that are deemed essential to supporting the\n            government's broader reform program. In countries where\n            capacity is weak it is necessary to ensure that development\n            policy operations are accompanied by a critical mass of\n            technical assistance. A common assessment framework that is\n            managed by the Government and supported by the donors can be\n            an effective tool for facilitating deeper harmonization of\n            donors support. Identifying good indicators to evaluate\n            progress can be difficult, especially in countries with data\n            and capacity. Also given the short time span covered by the\n            operation, it was difficult to find indicators that could\n            show improvement by the close of the operation. This is\n            particularly important for stand-alone operation where there\n            is no succeeding operation to continue the monitoring of the indicator."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Liberia -

institutions, and improve the environment for private\n            sector-led growth. More specifically, the RRSP II focuses\n            on: (i) improving the efficiency of budget preparation and\n            execution and increasing the professionalism and improving\n            the human resource management of the civil service; and (ii)\n            improving the investment climate through the reform of the\n            revenue and private investment regimes. The grant is an\n            integral part of International Development Association (IDA)\n            Country Assistance Strategy for the period FY09-12 presented\n            to the Board in April 2009 and is closely coordinated with\n            assistance provided to support the program of\n            Government's reforms through the ongoing Economic\n            Governance and Institutional Reform Project, the Enhanced\n            Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, the\n            African Development Bank (AfDB) budget support operation and\n            the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Poverty Reduction and\n            Growth Facility (PRGF). Since Liberia is at high risk of\n            debt distress, IDA resources are provided on grant terms,\n            per the stipulations of the grant allocation system agreed\n            with IDA donors for the IDA15 period.
