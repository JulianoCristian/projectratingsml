Some lessons learned\n            included: the study on the management of mechanical brigades\n            which is to begin, should provide a wide range of options,\n            including that of removing these brigades and of awarding\n            contracts to private firms for maintenance work. Monitoring\n            of associations on all schemes and evaluation of\n            agricultural production and farmers' income on a sample\n            of schemes should be conducted separately. Economic impact\n            surveys should be assigned to consulting firms. In order to\n            make the best use of the rehabilitation works, the concerned\n            local and regional agricultural services should be\n            strengthened.
