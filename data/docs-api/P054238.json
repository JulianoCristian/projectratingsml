Some lessons\n            learned included: involvement by several donors with\n            different financing and disbursement procedures and\n            information requirements imposed a considerable\n            administrative burden on Gazelle Restoration Authority (GRA)\n            administrative and engineering staff, in particular. In\n            addition, reserving Bank-financing for critical components\n            for improving the quality of life for displaced communities\n            will have lessened the adverse impact of problems\n            experienced with the European Union (EU) financing mechanism\n            by accelerating provision of basic services in relocation\n            sites as well as intensifying the dialogue on social and\n            livelihood aspects. The assessment at appraisal indicated\n            that operations and maintenance (O&M) on project assets\n            will be administratively and financially manageable by all\n            responsible agencies. The adverse impact on provincial\n            revenues replacement of the provincial sales tax by the\n            national value-added tax apparently undercut the\n            province's longstanding tradition of adequate O&M,\n            something which could not have been anticipated. The\n            province's present limited revenue authority and\n            dependence on government transfers highlights the need for a\n            thorough review of the current arrangements. The use by GRA\n            of a contract administration manual and enhanced risk\n            management measures project restructuring in 2005 was\n            effective in minimizing further cost escalation and\n            implementation delays. While, implementation delays in the\n            early years were largely out of the GRA's control,\n            these tools and techniques are transferable and could\n            generate major efficiency gains on development projects\n            generally in PNG."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Papua New Guinea -

To achieve the goals of restoring\n            social and economic wellbeing to the people of the Gazelle\n            Peninsula, the overall program and Bank-financed project\n            will support the following six components. The first\n            component, quality of life improvement in displaced\n            communities, will include: land mobilization; infrastructure\n            and utility services; social and public safety services;\n            community development; and economic support. Transportation\n            infrastructure, utility infrastructure, social services,\n            public safety, economic support, and government\n            administration reform comprise the second component,\n            Kokopo's consolidation as the provincial capital. The\n            third component, Rabaul's restoration as a regional\n            port, will deal with land management; port-related\n            infrastructure and facilities rehabilitation; and\n            restoration of essential utilities, infrastructure, and\n            public services. Utility infrastructure and social services\n            for the North Eastern Gazelle Peninsula are the fourth\n            component while the fifth is institution building for longer\n            term development planning. The final component will contain\n            design and supervision of project components for the first\n            phase of the project and design of components planned for\n            implementation during the second phase."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Papua New Guinea -
