This project is in\n            support of the third phase of the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS\n            Prevention and Control Program for the Caribbean Region.\n            There are four project components. The first focuses on\n            advocacy and policy development, incorporating human rights\n            and non-discriminatory practices for persons living with\n            AIDS (PLWA) in policy and legislation, mobilizing regional\n            leaders to champion HIV/human rights issues, ensuring\n            national level policy decisions reflect international best\n            practice standards, increasing participation of PLWA in\n            policy dialogues, and expanding analysis of the impact on\n            key socioeconomic sectors. The second component finances\n            HIV/AIDS prevention and control by delivering services such\n            as voluntary counseling and testing, condom social\n            marketing, and using targeted information, education, and\n            communications campaigns by age, language, culture, and\n            logistics to affect behavioral change. The third component\n            strengthens regional laboratory services to support the\n            scale-up of treatment and care of people affected by\n            HIV/AIDS and opportunistic infections like tuberculosis. The\n            fourth component strengthens the regional response capacity\n            of key regional institutions that support country efforts\n            against HIV/AIDS by financing civil works construction and\n            rehabilitation, equipment, management information systems,\n            consultant services, and operating expenditures. This\n            component also ensures effective and efficient coordination\n            of the regional response."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latin America and Caribbean Region - The\n            Pan-Caribbean Partnership (CARICOM) Against HIV/AIDS Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Latin America and Caribbean\n            Region -
