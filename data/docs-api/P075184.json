Some lessons learned included: National\n            Program Support (NPS) projects, which employ a Sector\n            Investment and Maintenance (SIM) loan instrument, are used\n            to implement sector and Public Expenditure Management (PEM)\n            reforms in the Philippines. As an instrument for difficult\n            institutional reforms, the Diversified Farm Income and\n            Market Development Project (DFIMDP) experience shows that a\n            National Program Support (NPS) would be appropriate and\n            effective only when the client agency, especially its\n            management, is fully committed and operationally prepared to\n            implement and mainstream these reforms during the project\n            period. This is especially true for Philippines which have\n            shown a systemic dichotomy between policy and operations,\n            especially in the agriculture and fisheries sector. Without\n            strong evidence that reforms are indeed already firmly\n            implemented on the ground level, the Bank should consider\n            very carefully before becoming fully engaged in a reform\n            program with a client agency. The Bank is better positioned\n            to facilitate, rather than lead or catalyze, reforms, at\n            least within the current political economy of the\n            Philippines. The World Bank (WB), therefore, should be\n            reluctant to fully enter the reform picture in the country\n            until these reforms are already well entrenched among the\n            clients, especially among the government managers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Diversified Farm Income and\n            Market Development

and Market\n            Development Project will assist the Government in\n            strengthening the Department of Agriculture's (DA)\n            capacity for the provision of market-oriented services, thus\n            increase agricultural competitiveness, and rural incomes.\n            Given the deeply entrenched nature of many areas requiring\n            reform, this process of institutional, and attitudinal\n            change will take time, and sustained efforts to achieve.\n            Components will support market development services, and\n            collaboration in

Further support shall strengthen the\n            core functions of the DA and Government agencies concerning\n            agricultural statistics, information technology for\n            agriculture and fisheries, and agricultural training.\n            Initially, it would be implemented in the four Focus Areas\n            supported by the project, complemented with community-based\n            information dissemination systems available to various types\n            of farmers/growers and the general community. Market\n            development investments will focus on rural roads, and other\n            rural infrastructure, strengthened through an appropriate\n            selection, approval and implementation criteria and\n            procedures, to ensure demand-driven, market-oriented\n            investments, supported, primarily through local government\n            units (LGUs) and producer groups. The safety and quality\n            assurance systems for market development will be achieved by\n            strengthening the implementation capacity of the DA's\n            regulatory services, as well as institutional strengthening,\n            and, coordinating with other regulatory agencies to complete\n            a review and action plan, aimed at rationalizing the\n            technical, physical and financial needs for the\n            strengthening, operation and maintenance of laboratories\n            needed to service the DA's overall regulatory system.\n            Furthermore, seeds and horticultural planting material will\n            be supported through the expansion of scion groves to\n            propagate vegetal species, while training and facilitation\n            should significantly expand accredited private sector,\n            operated seed farms, and nurseries. Market-linked technology\n            development and dissemination is designed to leverage a\n            change, by modifying and strengthening implementation of the\n            DA's competitive research grants scheme, and, through\n            partner-LGUs, information training provision will be\n            available also to farmers not affiliated to organized\n            growers/farmers groups. Such participation to, and adoption\n            of training shall enable the DA in assessing the extent of\n            training reach, and success. Technical assistance will be\n            provided to help implement Intellectual Property Rights\n            provisions, to promote better dissemination of technology,\n            and greater private sector involvement, as certification of\n            improved seed and vegetative products evolve. Finally,\n            improvement of public expenditure management will focus on\n            public resource allocation, and utilization, which includes\n            better linkages between planning

Diversified Farm Income and Market\n            Development Project, which stimulates rural growth and\n            farmer incomes by enhancing competitiveness of Philippine\n            agriculture and fisheries commodities and market-oriented\n            private sector-led investments. This report discusses\n            expected negative environmental impacts and measures to\n            mitigate them. During construction, likely impacts are\n            surface runoff, soil erosion, and siltation and\n            sedimentation of nearby water bodies. To offset them,\n            provide slope and road cut protection; construct a road\n            drainage system; install riprapping (stone foundation),\n            wattling (a fabrication of interwoven poles), and fascines\n            (bound wood sticks) to shore up embankments; plant\n            vegetation (shrubs, bushes, and selected trees), especially\n            along road shoulders; properly manage the site; dispose of\n            solid wastes and earth spoils; construct sediment sediment\n            traps to prevent drainage canal clogging; and regularly\n            sprinkle water to control dust. In addition during the\n            project's implementation phase, remove rubbish to dump\n            sites; compact topsoil; haul, spread, and compact filling\n            materials from earth cuts and borrow pits; divert rainwater\n            through canals; provide traffic warning signs, barricades,\n            and flagmen and schedule construction delivery and waste\n            material transport during off-peak hours to control traffic;\n            install silencers on exhaust mufflers and maintain machinery\n            properly to reduce noise; restrict work operations, reduce\n            speeds, use signage, and inform community to prevent\n            vehicular accidents; and require workers to strictly observe\n            safety standards."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines -
