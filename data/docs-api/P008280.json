There are three\n            lessons from this experience: 1) A phased approach to\n            reconstruction programs after natural disasters provides\n            flexibility and avoids locking into inappropriate\n            activities. A first phase needs to carefully identify and\n            prioritize immediate, short- and long-term needs while\n            simultaneously building local capacity and information,\n            tasks that generally require well-targeted technical\n            assistance. Important considerations include factoring in\n            macroeconomic realities, determining incentives frameworks,\n            balancing direct and indirect costs, and fostering\n            innovation.  2) Disaster recovery projects, with their\n            immediate physical objectives, may not be suitable vehicles\n            for achieving longer-term policy reforms.  3) Reconstruction\n            efforts should be designed to preserve communities, enhance\n            supporting services, and take great care that self-help\n            features are cognizant o f cultural norms and realistically\n            reflect household's ability to pay. In turn, this\n            requires that the Bank give more attention to social and\n            poverty assessments in disaster reconstruction activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Earthquake

Coordination of donor\n            activities can be difficult, particularly with independent\n            non governmental organization's (NGO's) with\n            strong international support, but is essential and requires\n            attention to forestall conflict during implementation.\n            Potential operational pitfalls deserve realistic attention\n            during design and appraisal.
