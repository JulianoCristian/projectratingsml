Some lessons learned includes: the approach\n            for supporting sub-national public service provision depends\n            on the stage of a country's decentralization process\n            and may vary over time. Advance procurement of\n            implementation support consulting services is a key for\n            success in Indonesia. Sub-national financing arrangements\n            need to be carefully designed to effectively support\n            sub-national components in Indonesia. The loan closing date\n            needs to take into account the country's fiscal year\n            start/end and budget procedures in Indonesia.

The\n            project is one of two complementary transport projects aimed\n            at supporting economic growth, and improving social welfare\n            in 16 provinces, and about 190 'kabupatens' and\n            'kotas' (districts and municipalities) of the\n            Eastern Indonesia Region. It will focus primarily on lower\n            level links in the primary road network that are the\n            responsibility of regional governments, and, on other\n            regional transport assets. The Lombang-Lombang subproject\n            acquired land belonging to five households. Three buildings\n            were affected entirely, while four households lost some of\n            their plants. All affected households received compensation\n            in cash for affected assets: land, building and plants.\n            Compensation for affected land and building referred to\n            market price, while compensation for affected plants was\n            based on their productivity and has been negotiated to\n            project-affected households. The Mataram subproject affected\n            102 households with parts of their property frontage mostly\n            housing to be acquired where no one is affected by more than\n            20 percent of their current landholdings, except for\n            Pertamina where property was affected 40 percent. Four\n            buildings were affected entirely (kiosk and sanitation\n            facilities). Other affected assets are: plants and fences.\n            Eleven street vendors occupying right of way are also to be\n            relocated. The project-affected households received\n            compensation in cash for their affected land, buildings, and\n            other assets. The compensation for land and building\n            referred to market price. The eleven street vendors will be\n            relocated in Pasar Rembiga, in very close proximity to the\n            current location. The local government also provided the\n            project-affected people: free certification for remaining\n            lands and rehabilitation assistance such as giving modal,\n            economic empowerment, etc. The Bukapiting Apui\n            project-affected five households with nine plots of land\n            under customary right are to be acquired. Four\n            project-affected households will lose around 30 percent of\n            their current landholdings and one person will lose 19\n            percent of his current landholdings. Land in the project\n            location is infertile and is dominated by brushes and does\n            not have many perennial plants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sub proyek Laha-Wakasihu (EIB-109)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Second Eastern\n            Indonesia Region Transport Project : resettlement plan (Vol.\n            13) : Sub proyek Laha-Wakasihu (EIB-109)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/10/13451389/indonesia-second-eastern-indonesia-region-transport-project-resettlement-plan-vol-13-sub-proyek-laha-wakasihu-eib-109","projn":"ID-Second Eastern Indonesia Region Transport\n            Project -- P074290","docty":"Resettlement Plan","subtopic":"Regional Rural Development,Banks & Banking Reform,Municipal Financial Management,Roads & Highways,National Governance","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Rural Development,Governance,Transport,Urban Development","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20110111224940"},"subsc":"Aviation,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways,Ports, waterways and shipping","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"Bahasa (Indonesian)","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Rural Development,Governance,Transport,Urban Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Transport sector management;
