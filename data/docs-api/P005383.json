The project includes preparation\n            of a priority project constituting the first stage of the\n            sewerage master plan and the acquisition of oceanography\n            equipment required to carry out the studies. The direct\n            benefit of this Engineering Project is that it will result\n            in a viable sewerage proposal for the Casablanca-Mohammedia\n            region, which will reduce public health hazards and risks to\n            fisheries deriving from pollution of coastal waters. The\n            project faces no special risks. A detailed work plan for the\n            consultants will be prepared in accordance with the agreed\n            technical terms of reference and the Government has agreed\n            to give special attention to the technical capacity of the\n            consultant staff so as to minimize the risk of the studies\n            not meeting the project objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco -
