The ratings for the National Fertilizer\n            Sector Project (NFSP) of Ethiopia were as follows: outcome\n            was unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. The main lessons\n            from the experience o f SSDP and NFSP are as follows: 1)\n            Strategically oriented sector work is essential as a base\n            for a relevant and effective rural development program; 2)\n            Better coordination and linkages are needed between projects\n            and within the rural sector as a whole; 3) Development of a\n            competitive fertilizer market requires actions beyond\n            \"Market Liberalization\"; 4) Reliance on the public\n            sector for input supply may create not only market\n            inefficiencies but also a shortage of inputs; 5)\n            Institutional structures and processes can restrict private\n            sector participation; 6) A one-size-fits-all agricultural\n            extension system has limited impact; and 7) A\n            strategy-focused program requires performance indicators,\n            monitoring, and an adaptive approach, reflecting the\n            strategic objectives and outcomes relative to these objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Seeds Systems Development Project\n            and National Fertilizer Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Seeds Systems\n            Development Project and National Fertilizer Sector Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/06/8466796/ethiopia-seeds-systems-development-project-national-fertilizer-sector-project","projn":"ET-National Fertilizer Sector Project -- P000753,ET-Seed System Development Project -- P000752","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Fertilizers,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Rural Development","count":"Ethiopia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20071010102931"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Petrochemicals and fertilizers,Central government administration,Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, agricultural colleges,\n            agricultural development, Agricultural Extension,\n            agricultural inputs, agricultural practices, agricultural\n            production, Agricultural Productivity, Agricultural\n            Research, agricultural ~ productivity, Agriculture,\n            agronomic practices, autonomy, barriers to entry, breeder\n            seed, business plans, Capacity Building, cereal yields,\n            cereals, coffee, coffee processing, Commercial Bank,\n            Commercial Banks, commercialization, comparative analysis,\n            competitive markets, comprehensive strategy, cooperatives,\n            cost of capital, crop, crop diversification, Crops,\n            cultivation, decentralization, decision making,\n            deregulation, development strategy, donor agency, economic\n            performance, employment, entrepreneurship, equipment,\n            exports, extreme poverty, face value, farm, farm incomes,\n            farm productivity, Farmer, farmer incomes, farmers, farming,\n            farms, feasibility studies, FERTILIZER, fertilizer\n            application, Fertilizer Consumption, FERTILIZER DEVELOPMENT,\n            fertilizer distribution, fertilizer imports, Fertilizer\n            Industry, Fertilizer Market, fertilizer prices, Fertilizer\n            Usage, Fertilizer use, fertilizers, food security, foreign\n            exchange, fresh seed, GDP, government finance, growth\n            potential, IFPRI, Industrialization, Institutional\n            Development, interest rate, interest rates, laboratories,\n            Level Playing Field, livestock, maize, maize yields,\n            management information systems, market entry, Marketing,\n            monopoly, NGOs, opportunity cost, organizational structures,\n            peer review, phosphate, Plant Genetics, Plant Quarantine,\n            population growth, price controls, price subsidies, Private\n            Sector, private seed sector, privatization, produce,\n            production functions, productivity growth, public agencies,\n            quality seed, reduced expenditures, risk averse, Rural\n            Development, SEED, seed businesses, Seed Certification, Seed\n            Enterprise, Seed Industry, Seed Multiplication, seed\n            producers, Seed Production, seed testing, seed varieties,\n            seeds, soil fertility, Soil Testing, soils, Sorghum,\n            structural adjustment, technical assistance, transport,\n            Urea, Variety Release, Wheat, wholesale prices, yield\n            increase, Yields"}},"owner":"Knowledge and Information Servs. (IMTKI)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020400-NETHERLANDS' CONSULTANTS\n            TRUST FUND,TF028065-CANADIAN CONSLT.

World Bank\n            performance is evaluated as unsatisfactory, while Borrower\n            performance is judged as satisfactory. These were some of\n            the lessons learned: 1) Successfully creating a market-based\n            seed production and distribution system in place of a\n            centrally-based system requires the gradual involvement of\n            the private sector. 2) see production should be based on a\n            thorough assessment of farmer demand and market for improved\n            varieties, not just focusing on supply. 3) Substantial\n            changes to the project design should not be made without\n            fully analyzing the proposed design in terms of economic,\n            financial, and social impacts and ensuring that the new\n            approach is sustainable. 4) to ensure better implementation,\n            arrangements for monitoring and evaluation need to be in\n            place before the project starts. 5) To ensure continuity and\n            sustainability, planning and initiating transitional\n            arrangements well in advance of project closure (some 18\n            months) is necessary. 6) Single factor projects are unlikely\n            to have a major impact on agricultural production. 7)\n            Government commitment is critical for the timely\n            finalization of project preparation. 8) Assess the impact of\n            an evolving situation and act quickly: the project failed to\n            assess the impact of a rapidly expanding approach which\n            relied on a single market outlet under the national\n            extension intervention program on the project.

The first component\n            supports (i) the development of the informal seed sector;\n            (ii) encourages private sector entry into the formal\n            business; and supports (iii) the restructuring of the\n            Ethiopian Seed Enterprise from a centrally managed\n            parastatal to a decentralized and commercially oriented\n            enterprise.
