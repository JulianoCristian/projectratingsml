Some lessons learned included:\n            this project\u0092s introduction of a performance-based\n            management approach, whereby every civil servant in the\n            Ministry had a performance-based contract (i.e., service\n            level agreement) including teachers, administrative staff,\n            both at directorate and regional levels provided important\n            incentives for behavioral change at all levels. Supporting\n            and drawing on local partners (private local operators) can\n            be useful in ensuring effective delivery and sustainability\n            of an intervention. Under the Project, literacy activities\n            relied on the work of local private operators for\n            implementation wherein literacy training was provided to\n            more than 4,839 learners. The reach (and effectiveness) of\n            this activity was likely much greater than an externally\n            supported activity might have been. Improving the quality of\n            teaching and teachers\u0092 performance is driven by both\n            capacity-building and the provision of incentives. The\n            Project contributed to an increased level of confidence and\n            motivation among teachers as the activities supported under\n            the Project improved their content knowledge in key subjects\n            and, in turn, their capacity to teach.  It is essential to\n            ensure that first, teachers have the basic content knowledge\n            to teach.. The teachers\u0092 learning assessments undertaken by\n            the project highlighted the continued need for support to\n            improving teachers\u0092 content knowledge. It was important to\n            ensure that training covered basic knowledge needed to teach\n            in lower basic schools \u0096 before covering those areas that\n            would be required to receive West African Senior School\n            Certificate Examination, or WASSCE credit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Gambia, The -

The legislation on resettlement of the government\n            of the Gambia and the norms of the World Bank in its OP 4.12\n            will be the instruments that will govern any resettlement\n            arising out of the activities of the project. In general,\n            the resettlement principles that will guide the project\n            include zero displacement for the populations of any\n            community and coverage by compensation of any displacement\n            of persons or assets, and loss of access and services and\n            attenuation of all impacts due to re-installation to an\n            appropriate site. While the consultant could not at this\n            stage do estimate the number of affected persons, this will\n            be detailed in the resettlement action plan for each\n            subproject. Several mitigating measures should be\n            implemented by the project and the communities in the event\n            of physical population re-location as well as the losses\n            that such relocation will generate, namely: relocate the\n            people affected to housing equivalent to those they left;\n            reallocate land equivalent if not better than their land\n            re-possessed; intensify the methods of production and\n            diversify their produce or revenue generating activities\n            outside their lands; and use resources created by the\n            project to improve productivity. In all cases the value of\n            the compensation is estimated at the current market value\n            plus the added value or on the basis of the declared value\n            to the fiscal authorities. For those who may lose\n            employment: create cottage industries and revenue generating\n            activities; and encourage husbandry of small ruminants; and\n            fish farming from hand-dug ponds, etc. The displaced persons\n            must not suffer any prejudice with regard to access to\n            natural resources and services. Overall, the displaced\n            persons whether individuals, families or communities with\n            certain affinities must be assisted by the project and the\n            communities to reconstruct their livelihoods without any\n            form of alienation, in particular by the host communities.\n            The right of use of the land and the forest code are\n            recognised and presents no conflicts as far as project\n            implementation but the mining code may, pose problems in\n            certain rural communities, such as in the Khosanto and\n            Missirah Sirimana in Tambacounda region where the sub-soil\n            contains gold deposits. The risks of resettlement to the\n            population and project locations will be there when\n            industrial exploitation of the deposits is decided. The\n            report recommends prior sensitization of the community and\n            establishing mechanisms for settling disputes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Resettlement policy framework audit report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"The Gambia -

These should be addressed by ensuring that any\n            mitigation measures are incorporated into the contracts. A\n            major rehabilitation program of educational infrastructure\n            should be undertaken. Other potential adverse environmental\n            impacts include degradation of storage sites; loss of\n            vegetation and degradation of soils, surface water\n            pollution; deforestation for construction site access and\n            quarry use; air pollution due to vehicle rotation, noise,\n            soil pollution from motor oil and lubricants; waste\n            generated by construction work; soil erosion; loss of\n            natural habitat zones and biodiversity; unserviceable\n            sanitation facilities and absence of access to water and\n            electricity; unrehabilitated quarries and borrow pits\n            (habitats for the malaria vector and bilharzia snail);\n            non-restoration of the landscape and regeneration of the\n            vegetation cover; risks of bush fires by uncontrolled\n            burning; river sedimentation; clogged drainage; pollution\n            and temporary disruption of river out-flow (by materials\n            storage); accidental discharge of oils, of greases; traffic\n            accidents risks; and traffic disruption; emanation of dust ;\n            increased water use and competition for the use of natural\n            resources;  increased levels of soil salinity; proliferation\n            of invading aquatic plants, development of water related\n            diseases (malaria, bilharzias, etc.); reduced arable and\n            pastoral surfaces; pesticides poisoning; and disappearance\n            of grazing lands, among others.
