In sum,\n            the impact of the Bank has been satisfactory. Given these\n            results, the projects' outcomes should be seen in a\n            more positive light than that presented by the audit for the\n            first two credits, which rated them as unsatisfactory. Slow,\n            but ultimately realized, policy reforms and subsequent\n            projects addressed the weaknesses of the earlier projects.\n            These projects also had satisfactory outcomes. Indeed, they\n            laid the groundwork for a very fruitful policy discussion\n            that continues today. Their sustainability is likely and\n            their institutional development is strong. The major lessons\n            of these projects are three. First, the sharp decline in\n            Bank support for SMI projects in recent years may have been\n            a missed opportunity. From the review of these projects it\n            is clear that if correctly structured, SMI operations can be\n            effective employment programs. Second, the resolution of the\n            most important problems confronting SMI's in Sri Lanka\n            requires broader financial sector reforms, rather than just\n            more credit, as was emphasized in the last project. However,\n            broader international experience suggests that Sri\n            Lanka's slowness in fully realizing these reforms is\n            not unusual. Finally, international experience also suggests\n            that greater fiscal discipline than has been achieved in Sri\n            Lanka may be a necessary condition for financial reforms to\n            be sustainable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - World Bank Support for Small and\n            Medium Industries in Sri Lanka : the First, Second, Third,\n            and Fourth Small and

  performance of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First, for\n            more systematic and effective project monitoring, the role\n            of the Apex Institution needs to be redefined and its\n            capabilities further improved to be able to carry out an\n            in-depth evaluation of economic impact and financial\n            performance of SMI sub-projects. Second, to ensure the\n            sustainability of SMI sector lending, the financial sector\n            needs to adopt lending to SMIs as part of their long-term\n            strategy. Third, more attention must be given to the design\n            and implementation of the TA component and to developing an\n            effective monitoring system to ensure more efficient and\n            successful project implementation. Finally, steps should be\n            taken to improve the effectiveness of experts through a\n            better selection process, evaluation of their performance,\n            and establishing counterparts in the concerned institution."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -
