Some lessons\n            learned included: like all project locales, the Amazon is a\n            unique region that presents a highly challenging environment\n            to work in, particularly in the conservation of biodiversity\n            where many of the candidate sites are in the more\n            inaccessible areas. Add to this a low and sparsely\n            distributed population with few service providers and\n            difficulties in launching any effort that requires extensive\n            public participation, preparation of management plans,\n            purchase of equipment, construction of infrastructure and\n            the associated communications, processes and procedures that\n            accompany these activities are bound to occur. It is almost\n            always more cost-efficient to factor in local\n            characteristics in project design even at additional cost in\n            time and resources, than attempt mid-course corrections as\n            they develop in implementation. Preparation of second ARPA\n            incorporates this lesson in project design. Of particular\n            relevance is to ensure to factor in 'premiums' in\n            terms of costs and time over similar operations elsewhere in\n            the country to better gauge project costs and calendars to\n            reduce risk of overestimating the achievement of outcomes\n            and outputs during project implementation. ARPA trust fund\n            was the first of its kind to be established in Brazil. The\n            fund was designed to address financial shortfalls from the\n            public purse to cover the recurrent costs of Protected Areas\n            (PAs). However, ARPA successful efforts to create so many\n            new PAs, particularly 'sustainable use' PAs, was\n            not anticipated in the initial trust fund design. But only\n            now, after almost six years of implementation, solid\n            financial records are available with data that can serve as\n            a basis for projecting expending needs for PAs, thus\n            allowing more regular updates of the need based on the\n            number of PAs entering the ARPA system and benefiting from\n            the trust fund revenues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -

Under the third component, two major activities\n            will be implemented: pilot projects to test\n            income-generating activities for the protected areas, and\n            endowment fund to support the recurrent activities of the\n            protected areas. Screening procedures will be conducted to\n            ensure that the recurrent activities and pilot sub-projects\n            do not violate any of the Bank safeguard policies. No\n            environmental impact is expected to result from these activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Amazon Protected Areas Project -\n            GEF : environmental impact assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Amazon Protected Areas\n            Project - GEF : environmental impact assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/05/1934940/brazil-amazon-protected-areas-project-gef-environmental-impact-assessment","projn":"BR-Amazon Region Protected Areas (Gef) -- P058503","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Biodiversity,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Forestry,Environmental Economics & Policies,Wetlands","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02070304085774"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agroforestry,biodiversity,community\n            forestry,conservation,conservation activities,conservation\n            of biodiversity,crops,degradation,ecosystem,ecosystem\n            health,ecosystems,endangered species,environmental impact\n            assessment,environmental impacts,environmental\n            issues,Environmental Policy,erosion,exotic\n            species,Extractive Reserve,farms,Feasibility\n            studies,Forest,forest areas,forest cover,Forest fires,forest\n            management,Forest Reserves,forest\n            resources,forestry,forestry operations,forestry\n            Policy,germplasm,Habitat,habitat\n            conservation,Habitats,hunting,income,indicator\n            species,indirect use,inventories,land use,land\n            uses,Legislation,logging,logging\n            equipment,managers,marketing,mitigation,native plants,native\n            species,Natural Habitats,natural resources,Parks,pests,Plant\n            production,plantations,population dynamics,population\n            studies,preservation,Protected Areas,Quality\n            control,reforestation,Restoration,revegetation,screening,species\n            inventories,Sustainable Development,sustainable\n            management,Sustainable Use,timber,timber\n            resources,waste,waste recycling,Water\n            pollution,Watershed,watersheds,Wetlands,Wetlands\n            Hydrology,Wildlife,Wildlife Reintroduction,wildlife\n            species,wood,wood products"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agroforestry,biodiversity,community\n            forestry,conservation,conservation activities,conservation\n            of biodiversity,crops,degradation,ecosystem,ecosystem\n            health,ecosystems,endangered species,environmental impact\n            assessment,environmental impacts,environmental\n            issues,Environmental Policy,erosion,exotic\n            species,Extractive Reserve,farms,Feasibility\n            studies,Forest,forest areas,forest cover,Forest fires,forest\n            management,Forest Reserves,forest\n            resources,forestry,forestry operations,forestry\n            Policy,germplasm,Habitat,habitat\n            conservation,Habitats,hunting,income,indicator\n            species,indirect use,inventories,land use,land\n            uses,Legislation,logging,logging\n            equipment,managers,marketing,mitigation,native plants,native\n            species,Natural Habitats,natural resources,Parks,pests,Plant\n            production,plantations,population dynamics,population\n            studies,preservation,Protected Areas,Quality\n            control,reforestation,Restoration,revegetation,screening,species\n            inventories,Sustainable Development,sustainable\n            management,Sustainable Use,timber,timber\n            resources,waste,waste recycling,Water\n            pollution,Watershed,watersheds,Wetlands,Wetlands\n            Hydrology,Wildlife,Wildlife Reintroduction,wildlife\n            species,wood,wood products"}},"owner":"Environment (LCSEN)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF051240-GEF2 FSP-BRAZIL:AMAZON REGION\n            PROTECTED AREAS,TF021967-DUTCH PARTNERSHIP - BANK/WWF\n            ALLIANCE (LCSES)","repnb":"E598"},"facets":{}}}
