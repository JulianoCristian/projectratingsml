The project will support the Government's\n            efforts to address the social, economic and political\n            factors that led to the involvement of youth in the crisis\n            of 2006 and in the ongoing manifestations of social\n            instability since then. There are two components to the\n            project. The first component is the operationalizing the\n            national youth policy. The second component is the youth for\n            local development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor-Leste - Youth Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Timor-Leste - Youth Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/05/9543398/timor-leste-youth-development-project","projn":"TP-Timor Leste - Youth Development Project\n            -- P106220","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Youth and Governance,Adolescent Health,Children and Youth,Housing & Human Habitats,Primary Education","teratopic":"Education,Social Development,Governance,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Timor-Leste","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20080613013932"},"theme":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction,Social risk mitigation,Social analysis and monitoring,Participation and civic engagement","subsc":"Other social services","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education,Social Development,Governance,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Audits, basic education, births, civic\n            education, civil society, communities, Community\n            Development, community groups, crime, Description,\n            districts, economic development, Education Sector, female,\n            females, gangs, gender, gender equity, homes, houses,\n            Intervention, interventions, labor market, leadership,\n            learning, literacy, literacy training, male youth,\n            monitoring process, National Youth Policy, neighborhood,\n            Pacific Region, peacekeeping, primary school, public\n            administration, public buildings, resettlement, risk\n            assessment, Risk factors, rural areas, rural youth, Self\n            Help, skills training, social cohesion, Social Development,\n            social issues, soldiers, technical assistance, trainings,\n            urban areas, urban youth, village level, villages, violence,\n            Vocational Education, vocational training, Young people,\n            young women, YOUTH, youth activities, youth advocacy, youth\n            center, youth centers, YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, youth empowerment,\n            youth groups, youth involvement, youth organizations, Youth\n            participation, youth population, Youth Representatives,\n            Youth unemployment, youth violence"}},"owner":"Social Development Sector Unit (EASSO)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF055720-PF III TL-CMU","majtheme":"Social protection and risk management,Social dev/gender/inclusion","repnb":"43547"},"facets":{}}}
