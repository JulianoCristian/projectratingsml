The main objectives of the Second Agricultural\n            Credit Project were to: (a) improve the financial viability\n            of the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives\n            (BAAC) and reduce its dependence on subsidies; (b) increase\n            BAAC's incentive to mobilize rural savings; and (c)\n            improve BAAC's role in providing credit to small\n            farmers who could not qualify for commercial bank loans.\n            Lessons learned from this project are as follows; (a) In\n            reaching new high-risk segments of the market, it is\n            essential that 'institutions like BAAC first design and\n            implement a pilot project which, if successful, can be\n            replicated more broadly. (b) The foreign exchange risk on\n            foreign borrowings can be serious burden on an institution\n            like BAAC, which is not allowed to charge commercial rates\n            for its lending operations. In this regards, BAAC considers\n            that it is incurring heavy foreign exchange losses because\n            of this project and that is the main reason that, despite a\n            very satisfactory working relationship, BAAC has thus far\n            been unwilling to consider further borrowing from the World Bank."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Second Agricultural Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand - Second Agricultural\n            Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1988/12/738655/thailand-second-agricultural-credit-project","projn":"TH-Agric.
