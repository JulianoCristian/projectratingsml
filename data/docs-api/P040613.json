Risks cited\n            at every step were: the absence of incentives to minimize\n            the volume of waste; risk of infection from the steam\n            sterilization of needles, syringes, and surgical gloves; the\n            absence of regulation of particular hazardous materials such\n            as mercury, and other heavy metals, chlorinated compounds;\n            the lack of awareness of the need to consistently segregate\n            medical wastes from domestic waste; the absence of lids and\n            lack of plastic lining of waste containers, increasing the\n            risk of spreading infectious micro-organisms both during\n            waste transport and cleaning of the containers; cases where\n            waste is transported manually implies a risk of infection to\n            the sweepers if they are not wearing protective clothing;\n            the transport of waste in uncovered vehicles posing a risk\n            as well as a nuisance to the public; the dumping of waste\n            out in the open before being transported to the dumpsite\n            where scavengers (including children) scrounge around for\n            recyclable material; the generation of noxious gases from\n            burning wastes in open fire; the burial in the ground of\n            pathological waste; the decomposition of the organic content\n            of waste in the ground, generating leachate that will flow\n            into the river; the absence of sanitary landfills in Nepal\n            with that could protect against groundwater pollution; and\n            the risk of discharge of treated and untreated wastewater\n            may pose risk to people collecting water for households,\n            fields and gardens, washing, playing, for religious\n            purposes, and spreading ashes from cremation. To minimize\n            some of these risks the report suggests: \"green\"\n            procurement (purchasing substitute items posing less risk to\n            the environment), waste reduction, recycling, and reuse;\n            quantitatively assessing waste products; waste segregation,\n            handling, transport, treatment, and disposal practices,\n            pollution prevention; and training staff and educating the\n            public about proper waste management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vulnerable community development plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Health Sector Program\n            Project : environmental framework (Vol. 2) : Vulnerable\n            community development plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/06/4451682/nepal-health-sector-program-project-environmental-framework-vol-2-vulnerable-community-development-plan","projn":"NP-Nepal Health Sector Program Project -- P040613","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Regional Rural Development,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Systems Development & Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Nepal","authors":{"authr":"Nepal"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20040623172531"},"subsc":"Health","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"abortion,accessibility,basic health\n            services,check ups,climate,clinics,communicable\n            diseases,Communities,community development,community\n            groups,Community Health,community\n            participation,Counseling,decentralization,Development\n            Goals,development process,development\n            projects,Discrimination,disease\n            control,districts,Economics,employment,Empowerment,Equality,extension,families,Family\n            Planning,female headed households,Gender,gender\n            issues,girls,Health Care,health centres,Health\n            Economics,Health Education,Health expenditure,Health\n            Facilities,Health for All,health indicators,Health\n            Institutions,health outcomes,health planning,health\n            policies,Health Policy,Health posts,Health Sector,Health\n            Services,health status,health system,Health\n            Training,holistic approach,hospitals,households,human\n            rights,immunodeficiency,incomes,Infant Mortality,Infant\n            Mortality Rate,infectious diseases,Lands,Laws,Life\n            expectancy,medical care,medical\n            facilities,medicines,mobility,Mortality,NGOs,Outpatient\n            Services,parents,Partnership,patients,People With\n            Disabilities,policy documents,poverty alleviation,Poverty\n            Reduction,Primary Health Care,prisons,private sector,private\n            sectors,public health,Rehabilitation,Resettlement,rural\n            areas,rural people,rural population,safety,schools,sexual\n            harassment,Social Exclusion,social support,squatters,street\n            children,targeted programs,urban areas,victims,Village Development,widows,Workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"abortion,accessibility,basic health\n            services,check ups,climate,clinics,communicable\n            diseases,Communities,community development,community\n            groups,Community Health,community\n            participation,Counseling,decentralization,Development\n            Goals,development process,development\n            projects,Discrimination,disease\n            control,districts,Economics,employment,Empowerment,Equality,extension,families,Family\n            Planning,female headed households,Gender,gender\n            issues,girls,Health Care,health centres,Health\n            Economics,Health Education,Health expenditure,Health\n            Facilities,Health for All,health indicators,Health\n            Institutions,health outcomes,health planning,health\n            policies,Health Policy,Health posts,Health Sector,Health\n            Services,health status,health system,Health\n            Training,holistic approach,hospitals,households,human\n            rights,immunodeficiency,incomes,Infant Mortality,Infant\n            Mortality Rate,infectious diseases,Lands,Laws,Life\n            expectancy,medical care,medical\n            facilities,medicines,mobility,Mortality,NGOs,Outpatient\n            Services,parents,Partnership,patients,People With\n            Disabilities,policy documents,poverty alleviation,Poverty\n            Reduction,Primary Health Care,prisons,private sector,private\n            sectors,public health,Rehabilitation,Resettlement,rural\n            areas,rural people,rural population,safety,schools,sexual\n            harassment,Social Exclusion,social support,squatters,street\n            children,targeted programs,urban areas,victims,Village Development,widows,Workers"}},"owner":"S.A.
