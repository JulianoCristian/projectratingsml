The\n            project objectives were to: (1) establish appropriate\n            institutional and organizational arrangements for the\n            management of liquid wastes and environmental protection in\n            Shanghai; (2) establish a self-financing company to deliver\n            and manage urban wastewater services; (3) strengthen\n            mechanisms to control discharge and improve water quality in\n            the Huangpu River and its tributaries; and (4) support the\n            first part of a phased program of work to provide primary\n            wastewater infrastructure services to enable economic\n            growth. With project objectives generally met, the project\n            outcome is satisfactory. The physical works were completed\n            satisfactorily. However, the institutional strengthening and\n            financial autonomy of SSC was only initiated under the\n            project. The key lessons learned from the project are: (a)\n            Institutional development is a slow process, depending on an\n            enabling environment; (b) Programs of physical works should\n            be closely-linked with actions for the institutional and\n            financial development of the utility enterprise; (c) The\n            Bank can play a meaningful role in supporting large-scale\n            urban infrastructure; (d) In future similar lending\n            operations, there may be a strong case for very large\n            management contracts moving toward program lending; (e)\n            High-quality planning and project management yield results\n            on the ground; and (f) Project design should be formulated\n            to ensure that sufficient time is allowed to put in place\n            arrangements to achieve covenants that could be difficult to implement."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
