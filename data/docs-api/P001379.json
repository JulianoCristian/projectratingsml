The Government appeared to be supporting this\n            movement, but in 1983, with the withdrawal of Government\n            funding, the extension service, such as it was, fell apart.\n            Otherwise, the project was organizationally very weak\n            because of the combination of limited Government\n            administrative capacity and the co-donors' individual\n            aims and interests.
