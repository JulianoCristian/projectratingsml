catch in Kazakhstan's\n            northern Aral Sea"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The northern Aral Sea in Kazakhstan was\n            choppy and water flushed through a sluice, washing down fish\n            into a channel leading towards the southern Aral Sea. The\n            new dike, financed by the World Bank, has helped raise water\n            levels in a once-dying sea. That increase has revived local\n            fisheries, restored hope in long-suffering communities, and\n            even affected the microclimate - clouds in May and\n            rainstorms used to be unheard of in an area parched by\n            decades of environmental abuse. As more water became\n            available for irrigation and fields were better protected\n            from floods, more farmers were likely to place additional\n            land in production. The next step was to improve the\n            irrigation efficiency of two-thirds of the land in the\n            Kazakh part of the Aral Sea basin.
