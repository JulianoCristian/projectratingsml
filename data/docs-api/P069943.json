Some lessons learned included: it\n            is important for the Bank to ensure that there is a\n            consensus within the country on the project before seeking\n            approval for it, even when the Bank is time constrained to\n            take a project to the Board. Especially when the Bank is\n            trying to move quickly on a project or country relationship,\n            arrangements must be made to ensure that the Borrower's\n            key project staff are hired and familiarized with Bank\n            processes and procedures before the actual start of project\n            implementation.  In a country like Iran where nothing can be\n            done without the approval of the relevant financial\n            controller who must therefore be familiar with World Bank\n            guidelines and requirements, it is advisable to design a\n            project that is simple and can be managed and implemented\n            under the jurisdiction of only one financial controller. It\n            is inefficient for a Bank project to finance, procure and\n            monitor a large number of low cost small works scattered\n            over a large geographic area, but very efficient in\n            procuring large numbers of equipment or vehicles where a\n            centralized tender process is possible. Attribution of\n            results must take into account parallel programs and the\n            synergy must be acknowledged."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran - Second Primary Health Care and\n

The components\n            will: 1) focus on an improved access to, and quality of\n            health, through the refurbishment of primary health care\n            facilities, phasing out civil works, and equipment costs\n            over a five year period. Medical equipment will be replaced,\n            and, additionally required equipment will be procured, such\n            as X-ray equipment, particularly for those communities in\n            need of diagnostic care; 2) improve nutrition of children\n            under the age of two, and of pregnant/lactating women,\n            through extensive training practices, focusing on\n            dissemination of information, education, and communication\n            for better nutrition. A strengthened monitoring system will\n            aim at preventing malnutrition among the target groups, and\n            decreasing the prevailing iron deficiency anemia among young\n            mothers. Functional nutritional literacy will be provided at\n            the household level; and, 3) strengthen the capacity\n            building, through improved management training, evaluation\n
