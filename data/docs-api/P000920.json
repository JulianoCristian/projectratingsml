under financial intermediary loans are unlikely\n            within an undisciplined credit environment; in this case,\n            measures should be included to address issues relating to\n            governance, management, financial policies, collection\n            performance, appraisal and supervision techniques, and\n            credit risk management policies of participating financial\n
