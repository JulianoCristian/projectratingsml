The project met its immediate\n            objectives. It has begun to strengthen the institutional\n            capacity of the Borrower and private sector. Sustainability\n            is uncertain at this time. Both the Bank and Borrower\n            performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, maintenance effectiveness needs to\n            be dramatically improved to ensure sustainability of road\n            improvements. The most critical immediate challenge is to\n            ensure that available maintenance resources are effectively\n            and systematically used for highest-priority needs. Second,\n            particular attention to drain clearing, river training\n            works, and road repairs before and during the monsoon season\n            can reduce the susceptibility to flood damage. Third, there\n            is a need to improve procurement processing, customs\n            clearance, and inter-ministerial coordination in DOR and\n            HMGN to permit timely and effective response to road\n            improvement needs and reduce the costs of works\n            implementation. Lastly, the involvement of the DOR staff in\n            project preparation should be expanded and encourage in the\n            future for effective implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Third Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Third Highway Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/06/733419/nepal-third-highway-project","projn":"NP-Highways Iii-114499 -- P010206","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Business Environment,Urban Housing,Airports and Air Services,Business in Development,Roads & Highways","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Nepal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961214173945"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"annual traffic growth,approach roads,audit\n            reports,Bridge,Bridge construction,bridge\n            works,Bridges,civil\n            works,concrete,construction,construction,construction\n            works,cost savings,daily\n            traffic,drainage,embankment,emergency repairs,feeder\n            roads,flooding,fuel,gravel,Highway,housing,international\n            standards,lane road,lanes,local\n            contractors,maintenance,Maintenance and\n            Rehabilitation,Maintenance Fund,maintenance\n            management,maintenance operations,maintenance\n            planning,maintenance resources,maintenance works,periodic\n            maintenance,procurement,quality control,rate of\n            return,remote,repair,reporting,River,road construction,road\n            improvement,road improvements,road investment,road\n            investments,Road Maintenance,road network,road\n            pavements,road planning,Road Safety,road system,road\n            traffic,road widening,Roads,roadworks,route,routine\n            maintenance,signs,slope stability,structures,suspension\n            bridges,terminal,terrain,traffic,traffic flow,traffic growth,Transport"},"1":{"cdata!":"annual traffic growth,approach roads,audit\n            reports,Bridge,Bridge construction,bridge\n            works,Bridges,civil\n            works,concrete,construction,construction,construction\n            works,cost savings,daily\n            traffic,drainage,embankment,emergency repairs,feeder\n            roads,flooding,fuel,gravel,Highway,housing,international\n            standards,lane road,lanes,local\n            contractors,maintenance,Maintenance and\n            Rehabilitation,Maintenance Fund,maintenance\n            management,maintenance operations,maintenance\n            planning,maintenance resources,maintenance works,periodic\n            maintenance,procurement,quality control,rate of\n            return,remote,repair,reporting,River,road construction,road\n            improvement,road improvements,road investment,road\n            investments,Road Maintenance,road network,road\n            pavements,road planning,Road Safety,road system,road\n            traffic,road widening,Roads,roadworks,route,routine\n            maintenance,signs,slope stability,structures,suspension\n            bridges,terminal,terrain,traffic,traffic flow,traffic growth,Transport"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"15861"},"725131":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1984/08/725131/nepal-third-highway-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1984/08/725131/nepal-third-highway-project","new_url":"1984/08/725131/nepal-third-highway-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/11/05/000178830_98101901063795/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/11/05/000178830_98101901063795/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"1515","docdt":"1984-08-31T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1999-11-05T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Third Highway Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Third Highway Project for Nepal\n            provides a means to integrate the far western part of Nepal\n            with the rest of the country through completion of an\n            all-weather East-West Highway.
