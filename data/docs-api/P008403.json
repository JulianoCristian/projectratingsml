Experience with this project confirms a\n            number of OED lessons: (a) Effective operational linkages\n            between related project components help improve project\n            outcomes. The aim of the farm drainage rehabilitation\n            component was to bring flooded land back into farm\n            production. In addition, drainage rehabilitation was also\n            used successfully to promote privatization by requiring\n            recipients of drainage assistance to cross-comply with the\n            privatization objectives under land reform. Farmers had to\n            buy or sign long-term lease agreements on state-owned land\n            in the drainage area and had to accept responsibility for\n            future drainage costs. Setting these conditions established\n            a \"give and take\" approach, which ensured that\n            farmers both contributed and were committed to the drainage\n            objectives and to the privatization objectives under land\n            reform. This served to advance more than one objective with\n            the same investment of resources under the project. (b) A\n            private sector delivery system for extension services can be\n            an effective alternative to public sector delivery, provided\n            that there are appropriate incentives, firtancia1 controls,\n            and audit procedures. In this case, private delivery (1)\n            allowed swift implementation, (2) avoided the future costs\n            of having to dismantle a public delivery system after having\n            met transition requirements, (3) contributed to developing a\n            base of private sector expertise to meet the long-term aim\n            of having the market provide certain extension services on a\n            user-pay basis, (4) recognized the private sector's\n            capacity for providing a diversity of extension expertise,\n            and (5) respected the preferences of farmers for less\n            government involvement in their business affairs. (c) In\n            identifying projects for development assistance, the Bank\n            should pay close attention to those where the borrower is\n            likely to take strong ownership, responsibility and control\n            of the project, because such conditions contribute\n            significantly to achieving positive project outcomes. The\n            Estonian Agriculture Project is an excellent example where\n            the borrower possessed a strong desire to own the project\n            from the beginning to the end. This contributed greatly to a\n            project likely to generate highly positive benefits for the\n            Estonian agricultural and rural economies. Based on the\n            Estonia example, indicators to look for in identifying a\n            borrower likely to take and maintain ownership and\n            responsibility include (1) a strong sense of policy\n            direction when entering into discussions with the Bank; (2)\n            already taking steps within its means toward realization of\n            the policy direction; and (3) exhibiting a desire to\n            disengage from the Bank's assistance as soon as\n            possible. Each of these indicators was very much in evidence\n            with respect to the Estonia project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Estonia - Agriculture Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Estonia -

Although project\n            preparation, and appraisal took longer than anticipated, it\n            proved essential in ensuring full agreement between the\n            Borrower and the Bank on issues related to project\n            objectives, content, and design. In line with the above,\n            lessons demonstrate that the Borrower's sustained\n            commitments, and the Bank's readiness to adjust\n            implementation arrangements, were instrumental for the\n            success of the project, particularly so for the land survey\n            program, drainage rehabilitation, and advisory services\n            components. Nonetheless, assumptions regarding the impact of\n            transition to a market economy, as it regards the evolving\n            structure of the rural economy proved inaccurate, suggesting\n            forecasts be regarded as transient. Evolution of the framing\n            sector was faster than foreseen, with implications for the\n            advisory services component, e.g., responsiveness to the\n            evolving land, and tax policy required modifications in the\n            implementation of the land reform component. However,\n            project experience also shows that effective private-public\n            partnerships can meet satisfactory information needs, with a\n            quick adaptation to changing
