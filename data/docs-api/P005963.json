The First Municipal Development Project (MDP-I)\n            was primarily designed to contribute to more effective\n            public sector management at the provincial and municipal\n            levels through improved financial mechanisms for municipal\n            investments. In this way, the project effectively supported\n            two critical national objectives: a) the mobilization of\n            resources in a non-deficit, non-inflationary manner; and (b)\n            increased public sector efficiency. These objectives were\n            quite ambitious given the macroeconomic conditions\n            prevailing during 1987-88. Argentina's economy was\n            crippled by high inflation, widespread stagnation and\n            massive public sector deficits after decades of economic\n            strategies characterized by heavy state interventionism,\n            inward-looking trade orientation, and disregard for\n            macroeconomic equilibrium. Capitalizing on the growing\n            awareness of the need to introduce drastic reforms at all\n            levels of government, the project laid the foundations for\n            municipal reform by enhancing municipal practices and\n            putting in place sustainable mechanisms for the financing of\n            needed municipal investments. With its emphasis on fiscal\n            responsibility and improved efficiency of municipalities,\n            the project fully supported the objectives of the reform\n            program that was later implemented by the Argentine Government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - First Municipal Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - First Municipal\n

management at the provincial and municipal\n            levels through improved financing mechanisms for municipal\n            investments. Specifically, the project provides subloans to\n            the five benefitting provinces for financing 50 percent of\n            total eligible costs for:  (a) physical investments; and (b)\n            technical assistance and training.  In order to implement\n            effectively the project's objectives, only creditworthy\n            municipalities will be eligible to receive subloans for\n            physical investments, and each annual investment plan of\n            each eligible municipality must have at least 65 percent of\n            total  physical investments allocated to components for\n            which 100 percent of total investment costs will be fully\n            recovered from payments to the municipality by direct beneficiaries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Municipal Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Municipal Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1988/02/738989/argentina-municipal-development-project","projn":"AR-Munic Devt I -- P005963","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Public Sector Economics,Municipal Financial Management,Regional Governance,Public & Municipal Finance","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Argentina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980420171238"},"subsc":"(Historic)Urban management","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability,accounting,betterment\n            levies,borrowing,cadastres,capital\n            expenditures,capitalization,cities,creditworthiness,current\n            expenditures,debt,debt service,debt\n            servicing,decentralization,deficit\n            financing,devolution,economic\n            conditions,employment,financial management,Fiscal\n            Year,foreign exchange,garbage\n            collection,Housing,inflation,interest\n            rates,Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations,land\n            use,legislation,loan commitments,local government,local\n            level,management,metropolitan areas,Municipal\n            Development,municipal government,Municipal\n            Governments,municipal infrastructure,municipal\n            investments,Municipal Level,municipal\n            services,municipalities,municipality,national\n            governments,natural resources,present\n            value,Provinces,Provincial Government,Provincial\n            Governments,provisions,public accountability,public\n            infrastructure,public investments,Public Sector,public\n            sector efficiency,public sector management,public\n            services,public works,resource mobilization,revenue\n            sharing,roads,settlements,solid waste collection,street\n            lighting,street maintenance,streets,tax,tax\n            revenues,Technical\n            Assistance,telecommunications,Urbanization,user charges"},"1":{"cdata!":"accountability,accounting,betterment\n            levies,borrowing,cadastres,capital\n            expenditures,capitalization,cities,creditworthiness,current\n            expenditures,debt,debt service,debt\n            servicing,decentralization,deficit\n            financing,devolution,economic\n            conditions,employment,financial management,Fiscal\n            Year,foreign exchange,garbage\n            collection,Housing,inflation,interest\n            rates,Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations,land\n            use,legislation,loan commitments,local government,local\n            level,management,metropolitan areas,Municipal\n            Development,municipal government,Municipal\n            Governments,municipal infrastructure,municipal\n            investments,Municipal Level,municipal\n            services,municipalities,municipality,national\n            governments,natural resources,present\n            value,Provinces,Provincial Government,Provincial\n            Governments,provisions,public accountability,public\n            infrastructure,public investments,Public Sector,public\n            sector efficiency,public sector management,public\n            services,public works,resource mobilization,revenue\n            sharing,roads,settlements,solid waste collection,street\n            lighting,street maintenance,streets,tax,tax\n            revenues,Technical\n            Assistance,telecommunications,Urbanization,user charges"}},"owner":"WB Off:Buenos Aires-Southrn Cone (LCC7C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"7093"},"facets":{}}}
