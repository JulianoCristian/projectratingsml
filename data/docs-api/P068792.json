Lessons however\n            point at issues that should be taken into consideration.\n            Regarding the pre-qualification of tenders for the sale of\n            electricity distribution companies, critical steps prior to\n            the procurement process should have been taken,\n            specifically, the sale should have been clearly defined, as\n            well as the corporate structure of the distribution\n            companies. In terms of market issues, the condition for the\n            sale of 20 percent of TT, was not accompanied by the\n            transfer of any management control, a situation not in\n            compliance with market expectations. Reforms in all of the\n            policy areas encompassed by the project were controversial\n            and involved large and difficult constituencies. Areas where\n            the greatest progress was achieved-agriculture,\n            privatization, fiscal reform and macroeconomic\n            performance-were areas where the Bank identified a long-term\n            agenda for the government, and then played a support role. A\n            high Bank profile in the reform process would not have been\n            effective. Indeed, an effective public communications\n            strategy could have facilitated reform: such a strategy\n            could have helped the government develop greater credibility\n            to deal with interest groups."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Economic Reform Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Economic Reform Loan

progress made\n            under the Economic Reform Loan (ERL), whose Loan Agreement\n            was declared effective on June 27, 2000. The ERL supported\n            the Government's economic reform program focusing on\n            five critical actions: (i) structural fiscal reforms to\n            underpin fiscal adjustment, (ii) policy and institutional\n            reforms towards a fair, and financially sustainable social\n            security system, (iii) rationalization of agriculture\n            support policies, and privatization of agricultural\n            State-owned enterprises (SOEs) to promote agricultural\n            growth, and rural income generation, (iv) structural reforms\n            to deregulate the energy, and infrastructure sectors to\n            promote private sector participation, and, (v) decisive\n            steps to accelerate privatization activities. Six of the\n            nine conditions for release of the second tranche of the ERL\n            were fully met by the end of first extension of the loan.\n            These conditions were the (i) macroeconomic framework, (ii)\n            fiscal reforms and the fiscal package for  2001, (iii) the\n            direct income support for farmers, (iv) the program to phase\n            out price and credit subsidies in agriculture, (v) the\n            energy reform program, and, (vi) the telecommunications\n            program. The three remaining conditions covered social\n            security reform, the agricultural SOEs restructuring\n            program, and privatization. In view of the fact that most\n            specific second tranche conditions had already complied\n            with, the Bank extended the closing date of the loan until\n            March 3 1, 2003, and, the Bank then agreed to extend the\n            closing date of ERL, as the fourth extension, from June 30,\n            2003 to March 3 I, 2004 for the completion of the remaining\n            actions for release of the second tranche.  Of the two\n            sub-conditions that were not fully met, the first one, the\n            sale of 20 percent of Turk Telekom (TT) to a strategic\n            private investor, has been replaced with the remedial\n            actions.The second condition, the launch of\n            pre-qualification tenders for the sale of electricity\n            distribution companies, has been replaced with a\n            comprehensive electricity privatization strategy. Given the\n            Government's commitment to the reforms by having an\n            Electricity Reform Strategy, and the privatization program\n            moving now forward (actions that promoted sector\n            development, enhanced commercial orientation of Turkish\n            Telecom (TT), and, improved prospects for privatization, as\n            well as steps towards strengthening institutional\n            responsibilities to proceed with market implementation),\n            partial waivers of the two sub-conditions are sought, on the\n            grounds set in
