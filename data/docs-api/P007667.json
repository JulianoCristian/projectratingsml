The\n            assessment confirms the following OED lessons of broader\n            relevance. Projects need to dovetail with programs; but\n            well-designed projects can rarely turn around a\n            poorly-designed program. This is a particularly important\n            lesson for the Bank's work in Mexico where leverage is\n            limited. Mexico has ample access to alternative sources of\n            funding, private as well as public. In line with the\n            Bank's poverty reduction mandate, its resources should\n            be tightly targeted, rather than added to programs where\n            there is a high potential for subsidies to be captured by\n            better-off groups. The Bank's leverage may be\n            substantially diluted when project funds flow into a\n            multi-state program which state governments have\n            considerable influence over the use to which resources are\n            put. Large Programs are candidates for formal impact\n            evaluation. In this case, the main limitation of the Alianza\n            evaluation was the absence of a control group of\n            non-beneficiaries, a striking oversight given the level of\n            funding committed. The evaluation should have sampled those\n            who did not apply to the program; and those who did but were\n            rejected. (It is not clear that a list of the rejected is\n            maintained.) Without this control it is impossible to assess\n            claims about the program's leverage: much of the\n            investment (and the income growth attributed to it) might\n            have occurred without a subsidy. Subsidies may have leaked\n            to better-off groups who don't need them."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Irrigation and Drainage Sector,\n            On-Farm and Minor Irrigation Networks Improvement, and\n            Agricultural Productivity Improvement Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico -

Irrigation and Drainage Sector Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Irrigation and Drainage Sector\n            Project's outcome is considered highly satisfactory.\n            The main lessons learned are: 1) The ability of governments\n            to provide the required funding for the irrigation sector\n            from the public budget results in a situation where public\n            infrastructure cannot be maintained and is unsustainable\n            over time. Strong political will is required to charge the\n            full organization and management cost to users of irrigation\n            facilities, while devising acceptable transfer mechanisms.\n            2) It is important to mitigate the traditional bias that\n            government irrigation agencies have in favor of\n            infrastructure development as they tend to overlook or\n            ignore broader sector policies. 3) The Bank committed itself\n            to high standards to assist Mexico with the best efforts\n            from preparation to implementation, by assigning top\n            expertise, adequate resources, intensive supervision, and\n            proactive dialogue. 4) It is important to coordinate with\n            Inter-American Development Bank. 5) The creation of\n            institutional capacity for project implementation was\n            fundamental. 6) The best structure of water fees would be\n            through a two-step structure that would consider the volume\n            and the irrigation right in the registry. 7) Water user\n            organizations were much more efficient than a specialized\n            government agency in managing and performing rehabilitation,\n            organization & management, and modernization of\n            irrigation systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Irrigation and Drainage Sector
