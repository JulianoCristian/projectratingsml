It aims at assisting the\n            Government in achieving its goals of attaining\n            self-sufficiency in meat and dairy products, in developing\n            its agro-based industries in improving the efficiency and\n            effectiveness of the Malawi Development Corporation and in\n            carrying out its structural adjustment program.\n            Specifically, the proposed two-year project, will finance\n            around 70 months of consultant services: (a) to study the\n            development prospects and price incentives in the livestock,\n            meat and dairy industries; (b) to review the Malawi\n            Development Corporation's present and projected\n            financial position, its management structure, and its\n            operating guidelines; (c) to help strengthen MDC's\n            export marketing capabilities; and (d) for other, currently\n            unidentified studies, needed to carry out the structural\n            adjustment program. As a result of the project, Malawai\n            plans to expand its investments in livestock and to\n            significantly improve the financial and economic performance\n            of one of its most important parastatals, the Malawi\n            Development Corporation.
