Xiaolangdi is the\n            first large-scale multipurpose dam project in China to use\n            only international contracting and construction management\n            procedures. Many of the difficulties experienced in\n            implementing the new system were caused by the relative\n            newness of economic and enterprise reform in China. The key\n            lessons learned include: 1) In implementing a project of the\n            magnitude and complexity of Xiaolangdi, implementation will\n            be greatly assisted if there is an implementing organization\n            in place at the outset of the project that is commercially\n            independent and has full decision-making authority and\n            responsibility for its performance. 2) Prior to the start of\n            construction, construction management personnel should be\n            trained in contract administration and modern project\n            management techniques. 3) Improved communication among\n            various parties should be actively pursued from the outset,\n            to avoid misunderstandings that could cause delays and/or\n            losses to the project. This is also an issue of\n            communicating ideas and concepts across international\n            boundaries of training and culture. 4) Development of\n            project management systems should also commence before\n            construction in order to manage construction more efficiently."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Xiaolangdi Multipurpose

The provisions for dam safety are believed to be\n            the most detailed ever undertaken for a major dam.  A wide\n            range of safety features are provided: 1) access to road\n            systems from either bank; 2) a comprehensive communication\n            system; 3) emergency power supplies; 4) an integrated\n            reservoir flood regulation plan; 5) emergency response\n            planning; and 6) a flood emergency response system.  In\n            addition, stability testing in the event of earthquakes was\n            undertaken.  Resettlement planning and management takes into\n            account not only the population directly affected by the\n            project, but also the population in the areas receiving\n            resettlers.  Studies of resettlement include: economic\n            effects; preferential policies; housing, amenities, and\n            public services; social and cultural aspects; grievance and\n            complaint procedures; safety net; and transport capacity for\n            relocation.  The cultural heritage is being preserved by a\n            detailed comprehensive archaeological exploration,\n            classification and salvage program that will locate, recover\n            and protect important underground and surface relics and\n            cultural treasures in the inundated area.  To ensure public\n            health, programs have been set in place to prevent\n            communicable diseases common in the study area such as:\n            malaria, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, brucellosis,\n            paragonimiasis, and sanitation-related enteric diseases\n            including dysentery, hepatitis and typhoid."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
