The\n            sustainability of the strengthened primary institutions will\n            be further addressed by transcending the village boundaries\n            through networking, federating and strategizing second\n            generation issues. In order to achieve all these, strong\n            ongoing technical support from the Bank, field presence of\n            task team leader (TTL), managing to constantly raise and\n            deepen the dialogue on the performance benchmarks and\n            keeping the central agencies fully briefed are essential.

This includes,\n            though is not limited to the following: a participatory\n            targeting methodology to ensure ownership of the operation\n            by the beneficiaries and prevents elite capture of its\n            benefits; user-friendly community operational manuals\n            developed with participation of the community to help\n            internalize the rules and guidelines of the approach, and\n            develop a shared understanding among community leaders,\n            members of the community institutions and facilitating\n            staff; a successful community financing model to provide new\n            opportunities for improved access of the hard core poor and\n            poor, including women to financial services; a proper social\n            auditing mechanism, governance and accountability action\n            plan and community assessment mechanism, to ensure improved\n            governance, downward accountability and transparency of the\n            operation; and  an independent and effective process\n            monitoring system as a permanent checking and informing\n            mechanism in order to ensure timely addressing of\n            impediments as well as learning."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Social Investment Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Social Investment\n            Program Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/12/15625827/bangladesh-social-investment-program-project","projn":"BD-Social Investment Program Project -- P053578","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Access to Finance,Banks & Banking Reform,Community Development and Empowerment,Housing & Human Habitats,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Social Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20120112012010"},"subsc":"General education sector,Other social services,Media,General transportation sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Social Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Health and other social services,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to credit, Access to education,\n            access to markets, access to services, accountability,\n            accounting, action plan, Action Plans, actual cost,\n            agricultural products, auditing, autonomy, bank accounts,\n            Bank financing, Bank Lending, basic infrastructure,\n            Borrower, Budget allocation, business development, CAP,\n            capacity building, capital funds, commerce, communities,\n            Community Action, community capacity, community capacity\n            building, community credit, community credit needs,\n            community development, community empowerment, community\n            financing, Community grants, community groups, community\n            infrastructure, community involvement, community leaders,\n            community learning, community members, community\n            organizations, community ownership, community procurement,\n            Community Support, confidence building, connectivity,\n            consolidation, corruption, credit management, credit\n            provision, credits, decision making processes, direct\n            financing, Disaster Recovery, districts, diversification,\n            DRM, economic activities, eligibility criteria, employment,\n            employment creation, employment opportunities, empowerment,\n            enrollment, equipment, Exchange Rate, exclusion,\n            expenditure, expenditures, facilitation, families, family\n            income, farmers, female, field visits, finances, financial\n            analysis, financial assistance, financial benefits,\n            Financial management, financial resources, financial\n            services, financial support, financial sustainability,\n            financial systems, financial terms, Gender, Gender Aspects,\n            GPs, health services, household incomes, households, houses,\n            human capacity, human capital, human resource, ICT, ID,\n            impact assessment, impact assessments, implementation\n            period, Implementation Plan, Implementation Plans,\n            Implementing Agencies, implementing agency,\n            income-generating activities, indebtedness, inequality,\n            inflation, informed choice, innovation, innovations,\n            installments, institution, institutional development,\n            interest rates, intervention, interventions, Key Performance\n            Indicators, Lessons Learned, loan, local communities, local\n            government, marketing, material, menu, MFIs, micro loans,\n            micro-credit, micro-credit schemes, micro-finance,\n            micro-finance institutions, microcredit, microfinance,\n            migration, monitoring mechanisms, Natural Resource, new\n            communities, nutrition, O&amp;M, operating costs,\n            operating expenses, Operation &amp;
