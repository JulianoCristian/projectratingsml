Being able to show concrete results on the\n            ground is critical to maintaining the legitimacy and\n            sustainability of the program. Coordination with other\n            donors limits the demands put on clients. Involvement of the\n            private sector in the implementation of the program improved\n            efficiency and transparency. The program provides incentives\n            for local governments to make services available for the\n            poorest. However, relying on municipal governments in the\n            implementation of the program also presents challenges. The\n            Bank should not overestimate (i) its ability to respond to\n            crises in a country where there is no social safety net in\n            place; (ii) the length of time it takes to design a new CCT\n            program; and (iii) the amount of time needed to design and\n            contract an impact evaluation study. Regarding points (i)\n            and (ii), setting up a new program requires time and careful\n            examination by competent administrators and lawyers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Human

The\n            project consists of six components: 1) The Educational Grant\n            Component will finance scholarships for children aged 7-17\n            years old belonging to families with
