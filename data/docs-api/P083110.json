Some lessons\n            learned included: construction of complex structures (large\n            bridges and tunnels) requires parallel support in standards,\n            design and supervision beyond preparation of traditional\n            design and use of supervision consultants. Technical\n            assistance activities which require revision of standards or\n            practices or legal frameworks to reach higher standards\n            (e.g. European standards) or more modern practices should\n            always be designed with close collaboration between\n            international consultants and local consultants. Technical\n            assistance activities related to modernization of human\n            resources (HR) management are likely to be implemented only\n            if they are linked to the on-going reform in the agency.
