Some lessons learned included: the project\n            implementation should start only after all the essential\n            preparatory work has been completed, and conversely, doing\n            the preparatory work during implementation should be avoided\n            as much as possible. Once the implementation has started,\n            persistence and perseverance are important for the success\n            of the project. Once a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has\n            been signed by the government with the Bank, to follow the\n            Bank's procurement guidelines, it is important for the\n            government to follow the Bank's procurement procedures\n            so that unnecessary delays can be avoided. It is good to\n            complete land acquisition and other social aspects of the\n            project before the commencement of the implementation as\n            these matters normally take a longer time than expected.\n            Using qualified consultants to assist with the original\n            design and cost estimates will prevent large changes in the\n            project during the implementation. It is important to\n            establish a clear results framework from the outset and only\n            identify results that are measureable. Also, it is necessary\n            to evaluate the project's performance against these\n            results framework on regular basis, and not against\n            disbursement rate that cannot necessarily be a good proxy\n            for project performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran - Ahwaz and Shiraz Water Supply and\n            Sanitation

Supply and Sanitation Project for\n            Iran, which anticipates possible negative environmental\n            impacts and proposes measures to mitigate them. During the\n            construction phase, expected impacts include noise and dust\n            nuisances, construction waste disposal, and safety concerns.\n            Other impacts during operation include odors, sludge\n            removal, and disease and hazard prevention and control. To\n            reduce noise, build in damping in the plant, screen plant\n            equipment with sandbags, notify residents, confine noisy\n            work to daytime, equip workers with protective devices, and\n            restrict construction traffic in the nighttime. Lessen\n            vibration impacts by using modernized and well-maintained\n            equipment, limit the use of percussive equipment when\n            excavating sewer trenches and tunnel shafts, use dead weight\n            when compacting trenches close to the building, provide\n            building supports, and locate works away from sensitive\n            buildings. To relieve impacts from dust, restrict work on\n            excessively windy days, spray unsealed routes and excavation\n            work faces, cover stockpiled excavated material with\n            tarpaulins or spray with water, and equip employees with\n            masks. To avoid traffic congestion, restrict vehicle\n            movement, divert traffic and provide diversion signs,\n            minimize lengths of open trench, and expeditiously complete\n            backfill and reinstatement. Inspect site access roads\n            regularly and make repairs, and cover and pave roads and\n            streets used for laying pipes. Apply protective measures in\n            areas close to historical sites, and implement Chance Find\n            Procedures. Collect and dispose of wastes, demolition, and\n            excavated material at appropriate sites, and restrict\n            surface runoff from the site to prevent water pollution. To\n            ensure public safety and site security, control access of\n            unauthorized personnel, provide pedestrian access, and use\n            safety barriers and signs. To decrease air pollution, do not\n            burn wastes on site, and routinely maintain construction\n            equipment and vehicles to minimize exhaust emissions.\n            Minimize wastes generated during construction, reuse\n            construction wastes where practicable, use appropriate\n            methods for storing waste materials, and dispose of wastes\n            at appropriate sites. To prevent degrading of water quality,\n            monitor raw water and treated water, and avoid\n            cross-contamination with sewage. To prevent water supply\n            reduction, prohibit illegal connections, avoid leakage, and\n            ensure proper maintenance. To maintain occupational health\n            and safety, maintain hygiene, medical surveillance, showers\n            and sanitary facilities, an emergency response plan, and\n            earthquake emergency preparedness procedures. Monitor\n            nematodes, coliforms, and heavy metal content of treated\n            sludge, and transport sludge in closed containers to prevent\n            to infection risks to farmers and the public.

Supply and Sanitation Project for\n            Iran, which anticipates possible negative environmental\n            impacts and proposes measures to mitigate them. During the\n            construction phase, expected impacts include noise and dust\n            nuisances, construction waste disposal, and safety concerns.\n            Other impacts during operation include odors, sludge\n            removal, and disease and hazard prevention and control. To\n            reduce noise, build in damping in the plant, screen plant\n            equipment with sandbags, notify residents, confine noisy\n            work to daytime, equip workers with protective devices, and\n            restrict construction traffic in the nighttime. Lessen\n            vibration impacts by using modernized and well-maintained\n            equipment, limit the use of percussive equipment when\n            excavating sewer trenches and tunnel shafts, use dead weight\n            when compacting trenches close to the building, provide\n            building supports, and locate works away from sensitive\n            buildings. To relieve impacts from dust, restrict work on\n            excessively windy days, spray unsealed routes and excavation\n            work faces, cover stockpiled excavated material with\n            tarpaulins or spray with water, and equip employees with\n            masks. To avoid traffic congestion, restrict vehicle\n            movement, divert traffic and provide diversion signs,\n            minimize lengths of open trench, and expeditiously complete\n            backfill and reinstatement. Inspect site access roads\n            regularly and make repairs, and cover and pave roads and\n            streets used for laying pipes. Apply protective measures in\n            areas close to historical sites, and implement Chance Find\n            Procedures. Collect and dispose of wastes, demolition, and\n            excavated material at appropriate sites, and restrict\n            surface runoff from the site to prevent water pollution. To\n            ensure public safety and site security, control access of\n            unauthorized personnel, provide pedestrian access, and use\n            safety barriers and signs. To decrease air pollution, do not\n            burn wastes on site, and routinely maintain construction\n            equipment and vehicles to minimize exhaust emissions.\n            Minimize wastes generated during construction, reuse\n            construction wastes where practicable, use appropriate\n            methods for storing waste materials, and dispose of wastes\n            at appropriate sites. To prevent degrading of water quality,\n            monitor raw water and treated water, and avoid\n            cross-contamination with sewage. To prevent water supply\n            reduction, prohibit illegal connections, avoid leakage, and\n            ensure proper maintenance. To maintain occupational health\n            and safety, maintain hygiene, medical surveillance, showers\n            and sanitary facilities, an emergency response plan, and\n            earthquake emergency preparedness procedures. Monitor\n            nematodes, coliforms, and heavy metal content of treated\n            sludge, and transport sludge in closed containers to prevent\n            to infection risks to farmers and the public.

Areas without\n            wastewater either use seepage pits, or discharge their\n            wastewater in open channels, rivers or in open grounds,\n            creating wastewater pools, polluting the soil and water\n            resources, and creating health hazards. The Karoun River\n            flows along Ahwaz and divides the city into two separate\n            drainage zones: the eastern zone and the western zone.\n            Therefore, pollution of the Karoun River is a major problem,\n            and a priority issue not only for Ahwaz, but for the whole\n            province, for the poor water quality is largely contributing\n            to high diarrhea prevalence that reaches. Similar to Ahwuz,\n            wastewater collection, treatment and disposal are the main\n            environmental concern in Shiraz. Although the proposed\n            project will reduce the pollution loads discharged to the\n            Karoun River and Maharloo lake, it will not solve the\n            pollution problem of these two water bodies, primarily due\n            to agricultural drainage and industrial discharges. This\n            Environmental Assessment summarizes the policy and legal\n            requirements, as well as Bank safeguard policies. Mitigation\n            measures are as follows. To reduce noise disturbances, work\n            should be restricted to normal working hours; equipment with\n            appropriate silencers should be used, only run when\n            required. Dust suppression measures should be employed, such\n            as spraying and dust enclosures, to minimize air pollution.\n            Movement of construction vehicles should be restricted to,\n            and from the sites during normal working hours; traffic\n            diverted through suitable roads to the expected traffic\n            loading; adequate traffic signals should be in place; and,\n            expeditious completion of backfill, and reinstatement\n            completed. The application of protection measures in areas\n            close to existing historical sites should be ensured.\n            Wastes, demolition and excavated materials should be\n            collected, and disposed of at appropriate locations, while\n            surface runoff from the site should be restricted. Moreover,\n            wastes generated during construction should be minimized, by\n            reusing construction wastes where practicable, and,\n            appropriate methods for the storage of waste materials\n            should be conducted. To mitigate the degradation of water\n            quality, the operation and maintenance of the water\n            treatment plant shall be ensured, as well as the continuous\n            monitoring of raw water, and treated water, including water\n            quality at various locations within the water supply system,\n            avoiding cross contamination with sewage. Adequate treatment\n            (retention time) should be provided to control the number of\n            nematode eggs, in addition, chlorine should be used to\n            disinfect the effluent, and for Ahwaz nitrification and\n            de-nitrification to control concentration of nitrogen.\n            Regular monitoring of treated effluent, which shall not be\n            discharged in the Karoun river, nor re-used in irrigation if\n            its quality does not meet the standards. Capacity building,\n            training and awareness will be supported to comply with\n            environmental standards and guidelines."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran - Water Supply and Sanitation
