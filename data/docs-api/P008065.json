The establishment of an\n            incentive framework, through the provision of security\n            land-ownership, and strengthening of agricultural support\n            services, was not, however, enough to improve the pace, and\n            diversity of agricultural production, and, the weak project\n            design lead to significant risks, and constraints, difficult\n            to overcome. The lessons suggest that: 1) the constraints\n            encountered during preparation, such as structural weakness\n            of the sugar industry, should have been subject to rigorous\n            analysis, and, in the absence of an adequate project design\n            to sustain them, consideration of a different project would\n            have been appropriate; 2) despite the fact that this project\n            was designed prior to the full acknowledgement of the\n            importance of beneficiary consultation, a sound assessment\n            of social, and political environments, conducted during\n            preparation, would have helped in a number of issues,\n            including the need to evaluate factors, such as other\n            sectors, possibly influencing the project; 3) in line with\n            the previous comment, the requirement for\n            monitoring/evaluation, mid-term reviews, and performance\n            indicators, confirms that the approach the Bank now attaches\n            to these activities, is needed for reviewing implementation\n            progress; and, 4) enforcement of loan covenants should be\n            linked to different aspects of the loan portfolio, or to\n            other pipeline projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"St. Kitts and Nevis -
