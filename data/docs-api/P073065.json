Some lessons learned\n            included: the Multi-Country AIDS Program (MAP), developed in\n            2000 and aimed at enabling African countries to scale up\n            their programs against the devastating epidemic, was focused\n            on speed, flexibility, learning by doing and reliance on\n            multiple implementing partners. Scaling up promising\n            activities makes much sense, but these activities must be\n            clearly defined and the justification of providing vastly\n            increased resources clearly made. Providing grants to a\n            multitude of local organizations is a risky business\n            everywhere and particularly in a context of poor governance.\n            It was clear from the outset that the risks of misuse of\n            funds were high. Extraordinary precautions should have been\n            taken to mitigate these risks and reduce the vulnerability\n            of a key Bank-financed operation to corruption. Pressure to\n            disburse in a context of weak governance and lack of\n            accountability for results leads to inefficiencies in the\n            use of

its impact for those who are\n            infected or affected by HIV/AIDS through the strengthening\n            of communities' capacity to design and implement action\n            plans for HIV/AIDS and through support to the design and\n            implementation of sector specific HIV/AIDS strategies. The\n            project consists of five components: 1) The first component\n            will support communities' efforts to prevent and\n            mitigate of the impact of the HIV/AIDS crisis. Strong\n            emphasis is given to the participatory nature of the\n            development of community action plans. 2) The implementation\n            of specific targeted health sector interventions geared to\n            HIV/AIDS will be supported through this component. These\n            include the establishment of voluntary testing and\n            counseling center, the improvement of blood transfusion\n            safety, and the management of blood banks, etc. 3) The third\n            component will support the design and implementation of\n            sector strategies. Targeted sectors include health,\n            communication, transport, defense, education, agriculture,\n            public works, youth and sport, tourism, women affairs,\n            mining,
