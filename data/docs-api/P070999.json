Ratings for the Second Poverty\n            Reduction Support Operations (PRSC II) for Madagascar are as\n            follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to the\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also rated satisfactory. Ratings for the Third Poverty\n            Reduction Support Operations (PRSC III) for Madagascar are\n            as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to the\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also rated\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1) PRSCs I-III\n            rightly focused on the critical areas of public finance\n            management and human development. Future PRSCs may want to\n            deepen support in these areas and focus on critical\n            bottlenecks rather than broadening the areas of support to\n            new areas. It may also be important to identify the\n            institutional and absorptive capacities of each sector, to\n            provide budget support to those sectors with the highest\n            capacities and to use PRSCs in combination with sectoral\n            projects to those areas where capacities are lowest. 2) The\n            amount provided under the form of budget support has been\n            revised downward for a better balance of overall Bank\n            support between budget support and projects. The next series\n            of PRSCs which would consist of three annual operations for\n            US$40 million each seems to strike an adequate balance.\n            Increase in budget support could be linked to credible and\n            sustained improvement in revenue collection, civil service,\n            and public sector management systems. 3) Both the Bank and\n            the Government need to have realistic expectations about the\n            breadth and pace of reform implementation. In particular,\n            the political appetite for reforms must be aligned with the\n            country's technical capacity to implement and absorb\n            these reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - First, Second and Third Poverty\n            Reduction Support Operation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Madagascar - First, Second and\n

       likely sustainability, substantial institutional\n            development, overall satisfactory Bank performance, and\n            overall moderately satisfactory Borrower performance. Some\n            implications for subsequent operations are: The first year\n            of implementation demonstrated the need for continued and\n            increased support for public and financial management\n            reforms. In particular, increase efforts to strengthen and\n            build capacity in the sector ministries for budget\n            formulation, procurement, and financial management. Greater\n            realism is needed in setting targets and the timeframe.\n            Prioritize and scale up the reform process to match the\n            Government's capacity. Unpredictability in resource\n            flows seriously hampered budget execution during 2004;\n            improve predictability through better revenue forecasting. A\n            better alignment of donor disbursements with the budget\n            cycle might also help improve predictability. A firm\n            commitment is actually more relevant than the timing of the\n            disbursement; in the case of Madagascar, however, the\n            resource availability at the outset is critical in providing\n            the level of confidence and certainty needed to execute the\n            budget and avoid stop-and-go cycles."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar -

In\n            addition, strengthening monitoring and evaluation will lead\n            to an enhanced accountability and results focus.  PRSC\n            's support includes assistance to the Government in\n            implementing its 2004 Priority Action Plan for public\n            expenditure management reforms. This includes the\n            preparation and submission to Parliament of the public\n            finance framework law; improved alignment of the 2004 budget\n            to the priorities of the PRSP, the reform of the Treasury,\n            simplification of expenditure management process, the\n            development and submission to Parliament of a new\n            Procurement Code, and strengthening internal controls\n            through the establishment of a General Inspectorate for\n            Finances. PRSC 1 also supports the Government's\n            anti-corruption agenda, including establishment of an\n            operational Anti- Corruption Commission and the development\n            of a national anti-corruption strategy. PRSC 1 also supports\n            Axis 3 on providing human and material security, by\n            supporting the development and implementation of the\n            Government's Education for All Agenda and service\n            delivery in nutrition. Key policy reforms have included an\n            increase in the education budget, measures to decrease\n            education costs for poor households (suppression of school\n            fees, provision of learning materials to all primary\n            students), actions to increase access for poor students\n            (through school construction, salary compensation for\n            teachers paid by parents, teacher recruitment) and\n            reinforcement of management capacity at central and\n            decentralized levels. PRSC 1 also supports policy and\n            institutional reform in the nutrition sector. The Country\n            Financial Accountability Assessment (2003) and the Country\n            Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR, 2003), and the draft\n            Public Expenditure Review (PER) provide the analytical\n            underpinnings for the public sector reform agenda supported\n            by this PRSC, and background work for the Education for All\n            underpins reforms in this area. A supporting Technical\n            Assistance Credit (Good Governance and Institutional\n            Development) approved in November 2003 will assist the\n            government in putting in place the systems to strengthen\n            budget management, and finance technical assistance and\n            capacity building needs. The credit would be disbursed in\n            one tranche at effectiveness following effectiveness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Poverty Reduction Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Madagascar -
