In projects with a diverse set\n            of local partners and donors, the project team should ensure\n            that the selected implementing agency has adequate\n            competency and commitment to handle all administrative,\n            financial, and reporting functions. The Bank's\n            financial supervision of projects can be strengthened by\n            escalating early on accounting or financial errors that\n            appear to be of a systemic nature and ensuring that\n            financial management addresses any identified weaknesses.\n            Transition and post-completion arrangements should be\n            planned well in advance of project closing. A successful\n            matching grant program for business services requires a\n            combination of international expertise, local knowledge,\n            autonomy in administration, and adaptability to respond to\n            market demand. Government agencies' role in overseeing\n            credit lines for small and medium enterprises should be\n            limited to ensuring adherence to development mandate and\n            overall portfolio quality."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique -

The project consists of\n            three components: 1) The technical learning in firms\n            component will focus on building the technical capabilities\n            of majority Mozambican-owned firms in manufacturing and\n            exports. The component will support the establishments of\n            the Firm Competitiveness Office, Training and Advisory\n            Office, and Linkage Program Office. All three foster\n            technical learning through the private marketplace. 2) Under\n            the finance component, two financial products will be\n            available for firms in all sectors -- a special facility\n            designed to provide small, first-time bank borrowers with\n            loans amounting to a maximum of $15,000; and a traditional\n            facility to finance loans up to $300,000 for small and\n            medium-scale borrowers. 3) The institutional capacity\n            building component will enhance the capabilities of private\n            and public institutions to deliver business support\n            services; and support Government agencies in their\n            transformation process from maintaining control functions to\n            providing business facilitation and promotion services,\n            including improving their capability to identify and ease\n            bureaucratic rigidities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique -
