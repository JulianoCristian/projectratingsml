Ratings for the Land\n            Administration Project for Guatemala are as follows: outcome\n            was unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            significant, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Ratings for the\n            Land Fund Project for Guatemala are as follows: outcome was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            significant, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was also moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Lessons learned include: the assessed projects make\n            assertions about enhanced tenure security, increased credit\n            access and reduced conflict over land rights but provided no\n            evidence to back these claims up. There is a literature\n            outside the Bank challenging these assumptions and the Bank\n            has only recently begun to take this into account. There are\n            a number of ways to measure tenure security and the progress\n            toward increasing it; and these measures need to be taken\n            into account in project design and monitored during\n            implementation. Summing up, security of land tenure is not\n            automatically boosted by land administration initiatives;\n            good land administration is a necessary (but not sufficient)\n            step toward secure land tenure. EI Salvador-with its single\n            agency-has made more progress toward technical integration\n            than Guatemala with its separate agencies. A unified agency\n            is preferred, if it can be politically established. If a\n            unified agency is not politically feasible, effective\n            arrangements for data integration must be introduced,\n            otherwise the unsatisfactory experience of Guatemala will be\n            repeated in other places. There are steps that can be taken\n            during project design and implementation to make it more\n            likely that integration will be effective. Regularization\n            may be more urgent, more feasible and more sustainable in\n            urban areas and in fertile rural areas with dynamic land\n            markets. Urban regularization could usefully be accompanied\n            by complementary efforts to improve municipal services,\n            municipal financing and slum upgrading. In rural areas,\n            there is more of a need to adopt an integrated approach to\n            land in private property, protected areas and indigenous\n            communities (the last two typically having been orphaned in\n            land administration projects)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador -

The objectives of this project are as follows:\n            (i) promotion of access to land; (ii) reform of the legal\n            and institutional frame work to increase tenure security and\n            resolve conflicts; and (iii) establishment of a modem,\n            decentralized cadastre/registry system. Some of the\n            important of the lessons learned from the project are as\n            follows: (i) political commitment is fundamental for legal\n            and institutional reforms: the project has shown that\n            meaningful legal and institutional reforms on land issues\n            only take place when there is strong political support at\n            the highest levels of government in both branches, the\n            executive and the legislative. When political support is\n            present, land administration projects can be an effective\n            instrument to develop sound technical proposals, facilitate\n            exchange of experiences with other countries, and build\n            public support for agreed reforms and once legal changes are\n            in place, implementation also requires political support;\n            (ii) integration of the cadastre and registry may take some\n            time: the integration of cadastral and registry functions\n            under one institution is very rare; only a couple of\n            countries in the region have done it. The project has shown\n            that Guatemala is not ready at this time for a full\n            institutional integration between the cadastre and the\n            registry; otherwise the law that created RIC can have just\n            as well created an integrated registry. Under these\n            circumstances, the second-best approach is a gradual\n            integration, as currently planned under second phase of the program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala - Land Administration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guatemala -

The project consists of three\n            components. First, cadastre and land regularization will\n            support the mapping of the Peten cadastre, in-field\n            adjudication upon demand, and data processing of areas\n            subject to regularization. The end result is the\n            establishment of a parcel-based cadastre that can be\n            integrated with the registry system. Second, the land\n            registry component will support the opening of a registry\n            office in Peten and modernizing registry records management.\n            It also includes office space renovation, office equipment,\n            consultant services, and training.
