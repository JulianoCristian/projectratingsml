Some lessons learned included:\n            strong support from the government is another key success\n            factor for a Global Development Learning Network (GDLN)\n            center to become a well recognized and well utilized\n            capacity building facility, since the primary target\n            audience of a GDLN center consists of senior policy makers\n            within the public administration. In other countries, the\n            Governments have provided continuous support through the\n            sponsoring of learning activities and the promotion of the\n            center's services across the ministries and the major\n            administrations. Moreover, a government should not invest\n            into a GDLN center unless it has allocated sufficient budget\n            funds to develop and implement a clear national capacity\n            building strategy. Although participation in a number of\n            GDLN learning events can be sponsored by donor agencies, it\n            is essential that key ministries and governmental agencies\n            have an annual budget for training and capacity building\n            activities, part of which can be organized through the local\n            GDLN center."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Development Learning Center Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso - Development\n            Learning Center Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/05/10888138/burkina-faso-development-learning-center-project","projn":"BF-Development Learning Center Project -- P076159","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"m,ICT Policy and Strategies,Educational Sciences,Housing & Human Habitats,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Information and Communication Technologies,Communities and Human Settlements,Education","count":"Burkina Faso","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20090729233309"},"theme":"Corporate governance,Technology diffusion,Education for the knowledge economy","subsc":"Adult literacy/non-formal education,Telecommunications,Sub-national government administration,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Information and Communication Technologies,Communities and Human Settlements,Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Information and communications,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"achievement, architectural design,\n            Assessment of Risk, attention, Bank Lending, Baseline Cost,\n            Beneficiaries, Beneficiary, best practice, best practice\n            guidelines, Borrower, Borrowing, business plan, capacity\n            building, capacity-building, capacity-building institutions,\n            career development, cities, coherence, communication skills,\n            communication strategy, Competitive Bidding, content\n            providers, Contingencies, cost recovery, CURRENCY,\n            curricula, curriculum, data collection, decision makers,\n            Distance Learning, Economic Development, entrepreneurship,\n            equipment, Exchange Rate, Female, Financial Analysis,\n            financial aspects, financial instrument, financial\n            management, financial support, financial sustainability,\n            formal education, Front-end, Gender, global knowledge,\n            Government Organization, health insurance, Human Resources,\n            ID, Implementing Agencies, Implementing Agency, Innovation,\n            installation, institution, international consultant, IP,\n            knowledge economy, language skills, leadership, learning\n            activities, Learning Centers, learning methods, learning\n            needs, Loan, marketing, marketing strategy, multimedia,\n            occupancy, partnership agreements, pension, pension reform,\n            perception, Performance Indicator, Performance Indicators,\n            performances, positive feedback, Primary Education, private\n            sector, private sectors, procurement, project management,\n            public administration, recognition, reduction in time,\n            regional network, RESULTS, senior, Social Development,\n            social security, Stakeholder, stakeholders, Supervision,\n            technical assistance, Telecommunications, training budgets,\n            training course, Training programs, urban area, web, Workbook"}},"owner":"AFTOS: Dev.
