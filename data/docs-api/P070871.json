Some lessons learned includes: indicators must\n            be realistic, feasible and available at the time the project\n            is launched. A well-prepared logical framework (i.e., a\n            results-based monitoring framework) should be the backbone\n            of project design and should be fully specified and agreed\n            prior to implementation. An Integrated Ecosystem Management\n            (IEM) approach focusing on inter-village cohesion built on a\n            common interest in the protection of shared watersheds is a\n            successful model. SILEM was innovative as it brought\n            together villages located in a watershed area and created a\n            common interest among them based on an integrated management\n            plan to protect the watershed.  This approach of developing\n            a common vision across interested villages allows for a\n            coherent organization and management of different\n            occupations (farmers/cultivators and cattle farmers) based\n            on the recognition the performance in each business depends\n            on the common management of the shared watershed. The\n            success of this approach was also reflected in the decline\n            in social conflict in the areas where SILEM intervened.\n            Formal and informal mechanisms were both

Local capacity building for\n            integrated ecosystem management will seek to strengthen the\n            technical, and organizational capacity of rural communities,\n            and municipalities to plan, implement and monitor integrated\n            ecosystem management (IEM) activities. Financed activities\n            include awareness building, and training on IEM concepts,\n            land/water use planning, and environmental issues, in\n            addition to the development of watershed management\n            committees. To support such activities, a local investment\n            fund will be developed, and have two windows: one for\n            financing village and inter-village subprojects for\n            watershed management, and, a special window to provide\n            provinces with resources to undertake larger investments. An\n            institutional capacity building for integrated ecosystem\n            management shall provide an adequate policy environment,\n            supporting civil society groups, and decentralized\n            government institutions, so that through policy dialogues,\n            IEM practices would be adopted. Also provided, will be\n            training on information, negotiation and conflict\n            resolution, supply of equipment, and, incremental operating\n            costs. To support this objective, capacities will be\n            strengthened to mobilize national, and international funds\n            to address environmental, and resource management issues of\n
