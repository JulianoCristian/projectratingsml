Gkamines Exploitation (Gecamines), the national\n            copper and Cobalt Company, historically generated over half\n            of the nation's foreign exchange and 25 percent of the\n            government's fiscal revenue. It also played a major\n            social role as an industrial employer, and as a provider of\n            basic public services such as housing, medical care,\n            schooling, and food, particularly in the Shaba region, where\n            the copper belt is located. The company is also the major\n            customer for infrastructure services such as electricity\n            production and rail transport. In this PCR was part of an\n            overall Bank strategy in Zaire and should not be seen in\n            isolation.

It would also finance preinvestment and technical\n            studies, and technical assistance to improve ongoing\n            operations, review the company's social activities,\n            reduce costs, and permit the definition of a long term\n            development plan, beyond the rehabilitation program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zaire - Gecamines Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zaire - Gecamines Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1986/03/741065/zaire-gecamines-rehabilitation-project","projn":"ZR-Gecamines Rehab. -- P003053","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Montreal Protocol,Primary Metals,Economic Theory & Research,Mining & Extractive Industry (Non-Energy)","teratopic":"Environment","count":"Congo, Democratic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970625095748"},"subsc":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agriculture,alloys,aluminum,ard,automobiles,bauxite,Breakeven\n            Analysis,cadmium,Central Bank,Centrally Planned\n            Economies,chemicals,climate,closure,Co,Cobalt,columbium,competitive\n            advantages,competitiveness,concentrates,Copper,Copper\n            Industry,Copper mine,Copper Mines,Copper Mining,Copper\n            Prices,corrosion,debt,diamonds,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic\n            boom,economic conditions,economic growth,economic\n            outlook,Economic Rate of Return,economic situation,economic\n            value,employment,exchange rate,Exploitation,forecasts,Funds\n            Flow,GDP,geological mapping,germanium,gold,gold\n            deposits,growth\n            rate,imports,Income,Inflation,inventories,iron,iron\n            ore,LDCs,lignite,limestone,machinery,manganese,market\n            factors,Metals,mineral activities,mineral deposits,Mineral\n            Exports,mineral occurrences,Mineral Producers,Mineral\n            Production,mineral products,Mineral Resources,mineral\n            sector,Minerals,Minerals System,Mines,Mining\n            Activities,mining companies,mining industry,mining\n            products,MINING SECTOR,nickel,oil,Ore\n            Reserves,ores,phosphate,plastics,precious metals,price\n            fluctuations,price increases,Production\n            Costs,productivity,radium,refining,rocks,silver,small\n            scale,small scale mining,tantalum,taxation,technical assistance,tin,tools,tungsten,uranium,Zinc"},"1":{"cdata!":"agriculture,alloys,aluminum,ard,automobiles,bauxite,Breakeven\n            Analysis,cadmium,Central Bank,Centrally Planned\n            Economies,chemicals,climate,closure,Co,Cobalt,columbium,competitive\n            advantages,competitiveness,concentrates,Copper,Copper\n            Industry,Copper mine,Copper Mines,Copper Mining,Copper\n            Prices,corrosion,debt,diamonds,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic\n            boom,economic conditions,economic growth,economic\n            outlook,Economic Rate of Return,economic situation,economic\n            value,employment,exchange rate,Exploitation,forecasts,Funds\n            Flow,GDP,geological mapping,germanium,gold,gold\n            deposits,growth\n            rate,imports,Income,Inflation,inventories,iron,iron\n            ore,LDCs,lignite,limestone,machinery,manganese,market\n            factors,Metals,mineral activities,mineral deposits,Mineral\n            Exports,mineral occurrences,Mineral Producers,Mineral\n            Production,mineral products,Mineral Resources,mineral\n            sector,Minerals,Minerals System,Mines,Mining\n            Activities,mining companies,mining industry,mining\n            products,MINING SECTOR,nickel,oil,Ore\n            Reserves,ores,phosphate,plastics,precious metals,price\n            fluctuations,price increases,Production\n            Costs,productivity,radium,refining,rocks,silver,small\n            scale,small scale mining,tantalum,taxation,technical assistance,tin,tools,tungsten,uranium,Zinc"}},"owner":"WBOff:Kinshasa-CC2:DRC/CG(Braz) (AFCC2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"5842"},"facets":{}}}
