Some lessons learned included: 1)\n            however, given the close inter-linkages between water and\n            wastewater service provision, a clear definition of roles as\n            well as a clear framework and mechanisms to ensure the\n            predictability in the availability of financial resources\n            are pre-requisites in ensuring the long-term sustainability\n            of such institutional framework; 2) given the complexity of\n            operation, continuity within the team and the high level of\n            supervision devoted by the Bank were adequate to ensure the\n            achievement of project outcomes, even though at the\n            formulation of this Implementation Completion Report (ICR)\n            some of the works were not fully completed. The assumption\n            that a well designed program will need minimal supervision\n            should not be made and adequate financial and human\n            resources must be allocated to complex projects; 3)\n            furthermore, global experience demonstrates that projects\n            that involve significant and complex water infrastructure,\n            such as sewerage networks and wastewater facilities take, on\n            average, almost ten years to implement successfully. The\n            Bank must take this into consideration when designing\n            operations in the sector, as shorter execution periods could\n            impede the achievement of desired outcomes; and 4) it is\n            important to set realistic objectives, especially in areas\n            that are known to be controversial and politically\n            sensitive, such as increase in tariffs and achievement of\n            full cost recovery in a relatively short period of time. In\n            this case, given the fact that the Tehran Sewerage Company\n            (TSC) was newly established and that this already\n            represented a new approach to provision of wastewater\n            services, objectives and targets related to institutional\n            and reform aspects should have been set at lower levels."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran - Tehran Sewerage

Tehran area, through the\n            installation of wastewater collection, and treatment\n            facilities, to improve public health, and further enhance\n            irrigation systems in the surrounding areas. The components\n            call for: 1) civil works to install interceptors, and\n            laterals to collect the northern, and southern areas'\n            waste-waters, and in part, the collection of the central\n            area's discharge into the western, and eastern trunk\n            mains; 2) construction, and installation of reinforced\n            concrete pipe for the western trunk main , and related\n            tunnels; 3) installation of the eastern trunk main, to be\n            constructed as a tunnel, to connect to a culvert before\n            reaching the treatment works; 4) waste-water treatment\n            works, to allow an acceptable waste-water quality, to be\n            diluted with surface water, and enable unrestricted\n            irrigation practices in the surrounding areas. Secondary\n            treatment chlorination will dissinfect treated effluents for\n            suitable irrigation purposes, and a further tertiary\n            treatment will be extended if required. Treated effluents,\n            and sludge will be reused for agricultural purposes under\n            the irrigation scheme; 5) strategic operation, and\n            maintenance works will be contracted, under the supervision\n            of the Tehran Sewerage Company (TSC) ; and, 6) technical\n            assistance, to strengthen TSC's capacity, allow private\n            sector participation, and, achieve flexibility for staff deployment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran - Tehran Sewerage Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Iran - Tehran Sewerage

sewerage\n            system, sewage and sludge treatment facilities, and a\n            sewerage drainage system. Measures to minimize negative\n            environmental impacts include the following: During\n            construction and operation, reduce noise levels by suitable\n            dampening; screening plant air compressors and de-watering\n            pumps with sandbags; restrict work to daytime where\n            possible; issue workers equipment to protect hearing; and\n            restrict construction traffic during nighttime. Mitigate\n            vibration impacts by limiting the use of percussive\n            equipment when excavating sewer trenches and tunnel shafts;\n            and using dead-weight rather than vibration compaction\n            plant. Dust problems will be alleviated by spraying water,\n            covering stockpiles of excavated material with tarpaulins;\n            providing workers with masks to keep from inhaling dust.\n            Noisome odors will be controlled by covering containers and\n            equipment, and designating the area surrounding the site as\n            a greenbelt. Disposal of solid waste in the municipal\n            landfill has been designed to prevent groundwater or surface\n            runoff from contaminating the site. To ensure the health and\n            safety of workers and the public, access to sewage treatment\n            plant effluent will be restricted by installing a fence; a\n            regular eradication program will use biodegradable\n            pesticides for pest control; and other safety measures, such\n            as barriers, flags, and bollards, will be
