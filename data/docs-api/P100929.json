Significant lessons\n            learned during project implementation include: 1) more\n            resolute, up-front action could have been taken to counter\n            the political interference which led to mis-procurement; 2)\n            relatively modest investment funding can be used to leverage\n            other external resources with a programmatic approach; 3)\n            coordination with development agencies can make operations\n            more efficient and have a greater development impact; 4) the\n            Bank can differentiate itself from other development\n            agencies through its expertise on institutional and policy\n            reform; and 5) project outcome indicators should be limited\n            in time and scope, and should measure

This will be\n            achieved by two components: the first is the road network\n            recovery component which will rehabilitate about 400 lane-km\n            of main roads (equivalent to about 160 to 200 km of main\n            roads) and thereby reducing road user costs in the short\n            term. The second component is the institutional\n            strengthening component which will improve the capacity of\n            the State Road Administration to manage effectively the road\n            network under its responsibility, and to carry out road\n            maintenance, rehabilitation, and investment programs in an\n            efficient and transparent manner.
