Some lessons learned included: 1)\n            proper synchronization and sequencing between infrastructure\n            construction, water mobilization and land development on the\n            one hand and social development on the other hand should\n            have taken place over a longer period of time but instead\n            had to be rushed -- in hindsight, the project should either\n            have been designed with a longer implementation period as\n            originally requested by the Borrower (12 years or more) or\n            have been split into two separate operations; 2) the main\n            design flaws that surfaced during project implementation\n            related to the lack of application of\n            internationally-recognized best practice in proper water\n            utilization ratio and integrated river basin management --\n            it is imperative that the Bank uses effectively its quality\n            control and support mechanisms, and internal formal and\n            informal quality reviews, to ensure that no significant\n            design flaws are introduced in projects financed by the\n            Bank; 3) flexibility during implementation encouraged the\n            effective correction of the project's design problems,\n            raising attention to the various issues of environmental and\n            economic sustainability and enabling completion of the\n            project with relatively satisfactory achievement of the\n            project objectives -- it is important for the Bank's\n            supervision teams to be proactive and flexible and to\n            respond in a timely manner to unexpected changes and\n            difficulties during project implementation; and 4) the right\n            concept of defining and measuring efficiency and performance\n            is extremely important in order to monitor and evaluate a\n            project's poverty impact."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Gansu Hexi Corridor Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Gansu Hexi Corridor Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/06/7931333/china-gansu-hexi-corridor-project","projn":"CN-Gansu Hexi Corridor -- P003594","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Common Property Resource Development,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Systems","teratopic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Rural Development","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000310607_20070719104444"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Irrigation and drainage,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development, agricultural\n            output, agricultural production, agriculture, canals,\n            Central government, collection of water, compensation, Cost\n            recovery, counterpart funding, covering, cubic meters, dams,\n            desalination, Distribution system, drainage, drainage\n            systems, Ecology, economic conditions, efficient water use,\n            Engineering, Environmental, environmental health,\n            environmental issues, Environmental Management,\n            Environmental Protection, environments, Exchange Rate,\n            expenditures, farms, fishing, flood control, flood\n            protection, forage, forest, forestry, government\n            regulations, grassland, groundwater, households, Hydrology,\n            income, Indigenous Peoples, inflation, Irrigation,\n            Irrigation District, irrigation systems, Land\n            administration, land reclamation, lands, local authorities,\n            market prices, meteorological data, Natural Resources,\n            number of beneficiaries, Partnership, Performance\n            Indicators, Pollution, Present Value, pressure, Provincial\n            Water, remote sensing, Reservoirs, resources management,\n            River, River Basin, river basin management, runoff, Rural\n            Development, sanitation, social services, soil, soil\n            conservation, soils, supply of water, Sustainable\n            Development, sustainable use, sustainable water, use of\n            water, water, water allocation, water conservation, water\n            facilities, water fees, water management, Water Resource,\n            Water Resource Management, water resources, water resources\n            management, water storage, water table, water use, Water\n            User, Water User Association, water users, water withdrawals"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF022211-CANADIAN GENERAL CTF II-CHINA,TF023091-PHRD-SOUTHWESTERN POVERTY REDUCTION,TF029173-PHRD-GANSU HEXI CORRIDOR PROJ.
