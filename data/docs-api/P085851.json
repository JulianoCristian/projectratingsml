Some lessons learned included: the choice of\n            the Adaptable Program Loan (APL) instrument was appropriate.\n            It provided an overall framework for implementation of a\n            Government program over time, while allowing adjustments\n            throughout implementation. The existence of good systems for\n            monitoring and evaluation appears even more important in an\n            APL program than for a stand-alone investment project. The\n            less-than-expected participation of parents of 0-4 year olds\n            in training under the Initial Education Program appears to\n            be influenced in part by preference for participation in\n            other Government programs. Before continuing to expand this\n            program, it would be important to identify further the\n            causes behind shortfalls in parental participation, and, if\n            necessary, ensure coordination and complementarities with\n            other programs. Also, the ability to attract and retain\n            agents to implement this program also appears to have been\n            affected, in part, by other Governmental programs that\n            catered to the same pool of potential agents."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Basic Education Development Project\n            in Support of the Third Phase of the Basic Education\n            Development

incorporated several components that\n            specifically respond to needs expressed in consultation with\n            indigenous peoples. Those components include: trained\n            bilingual teachers; bilingual teacher guides; special\n            attention to indigenous migrant; and special attention to\n            indigenous students attending general schools. CONAFE\n            developed several initiatives to address these needs; those\n            initiatives have now been streamlined as part of\n            Mexico's national basic education policy. They include:\n            Textbooks in 33 indigenous languages and 52 variants,\n            covering the first three grades or primary school, are now\n            provided at no cost by SEP through DGEI. Teachers are\n            trained to develop teaching materials appropriate to local\n            languages. SEP supplies regionally-specific books to school\n            libraries at no cost to the school. SEP and CONAFE continue\n            to provide in-service training for primary school teachers.\n            Such training is particularly important when instructors in\n            remote rural areas are unable to access teacher training\n            through normal means. A PAREIB I pilot program for migrant\n            children has become part of SEP's policy for basic\n            education and has become a core component CONAFE's\n            community education. The special attention to indigenous\n            students attending general primary schools that was piloted\n            under PARIB I, helped generate a multicultural approach to\n            basic education, which was formalized in the National\n            Education Program as a guide for basic education policy. The\n            post-primary lower-secondary program, adjusted to rural\n            communities, has become part of CONAFE's regular\n            community education program. Evaluation of that post-primary\n            program by indigenous parents, education promoters, and\n            external scholars has been positive."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Basic Education
