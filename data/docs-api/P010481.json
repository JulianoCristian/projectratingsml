Several lessons were\n            drawn from the project, the most outstanding follows. The\n            removal of subsidies on tree seedlings resulted in the\n            emergence of a sizeable number of small private nursery\n            operators, proving to be a profitable business to mostly,\n            smallholders and the landless, who as a result of the\n            project, are benefiting, though in a small measure, from\n            employment opportunities. However, the role of\n            nongovernmental organizations in social mobilization, needs\n            to be built into the project design, demonstrated in the\n            Thal and Pothwar areas, where mobilization succeeded by\n            impacting on communities in rangelands, and scrub forests as\n            set by the relevant component, an innovative effort\n            undertaken during implementation. However, project design\n            should be limited to achievable outcomes, where clear\n            innovations, even with challenging tasks such as the above\n            mentioned newly established nurseries, may prove successful\n            without diluting the focus from implementation capacity. But\n            required adjustments in implementation arrangements need to\n            be addressed promptly, as they affect the pace of the\n            implementation phase, and, timely recruitment of technical\n            assistance needs to be ensured, to avoid implementation\n            delays. The absence of appropriate training hindered\n            capacity development in forestry research, i.e., the tissue\n            culture research would continue to be constrained due to\n            lack of expertise. This could have been prevented, had a\n            foreign training been available."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Punjab Forest Sector Development
