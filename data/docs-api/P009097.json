Among the lessons learned,\n            it is suggest that greater attention should have been paid\n            to organizational procedures, to support more efficient data\n            processing, and analysis. Given that in some instances,\n            internal barriers within the Treasury, and, between the\n            Treasury and other agencies, prevented the most efficient\n            use of the data management system (DMS), internal incentives\n            for example, might have mitigated data processing problems.\n            Similarly, although a major purpose of the project was\n            knowledge transfer, the selection of consultants for their\n            ability in this area was negligible, for regardless of\n            pre-eminent qualifications, consultants were not adequately\n            available to Treasury staff, nor effective in transferring\n            the desirable knowledge. Nevertheless, it is worth noting,\n            that the use of the best competitive software available in\n            the market, proved not only effective, but avoided delays,\n            and cost overruns; an improvement over the initial intention\n            to utilize proprietary products, tailored to the existing\n            IBM mainframe computer. Finally, the experience of the\n            project suggests that greater attention should have been\n            given to the internal promotion of the DMS, either through\n            seminars, or information dissemination."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Technical Assistance for Treasury\n            Data Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Technical Assistance for\n            Treasury Data Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/06/1551993/turkey-technical-assistance-treasury-data-project","projn":"TR-Ta For Treasury Data -- P009097","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Fiscal & Monetary Policy,ICT Policy and Strategies,Information and Records Management,Information Technology,Public Sector Economics","count":"Turkey","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01080804021527"},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Central government administration","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ABBREVIATIONS,accounting,ACRONYMS,application\n            software,appropriate\n            technology,arrangement,automation,balance of\n            payments,computer usage,computing,CURRENCY,Data\n            Management,Data Processing,data sharing,data sources,data\n            storage,Data Systems,databanks,database design,Database\n            Management,Debt,Debt Management,decision-making,disk\n            storage,Exchange Rate,External Debt,External\n            Finance,Financial Management,FISCAL YEAR,foreign economic\n            relations,information,information dissemination,information\n            systems,Information\n            Technology,insurance,Intranet,learning,Local Area\n            Network,macroeconomic performance,Outputs,personal\n            computers,private sector,probability,Protocols,Public\n            Finance,Public Finance Management,Public Sector,Public\n            Sector Borrowing,reserves,risk\n            management,server,servers,State Owned Enterprises,system\n            design,Technical Assistance,technology,terminals,training\n            programs,Treasury,Treasury operations,users,vendors,web site,workstations"},"1":{"cdata!":"ABBREVIATIONS,accounting,ACRONYMS,application\n            software,appropriate\n            technology,arrangement,automation,balance of\n            payments,computer usage,computing,CURRENCY,Data\n            Management,Data Processing,data sharing,data sources,data\n            storage,Data Systems,databanks,database design,Database\n            Management,Debt,Debt Management,decision-making,disk\n            storage,Exchange Rate,External Debt,External\n            Finance,Financial Management,FISCAL YEAR,foreign economic\n            relations,information,information dissemination,information\n            systems,Information\n            Technology,insurance,Intranet,learning,Local Area\n            Network,macroeconomic performance,Outputs,personal\n            computers,private sector,probability,Protocols,Public\n            Finance,Public Finance Management,Public Sector,Public\n            Sector Borrowing,reserves,risk\n            management,server,servers,State Owned Enterprises,system\n            design,Technical Assistance,technology,terminals,training\n            programs,Treasury,Treasury operations,users,vendors,web site,workstations"}},"owner":"Poverty Reduction/Econ Mngmt (ECSPE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"3":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"4":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF020225-PHRD-WOMEN IN DEV.
