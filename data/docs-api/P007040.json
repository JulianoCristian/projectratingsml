Studies carried out by the\n            Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission for the area in\n            which the vessels would operate, in the Pacific off the\n            Ecuadorian Coast, indicate that the abundance of tuna is\n            more than sufficient to warrant the expanded exploitation\n            which is envisaged. When all vessels are in full operation,\n            an increase of over US$3 million in annual foreign exchange\n            earnings is expected. This increase represents almost 45\n            percent of the foreign exchange earnings for the entire\n            Ecuadorian fishing industry in 1967."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Fisheries Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ecuador - Fisheries Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1968/07/1556635/ecuador-fisheries-project","projn":"EC-Fisheries-270354 -- P007040","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Coastal and Marine Resources,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Adjustment and Lending,Fishing Industry,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Ecuador","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101903072816"},"subsc":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Borrower,Commitment,Commitment\n            Charge,contractors,debt,development\n            finance,Disbursement,expenditures,exploitation,fish,Fisheries,fishing,fishing\n            industry,fishing vessels,foreign exchange,IDA Credit,IDA\n            credits,LOAN,Loan Agreement,loan agreements,tuna"},"1":{"cdata!":"Borrower,Commitment,Commitment\n            Charge,contractors,debt,development\n            finance,Disbursement,expenditures,exploitation,fish,Fisheries,fishing,fishing\n            industry,fishing vessels,foreign exchange,IDA Credit,IDA\n            credits,LOAN,Loan Agreement,loan agreements,tuna"}},"owner":"LCS","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"P624"},"facets":{}}}
