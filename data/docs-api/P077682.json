Lessons learned from the project: The Bank\n            is well positioned to respond to similar emergencies in the\n            future. The Bank can play an active role to assist countries\n            in meeting established and evolving regulatory standards.\n            There can be significant advantages to implementing\n            multi-country programs through a regional entity with\n            sufficient capacity. Regional procurement can bring\n            important cost-benefits. The Emergency Recovery Project in\n            Grenada was successful in great part thanks to the close and\n            regular supervision of the Bank team. This was made possible\n            by grouping supervision of five similar projects in the\n            region, thereby creating significant economies of scale.\n            With pooled supervision funds, the team was able to visit\n            all participating islands on a single mission while paying\n            transportation costs only once. Had this not been the case,\n            the Bank team would not have had the funds required to be\n            closely involved in project implementation - to the\n            detriment of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Grenada -

Five Emergency Recovery Projects (Dominica,\n            Grenada, St. Christopher and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent\n            and the Grenadines)"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This report combines five emergency\n            recovery programs for five member states of the Organization\n            of Eastern Caribbean States--Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts\n            and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\n            The development objectives of these five Bank operations\n            are: 1) to help safeguard and maintain the productive\n            capacity of the countries' tourism sectors, notably by\n            securing the industry's emergency needs in the\n            aftermath of the September 11 events; 2) to enhance security\n            at key airport and seaport facilities in line with\n            international standards, with the aim of preventing further\n            acts of terrorism and safeguarding the sub-region's\n            image as a safe tourist destination; and 3) to strengthen\n            the countries' institutional capacity to develop and\n            implement security plans, procedures, and measures as\n            mandated by the international civil aviation and marine\n            transport regulatory agencies. There are two main project\n            components. The first finances one critical import, low\n            sulfur diesel fuel for electricity generation, which is\n            critical to the maintenance of economic activity in the\n            tourism industry by ensuring that the energy-intensive\n            tourism facilities are kept operational during the recovery\n            period. The second component finances the physical and\n            technical resources needed for national port and aviation\n            authorities, as well as individual airports and seaports, to\n            upgrade security arrangements at key facilities and meet\n            international regulations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Organization of Eastern Caribbean States\n            (OECS) - Five Emergency
