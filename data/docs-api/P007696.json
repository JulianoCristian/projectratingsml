The key lessons learned relate to the\n            importance of a close relationship between project design,\n            ownership, and the macro-economic climate. While there was a\n            relatively large number of project objectives, they\n            reflected a coherent whole contained in the policy statement\n            of the government. Project ownership by the implementing\n            agencies (FOVI) and the government was essential as many of\n            the objectives of the project depended not only on\n            government support but on direct government action. The\n            government was closely involved with the implementing agency\n            in project preparation and in the development of a policy\n            statement for the sector which strengthened ownership. It\n            not only approved the plans for achieving regulatory and\n            sector reforms but was actively involved in promoting\n            reforms at the state and municipal levels. The macroeconomic\n            climate was also important for project success. Rising\n            housing costs relative to household income and the\n            significant reduction in the availability of credit and its\n            increased cost due to the 1995 economic crisis had serious\n            adverse effects on the credit component. These risks were\n            not foreseen during appraisal. Creative action by FOVI and\n            the government ameliorated their effects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Housing Market Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico -
