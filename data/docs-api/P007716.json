The project will have three main\n            components: (i) human resources development will upgrade the\n            knowledge and skills of all personnel involved in the IE\n            program, Public Education Secretariat (SEP) and state-level\n            Public Education Secretariats (SPES)'s (technical\n            staff, coordinators, supervisors, and community educators),\n            and specifically the child development skills of parents;\n            (ii) educational materials development will upgrade\n            instructional materials to cover new areas (health,\n            nutrition, and environment), present materials more\n            effectively, and develop new supporting audiovisual\n            components; and (iii) institutional strengthening will\n            strengthen management capacity at both SEP and SPES levels -\n            including their planning, management, supervision, and\n            evaluation capacity - while fostering and supporting\n            community participation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Initial Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Initial Education
