Even issues that are\n            seemingly resolved can re-emerge unexpectedly. For example,\n            there are current political controversies swirling around\n            the National AIDS Commission, with continuing rumors that it\n            is about to be dissolved. Given that the Commission's\n            initial creation was viewed by many as simply a quick\n            political fix, intended to placate public outcry over\n            increasing number of AIDS-related illnesses and deaths, it\n            is not surprising that it remains a source of controversy,\n            in many cases merely a tool in ongoing power struggles. In\n            the case of the HSRP, the lack of a macroeconomic support\n            program to push for difficult policy issues outside the\n            purview of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW)\n            probably constrained or delayed actions, particularly in the\n            areas of decentralization of services and upgrading the\n            salaries and benefits of health workers. Sustainable human\n            resources retention requires long-term planning, ownership,\n            and most of all, innovation. Like many countries in the\n            region, shortage of skilled manpower is one of the main\n            challenges facing the Government of Lesotho. Levels of\n            remuneration, while important, are not the primary issue.\n            HIV/AIDS programs must be balanced with attention to, and\n            integration with, other key health priorities. There is\n            near-universal agreement that HIV has crowded out other\n            important health challenges in Lesotho. The HCTA's\n            focus on Global Fund resources may have exacerbated this\n            problem, with its exclusive concentration not only on HIV,\n            but on global fund-financed HIV interventions; Government\n            attention, largely because of the significant dollar amounts\n            involved, remains with the global fund grant, and\n            opportunities to integrate both global fund activities and\n            HIV-related activities with the health sector in general\n            have been missed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Health Sector Reform
