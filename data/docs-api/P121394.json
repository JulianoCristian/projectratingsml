- Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Federally\n            Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) Emergency Recovery Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and\n            Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) Emergency\n            Recovery Project for Pakistan were as follows: outcomes were\n            not applicable; risk to development outcome was also not\n            applicable; Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory;\n            and borrower performance was unsatisfactory. In early 2009,\n            the Government of Pakistan (GoP) launched major military\n            operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KP) and FATA to\n            root out the local pockets of militants. Starting from the\n            valley of Swat, bordering the tribal areas, the\n            Government's military operations gradually moved\n            westward. The offensive led to significant damage to\n            physical infrastructure and services while creating a large\n            population of internally displaced persons (IDPs) who lost\n            their homes and livelihoods. Approximately 3 million people\n            were displaced in KP and FATA in 2009.The Emergency Project\n            was to set up a recovery mechanism that will provide cash\n            grants directly to households affected by the militancy\n            crisis and the flood crisis. The project design recognized\n            that during the recovery process getting cash support to\n            poor and vulnerable groups in a timely manner will improve\n            their welfare, and that such assistance will be a prominent\n            sign of the government's presence and support in a time\n            of acute need. The project was strategically designed to\n            provide short term relief in the aftermath of the\n            devastating militancy crisis in Pakistan. The project was to\n            support the early recovery phase (6-24 months) focusing on\n            recovering livelihoods by promoting self-reliance and\n            rebuilding livelihoods through cash transfers to households\n            and reestablishing essential services such as health,\n            education, water or sanitation, and primary infrastructure\n            (road repair, transport, communication)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -
