They provided necessary guidance through various\n            review and technical missions during the period of\n            implementation. The project moved quite smoothly except in a\n            few cases where the difference of opinion between the\n            Borrower and IDA (e.g. contract for head regulator and\n            contract for gates etc) caused delay in the execution of\n            work. The main lessons learned from the project are that:\n            (a) financial capability and willingness of the Borrower to\n            execute the project should be ascertained carefully before\n            credit approval; (b) it is important to prepare final\n            designs of canal and drainage works for the first project\n            year prior to credit negotiations, and to allow adequate\n            time for these tasks in the implementation schedule and the\n            project should be reassessed for technical and economic\n            viability. It is important to ensure adequate preparation of\n            final designs prior to loan/credit negotiations. When this\n            is not possible and designs are finalized during\n            implementation, sufficient time should be allowed in the\n            implementation schedule, and the project should be\n            reassessed for technical and economic viability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -
