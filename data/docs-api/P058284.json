While the piloting nature\n            of a Learning and Innovation Loan proved to be particularly\n            appropriate in a new sector and an uncertain setting, where\n            experimentation and testing of innovative approaches - i.e.\n            especially in the Saxon village development - are essential,\n            the selection process for pilot villages however, would have\n            benefited from a more comprehensive community consultative\n            effort earlier in the process, to include clearer selection\n            criteria. In addition to reinforcing the need for community\n            consultation and participation, established monitoring and\n            evaluation mechanisms, and a strong supervision, several\n            lessons are addressed as follows. Given the importance and\n            uniqueness of cultural assets, and the patrimony regulations\n            that govern their management and use in most countries,\n            there are inevitable, and understandable clearance and\n            approvals at various levels, that result in unexpected\n            execution delays. The nature of these processes is\n            significantly different from those experienced in most\n            Bank-supported sectors; e.g., the processes involve several\n            layers of review by art historians, restoration experts, and\n            other specialists inside, and outside the Government. This\n            factor must be taken more into account at the initial\n            project design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Cultural Heritage Pilot Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania -
