Conversely, the Borrower\n            performance is rated unsatisfactory, for although the\n            Borrower's performance during preparation was\n            satisfactory, the institutional instability led to\n            insufficient support from the highest level of Government.\n            Lessons convey the following. Project specific lessons\n            highlight the lack of political leadership, in particular,\n            because it worsened difficulties between the two\n            governmental bodies in charge of the project implementation:\n            the resistance of the Autonomous Literacy Service - SAA - to\n            the new approach could only be eliminated, or eased by means\n            of strong political leadership. This lack of political\n            leadership, aggravated the establishment of new\n            institutional framework arrangements; instead, on the basis\n            of existing institutions, arrangements could have been\n            built, avoiding institutional conflicts. Moreover, the\n            program lacked an adequate assessment of literacy providers.\n            Therefore, strengthening training activities is crucial to\n            facilitating implementation, and avoiding most of the\n            problems experienced. Lessons of specific value for the Bank\n            point at the \"Quality of Supervision Assessment\"\n            (QSA6) report, which observed in some specific cases, that\n            conclusions included in \"Aide Memoirs\" and\n            Back-to-Office Reports, were not always reflected in the\n            performance ratings."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire -

The goal is to\n            develop flexible systems and procedures for delivering\n            technical support services and financing to\n            providers/beneficiaries which permit scaling-up to a larger\n            country-wide constituency. The project has three components.\n            The first component, testing functional literacy programs,\n            funds the selection of sub-projects proposed by\n            provider/beneficiary groups that are community developed,\n            and provides technical support to nongovernmental\n            organizations to build staff capacity in all required areas\n            of expertise while creating an operational network of\n            resource institutions. The second component develops and\n            tests essential strategies for post-literacy to ensure the\n            scaling up and sustainability of the program. It finances\n            the preparation and broadcasting of post-literacy programs.\n            Component 3 finances project management, supervision, and\n            evaluation. It establishes an autonomous institution with\n            government sponsorship, the National Fund to Assist Literacy\n            (FNAA), which receives and manages public, private, and\n            donor funds.
