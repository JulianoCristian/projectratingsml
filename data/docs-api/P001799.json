outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: it is possible to revive and\n            re-position even weak public institutions in a short time\n            provided there is sufficient depth of commitment and a\n            multi-pronged reform strategy that is willing to address\n            difficult or \"long haul\" issues as well; in\n            lending operations with non-earmarked funding, it is both\n            more realistic and judicious to manage/supervise by\n            concentrating essentially on intermediate and final outcome\n            indicators; Functional analysis and re-structuring should be\n            carried out early in the reform process since the relevance\n            and effectiveness human resource development and many other\n            reforms depend upon that; massive capacity building efforts\n            need to also focus on staff retention strategies; a clear\n            articulation of expected outcomes is absolutely necessary at\n            design stage; sustained donor coordination around commonly\n            agreed programs has a significant reinforcing effect on\n            government ownership of and commitment to reform; when\n            investing in capacity of public institutions who are sole\n            providers of a good or service; and financial and\n            institutional

Legal and regulatory enforcement will support crop\n            and livestock production; and, 3) the natural resources\n            management will focus on the development of a conservation\n            program for forestry and wildlife management.
