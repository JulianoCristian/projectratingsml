Some of the\n            lessons learned included: 1) there is an increasing demand\n            for inland water transportation in China especially for\n            low-value commodities in large consignments from and to\n            destinations alongside or near a river or inland waterway.\n            Users of China's inland waterways are aware of the\n            benefit of using larger vessels for such cargo and responded\n            positively to improvements in inland waterway\n            infrastructures that promote their use. The study on the\n            development of container shipping on the Xiangjiang\n            concluded that with the standardization of vessels,\n            improvement to navigation channels, up-to-date handling\n            facilities and terminals, effective inter-modal connections\n            (road and rail access/linkages), and strong government\n            support, container shipping on China's inland waterways\n            can reach Europe's inland waterways share of 40 percent\n            total container traffic transported; 2) as was found in\n            previous inland waterway projects, cost recovery mechanisms\n            are rarely sufficient to cover all costs, but these costs\n            are small compared to other modes in either absolute terms\n            or in proportion to traffic handled. In general, permanent\n            government subsidies for transport infrastructure should be\n            avoided but inland waterway systems are somewhat\n            exceptional: for the most part they are appropriately\n            treated as public goods recovered through taxes and vessel\n            registration fees. In this light, and given inland waterways\n            greater energy efficiency and smaller environmental\n            footprint, this national policy appears appropriate; and 3)\n            the Bank's operational policy on safety of dams (OP\n            4.37) requires reviews of the investigation, design, and\n            construction of the dam and start of operation by an\n            independent panel of experts where the dam is more than 15\n            meters in height. This requirement did not apply to the\n            Zuzhou Dam which had a designed height of 10 meters.\n            Nevertheless a Dam Safety Panel for the Project was formed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Third Inland Waterways Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Third Inland Waterways

access of the remote inland areas of Hunan\n            Province; b) providing more efficient and economic inland\n            waterway transport (IWT); and c) generating power to\n            supplement the needs of remote areas. There are seven\n            project components. The first constructs a shiplock and\n            shiplock gates and hoists. The second component constructs a\n            dam and powerhouse; and supplies and installs turbines and\n            power generators, sluice gates, and hydraulic hoists as well\n            as providing trash screens, roof covers, and other small\n            equipment; and provides transformers and a switch yard and\n            builds transmission lines. The third component funds access\n            roads from existing roads to the project site along with\n            access roads within the project complex. The fourth\n            component finances river bank protection works and reservoir\n            area protection. The fifth component upgrades channels. The\n            sixth component strengthens institutional capacity by\n            developing a waterway management strategy and providing for\n            training, a containerization study, and construction\n            supervision. The seventh component finances land\n            acquisition, compensation for resettlement, cleaning of the\n            reservoir area, and other resettlement-related activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
