The lessons learned indicated that the\n            absence of coherent sector policies, a supportive legal\n            framework, and an effective institutional structure makes it\n            very difficult to implement a well-designed and fairly\n            limited pilot project. Since private participation in water\n            services is usually politically sensitive, it is important\n            that it is associated explicitly with service improvements\n            for the poor. In an environment of political turmoil in\n            which government officials and staff changed frequently, the\n            management contract provided some stability for the water\n            services in Monagas and produced significant improvements in\n            commercial/financial performance, and service. The failure\n            of political authorities to support a tariff policy in\n            secondary cities of Monagas, undermined the financial\n            viability of Monagas Water and Sewerage. The project team\n            and regional management made adequate concessions and\n            provided an appropriate level of assistance to the\n            government in light of the difficulties it was facing during implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Venezuela - Water and Sewerage\n            Decentralization Project in the State of Monagas"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Venezuela -

for decentralization,\n            institutional strengthening, and expanded private sector\n            participation. The project has three specific objectives: 1)\n            to assist in the strengthening of Monagas Water and Sewerage\n            Company (AdM), develop its financial self-sufficiency, and\n            involve the private sector in the management and operation\n            of the company; 2) to rehabilitate and improve the quality\n            of WS&S services in Monagas; and 3) to support sector\n            development and decentralization at the national level,\n            including water resources management. The project will\n            include two components to finance: 1) regional institutional\n            strengthening and investment in rehabilitating the existing\n            WS&S systems in the State of Monagas to improve quality\n            and efficiency of service delivery. This component will\n            consist of: (a) institutional strengthening and support to\n            AdM; (b) rehabilitation in urban areas; and (c)\n            institutional development and rehabilitation of rural water\n            systems; and 2) national institutional strengthening, which\n            will include: (a) a technical assistance program; (b) a\n            national
