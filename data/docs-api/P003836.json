and its bridges; (b) improve\n            highway planning and management; and (c) increase road user\n            contributions to highway construction and maintenance.  As\n            part of Indonesia's road program under the Fourth\n            Five-Year Development Plan (1984-89) the project will\n            provide for betterment and upgrading of some 3,000 km of\n            roads and 3,200 m of bridges and replacement of some 8,000 m\n            of bridges.  Equipment will be provided for surface dressing\n            operations to improve the efficiency of road maintenance in\n            fourteen provinces, for design and quality control of\n            hot-mix bituminous surfacings, and for quality control of\n            the natural rock asphalt (asbuton) used in road construction\n            and maintenance.  The project also includes components for\n            consultancy and technical assistance services, and training.\n            The project will provide substantial economic benefits to\n            large areas of the country, improved capacity for planning,\n            construction and maintenance of highways as well as\n            assistance in decentralizing those functions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Highway Betterment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Highway Betterment
