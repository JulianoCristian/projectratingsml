Devolution of\n            decision-making and ensuring procurement can be done as\n            simply as possible are essential, while maintaining\n            accountability. In parallel with this, the focus of\n            monitoring should be on fewer and more outcome-oriented\n            supervision/review missions, at least through the later part\n            of a project. Detailed technical supervision is highly\n            appreciated as part of the package of working with the Bank,\n            and provides an important, marketable 'quality\n            stamp' to activities. However, technical support should\n            also be increasingly entrusted in the course of the project\n            to sharing among regions and the increasing high-level\n            technical expertise within the country. Strengthening\n            sustainable development in coastal areas is a continuing\n            issue for China, with pressures on the resources likely to\n            increase further. There is still room for major funding of\n            public goods but this may need greater grant or soft loan\n            finance, also considering the learning, pioneering,\n

There are four components.\n            The first forms and implements programs in four provinces.\n            It establishes institutional arrangements to promote coastal\n            zone management (CZM); assesses resource use; provides\n            hardware and software for data management and analysis as\n            well as equipment and training for environmental data\n            collection and analysis; establishes fishery and\n            environmental management centers; provides surveillance\n            vessels and equipment; and establishes a coastal forest\n            protection belt. The second component supports\n            environmentally sustainable marine aquaculture in shallow\n            waters and tidal flats. It finances equipment, facilities,\n            and services to farmers in aquaculture. It raises fin fish\n            in net cages; breeds oysters, scallops, kelp, algae, clams,\n            and laver (a red algae); and uses artificial breeding\n            techniques. The third component supports trials of new\n            methods of shrimp culture. The fourth finances a number of\n            seafood handling operations, including processing and\n            wholesale markets, to improve product quality and safety.\n            Selected cold storage, packaging facilities, and wholesale\n            markets will be expanded and improved, and processing\n            facilities will be built and expanded.

Negative environmental impacts\n            and their mitigations include the following:\n            Counter-measures for controlling the pollution of fisheries\n            include dividing and developing fishery areas according to\n            function; choosing suitable cultural organisms which are\n            strongly adaptable; strengthening scientific research in\n            this area; and enhancing the laws for environmental\n            management in this field. Other mitigating measures include\n            removing organic waste through pumping or pouring lime white\n            to make a surface cover or bottom protective layer to reduce\n            sediment pollution.
