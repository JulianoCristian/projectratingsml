sustainability likely, and institutional development impacts\n            were substantial, achieved through satisfactory performances\n            by both the Bank and Borrower. Lessons address the\n            following: 1) On broad policy issues, conditionalities\n            should be very limited in investment lending operations,\n            limited to policies that affected the project directly. For\n            example, further disbursement to savings and credit\n            associations should not have been allowed until there was a\n            proper supervisory authority in place. As much as possible,\n            further \"policy issues\" should be integrated into\n            alternative documents. 2) On Rural Finance, credit lines\n            that are likely to make a large number of small sub-loans\n            need considerable delegation of fiduciary responsibilities.\n            While eligibility criteria for participating financial\n            institutions should be designed during project preparation,\n            the project should allow for some flexibility to\n            add/subtract financial intermediaries throughout project\n            implementation. Loan documents AND budgets should allow this\n            flexibility. If the credit line is going to contain a grant\n            portion, the project should ensure there is a general\n            consensus on the constrain the grant is trying to address,\n            so that the project can objectively measure its\n            effectiveness. 3) On advisory and business development\n            services, the lack of consulting services to help small\n            entrepreneurs prepare and implement business plans, was as\n            important a constrain to rural finance, as the lack of\n            long-term credit on the market."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova -

and measures to\n            mitigate them. High standard phytosanitary requirements ,\n            adequate packaging, and compliance with bilateral agreements\n            will ensure that pests and diseases and diseased animals and\n            animal products will not be introduced in export. Staff will\n            be trained in proper handling methods, appropriate storage\n            of fuels and lubricants, and periodic safe transfer to\n            recycling facilities will reduce soil contamination and\n            water pollution. Safety equipment and clothing will be\n            issued and on-site warnings given to avoid personal\n            injuries. Loss of aquatic ecosystems and resources will be\n            prevented by appropriately handling and storing pesticides,\n            fertilizers, and waste materials. Also, farmers will be\n            trained in appropriate application levels. And the\n            timeliness of applications. The importance of the ecosystem\n            from where irrigated water will be sourced will reduce the\n            loss of water systems through irrigation. Traditional plant\n            varieties and indigenous and endemic germplasm will be\n            protected. Crop rotation with legumes and green manures will\n            avert heavy dependence on fertilizers. There will likely be\n            some nutrient leaching from chemicals into surface waters\n            and into groundwater sources as well as nutrient enrichment\n            of the soil.
