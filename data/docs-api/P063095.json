Some\n            lessons learned included: there is a need for consensus on\n            privatization issues especially with the policy makers. A\n            robust and well targeted public awareness program is\n            critical to sustain public support, especially for the\n            larger, politically difficult transactions. In the second\n            half of the project implementation this aspect was very much\n            reinforced leading to a speedier implementation.\n            Overestimation of capacity within the Privatization\n            Commission (PC) at project design meant that the project did\n            not have adequate procurement and financial management\n            capacity in the first three years of project life. This\n            effectively delayed achievement of project outcomes and\n            outputs. For the future it will be important to properly\n            assess capacity specific to project requirements. A\n            communications strategy that targets all key stakeholders\n            and constantly provides all relevant and accurate\n            information in a timely matter is critical to the success of\n            reforms of this nature. Project design and implementation\n            should retain sufficient flexibility to reflect changes in\n            context and country priorities. The restructuring of PURP\n            allowed the project to remain relevant and use its resources\n            to reflect a new stage in private sector programming and development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Privatization and Utility Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malawi - Privatization and\n            Utility Reform
