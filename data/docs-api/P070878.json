To enhance sustainability of\n            outcomes of this biodiversity project, consideration should\n            be given to use a regional approach and to use the\n            Conservation Trust Fund already in place in neighboring\n            Guinea Bissau with a window for Guinea-Conakry.

Therefore, institutional\n            strengthening needs focused attention, and an integrated\n            approach should be considered that goes beyond short-term\n            consultancies and disparate studies.  Project indicators and\n            outcomes have to be carefully defined, baseline data should\n            be collected at project preparation, and indicators must be\n            smart and measurable.

The project was\n            approved on June 22, 2006 and became effective on July 20,\n            2007. The Global Environment Fund (GEF) grant amount is USD5\n            million and the disbursement amount to date is USD0.62\n            million representing a 12.32 percent disbursement rate.\n            Given the suspension of disbursements, implementation of\n            project activities came to a halt which led to a rating of\n            moderately unsatisfactory of both progress towards achieving\n            the objective and the overall implementation progress. The\n            restructuring paper seeks the approval of the Executive\n            Directors to introduce changes to the project, and\n            accompanying amendments to the Project's legal\n            documents. The changes include: (i) a revision of the\n            Project Development Objectives (PDO); (ii) a reduction in\n            the scope of project components; (iii) an extension of the\n            project closing date by 24 months, from December 31, 2011 to\n            December 31, 2013; and (iv) a reallocation of the grant\n            proceeds and an increase in the ceiling of the special\n            account from its current USD550, 000 to USD1, 000,000. The\n            main reason for the changes is to minimize the impact of the\n            suspension of disbursements since December 2008 following\n            the political and social unrest in the country."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Coastal Marine and Biodiversity\n            Management Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea - Coastal Marine and\n            Biodiversity Management Project : restructuring"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/05/14182384/guinea-coastal-marine-biodiversity-management-project-restructuring","projn":"GN-Coastal Marine And Biodiversity\n            Management -- P070878","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Biodiversity,Wetlands,Population Policies,E-Business,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Water Resources,Environment","count":"Guinea","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20110511235654"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Water Resources,Environment","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"action plan, alternative livelihoods,\n            audits, baseline data, BIODIVERSITY, BIODIVERSITY\n            MANAGEMENT, biodiversity monitoring, biodiversity\n            protection, biodiversity status, biodiversity use,\n            Biological Diversity, Biological Resources, Capacity\n            Building, co-management, coastal biodiversity, coastal zone,\n            communication activities, Conservation, conservation\n            measures, Conservation Zone, Construction, cultivation, Data\n            Collection, Development Objectives, development plans,\n            dissemination, ecosystem, Enabling Environment,\n            Environmental, environmental awareness, environmental\n            education, Environmental Evaluation, environmental impact,\n            Environmental information, Environmental Studies,\n            environmental trust fund, environmentally sustainable\n            development, equipment, expenditures, Financing Plan,\n            Fisheries, flora species, Forestry, Fund Management,\n            Geographic Information, GIS, Global Environment, GPS,\n            habitats, hard copies, ID, impact assessment, Implementing\n            Agency, information database, information technology,\n            innovations, installation, international consultant,\n            Inventories, inventory, land tenure, legal framework, Local\n            Capacity, local communities, Local Development, local\n            population, marine species, material, multimedia, national\n            authorities, National level, national levels, Natural\n            Resource, natural resource base, Natural Resource\n            Management, natural resources, opinion leaders,\n            Participation of Communities, political unrest,\n            preservation, PROCUREMENT, progress, Project Management,\n            Protected Areas, Protocol, Provision of Support, radio,\n            radios, Resource Management, resource use, result, RESULTS,\n            Rural Development, rural populations, sites, social unrest,\n            species, supervision, Surface area, sustainable development,\n            sustainable management, sustainable resource use,\n            sustainable use, technical capacity, translation, user,\n            video, water resources, watershed, watersheds, Wetlands, Wildlife"}},"owner":"Env., NRM, WRM & DRM Prac 1 (AFTN1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"BBGEF-BB GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL FUND,TF051207-GEF2 PDFB-GUINEA:COASTAL ZONE\n            INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT AND PRESERVATION OF,TF056981-GEF FSP-REPUBLIC OF GUINEA:\n            COASTAL, MARINE AND BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENT","repnb":"61106"},"facets":{}}}
