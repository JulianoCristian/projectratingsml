Financial Sector Development\n            Policy Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Financial Sector Development Policy\n            Credit Project for Uganda received a moderately\n            unsatisfactory outcome rating with substantial risk to\n            development. The Bank\u0092s performance was deemed to be\n            moderately satisfactory while the Borrower\u0092s performance was\n            rated moderately unsatisfactory. There were no significant\n            changes made to this project including restructuring and\n            component revisions. There were four main lesson learned\n            from this project and they are as follows: (1) Strong\n            analytical foundations are essential for a successful\n            operation: While the Government had taken some initial bold\n            steps to initiate the process of financial sector reform,\n            the Bank had supported these reforms through high quality\n            analytical work, coupled with technical; assistance and\n            capacity building. (2) Ownership and commitment are critical\n            to success: The operation was fully client driven, building\n            on the Financial Market Development Plan (2008-12), which\n            was being implemented and supported by various donors,\n            including the Bank. The creation of URBRA, the presentation\n            of a Bill to Parliament to gradually remove the monopoly of\n            NSSF in the provision of pension services, the elaboration\n            of a reform proposal for the PSPF, were all important steps\n            in the process of financial sector reform. Building a\n            political constituency of support is key to the pace of\n            progress of reforms: One of the key reasons for delays in\n            meeting the triggers for the second phase of the DPC was the\n            difficulty in ensuring passage of legislation through\n            Parliament. (4) An overly ambitious agenda may be difficult\n            to sustain: Another aspect of the difficulty in meeting the\n            triggers for the second phase operation was the overly\n            ambitious nature of the initial reform agenda, which called\n            for actions simultaneously on a large number of fronts. A\n            narrower focus might have made the project more manageable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Financial Sector Development Policy\n            Credit
