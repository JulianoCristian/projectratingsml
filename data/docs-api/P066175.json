The additional loan will help\n            finance the cost of activities geared to deepen the\n            Government of Guatemala's public sector modernization\n            process, by amplifying the impact and development\n            effectiveness of this well-performing project, and\n            addressing pending challenges to the overall sustainability\n            of the reform process. Specifically, the additional\n            financing will facilitate the provision of technical\n            assistance necessary to: i) further strengthen the budget,\n            accounting and treasury management functions; ii)\n            institutionalize the respective integrated financial\n            management (SIAF) and the e-procurement (GUATECOMPRAS)\n            systems within the Ministry of Finance; iii) support the\n            municipalities' capacity to adopt and consolidate new\n            procedures and systems to carry out efficient and\n            transparent financial management; iv) strengthen the\n            Comptroller General's Office (CGC); v) build-up and\n            integrate public planning and public investment procedures\n            and systems with the budget; and vi) design and\n            institutionalize a permanent knowledge management system in\n            the area of public expenditure management.
