Among the lessons learned were the following:\n            1) Project activities and investments should be more closely\n            linked to the development objective. 2) Key performance\n            indicators need to be more thoroughly and realistically\n            planned. 3) Given the upcoming decentralization,\n            institutional capacity building should strengthen its focus\n            on sub-national levels, including schools and\n            municipalities. 4) The next project should be linked with\n            the education strategy. 5)  Ensure that TA, if required, is\n            provided early and there are appropriate measures for the\n            Ministry and other local agencies to absorb TA input. 6)\n            Investment into infrastructure should continue but it needs\n            to be linked to reallocation of resources between school\n            districts to favor those where migration is oriented. 7) The\n            purpose and specification of the Education Management\n            Information System needs more focus. 8) Community\n            participation in managing school-based activities can be\n            achieved through demand-driven interventions. 9) Investment\n            into curriculum needs to be continued for the next five to\n            complete the reform for compulsory education, even if Bank\n            financing into some aspects (i.e. teacher training, textbook\n            publishing) declines. 10) Project activities should be\n            implanted and implemented in the relevant departments in the\n            Ministry of Education and Sciences. 11) The investment\n            projects should have clear implementation plans/operational\n            manuals by the beginning of project implementation. 12)\n            Supervision missions need to give more emphasis to\n            monitoring outputs and outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania -

The project has five components. The first\n            component strengthens the generic functions of the Ministry\n            to improve the sector: policy analysis and strategic\n            planning; financial planning and management; human resource\n            management; and the design, implementation, and monitoring\n            of specific educational reform programs. The second\n            component is an institution-strengthening component that\n            supports a management information system that will link all\n            branches of the Ministry, including district offices and\n            universities. The third component is also an institution\n            building component as well as a policy reform component. It\n            funds the following activities: improving the current\n            examinations administered at grades 8 and 12; continuing the\n            development and administration of high quality and fair\n            university entrance examinations; determining the learning\n            performance standards to be assessed; and carrying out a\n            sample-based assessment for grade 4. The fourth component\n            develops building and design guidelines and specifications,\n            and rehabilitates schools.
