Some lessons learned included:  changes\n            in project design to reduce its environmental impact and\n            resettlement needs are essential for hydropower projects.\n            Developing an agreed policy and implementation framework for\n            resettlement and preparing a resettlement action plan\n            acceptable to the affected groups at the start of the\n            project is essential so that subsequent changes are\n            minimized and costs are kept within budget. This requires\n            conducting of very detailed surveys of submergence and other\n            adverse social impacts from the start. While this is simple\n            for a normal hydroelectric dam which impounds a river, it is\n            less so for a run-of-the river scheme like Pak Mun, which\n            presents diverse categories of affected persons. In\n            situations where adverse health effects or other serious\n            impact is probable, as for the case of the looming emissions\n            problems in Mae Moh, the Bank should insist on installation\n            of control measures from the start instead of acceding to\n            the Borrower's request to complete lengthy studies to\n            find the least-cost
