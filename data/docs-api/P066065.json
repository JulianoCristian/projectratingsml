In 2001\n            Romania was on the path of European Union (EU) accession and\n            facing the challenge of harmonizing with the EU\n            environmental agreements. Given its large agriculture\n            sector, the EU Directive on protecting water against\n            pollution with agricultural nutrients (the Nitrates\n            Directive) was of special importance. The agricultural\n            pollution control project a successful pilot to test and\n            demonstrate these practices under Romanian conditions and\n            have devised a strategy for country-wide implementation. The\n            integrated nutrient pollution control project was designed\n            to support the government of Romania to more fully meet the\n            EU Nitrates Directive requirements by scaling up these\n            practices while reducing nutrient discharges to water\n            bodies, promoting behavioral change at the community level,\n            and strengthening institutional and regulatory capacity. The\n            project supports a menu of investments focusing on Nitrate\n            Vulnerable Zone communes in ten river basins and eleven\n            counties. It is also helping to build capacity within the\n            Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development and the\n            National Administration for Romanian waters, as well as in\n            other national, regional, and county agencies involved with\n            the nitrates directive."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - When Nutrients Strangle Life"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - When Nutrients Strangle Life"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2009/07/25106963/romania-nutrients-strangle-life","count":"Romania","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"wells, water quality, waste, fertilizers,\n            manure, nutrient, oxygen, fish, ecosystem, lead, garbage,\n            algae, drinking water, nitrogen, leads, chemical, basins,\n            discharge, pollution control, water, animals, river basins,\n            sea, nitrates, pollution, phosphorus, nitrate, rivers,\n            nutrients, farmers, waters, runoff, environmental practices,\n            trees, household waste"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Environment and natural resource management,Rural development","projn":"RO-Agricultural Pollution Control Gef\n            Project-434018 -- P066065","topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population m1327755 621,Economic Growth m1326241 471,Social Development m1327660 134,Agricultural Water Management m1326881 140,Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171","subtopic":"Sanitation and Sewerage,Coastal and Marine Environment,Water Conservation,Water and Industry,Wastewater Treatment","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Water Resources,Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b083117444_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"World!$!517191"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"World!$!517191"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"World!$!517191"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","theme":"Environmental policies and institutions,Water resource management,Pollution management and environmental health,Other rural development,Land administration and management","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation","prdln":"Global Environment Project","topicv3":"Health, Nutrition and Population m1327755 621,Economic Growth m1326241 471,Social Development m1327660 134,Agricultural Water Management m1326881 140,Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171","owner":"Envir & Nat.

The central\n            government respected country council and communities\n            preferences in the design of project activities, notably the\n            emphasis on manure storage as part of communal waste\n            management and afforestation, and in amending some of the\n            project activities, as discussed in earlier sections.

Although it is expected\n            that surface water quality will improve with the reduction\n            in nitrogen, and phosphorous transport to run-off waters\n            from swine, and cattle manure disposal sites, including that\n            of drainage, and irrigation canals, measures will be\n            implemented to improve manure management, and\n            environmentally sound agricultural management. Water quality\n            monitoring programs will be undertaken, to establish a\n            baseline database on the quality of surface waters. It is\n            also expected that reductions in nutrient leaching to\n            groundwater flows will occur, improving drinking water\n            supplies. Nonetheless, wellhead protection programs will be\n            implemented, and extensive groundwater monitoring programs\n            established in the highly intensive agricultural, and animal\n            production areas, with improved animal waste management\n            systems. While the introduction of better farming systems\n            will conduce to improved soil quality, and more productive\n            lands, soil monitoring of selected areas will be undertaken,\n            to establish the effect of these improvements on soil, and\n            water quality. Similarly, biodiversity will increase,\n            nonetheless, impacts on new plant, and livestock will be\n            observed to prevent soil worm, and microbial activity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania -
