The project achieved some of its objectives,\n            its impact on institutional development was modest,\n            sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of the Bank\n            was marginally satisfactory while the Borrower's was\n            unsatisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, in contexts where there is a lack of a\n            rigorous accounting tradition and education as well as a\n            wide tendency for mismanagement of public funds,\n            incompetence in the area of accounting will facilitate\n            mismanagement and make it difficult to detect in time.\n            Second, in countries such as Guinea, where the civil service\n            skills base is weak and ill-adapted to the management of a\n            market economy, technical assistance is doomed to play a\n            substitution role in an early stage when TA outputs are\n            urgently needed for the design of the adjustment program.\n            Third, on the supply side, it is important to develop a\n            training strategy tailored to meet the specific needs of the\n            target population. Finally, on the demand side, it is\n            crucial to ensure that the conditions on the recipient part\n            do not impede meeting the institution strengthening objective."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea -
