The restructuring is\n            to better align the project activities to: 1) the priorities\n            in the conservation area in Gabon, including some emerging\n            needs that had not been identified during the preparation of\n            the project as well as; 2) the existing institutional\n            capacities. These adjustments will also imply some resource\n            reallocations amongst the different categories of\n            expenditures as well as a 12-month extension of the closing\n            date.
