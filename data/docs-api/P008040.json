Bank performance was highly\n            satisfactory in identification and preparation, and\n            satisfactory for appraisal and supervision. While the\n            Borrowers performance was satisfactory for preparation and\n            implementation, it was unsatisfactory in the area of\n            covenant compliance. Key lessons learned follow. A complete\n            reform of the electricity sector is a long-term proposition\n            requiring a firm focus on fundamental requirements with a\n            flexible legal framework. Governments need to retain high\n            quality staff familiar with the private sector. Maintaining\n            the autonomy of regulatory agencies is a constant struggle.\n            It is important to move quickly when privatizing, and close\n            coordination between key agencies is required. Tariff\n            increases should be made well before privatization\n            commences. The government needs to carry out studies of the\n            effects of privatization and adequately communicate the\n            results. The Bank, when making sectoral reform loans, should\n            include all major components of the sector, give supervision\n            appropriate priority, and attempt to understanding the\n            source of major obstacles rather than focusing on the legal\n            and administrative aspects of project implementation.\n            Combining adjustment lending with technical assistance\n            provides an effective was of ensuring that the Government\n            has the funds to carry out the necessary preparations for reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru -
