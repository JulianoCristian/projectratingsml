The\n            lessons learned indicate that a stable banking environment\n            and improved regulatory framework would be some\n            prerequisites for the success of the line of credit. The\n            straightforward design of the lending operation was an\n            important factor in the successful completion of the\n            activity. It is important to have strong ownership of the\n            project by the government and the central bank for the\n            project's monitoring and coordinating activities. The\n            focus on sub-loan portfolio quality and the overall\n            financial position and performance of the Participating\n            Financial Institutions (PFIs) is crucial to the achievement\n            of the project's developmental objectives. A suitable\n            time frame needs to be reflected in the preparation for the\n            institutional-building and technical assistance components,\n            especially in countries with weak civil service such as\n            Mongolia. Appropriate amount of supervision and monitoring\n            was the underlying achievement of the project. Criteria for\n            the evaluation of a training program would need to be\n            designed to facilitate the assessment of its results and\n            contribution to the capacity building activities of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mongolia - Private Sector Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mongolia - Private Sector\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/02/5637041/mongolia-private-sector-development-project","projn":"MN-Priv.Sec.
