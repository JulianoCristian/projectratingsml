Among the lessons learned are: 1. Strategic\n            timing and support to government in a critical situation can\n            be at least as important as its specific technical content.\n            2. Complex reforms, such as those supported, are liable to\n            require mid-course adjustments and can thus be best\n            supported with the Bank's programmatic instrument.\n            3.The design of tax reforms in federalist countries requires\n            careful political economy analysis regarding winners and\n            losers and adjustment to design to make reforms politically\n            viable. 4. Economic adjustments in economies with high\n            indexed debt require careful coordination of fiscal,\n            monetary and debt management policies. 5. Other lessons\n            concerned adopting counter-cyclical fiscal policies that\n            take into account the indebtedness level; the need to\n            consider that concentrated market structures and certain\n            shortcomings in the fund industry limit the speed at which\n            risks can be prudently transferred from the government\n            balance; and the need to adopt a more conservative approach\n            to the depth of the proposed changes in the tax system when\n            the government is operating in an environment of tough\n            fiscal

vulnerabilities, and thus promote sustainable\n            growth and poverty reduction. This opportunity comes at a\n            time of unusually adverse external environment, which poses\n            grave economic risks. The new government needs to quickly\n            build a record of credibility that will enable Brazil to\n            improve its access to international markets. The proposed\n            Second Programmatic Fiscal Reform Loan for Brazil addresses\n            two of the four broad objectives of the Government's\n            fiscal reform: 1) institutionalization of responsible and\n            credible fiscal policy and risk management; and 2)\n            improvements in efficiency in the revenue structure and\n            further strengthening of the tax administration. Within the\n            context of the first broad objective, the loan will support:\n            a) strengthening of macro-fiscal planning; b) effective\n            control of sub-national debts and sub-national fiscal\n            discipline; c) improvements in fiscal transparency and\n            reporting; d) capacity building in public debt management\n            and its further institutionalization; and e) market\n            development for government securities. With respect to the\n            second broad objective, the loan will support a tax reform\n            to reduce distortionary effects on the national economy"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Second
