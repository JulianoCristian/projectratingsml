The project showed that absorptive capacity in\n            the institutions being strengthened was a key constraint in\n            the achievement of outcomes. While certain project\n            activities were implemented expeditiously, there was a clear\n            lack of ownership for the project and project activities\n            were not internalized in the institutions being\n            strengthened. A key ingredient for institutional performance\n            and reforms is sustained and committed leadership. Long\n            delays were experienced in the recruitment of staff to\n            technical staff positions that were identified in the\n            Staffing Plan for the restructured Ministry of Environment\n            (MOE) and Central Environmental Authority (CEA). Delays in\n            filling technical staff vacancies and poorly designed\n            consulting inputs due to lack of absorptive capacity in MOE\n            and CEA, resulted in the technical assistance consultancy\n            inputs of EA1P being only marginally effective.\n            Institutional development requires continuous engagement\n            with the client, particularly with regard to the\n            implementation of reforms. Community Environmental\n            Initiatives Facility (CEIF), and Pilot Land Management\n            Component (PLMC) suffered from long delays in disbursement\n            of funds for community activities. Funding delays adversely\n            affected project outcomes as well as a loss in community confidence."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Landa - First Environmental Action

In particular, the project will: support\n            restructuring the Environmental Division (ED) in the\n            Ministry of Transport, Environment and Women's Affairs\n            (MTEWA) for better policy planning and coordination; and\n            strengthen the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) to\n            better carry out its analytical, monitoring, and enforcement\n            responsibilities; support ongoing efforts to integrate\n            environmental considerations in the overall development\n            planning process; and help the government take immediate\n            remedial measures to reverse the trend of environmental\n            degradation through pilot programs involving participatory\n            approaches to environmental management.  The project will\n            comprise three major components:  (1) Institutional\n            Strengthening -restructuring ED within MTEWA to allow it to\n            play a central role in environmental policy, planning and\n            coordination nationally; restructuring and strengthening CEA\n            by establishing and implementing a staff development\n            program; enhancing the Industrial Licensing and Inspection\n            Program; developing environmental codes of practice for\n            small industries; improving   EIA capacity, and\n            strengthening the environmental information system;\n            providing office and technical facilities to accommodate\n            both ED and CEA; and studying linkages between sector and\n            economy-wide policies and the environment including an\n            annual review of the environmental implications of the\n            Public Investment Program (PIP), and further updating the\n            National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP).  (2) Community\n            Environmental Initiatives Facility (CEIF) -which will be\n            established to finance well-planned environmental activities\n            at the grass-roots level within the priority NEAP/PIP.
