The objective of the Credit was to support\n            the Government's program of economic stabilization and\n            structural reform.  The lessons learned are not new or\n            startling; however, they are guided by the set of\n            circumstances that pertain to Azerbaijan. The main lessons\n            from the Rehabilitation Credit are: a) The transition from a\n            command to a competitive and growing market economy is a\n            complex process that takes substantial time and effort to\n            implement. b) Strong commitment on the part of the Borrower\n            is essential to the success of adjustment operations. c) The\n            Bank's contribution is in project design and sharing\n            the lessons of experience as much as in providing financial\n            resources. A closely knit, cohesive core team of national\n            officials with whom Bank staff can work is essential to make\n            the Bank's assistance effective. d) Many of the\n            components of reform programs require technical expertise.\n            e) Now that a resident mission has been established in\n            Azerbaijan, it could take on more of the monitoring and\n            supervision of adjustment lending."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan - Rehabilitation Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Azerbaijan - Rehabilitation\n            Credit
