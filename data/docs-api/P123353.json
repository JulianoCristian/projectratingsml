Both the Bank and the Borrower received\n            satisfactory ratings for their part in the project. The\n            project was restructured to extend the closing date by one\n            year. The extension was necessary to provide the Edo State\n            Government with adequate time for the operation given the\n            delay in national parliamentary approval of Nigeria\u0092s\n            2011/2012 External Borrowing Plan which in turn led to\n            delays in the signing of the credit agreements and\n            declaration of credit effectiveness. The project development\n            objective (PDO) and key outcome indicators remained\n            unchanged. There were several lessons learned from the\n            project and include the following: (1) a key lesson is that\n            the commitment of the State Government to reforms is\n            critical to the success of the state-level subnational\n            development policy operations (DPOs), (2) the use of DPOs at\n            the state level to promote good governance and economic\n            growth is increasingly motivating other state governments in\n            Nigeria to sustain their reform-oriented programs, (3) the\n            existence of complimentary projects with funding for\n            technical assistance supported the implementation of prior\n            actions and enhanced sustainability program reforms, (4) the\n            use of private sector information communication and\n            technology (ICT) experts helped with the speedy\n            implementation of public sector modernization components of\n            the DPO such as the integrated financial management\n            information system (IFMIS) and education management\n            information system (EMIS), and (5) mainstreaming the\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system during program\n            implementation is critical for ensuring effective monitoring\n            of progress being made on key development objective indicators."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - First Edo State Growth and\n            Employment Support Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - First Edo State Growth\n

Growth and\n            Employment Support Credit Program main policy areas\n            supported are: (a) improving the management of public\n            resources in implementing an infrastructure-oriented\n            development strategy by ensuring fiscal sustainability and\n            improving budgeting institutions and practices; (b)\n            improving the institutional and policy environment for\n            growth and employment creation by improving investment\n            climate and the quality of education. A cross-cutting theme\n            running through these policy areas is that of improving\n            social accountability. This program document proposes the\n            first growth and employment support credit to the State of\n            Edo for SDR 48.4 (US$75 million). It will be the first\n            operation in a series of three annual programmatic\n            development policy operations, with a planned total of\n            US$225 million, that are aimed at supporting the\n            Government's policy and institutional reform program in\n            the implementation of the state's medium-term\n            development strategy that is itself focused on growth and\n            employment creation. In spite of progress made in service\n            delivery, challenges still remain, including the need to\n            ensure sustainability of the gains made. The infrastructure\n            development needs still abound with huge financing gaps to\n            be filled. For instance, there are still many schools at\n            various levels of education requiring rehabilitation.\n            Similarly, although work has begun on the master plan of the\n            Benin City storm water drainage system, the financing\n            requirements of its full implementation are immense.\n            Finally, Government systems remain largely weak which\n            threatens the long-term sustainability of progress. Going\n            forward, the Government's overall strategy is to\n            mobilize more resources, including from external sources,\n            and to strengthen systems and institutions for sustained progress."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - First Edo State Growth and\n            Employment Support Credit Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - First Edo State Growth\n
