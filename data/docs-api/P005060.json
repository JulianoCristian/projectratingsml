The performance\n            of the Bank was less than satisfactory. The main lessons\n            learned from the project include: (i) Substantial delays\n            between Board presentation and Loan effectiveness should be\n            taken into account when formulating projects for Egypt; (ii)\n            The implementation of policy changes (total ban on all\n            herbicides for channel maintenance) should not exclude the\n            use of environmental friendly chemicals;  (iii) Transitional\n            problems resulting from the divestiture of Public Excavation\n            Companies (PEC)s should be taken into account and the\n            Borrower should recognize the autonomous status of the PECs;\n            (iv) When project ownership by the Borrower is in doubt and\n            Government policy changes make project objectives\n            unattainable, restructuring should result in a total\n            re-evaluation of the project by the Bank; (v) Financial and\n            contractual aspects, relating to the unit rates for works\n            and length of work contracts, need to be adequate."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt -
