The\n            lessons learned indicate that the project preparation\n            team's willingness to delay project preparation in\n            favor of waiting for the design and consolidation of the\n            incoming administration's education program --Educar\n            Para Vencer-was fundamental for the successful completion of\n            the project. Qualitative analysis in Bahian schools has\n            demonstrated that increased autonomy of schools, through the\n            School Development Plan (PDE), and School Improvement\n            Project (PME) process, has contributed to strengthened\n            institutional capacity in schools and greater community\n            participation in school planning and actions. The Evaluation\n            Agency's Learning Assessment has also helped teachers\n            to evaluate and improve their instruction through the use of\n            continual assessment. The Adaptable Program Loan (APL)\n            approach can be advantageous because of the lower level of\n            financial exposure for the Bank and more flexible sequencing\n            of project activities. Nevertheless, the mechanism may not\n            be the most appropriate for projects with an implementation\n            period under six years, as it has higher preparation cost\n            for the Government and the Bank. The project featured a\n            consistent and reliable monitoring system that has\n            facilitated the evaluation of the project and its separate\n            subcomponents. The careful selection of which activities\n            should carried out in-house and which should be\n            \"contracted-out\" is a key determinant of the\n            project's ability to build institutional capacity and\n            be sustainable. Expanding primary level enrollment to reach\n            the last decile of the school-aged population is often\n            accompanied by a short-term drop in student assessment\n            results and, possibly, an increase in repetition rates."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Bahia Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Bahia Education
