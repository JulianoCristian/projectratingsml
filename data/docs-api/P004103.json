To achieve these medium-term objectives,\n            specific actions will be taken: (i) to save imports\n            (particularly energy-related imports); (ii) to promote\n            exports and improve industrial efficiency through\n            consolidation of investment, further opening of the economy\n            and reducing government intervention; and (iii) to\n            strengthen domestic resource mobilization efforts.
