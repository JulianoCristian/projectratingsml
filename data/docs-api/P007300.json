While the performance of\n            the International Development Association (IDA) is\n            satisfactory overall, Borrower's performance is\n            unsatisfactory. Some key lessons learned are: EdH is not\n            financially viable under the present institutional\n            arrangements because they do not entail sufficient\n            incentives, autonomy, or private involvement. The main cause\n            for EdH's low income is the high level of electricity\n            losses which have steadily grown since the first power\n            project. Failure to achieve the loss-reduction objective was\n            due in part to inadequately preparing a comprehensive\n            program during project preparation. The Staff Appraisal\n            Report should included a political risk analysis whenever\n            the political environment is unstable; this analysis should\n            include the utility's financial projection and base it\n            on historical levels of efficiency. Government support,\n            including use of public force, is essential to ensure that\n            Edh has safe access to neighborhoods and to prevent\n            non-paying customers' from reselling electricity. The\n            lack of adequate maintenance is another crucial issue linked\n            to lacking financial resources. The government has initiated\n            actions to concession EDH to a private company, which should\n            bring in new capital indispensable for expanding the\n            facilities and drastically reducing electricity losses."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti -
