In such circumstances, it would be better to start\n            with a smaller line of credit to test and perfect the\n            mechanism and system for credit delivery and establish a\n            more solid basis for assessing real demand. 2) Although\n            lending through an apex institution provides flexibility in\n            the timing of selecting and qualifying participating banks,\n            the added layer does increase the cost of resources to the\n            participating banks and to the final borrower. Prior to\n            making a decision on an apex institution, one should look\n            carefully at the possibility of lending directly to\n            creditworthy commercial banks. 3) When working with new\n            borrowers and intermediaries, one should simplify subproject\n            appraisal requirement as much as possible and ensure that\n            sufficient hands-on technical support is readily available\n            to assist enterprises and participating banks in putting\n            together subproject proposals. 4) Bank procurement rules are\n            not well-suited to the purchase of banking automation\n            systems, since the rules make it difficult for the borrower\n            to adjust to rapidly changing banking needs and rapidly\n            changing technology."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland -
