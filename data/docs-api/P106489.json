Some\n            lessons learned included: the Bank needs to address more\n            aggressively the issue of governance structures, which can\n            foil project implementation. The Bank should improve its\n            efforts to advertise the benefits of a project to win the\n            support of the general populace. It was reported in the\n            Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) component that one reason\n            for the resistance to the Bank project was that there was\n            not enough understanding of what the project benefits will\n            be, on one hand, compared with too much cynicism spawned by\n            too many failed projects of the past, on the other. During\n            the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR)\n            mission, MOPH made the suggestion to hold workshops for\n            stakeholders to inform them of what the project was\n            attempting to achieve as this will provide the opportunity\n            to lower resistance to reforms. The Bank, like other donors,\n            has often made the erroneous assumption that simply because\n            a piece of policy reform is in the national interest of\n            Lebanon, it will be implemented. In Lebanon, the\n            confessional system of governance and the resulting\n            diffusion of political authority make such reforms subject\n            to collective action, and such collective action is, for the\n            same reasons, far from guaranteed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lebanon - Emergency Social Protection\n            Implementation Support

Emergency Social\n            Protection Implementation Support Project is to accelerate\n            and improve the quality of the implementation of the package\n            of social sector reforms presented by Lebanon at the Paris\n            III donor conference in the areas of social insurance,\n            safety nets, and health expenditures. The project has three\n            main components with the first being the modernization of\n            the social insurance system. This component has four core\n            subcomponents: (a) preparation of a policy framework for\n            social insurance and coverage expansion; (b) improvement of\n            the governance and administration of the NSSF; (c) reforms\n            to guarantee the medium and long terms sustainability of the\n            NSSF; and (d) reforms to strengthen income protection\n            programs (pensions and family allowances). The second\n            component is the strengthening of the social safety nets.\n            These reforms include: (i) institutional strengthening and\n            capacity building for social safety nets and social\n            development; (ii) strengthening protection of the disabled;\n            (iii) safety net programs implementation and service\n            delivery arrangements; and (iv) strengthening the poverty\n            focus of the social safety net programs. Finally the third\n            component is the health sector cost rationalization which\n            will focus on reforms in the Ministry of Public Health and\n            its implementation will be closely coordinated with\n            Component one. Component three focuses on improving on\n            allocation and technical efficiency in health spending"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lebanon - Emergency Social Protection\n            Implementation
