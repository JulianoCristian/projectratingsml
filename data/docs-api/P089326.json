Kiribati was extremely vulnerable to climate\n            change and sea level rise. Sea level rise was also\n            contaminating groundwater in Tarawa, making it unfit for\n            people to drink, increased the potential for epidemics,\n            making it difficult to grow crops, and threatened critical\n            marine ecosystems. Infant mortality from diarrheal diseases\n            in Kiribati was the highest in the Pacific. Kiribati\n            Adaptation Program, Phase II (KAP II) supported by the World\n            Bank and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) has helped\n            identify and pilot adaptation measures to improve coastal\n            protection, freshwater supply, and sustainability for the\n            Pacific island nation of Kiribati. Climate risk\n            considerations have been integrated in key Ministry plans,\n            and the project has helped develop and apply best practices\n            in water resource management and coastal protection.\n            Approximately 0.5 km of sea walls have been built along the\n            main road, over 37,000 mangrove seedlings have been planted\n            and several water management improvements have been carried\n            out, all helping to increase resilience to the effects of\n            climate change for Kiribati\u2019s residents."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Preparation, adaptation and awareness -\n            Kiribati\u2019s climate challenge"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Preparation, adaptation and\n            awareness -
