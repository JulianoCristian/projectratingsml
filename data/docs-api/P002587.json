The main objective of the project was to raise crop\n            yields and production through therehabilitationo f the\n            Gezira irrigated area and its supporting services,t hereby\n            increasingf oreignexchange earnings in line with the\n            Government's overall strategy of achieving better\n            utilization ofexisting capital investments. The main project\n            components included the: (i) improvement of theGezira\n            irrigation, drainage, and pumping systems; (ii)\n            rehabilitation of the infrastructure including roads,\n            cormnunicationn etwork, railway, staff housing and\n            ginneries;( iii) provision of critical inputs such as farm\n            machinery; (iv) improvement of farmer training, research,\n            and extension; and (v) support to improve health through\n            schistosomiasisc ontrol and sanitary systems. The key\n            lessons learned are: Long-term solutions to the canal\n            siltation problem should be found, as the silt inflow into\n            the canals has increased substantially in recent years; (ii)\n            Projects should be adequately designed at appraisal taking\n            into account a more realistic estimate of the capability of\n            the borrower in meeting its financial and production\n            obligations; The number of project components, the diversity\n            of the procurement, and the involvement of many different\n            agencies to implement the project led to both various delays\n            in project start up and implementation. In-service training\n            should focus on relevant and practical short-term courses or\n            studytours rather than on narrow post-graduate degrees;\n            Although measurable cropping increases in yields have been\n            achieved, there is potential to further increase cropping\n            intensities; IDA's timely assumption of some components\n            suspended from financing by AF/SF was very helpful in\n            keeping the project moving and is a valuable lesson for\n            future projects with similar
