Health Sector Services Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Congo Health Sector Services\n            Development Project received a moderately satisfactory\n            outcome with moderate risk to development. Both the Bank and\n            the Borrower received moderately satisfactory ratings for\n            their performances. Component 1 was found to be too\n            ambitious with little design built in. Thus, the objective\n            of the component was changed from \u0091Strengthening leadership\n            capacities of Ministry of Health, Social Services and Family\n            Welfare (MSASF) in managing a functioning and decentralized\n            health system\u0092 to \u0091Access to a package of high priority\n            health services\u0092 aimed at addressing the three health\n            problems that account for the largest share of the burden of\n            disease in the Congo: malaria, maternal and child mortality,\n            and interrupting the transmission of mother to child of the\n            HIV virus. Component 3 would become Component 2 to provide\n            support to new Component 1 and include rehabilitating and\n            equipping of primary health care covered by performance\n            based financing, and safe disposal of biomedical waste in\n            these facilities. Activities under Component 4 were narrowed\n            and put under the new Component 1 and delivered through a\n            performance based financing pilot. Five lessons were learned\n            from this project and are as follows: (1) A preliminary\n            political economy assessment may help identify appropriate\n            institutional frameworks for project coordination. (2) For\n            large-scale, complex projects a dedicated team of\n            professionals must be created for effective implementation.\n            (3) Streamline resources to the beneficiaries. In situations\n            where leadership and coordination remain weak at the central\n            level, efficient and effective interventions that streamline\n            resources to the decentralized level where services are\n            provided to the target population should be introduced. (4)\n            Reliance on significant counterpart and development partner\n            financing can impede achieving project results. (5)\n            Reinforce Monitoring and Evaluation systems through a\n            two-pronged approach can have significant effect."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo - Health Sector Services Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Congo - Health Sector Services\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2014/12/23172727/congo-health-sector-services-development-project","count":"Congo, Republic of","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome,\n            adolescents, allocation of resources, basic needs, basic\n            social services, BCG, birth attendants, blindness, both\n            sexes, burden of disease, Capacity building, Child Health,\n            child health services, child mortality, cholera, citizens,\n            civil war, communicable diseases, communities, Community\n            Health, community participation, Counseling, deaths,\n            Development Objectives, diagnoses, Diphtheria, Disability,\n            districts, drugs, economic status, employment, engineers,\n            epidemic, epidemiological surveillance, equitable access,\n            Essential Health Services, essential medicines,\n            expenditures, Family Health, Family Welfare, Fertility,\n            Fertility Rate, financial control, Financial management,\n            general health system, government capacity, Gross Domestic\n            Product, health care provider, health care providers, health\n            centers, health facilities, health financing, health impact,\n            health information, health information system, health\n            infrastructure, health interventions, Health Management,\n            health needs assessment, health outcomes, health plan,\n            health policy, health problems, health programs, health\n            reforms, Health Results, HEALTH SECTOR, health service,\n            health service delivery, Health Services, health status,\n            Health Strategy, Health system, Health system performance,\n            health system strengthening, health systems, health workers,\n            health workforce, HIV, HIV/AIDS, hospitals, households, HR,\n            Human Immunodeficiency Virus, human resource management,\n            Human Resources, human resources management, illness,\n            immunization, immunization activities, Immunodeficiency,\n            improvements in health, income, indigenous people,\n            Indigenous Peoples, indigenous populations, infant, infant\n            mortality, infant mortality rate, infections, infectious\n            diseases, Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses,\n            integration, intervention, lack of capacity, life\n            expectancy, live births, local capacity, Malaria, Malaria\n            Control, malnutrition, Material resources, Maternal and\n            Child Health, maternal mortality, maternal mortality ratio,\n            measles, medical equipment, medical supplies, Medicines,\n            Ministry of Health, morbidity, mortality, mother, mother to\n            child, National Committee, national government, national\n            level, national objectives, national project, national\n            strategy, neonatal care, number of births, number of\n            children, number of people, Number of persons, number of\n            women, Nutrition, obstetrical care, peace, Pertussis,\n            pharmaceuticals, Pharmacies, policy development, policy\n            formulation, Policy Framework, poor health, Pregnant women,\n            prevalence, prevention activities, Preventive Treatment,\n            primary care, primary education, Primary Health Care,\n            progress, public administration, public health, Public\n            Health administration, public health interventions, public\n            health services, public hospitals, Quality control, quality\n            of care, quality of health, quality of services, quality\n            services, radio, referral systems, rehabilitation,\n            reproductive health, research program, Resettlement, rural\n            areas, sanitation, services for children, skilled birth\n            attendants, skilled health personnel, Social Services, TB,\n            Technical Assistance, technical capacity, television,\n            Tetanus, Therapy, trainings, TSS, Tuberculosis, urban areas,\n            use of health services, vaccination, vulnerable groups,\n            Waste, workers, working conditions"}},"majtheme":"Human development","projn":"CG-Rep.
