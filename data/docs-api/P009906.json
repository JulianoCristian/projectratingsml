The ratings for the India Industrial\n            Pollution Prevention Project were as follows: Outcome was\n            moderately unsatisfactory; sustainability was likely; Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons learned included: 1) The Bank should\n            not go forward with new (even complementary follow-on)\n            projects that attempt to extend and/or replicate previously\n            untested design approaches when there has been insufficient\n            opportunity to monitor, evaluate and learn from the\n            implementation experience and results of the first\n            operation. Adequate monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are\n            also particularly important under these circumstances; 2) to\n            the extent possible the objectives of Bank-supported\n            environment projects should identify upfront the specific\n            outcomes they seek to achieve in terns of improvements in\n            environmental quality; 3) efforts should have been placed in\n            the context of more comprehensive national and local\n            pollution abatement strategies, involving the full range of\n            contributing sectors (in all likelihood including urban\n            sanitation, transport, energy and even agriculture, as well\n            as industry) and suitable actions to address air, water and\n            land degradation problems in a more spatially focused way;\n            4) project environmental outcomes may not have had a\n            significant impact in terns of improving overall ambient air\n            and water quality in the places where these industrial\n            plants are situated; 5) it is impossible to determine the\n            relative priority of addressing industrial, as compared with\n            other, sources of pollution at any particular locality, or\n            more generally. This should, in fact, have been the starting\n            point for Bank involvement in this regard; 6) by not taking\n            an area-based approach to addressing pollution problems, the\n            Bank missed an opportunity to implement one of its own\n            specific recommendations following its assessment of\n            Government of India's Environment Action Program in\n            1995; 7) the approach to industrial pollution management\n            through Industrial Pollution Control Project and Industrial\n            Pollution Prevention Project was also a partial one in that\n            it did not incorporate the full range of instruments which\n            could have potentially been used to achieve pollution\n            prevention and control objectives; and 8) in project\n            extension decisions, development effectiveness\n            considerations should take precedence over internal Bank\n            portfolio quality concerns."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

Excessively broad investment\n            eligibility criteria, poorly designed interest rate\n            covenant, and lack of interest rate subsidy reporting during\n            implementation, contributed to a marginal Bank performance,\n            coupled with the failure to incorporate sludge disposal in\n            subproject design. Regardless of the borrower's\n            satisfactory counterpart funding, inadequate procurement,\n            and project coordination/management practices were\n            nonetheless unsatisfactory. The key lessons convey that\n            institutional strengthening, and technical assistance\n            components, should complement the investment component,\n            along with an agreed implementation program, in place at the\n            preparation stage. In addition, procurement of equipment\n            should be decentralized to beneficiaries, which\n            incidentally, local World Bank offices, have already,\n            delegated these responsibilities accordingly. To ensure\n            effluents sustainability, a model should be developed - to\n            contain pollution - in accordance with adequate design,\n            scope, management, and ownership issues, as well as cost\n            sharing systems. Since environmental credit lines rarely\n            contribute to successful outcomes, well designed technical\n            assistance, and institutional building, should prod\n
