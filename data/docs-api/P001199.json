The project achieved its objectives, its\n            impact on institutional development was substantial,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was highly satisfactory. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, Government\n            commitment and political will are the key elements for\n            success. Second, the project illustrates the merits of\n            setting conditionality in a precise fashion rather than in\n            terms of broad objectives. Third, program implementation\n            highlights the intensive supervision that adjustment\n            programs require, particularly when implementation is drawn\n            out by delayed compliance. Fourth, it may be worthwhile to\n            take a calculated risk by initially going ahead with a\n            restructuring program in the absence of a suitable macro\n            framework if restructured institutions are shielded from the\n            negative impact of an unfavorable macro environment by a\n            conservative, independent, and private management backed by\n            a strong political will to implement reforms, restore market\n            mechanisms, and instill strong regulation and supervision.\n            Finally, Bank privatization should be a Board condition, not\n            a condition for tranche release."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cote
