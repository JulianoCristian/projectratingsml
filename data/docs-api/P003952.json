The key lessons convey, that, after\n            overcoming the administrative difficulties, the inclusion of\n            the standard operating procedures, and, funding mechanisms,\n            contributed to the management decentralization, and, the\n            delivery of training at the provincial level. This was\n            emphasized by the willingness of the private sector, even\n            during recession, to take responsibility in the training of\n            their employees, for, while some resistance from small firms\n            exist towards the concept of cost sharing, most enterprises\n            are willing to accept this model, and contribute to training\n            costs. The experience gained by the Ministry of Manpower\n            under the project was valuable, in that, the new policy\n            initiative extends the use of variations of the cost sharing\n            model to labor market programs, along with decentralized\n            budgeting and provincial control. This decentralization,\n            contributed to the smooth special fund mechanism operation,\n            to be used widely in further projects. However, operating\n            procedures should be developed, and tested, to allow further\n            accountability in performance and the use of funds. Based on\n            this experience, the time frame for these operations, is\n            suggested to be six years, with the provision to include\n            analytical methods for early corrective actions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Skills Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Skills Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/06/728476/indonesia-skills-development-project","projn":"ID-Skills Development -- P003952","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Vocational & Technical Education,Teaching and Learning,Educational Sciences,Tertiary Education,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Education","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99090405492461"},"subsc":"Vocational training,Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Achievement,achievements,attention,cost of\n            training,decentralization,degrees,demonstration,Education\n            Sector,Employment,external efficiency,higher education,Human\n            Development,human resources,Information\n            Systems,instructors,intranet,job training,labor force,Labor\n            Market Information Systems,learning,led,management\n            skills,masters programs,private sector training,private\n            training,programming,programs,public training,self\n            employment,Skills Development,skills training,staff\n            development,staff training,trainees,training\n            centres,training contracts,training costs,Training\n            Funds,training management,training materials,training\n            needs,training of employees,training programmes,training\n            programs,training providers,training services,training\n            systems,university graduates,vocational training,vocational\n            training centres,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"Achievement,achievements,attention,cost of\n            training,decentralization,degrees,demonstration,Education\n            Sector,Employment,external efficiency,higher education,Human\n            Development,human resources,Information\n            Systems,instructors,intranet,job training,labor force,Labor\n            Market Information Systems,learning,led,management\n            skills,masters programs,private sector training,private\n            training,programming,programs,public training,self\n            employment,Skills Development,skills training,staff\n            development,staff training,trainees,training\n            centres,training contracts,training costs,Training\n            Funds,training management,training materials,training\n            needs,training of employees,training programmes,training\n            programs,training providers,training services,training\n            systems,university graduates,vocational training,vocational\n            training centres,workers"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF028194-DEET-LABOR MARKET CONSULTANCY\n            (ALAN ABRAHART),TF028098-UK (ODA) CONSULTANT TRUST FUND,TF028065-CANADIAN CONSLT.
