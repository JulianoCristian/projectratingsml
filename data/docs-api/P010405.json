and 5) monitor and evaluate the\n            project's impact on groundwater tables and agricultural production."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Fordwah Eastern Sadiqia (South)\n            Irrigation and Drainage Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Fordwah Eastern\n            Sadiqia (South) Irrigation and Drainage Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/06/736602/pakistan-fordwah-eastern-sadiqia-south-irrigation-drainage-project","projn":"PK-East.Sadiqia So Phas -- P010405","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Water Resources Law,Water Law,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry,Water Conservation","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961002145854"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adequate water,agricultural\n            production,aquifers,bunds,canals,capillary action,capillary\n            rise,channel,Channels,Conductivity,Conjunctive use,conserve\n            water,construction,crop production,Crop Yields,decision\n            making,deep percolation,Dissolved\n            Solids,ditches,diversion,Drainage System,Drainage\n            Systems,Drains,efficient use of water,Effluent,Effluent\n            Disposal,Environmental\n            Issues,evaporation,export,farmers,Farming,Field Trials,flood\n            damage,flood protection,flooding,floods,Fresh\n            Groundwater,gravel,groundwater resources,groundwater\n            table,high water,high water table,international\n            law,Irrigated Agriculture,Irrigation,irrigation\n            canals,irrigation development,irrigation\n            management,irrigation systems,irrigation water,large\n            dams,local authorities,On-Farm Water\n            Management,permeability,programs,Pumping,pumps,rainfall,reservoirs,rivers,root\n            zone,Salinity,seepage,soil degradation,Soils,springs,storm\n            water,surface drainage,Surface Water,systems,use of\n            water,water allocation,water allocations,Water\n            Availability,water charges,Water Conditions,water\n            conservation,water distribution,Water Management,water\n            management,water needs,Water Sector,Water Supply,water\n            table,water tables,water use,Water Users,watercourses,weirs,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"adequate water,agricultural\n            production,aquifers,bunds,canals,capillary action,capillary\n            rise,channel,Channels,Conductivity,Conjunctive use,conserve\n            water,construction,crop production,Crop Yields,decision\n            making,deep percolation,Dissolved\n            Solids,ditches,diversion,Drainage System,Drainage\n            Systems,Drains,efficient use of water,Effluent,Effluent\n            Disposal,Environmental\n            Issues,evaporation,export,farmers,Farming,Field Trials,flood\n            damage,flood protection,flooding,floods,Fresh\n            Groundwater,gravel,groundwater resources,groundwater\n            table,high water,high water table,international\n            law,Irrigated Agriculture,Irrigation,irrigation\n            canals,irrigation development,irrigation\n            management,irrigation systems,irrigation water,large\n            dams,local authorities,On-Farm Water\n            Management,permeability,programs,Pumping,pumps,rainfall,reservoirs,rivers,root\n            zone,Salinity,seepage,soil degradation,Soils,springs,storm\n            water,surface drainage,Surface Water,systems,use of\n            water,water allocation,water allocations,Water\n            Availability,water charges,Water Conditions,water\n            conservation,water distribution,Water Management,water\n            management,water needs,Water Sector,Water Supply,water\n            table,water tables,water use,Water Users,watercourses,weirs,wells"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF029468-PHRD-NATIONAL DRAINAGE PROGRAM","repnb":"10461"},"facets":{}}}
