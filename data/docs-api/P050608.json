The use of a\n            one-tranche operation provided good support to a pending\n            reform agenda, particularly when, during the last period of\n            an outgoing administration, no compliance with tranche\n            conditions remained for the new government to implement. The\n            lessons indicate that, although the reform program was\n            largely successful, three measures might have improved the\n            implementation, and sustainability of reforms: 1) a stronger\n            public awareness campaign could have been built into the\n            program, to emphasize the rationale for reform, which in\n            turn would have increased public support, particularly in\n            Panama, where interventionist policies, and benefits of\n            competition, and market-oriented policies have had limited\n            acceptance; 2) the Government, with the support of the Bank,\n            should have addressed the needs of poor producers -\n            negatively affected by the trade reform program - by clearly\n            devising a strategy to minimize the transitional impact,\n            while non-competitive farmers should have been encouraged to\n            shift to other economic activities; 3) while the difficulty\n            of reducing the share of public expenditure in an election\n            year could have been foreseen, and adjusted, it is fair to\n            say that realistic fiscal assumptions could have led to\n            better planning, and phasing of subsequent budget cuts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - Public Policy Reform Adjustment\n            Loan

adjustment\n            operation, being built into the financing plan of the\n            ongoing three-year IMF Extended Fund Facility. The project\n            focuses on the various reforms and restructuring of the\n            administration. Firstly, trade reforms are due to boost the\n            economic growth and employment over the long term, with the\n            new tariff structure reducing consumer prices. Secondly, the\n            project examines domestic competition reforms, through the\n            support of the Competition Law. Furthermore, the social\n            security reform will strengthen public sector finances, in\n            addition to improving the equity of social expenditures, and\n            fostering savings and capital market development. The\n            reduction of poverty and inequality is a major concern,\n            being specifically addressed through the implementation of\n            the Poverty Strategy and the corresponding Action Plan. One\n            such action involves the improvement of the existing Poverty\n            Map, through the combination of the Living Standards\n            Measurement Survey (LSMS) and Census data, directly\n            impacting the incidence of public spending."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - Public Policy Reform Adjustment\n            Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Panama -
