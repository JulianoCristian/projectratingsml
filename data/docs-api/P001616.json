of the smallholder farmers\n            in the project areas by increasing productivity and\n            providing some social services. Project components will\n            include: (a) strengthening and expanding extension, training\n            and research activities; (b) assisting with farm planning\n            and the introduction of conservation measures; (c) improving\n            and extending livestock dipping and slaughter facilities and\n            programs; (d) providing marketing facilities and expanding\n            credit activities; (e) providing potable water supplies; and\n            (f) strengthening project management, monitoring and\n            evaluation capacities. MOA will have overall responsibility\n            for project implementation. About 10,500 farm families will\n            benefit directly from the project. The project is subject to\n            some risk from erosion and overcrowding, particularly in\n            Dedza Hills. However, the project's emphasis on land\n            husbandry/conservation, adaptive research and improved\n            extension efforts should minimize the adverse effects of any\n            such

Development\n            Program Project, which will constitute the fourth phase of\n            the National Rural Development Program (NRDP), aims to\n            improve the socio-economic status of the smallholder farmers\n            in the project areas by increasing productivity and\n            providing some social services. Project components will\n            include: (a) strengthening and expanding extension, training\n            and research activities; (b) assisting with farm planning\n            and the introduction of conservation measures; (c) improving\n            and extending livestock dipping and slaughter facilities and\n            programs; (d) providing marketing facilities and expanding\n            credit activities; (e) providing potable water supplies; and\n            (f) strengthening project management, monitoring and\n            evaluation capacities. MOA will have overall responsibility\n            for project implementation. About 10,500 farm families will\n            benefit directly from the project. The project is subject to\n            some risk from erosion and overcrowding, particularly in\n            Dedza Hills. However, the project's emphasis on land\n            husbandry/conservation, adaptive research and improved\n            extension efforts should minimize the adverse effects of any\n            such
