However, sustainability seems unlikely, for it\n            depends on solving two basic conditions - the ongoing war,\n            and macroeconomic imbalances - to allow increased budget\n            allocations for the education sector. Lessons drawn form the\n            project, re-enforce that basic levels of quality education\n            systems will be sustained, as long as Government assures a\n            minimum allocation for education expenditures. Nonetheless,\n            sound decisions were taken by the Government to create\n            motivated teamwork, such as making the Ministry of\n            Education's Department of Planning, responsible for the\n            implementation of the project, creating a sense of\n            ownership, even under stressful circumstances. Furthermore,\n            the government negotiated with the teacher's union, a\n            policy to attract, and retain qualified educational staff,\n            though unfortunately, this policy needs to be enforced, and,\n            the role of the National Institute for Educational Research\n            and Development, in the production of learning materials,\n            needs to be revisited, allowing instead, the efficacy of\n            experienced teachers, in adapting foreign learning\n            materials. Given the country's weak institutional\n            capacity, the two-way demonstration model, targeting quality\n            improvement, and accessibility, was reasonable in that\n            experience was gained by implementation of the model itself."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Angola - First Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Angola - First Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/03/728761/angola-first-education-project","projn":"AO-Education I -- P000042","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Angola","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00040502431719"},"subsc":"Tertiary education,Central government administration,Primary education,Sub-national government administration,Secondary education","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"academic\n            year,Achievement,achievements,addition,basic education,basic\n            education services,basic literacy,classrooms,costs of\n            education,curricula,curriculum,curriculum design,curriculum\n            development,decentralization,demonstration,Development\n            Program,economic growth,economic reforms,education\n            budget,education levels,education reform,education\n            sector,Education System,Educational Management,educational\n            reform,Educational Research,Educational Sciences,effective\n            education,enrollment,enrollment rate,environmental\n            issues,fatigue,girls,gross enrollment,Human\n            Development,Institutional\n            Development,leadership,learning,learning\n            achievement,learning achievements,learning\n            materials,learning opportunities,lecturers,levels of\n            education,library books,Literacy,Mid-Term Review,modular\n            training,numeracy,parents,positive impact,Primary\n            Education,primary schools,Primary Teachers,private\n            education,professors,public sector,pupils,qualified\n            teachers,quality assurance,quality of education,rural\n            areas,school inspection,school\n            management,schools,screening,secondary education,secondary\n            schools,study tours,Teacher,teacher qualifications,teacher\n            training,teaching,teaching materials,teaching\n            practice,teaching staff,tertiary education,textbook\n            distribution,textbooks,trainees,training courses,training\n            programs,universities,urban areas,Vocational Training"},"1":{"cdata!":"academic\n            year,Achievement,achievements,addition,basic education,basic\n            education services,basic literacy,classrooms,costs of\n            education,curricula,curriculum,curriculum design,curriculum\n            development,decentralization,demonstration,Development\n            Program,economic growth,economic reforms,education\n            budget,education levels,education reform,education\n            sector,Education System,Educational Management,educational\n            reform,Educational Research,Educational Sciences,effective\n            education,enrollment,enrollment rate,environmental\n            issues,fatigue,girls,gross enrollment,Human\n            Development,Institutional\n            Development,leadership,learning,learning\n            achievement,learning achievements,learning\n            materials,learning opportunities,lecturers,levels of\n            education,library books,Literacy,Mid-Term Review,modular\n            training,numeracy,parents,positive impact,Primary\n            Education,primary schools,Primary Teachers,private\n            education,professors,public sector,pupils,qualified\n            teachers,quality assurance,quality of education,rural\n            areas,school inspection,school\n            management,schools,screening,secondary education,secondary\n            schools,study tours,Teacher,teacher qualifications,teacher\n            training,teaching,teaching materials,teaching\n            practice,teaching staff,tertiary education,textbook\n            distribution,textbooks,trainees,training courses,training\n            programs,universities,urban areas,Vocational Training"}},"owner":"AFT: HD4 Trust Fund Admin (AFTH4)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF028065-CANADIAN CONSLT.
