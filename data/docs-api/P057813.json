Ratings for the Reform\n            Support Credit Project for Georgia were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the experience of the Judicial Reform\n            Project shows that making the judiciary more independent,\n            effective, adherent to higher ethical standards and\n            professional requires interventions that go beyond\n            rehabilitating infrastructure, using information technology,\n            and educating the public. Establishment of an independent\n            and effective judiciary requires strong political will and\n            continuous commitment of the country authorities, which a\n            Bank operation can only complement, but not substitute for.\n            The experience of SAC3 and Reform Support Credits reiterates\n            that Bank support can be effective in promoting and\n            supporting change when the authorities are ready for reform,\n            but not otherwise. When the authorities are not ready it\n            could be argued that financial support may weaken the need\n            for change and strengthen the capacity to maintain the\n            status quo The experience of the Reform Support Credit shows\n            that simpler rules reduce opportunities for corruption. When\n            the government simplified the rules and streamlined\n            administrative procedures in organizations like the traffic\n            police, customs, and tax administration their staff\n            delivered better services and extorted fewer bribes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Judicial Reform Project; Third\n            Structural Adjustment Credit Project; Reform

Some of the main lessons learned\n            were: this project illustrated, both the Government and the\n            judiciary are the clients or beneficiaries of much of the\n            assistance provided through judicial reform projects. Bank\n            teams must be prepared to negotiate and work with both\n            clients and, most importantly, must be prepared to mediate\n            and arbitrate as necessary between these two branches of\n            government. One key lesson that has emerged from the\n            Bank's first cohort of judicial reform projects is that\n            the paths to judicial independence and reducing corruption\n            in the judiciary remain highly political. Another lesson was\n            that the lack of measurable indicators and baseline\n            information for each project component hindered the Bank\n            team's ability to evaluate

committed to high standards of\n            judicial ethics and capable of efficient, effective dispute\n            resolution. The project supports key interventions to assist\n            in establishing the judiciary as an independent third branch\n            of government. There are six main components. The first,\n            court administration provides technical assistance for case\n            management and court administration procedures and\n            implementation, computerizes appellate courts and district\n            courts and provides personal computer packages for each of\n            75 courts, and funds audio equipment. The second component\n            funds civil works, rebuilding court infrastructure including\n            training facilities. The third and fourth components provide\n            technical assistance and equipment for enforcing court\n            judgments and for drafting legislation. The fifth component\n            sponsors study tours and training. The sixth component\n            supports public information and education, including a\n            communications campaign."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Judicial Reform
