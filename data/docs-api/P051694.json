Key lessons\n            convey that: 1) a national framework for fiscal reform is\n            critical, for initially, specific sector-level reforms were\n            promoted by the federal government, benefiting provincial\n            efforts through fiscal incentives; however, and although the\n            new federal administration did provide a program to support\n            provinces to service their short-term debt, other measures\n            actually hardened the budget constraint, by requiring\n            federal authorization for external borrowing, and linking\n            co-participation transfers, to the overall growth of the\n            economy; 2) tensions between fiscal, and sector reform\n            become exacerbated when fiscal adjustments are not taken\n            up-front, suggesting reform success, and sustainability is\n            more likely in provinces that have already achieved a level\n            of control in their fiscal, and debt situations; 3) given\n            the length of engagement, and political cycles, a more\n            flexible instrument, other than a traditional adjustment\n            operation, might be more appropriate, since the programs had\n            combined policy actions, with longer institutional\n            development activities; 4) project preparation should be\n            guided by social, and institutional assessments, which would\n            garnish public support for reforms, and in the case of San\n            Juan, would have been useful in sustaining reforms across\n            two administrations; and, 5) participatory approaches can\n            facilitate implementation, and support sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Second Provincial Reform Loan\n

Projects will help the Tucuman, Rio Negro, Salta and\n            San Juan provinces to reform and restructure their\n            governments to ensure an efficient and responsive delivery\n            of public services (notably social services) within fiscally\n            sound policies. The loan will be disbursed depending on\n            successful implementation of the following reforms and\n            performance benchmarks: 1) public performance reviews will\n            assess: whether overall fiscal and debt targets were\n            reached, the composition of social sector expenditures, the\n            rationale for new borrowing to refinance old debt and/or to\n            finance priority investment programs, and the economic\n            justification for all large projects; 2) public finance\n            reforms include reestablishing provincial fiscal balance by\n            improving tax collection, reducing current government\n            expenditures - namely civil service reductions, and\n            shrinking provincial debt; 3) selected education reforms\n            include consolidating classes, controlling absenteeism,\n            reducing overhead costs, reconverting public teacher\n            training institutions, and introducing new subsidy systems\n            for private schools; benchmarks include reducing\n            non-essential personnel, improving student-teacher ratios,\n            and shifting personnel expenditures towards investment and\n            other outlays; and 4) selected health reforms include\n            separating provision and financing of public health services\n            by giving hospitals autonomy, implementing new management\n            and payment systems, improving insurance coverage by\n            identifying poor beneficiaries, defining the health package,\n            and legally implementing the new insurance system prior to\n            the last tranche release."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Four Second Provincial Reform\n            Adjustment Loan Projects - Rio
