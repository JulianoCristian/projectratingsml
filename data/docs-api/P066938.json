As a learning and innovation loan,\n            the Project contributed to the enrichment of Mexico's\n            gender work. The project developed methodological elements\n            that were very useful in the discussions on how to\n            mainstream gender equity into public policies in the region;\n            the two models tested developed a set of instruments,\n            manuals, methods, and processing that can be easily adapted\n            and replicated in other countries. The CONVIVE Model showed\n            that incorporating a gender approach can enhance the quality\n            and results of CDD interventions, therefore increasing\n            investment payoffs. The GEM demonstrated that the private\n            sector is willing to incorporate a gender equity approach as\n            a means of corporate responsibility that also has positive\n            results within the firms' labor environment. These two\n            results indicate that there is an opportunity for the Bank\n            to promote self-standing gender equity projects within\n            communities and the private sector with the main objective\n            of creating a new approach, and the behavioral changes\n            required to address gender bias for the establishment of a\n            more inclusive development model. Further lessons highlight\n            the design of tools and techniques are critical factors to\n            mainstream gender; technical assistance that is\n            collaborative, participatory, continuous, and covers the\n            entire women groups' capacity building process, proved\n            effective in strengthening both women's organizations,\n            and their productive projects; gender awareness training,\n            combined with leadership training, allows women and men to\n            address power issues entailed in gender disparities; and,\n            partnerships with the private sector to mainstream gender\n            equity are feasible, provided firms have options to\n            participate and lead the process of change, and receive\n            permanent advice to implement the model from the Project staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
