Some\n            lessons learned included: policy actions should be linked\n            directly with outcomes in support of one or more program\n            objectives based on a reasonable logical framework that is\n            supported to the extent possible with empirical evidence. In\n            the case of education, the policy action consisted of\n            disseminating the results of student achievement tests along\n            with teaching guides, which was also the outcome indicator.\n            There should be an inverse relationship between the level of\n            risk of an operation and the complexity of policy actions.\n            The Bank needs to pay more attention to the political\n            context in order to put in place relevant mitigating\n            mechanisms. While on the one hand, the Bank capacity to\n            directly mitigate political risks is very limited, to the\n            extent that these risks can have budgetary implications and\n            therefore affect the public investment program and pace of\n            program implementation, the Bank should consider mitigating\n            mechanism similar to those used to address macroeconomic risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Development Policy Credit"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nicaragua - Development Policy

single-tranche, stand-alone Development Policy Credit (DPC)\n            for the Republic of Nicaragua. This DPC builds on the\n            recently ended series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits\n            (PRSCs). It is being proposed for strategic reasons to\n            engage the authorities in a continuing policy dialogue and\n            in the interests of maintaining a predictable periodicity in\n            budget support disbursements, while the authorities prepare\n            and consult their up-dated Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS).\n            As indicated in the last PRSP progress report, the\n            authorities intend to strengthen the PRSP in response to\n            what has been perceived as a very slow poverty reduction\n            response to the strategy implemented so far. In particular,\n            the authorities are seeking to deemphasize the privatization\n            agenda, replace the previous 'cluster development\n            strategies' with small and medium enterprise\n            development models, and promote universal access to basic\n            social services by lowering their costs. More generally, the\n            revised strategy puts more emphasis than before on\n            facilitating participation by small and medium producers in\n            the growth process and on maximizing access to\n            opportunities. The policy actions supported under the DPC\n            focus mainly on public sector strengthening, with an\n            emphasis on public sector management and transparency, and\n            on strengthening the efficiency, monitoring and\n            accountability of basic social services. These actions are\n            drawn mainly from the first two of the four thematic areas\n            covered by the common Performance Assessment Matrix (PAM)\n            for joint financing arrangement, which are (i) macroeconomic\n            stability and improvement of public sector and financial\n            management; (ii) promotion of greater social and human\n            capital development; (iii) inclusive economic development;\n            and (iv) strengthen governance and accountability. These\n            four thematic areas are broadly consistent with the focus of\n            International Development Associations (IDA'S) current\n            Country Partnership Strategy (FY08-FY12), whose lending\n            program is anchored in a series of annual budgetary support operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Development Policy Credit
