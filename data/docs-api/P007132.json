Some lessons learned\n            included: in a changing political environment especially in\n            a situation of economic and political turmoil and absence of\n            political protection for reforms, the objective of technical\n            assistance was appropriately limited to facilitating the\n            reform of sector structures and the strengthening of the new\n            structures needed to enhance private participation. The\n            envisioned sector privatization requires a permanent\n            commitment by the Government to reform that extends beyond\n            the scope and duration of the project supporting the\n            technical assistance. Well-articulated public information\n            and communications campaigns are a key to successful sector\n            reforms. These campaigns need to be directed at decision\n            makers as well as stakeholders such as management and\n            employees of state enterprises. Continued consultations need\n            to be maintained with sector entities, groups directly\n            affected by actions to be supported by technical assistance,\n            professional groups, and other shareholders so as to gain\n            their support in the reform process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Public Enterprise Reform Technical\n            Assistance Loan

for the electricity and\n            telecommunications sectors so as to ensure a complete\n            separation of state policy and regulatory functions from\n            commercial activities; 3) establish and/or strengthen the\n            institutions in charge of the policy and regulatory\n            functions which remain with Government; and 4) modify the\n            legal status of the

Project are to\n            support the Government's current efforts to: 1) reduce\n            electricity subsidies in a sustainable way; 2) reform the\n            legal and regulatory framework for the electricity and\n            telecommunications sectors so as to ensure a complete\n            separation of state policy and regulatory functions from\n            commercial activities; 3) establish and/or strengthen the\n            institutions in charge of the policy and regulatory\n            functions which remain with Government; and 4) modify the\n            legal status of the two state enterprises INECEL and EMETEL\n            to prepare them for commercially oriented activity through\n            concessions possibly combined with sale of assets or shares.\n            To meet these objectives, the project will provide the\n            Government with technical assistance in the form of\n            consulting services and training to prepare the necessary\n            legal, regulatory, institutional and sectoral reforms in the\n            electricity and telecommunications sectors; define reform\n            implementation; and prepare the privatization of
