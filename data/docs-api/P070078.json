Some lessons learnt from the project: included\n            1) the need for interagency cooperation at border cross\n            points to sustain changes and promote pragmatic approaches\n            in problem resolution; 2) the multiplying effect of economic\n            returns that come from replicating procedures at pilot\n            sites; 3) the frequent rotation of staff in the General\n            Directorate of Customs that made it difficult for the\n            organization to \"own\" the project, and contributed\n            to project delays; 4) the better results in detecting\n            irregularities that come with customs control; 5) the need\n            for further cooperation and support from government agencies\n            to make the regional website sustainable and successful; 6)\n            designing border inspection facilities as multifunctional so\n            they could be adapted for other uses after their current use\n            becomes no more relevant; 7) the need for the Bank to focus\n            on legitimate security arrangements and anti-terrorism\n            aspects as well as trade facilitation; 8) the fact that\n            project was result-oriented  with measurable indicators\n            contributed to project success; 9) the importance of\n            starting the policy dialogue at the very beginning of the\n            project; and 10) achieving better project results by\n            adopting a regional approach, which creates peer pressure\n            among participating countries and generates competitive\n            spirit and motivation, leading to better performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Trade and Transport Facilitation\n            in Southeast Europe Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Trade and Transport\n            Facilitation in Southeast Europe Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/10/6349898/albania-trade-transport-facilitation-southeast-europe-project","projn":"AL-Trade & Transport Facilitation In\n            South East Europe Project -- P070078","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Trade and Regional Integration,Trade Policy,Customs and Trade,Transport and Trade Logistics,Common Carriers Industry","teratopic":"International Economics and Trade,Transport,Industry","count":"Albania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20051017161308"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Roads and highways","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"International Economics and Trade,Transport,Industry","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"border crossings, cargo, clearance\n            terminals, Customs, Customs administration, customs\n            administrations, Customs area, customs clearance, Customs\n            Code, Customs Component, Customs declarations, Customs\n            Department, Customs duties, Customs environment, Customs\n            Information, Customs inspection, Customs officers, Customs\n            performance, customs procedures, Customs reform, Customs\n            Services, dialogue between Customs, East Europe, Economic\n            Cooperation, economic growth, efficiency of Customs\n            operations, exports, financial capacity, financial\n            resources, financial sector, foreign companies, foreign\n            investors, Foreign Trade, Forwarding, free trade, free trade\n            agreements, freight, Freight Forwarders, harmonization,\n            imported goods, imports, legal frameworks, macroeconomic\n            stability, neighboring countries, oil prices, partner\n            countries, ports, private sector, public sector, Quality\n            Assurance, reduction in tariffs, reform program, regional\n            approach, regional basis, regional cooperation, regional\n            coordination, Regional integration, regional level, regional\n            program, regional Trade, Road Transport, supply chain\n            management, technical assistance, Trade Center, trade\n            community, trade expansion, Trade Facilitation, trade\n            facilitation audits, trade facilitation issues, trading\n            partners, traffic, Transit, transport costs, transport\n            operators, transport sector, Trucks"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF024042-BNPP-TRADE: TRADE AND TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE,TF030454-AUSTRIA GENERAL CTF FY04 - ECA,TF030461-GREECE CTF FY04 - BALKANS,TF037984-ECA REGION - TRADE AND TRANS.
