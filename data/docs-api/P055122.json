The lessons\n            learned included: 1) The support of the central ministries\n            is essential for an operation with the ambition of\n            addressing the most pressing issues in a sector; 2)\n            Supervision of a broad-based sector operation should include\n            a review of budget implementation for the sector and\n            agreement on an updated Medium-Term Expenditure Framework\n            (MTEF) on an annual basis. This was not done for the project\n            under review; 3) Heroic efforts to get things done at the\n            micro level do not bring about expected results if the\n            macroeconomic and governance environment becomes\n            increasingly hostile. At the mid-term review, which took\n            place a month after the portfolio review, the Bank team\n            should have come to the conclusion that continued support to\n            the sector was difficult to justify under the unchanging\n            country circumstances; and 4) In such a challenging and\n            difficult country environment fraught with\n            governance-related issues, the design of projects should be\n            simple and well-targeted."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad - Health Sector Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chad - Health Sector Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/06/8005516/chad-health-sector-support-project","projn":"TD-Health Sector Support Project -- P055122","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Regional Rural Development,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Systems Development & Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Rural Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Chad","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070731134706"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Health,Compulsory health finance","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accessibility,agriculture,basic health\n            services,COMMUNITIES,community groups,community\n            participation,deaths,decentralization,Diphtheria,districts,Doctors,economic\n            development,employment,equipment,Essential\n            Drugs,expenditures,extension,families,family\n            planning,feed,Finances,financial management,food\n            security,free choice,health centers,health\n            communication,health delivery,health expenditure,health\n            expenditures,health facilities,Health for All,Health\n            Policy,Health Sector,Health Services,health status,health\n            system,hospitals,infectious diseases,Integrated Management\n            of Childhood\n            Illnesses,Intervention,isolation,laws,malaria,malnutrition,medical\n            personnel,Medicines,meningitis,midwifes,morbidity,mortality,mothers,NGOs,nurses,paramedics,Partnership,performance\n            indicators,pharmacy,PHO,poverty alleviation,Poverty\n            reduction,pregnant women,primary care,Primary health\n            care,private sector,Public Health,radio,social\n            services,Sustainability,sustainable development,sustainable\n            health care,urban areas,Vaccination,WorkersHealth service\n            delivery;

This will reinforce delivery of minimum, and\n            complementary activities, supporting management, and\n            supervisory capacities, and render those currently\n            under-served health districts, operational; 3) Strengthen\n            health financing, and management in support of the\n            decentralization process. The central level capacity will be\n            reinforced, to design sector reforms, translated into\n            project-targeted areas. Community participation will be\n            developed to achieve cost-recovery, and initiate innovative\n            practices; 4) build the institutional capacity of MOPH,\n            specifically, to support the pharmaceutical, and health\n            communications policies. The AIDS control strategy will be\n            strengthened, by supporting mobilization of civil society,\n            and improving the epidemiological surveillance system, to\n            limit HIV transmission risks; and, 5) assist the government\n            in collecting socio-demographic data to improve, and monitor\n            progress in the health, and population sectors. A health,\n            nutrition, and population survey will be conducted by 2002,\n            envisaged to contribute to the 2003 census."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad - Health Sector Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chad -
