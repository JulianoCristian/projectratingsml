Some important\n            project lessons learned were: (1) On Use of Private Land vs.\n            Public Land. MTSP experience is that purchase acquisition of\n            private land, if available, for the project is more\n            transparent, easier and less troublesome, in the long run.\n            (2) On Technology Choice. The MTSP experience indicates that\n            an assessment of the optimization of the design of the\n            facilities and choice of technology is recommended.\n            Conventional Activated Sludge process might not be the best\n            technology option if the utilization rate remains low for an\n            extended period of time (5-10 years after construction).\n

The local\n            concessionaires, the Manila Water Company Inc. (MWCI) and\n            Maynilad Water Services Inc. (MWSI) were needed to upgrade\n            their piped water supply and sanitation coverage due to\n            expanding franchise areas. To address the challenge, the\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)\n            set out to promote greater private sector participation to\n            improve the sector. IBRD\u2019s involvement in water concessions\n            was based on the rationale that the private sector can play\n            an important role in delivering services. MWCI and IBRD\n            implemented Manila Second Sewerage Project to improve the\n            quality of wastewater and septage management service in\n            Manila and expand MWCI\u2019s sewerage and septage management\n            program. The Manila Third Sewerage Project enhanced septage\n            management, piloted a combined sewer-drainage system\n            approach and promoted advocacy campaigns on the negative\n            environmental impacts of wastewater. Through capital\n            infusion, debt restructuring and infrastructure\n            rehabilitation, both concessionaires managed to accelerate\n            and enhance supply across their franchise areas. MWCI posted\n            a dramatic increase in 24-hour water supply, to 99 percent\n            in 2009 from 26 percent in 1997. MWCI\u2019s investment program\n            reduced the risk of sicknesses from exposure to sewage\n            contamination, which is estimated to have reduced mortality\n            by 20 percent. IBRD has supported two utilities in expanding\n            affordable and efficient water and sewerage services to\n            benefit some 107,000 poor households."},"docna":{"cdata!":"L'eau potable am\u00e9liore la vie de\n            millions de gens \u00e0 Manille"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Potable water improves life for\n            millions in Manila : L'eau potable am\u00e9liore la vie de\n            millions de gens \u00e0 Manille"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2010/03/25158118/potable-water-improves-life-millions-manila-leau-potable-am\u00e9liore-la-vie-de-millions-de-gens-\u00e0-manille","count":"Philippines","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"water, sanitation, finance, project, management"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Human development,Environment and natural resource management,Public sector governance","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agua potable mejora la vida de millones\n            en Manila"}},"topic":"Hygiene Promotion m1326501 147,Water Quality Standards m1327118 1215,Water Safety Plans m1326749 2007,PPP in Water Supply and Sanitation\n            m1326748 2006,Sanitation Technologies m1326886 2003","projn":"PH-Lgu Urban Water And Sanitation Project\n            Apl2 -- P069491,PH-Manila Second Sewerage Project -- P004611,PH-Manila Third Sewerage Project -- P079661,PH-Gef-Manila Third Sewerage Project -- P089082","subtopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation Economics,Water Supply and Systems,Water Treatment & Quality,Water Supply and Sanitation Finance,Water Supply and Sanitation Participation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b083149068_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia"}},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","theme":"Pollution management and environmental health,Water resource management,Other urban development,Municipal governance and institution building,Pollution management and environmental health,Urban services and housing for the poor,Other human development,Environmental policies and institutions,Other public sector governance,Pollution management and environmental health,Water resource management,Municipal finance,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Other financial and private sector development,Municipal governance and institution building,Other urban development","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation","prdln":"IBRD/IDA,Global Environment Project","topicv3":"Hygiene Promotion m1326501 147,Water Quality Standards m1327118 1215,Water Safety Plans m1326749 2007,PPP in Water Supply and Sanitation\n            m1326748 2006,Sanitation Technologies m1326886 2003","owner":"Water - GP (GWADR)","trustfund":"TF020930-NEW ZEALAND CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF038593-PHILIPPINES - SUPERVISION OF\n            MANILA 2ND SEWERAGE PROJECT,TF040953-PHILIPPINES: MANILA SECOND\n            SEWERAGE PROJECT,TF022523-PHRD-MANILA SECOND SEWERAGE PROJECT,TF029265-PHRD-MANILA WATER &\n            SEWERAGE PROJ.,TF033718-PHILIPPINES - MANILA 2ND\n            SEWERAGE PROJ.,TF053321-PHRD-PHILIPPINES: MANILA THIRD\n            SEWERAGE PROJECT,TF055660-GEF PDF B-PHILIPPINES: MANILA\n            THIRD SEWERAGE PROJECT (MTSP) - BANK EXEC,TF055659-GEF PDF B-PHILIPPINES: MANILA\n            THIRD SEWERAGE PROJECT (MTSP),TF057296-GEF FSP - MANILA THIRD SEWERAGE PROJECT,TF040023-PHILIPPINES - LGU URBAN WATER\n            AND SANITATION PROJECT APL2,TF025857-PHRD-PROG.
