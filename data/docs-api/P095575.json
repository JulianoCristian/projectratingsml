Some lessons learned\n            includes: in the case of Sierra Leone the Governance Reform\n            and Growth (GRG) series helped to consolidate and entrench\n            the local councils which were re-established after a 30 year\n            absence. This resulted from a strong shared understanding\n            between Government and many external stakeholders about the\n            importance of re-establishing government presence around the\n            country, and the role that the lack of such a government\n            presence played in the conflict. For a post-conflict country\n            in a fragile, state-building process, the benefits of a\n            programmatic approach to policy operations are likely to\n            outweigh the risks, particularly the opportunity to\n            revaluate progress before each successive operation, if the\n            timing of the approval process of donors for budget support\n            is not well aligned with the government's budgetary\n            process, the program support for poverty reduction risks\n            shortfalls due to uncertainty in funding. Embedding policy\n            reforms in the Government's reform agenda instills\n            greater government ownership of the program, diminishing the\n            risk of delays or shortcomings in achieving objectives. For\n            an operation that involves coordinating actions in several\n            sectors, outside the authority of the main implementing\n            agency, the achievement of targets is more likely if\n            disaggregated into a set of measurable indicators with\n            clearly-defined administrative responsibilities in a given\n            ministry, department or agency. In a country short of\n            management capacity, a detailed Monitoring and Evaluation (M\n            and E) framework is not likely to be sustainable without\n            intensive donor inputs and supervision. Also the requirement\n            for monthly reports to be provided by the Ministry of\n            Finance may have been onerous and excessive, discouraging\n            any reporting."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Programmatic Governance\n            Reform and Growth Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sierra Leone - Programmatic\n            Governance
