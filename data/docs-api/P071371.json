Some lessons learned\n            included: adoption of a fast track preparatory process has\n            hidden costs that cannot be discounted. The extensive effort\n            needed over the first few years of the project period\n            essentially to complete preparation of core inputs required\n            for actual project execution significantly slowed\n            implementation and disbursements and ultimately contributed\n            to the need to extend the MAOP closing date by almost two\n            years. The risks to implementation from capacity weaknesses,\n            particularly pervasive shortages of skilled professionals,\n            can be and indeed were in Burundi significantly\n            underestimated during project preparation. These shortages\n            presented major obstacles to effective, efficient project\n            implementation. Tackling major, widespread human resource\n            constraints may be best done cross-sectorally rather than on\n            a sector-by-sector basis since the underlying dynamics of\n            low morale and high turnover among civil servants tend to be\n            common across public sector entities. High turnover of Bank\n            Task Team Leaders (TTLs) presents a major obstacle smooth\n            project implementation. The five TTLs over the MAOP life led\n            to serious shortfalls in project performance, monitoring,\n            and reporting. Continuity of Bank project leadership,\n            particularly in challenging operational environments is\n            essential. Similarly, having two executive secretaries at\n            the National AIDS Council (NAC) was disruptive. In such\n            circumstances, increased attention must also be given to\n            identifying alternative approaches to attract and retain\n            project managers in executing agencies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Control and\n            Orphans Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi - Multisectoral HIV/AIDS\n            Control and

Based on the analysis, this biomedical waste\n            management plan suggest recommendations as follows.\n            Legislation on medical, and biomedical waste management\n            needs to be established, implemented, and enforced,\n            regulated by waste management committees at the national,\n            provincial, and municipal levels, with communal\n            participation. In addition, hospitals and health care\n            facilities should establish their own medical waste plans in\n            compliance with the country's laws, and regulations, in\n            order to set a governing institutional framework. Medical\n            personnel should be trained in the management of the overall\n            medical waste sector, and in addition, training should be\n            further provided to staff members in charge of the\n            institution's cleaning, and waste management practices.\n            Public awareness should be raised, through community\n            mobilization, and active participation of civil society, the\n            private sector, organizations in general, and policymakers\n            in particular, on the adequate management of biomedical\n            wastes. Most importantly, electrical incinerators should\n            replace existing ones, based on standard sanitary\n            regulations, but to be later phased-out, and replaced by new\n            waste treatment technologies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi -
