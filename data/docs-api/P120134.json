Government of Mexico (GOM) has\n            requested an Adaptation to Climate Change in the Water\n            Sector Development Policy Loan (DPL) Program in the amount\n            of US$450 million to be presented to the Board for its\n            approval by the end of Fiscal Year 2010. The DPL will\n            support government priorities established in the climate\n            change adaptation and water sector agenda. Mexico has\n            emerged as a global climate change leader and is moving\n            quickly to prepare mitigation and adaptation policies to\n            tackle the most pressing issues that affect the\n            country's main economic sectors. Mexico's role as\n            a leader will be in the spotlight during the Sixteenth\n            Conference of the Parties (COP 16), to be held in Mexico at\n            the end of 2010. The operation represents a further step in\n            the country's engagement in climate change and its\n            impact on the hydrological cycle, a process that is expected\n            to intensify over the course of this century. This operation\n            supports the strengthening of the institutional, normative,\n            regulatory and financial frameworks as a means to foster\n            adaptation to climate change in the water sector. Measures\n            and tools whose aim is to ensure water security through\n            proper regulations, norms, institutional reforms and\n            financial mechanisms are key to addressing
