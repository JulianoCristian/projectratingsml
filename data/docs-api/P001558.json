The project did not achieve its\n            original aim, but did contribute to lay the foundations for\n            reform, mainly a draft new legal framework for a privatized\n            sector. The Bank de facto unilaterally changed the\n            project's scope in terms of reform and pressed the\n            government for more radical transformations. The main lesson\n            learned is that the Bank should have either maintained the\n            original objectives promoting the project with patience, or\n            acted more decisively to restructure the project once it\n            changed its position on reform. If the infrastructure\n            components had been cancelled the project could have instead\n            supported investments for which public financing was\n            justified in support of the privatization process. Project\n            sustainability in terms of legal reform is uncertain,\n            because the process is still ongoing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Petroleum Sector Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Madagascar -
