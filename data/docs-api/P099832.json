Some\n            lessons learned includes: a three-year emergency project is\n            appropriate for quickly building some surveillance,\n            diagnosis, and response capacity to rapidly tackle an\n            immediate threat but is unsuited to a deepening and\n            broadening of institutional capacity for more systemic\n            reforms. An alternative would have been to launch a quick\n            emergency project followed by an overlapping longer term\n            institutional reform and capacity building project with the\n            broader animal disease focus designed in a more measured\n            way. In projects aimed at preventing or preparing for a\n            potential disease threat with an uncertain probability and\n            magnitude of impact, the results frameworks need to\n            anticipate how 'success' will be measured both in\n            the event that the anticipated threat materializes and in\n            the event that it does not. Failure to effectively manage\n            communications can lead to unproductive panic, insufficient\n            public knowledge, and erosion of faith in public\n            authorities. In the case of this project, while the early\n            crisis awareness materials themselves were generally well\n            conceived, there were some unexpected responses and some\n            lessons. Carefully designed, timed and targeted public\n            communication following established protocols and\n            communication principles, drawing on professional\n            communications skills, is likely to facilitate emergency\n            response when there is little time to plan. There is an\n            established science of communications that can be locally\n            adapted and tested to ensure communications readiness and to\n            develop national and sectoral strategies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Avian Influenza Preparedness Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Armenia - Avian Influenza\n            Preparedness

Influenza\n            Preparedness Project is to minimize the threat in Armenia\n            posed by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection\n            as well as other livestock diseases and to prepare for the\n            control and response to an influenza pandemic and other\n            zoonotic or infectious disease emergencies in humans. The\n            risk of avian influenza remains an ongoing concern but\n            recent outbreaks of African Swine Fever (ASF) and concurrent\n            zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis are deemed to be of\n            equal relevance and are now a high priority for the\n            government. This paper is based on a formal request from the\n            minister of agriculture indicating the pressing need to\n            broaden the scope of the project to cover other animal and\n            public health issues. The ongoing epidemic of ASF, which\n            began in April, 2007, is causing substantial economic losses\n            affecting the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and the\n            incomes of medium sized swine enterprises. The required\n            changes in the project essentially involve a revision to the\n            project's development objectives to allow the project\n            to encompass some of these other pressing issues yet\n            preserve the integrity of the original project design\n            related to avian influenza. Many of the project activities\n            that are intended to control avian influenza are also\n            effective approaches for the prevention and control of other\n            animal diseases of public health concern. These activities\n            include disease surveillance, information systems,\n            compensation funds, communication, etc."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Avian Influenza Preparedness\n

control and response to an influenza pandemic, and other\n            infectious disease emergencies in humans. The first\n            component - animal health - will support activities on\n            prevention, control, and eradication of the HPAI; the second\n            component - human health - will focus on activities to\n            reduce the impact of HPAI, building an effective national\n            public health response strategy, within an enabling\n            environment, to include the necessary resources, responsive\n            to nationwide scale, through proven interventions. The\n            public awareness and implementation support component, will\n            support and provide information and communication\n            activities, to increase awareness, and commitment by the\n            government, private sector, and civil society organizations,\n            in order to strengthen the understanding among the general\n            population about the risk and impact of a potential\n            pandemic. Finally, the fourth component - support to\n            critical imports - would finance, under Emergency Recovery\n            Assistance (ERA) procedures, a positive list of critically\n
