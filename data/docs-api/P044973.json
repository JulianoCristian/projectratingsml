Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            that of the borrower moderately satisfactory (again\n            reflecting EdL's poor financial performance). The risk\n            to development outcome is modest since measures implemented\n            toward the end of, and  subsequent to, project completion\n            have addressed the financial sustainability issue, and\n            technical issues are being addressed under the follow-on\n            Rural Electrification Project. The main lessons from this\n            review are as follows: (i) the consumers are willing to pay\n            tariffs at cost recovery levels, and the willingness to pay\n            analysis shows that consumers are willing to pay for\n            electricity at levels exceeding supply costs. Lao PDR has\n            been able to implement sizeable tariff increases in a short\n            space of time with no adverse social impact or notable\n            demand reductions (indeed it can be argued that any\n            reduction in usage by already connected customers would help\n            extend supply to new locations); (ii) but poorer households\n            remain unconnected, even after the grid has been in a\n            village for more than 10 years, some 20 percent of\n            households remain unconnected. Smart (i.e. efficiently\n            targeted) connection subsidies for late connectors will help\n            achieve government's 90 percent coverage target; and\n            (iii) explicit attention needs to be paid to technical\n            efficiency, and technical problems of system losses and\n            outages reduce financial performance and undermine project\n            benefits. Explicit components are needed to tackle such issues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lao - Southern Provinces Rural\n            Electrification Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lao - Southern

However, problems (which largely arose due to the\n            position of the Off-Grid Promotion Support Office (OPS) as a\n            government office) such as delay in centralized procurement,\n            lack of effectiveness in management of non-performing\n            Provincial Electricity Services Companies (PESCOs), could be\n            overcome by contracting out the OPS' daily operational\n            functions for the off-grid program. Moreover, financially,\n            through the off-grid component, it has been found that the\n            private sector in Lao PDR is unwilling to make long-term\n            capital investments, although it will contribute working capital."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lao -
