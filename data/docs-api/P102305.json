Some lessons learned included: the\n            project design and scope should have been simpler by better\n            balancing technical content against the limited local\n            implementation capacity and tailoring the design\n            accordingly. Bank and Borrower implementation performance\n            can be substantially improved by a simpler project design,\n            earlier institution of better Monitoring and Evaluation (M\n            and E) quality, better cognizance of matching project funds\n            and activities to already ongoing donor activities, quicker\n            government action to recruit partner organization, if\n            necessary for project implementation, and speedy\n            internalization of incremental budgets associated with\n            upgraded avian flu containment activities. Care should be\n            taken to explicitly include all relevant agencies as\n            implementing partners. Inadequate poultry farm biosecurity\n            is the paramount constraint in containing avian influenza in\n            Bangladesh, which should have been recognized during project\n            preparation. Public awareness messaging is expensive and\n            should be shifted from sole government financing to\n            Public-Private Partnership (PPP) arrangements with private\n            sector business stakeholders, under which the costs of\n            circulating messages is borne as part of the goodwill\n            advertising by businesses (i.e., poultry feed and drug\n            companies, breeder farms and hatcheries). Risk-based\n            epidemiology capacity should be developed quickly, so that\n            the costs of disease control strategies becomes focused on\n            the least-cost analysis of high risk areas, thereby limiting\n            human physical resource costs whilst making interventions\n            more effective and sustainable. Speeding up procurement in\n            Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) emergency\n            operations needs full readiness for implementation prior to\n            negotiation, greater Borrower cooperation, and more\n            intensive Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) training. Limit\n            the \"sticker shock\" of incremental operating and\n            maintenance costs from upgraded laboratory and surveillance\n            systems by a gradual, proportional shift from project to\n            government funding during the project's lifespan,\n            leading to full government financing by end of project.\n            Emergency operations must be implemented as avian flu is a\n            rapidly spreading infection."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Avian Influenza Preparedness\n            and Response

threat posed by\n            highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) to humans in\n            Bangladesh by controlling such infections in domestic\n            poultry, and preparing for, controlling, and responding to\n            possible human infections, especially an influenza epidemic\n            and related emergencies. This objective will be achieved\n            through three types of interventions: (i) prevention; (ii)\n            preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and\n            containment. The project has three components: (i) animal\n            health, which concentrates on enhancing prevention and\n            preparedness, strengthening disease surveillance and\n            diagnostic capacity, strengthening control programs,\n            improving biosecurity, providing support for surveillance o\n            f migratory birds and establishing a contingency fund; (ii)\n

traders,\n            poultry processors and other stakeholders dealing with\n            poultry, by improving public awareness and information about\n            the HPAI; and finally (iii)
