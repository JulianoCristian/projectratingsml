The Bank was most helpful in exploring\n            various avenues for rescuing the project from total\n            collapse. The Bank also showed realism and flexibility in\n            readjusting the financing categories and disbursement\n            percentages in light of the project's implementation\n            experience. The main strength of the Borrower's\n            performance on this project was that it was quite flexible\n            on many issues and was prepared to change its position even\n            after holding it for a long period. The lessons learned are\n            (a) Sound agronomic conditions do not necessarily ensure\n            success of an agricultural project; appropriate pricing and\n            marketing arrangements are also essential. (b) Smallholder\n            investment is socially desirable but fraught with risks,\n            particularly if the farmers lacked motivation, investments\n            have a long gestation period and incentive prices offered\n            are inadequate. (c) A project with a modest but successful\n            beginning has a better prospect in the long-run, than one\n            with an ambitious beginning which raises the risks. Without\n            assurance of counterpart funding and its timely release, a\n            project is doomed from the start to falter and fail. Many of\n            the conceptual problems concerning this Project could,\n            perhaps, have been resolved earlier if general educators had\n            participated sooner in project supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Liberia - Decoris Oil Palm Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Liberia - Decoris Oil Palm Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1991/05/736047/liberia-decoris-oil-palm-project","projn":"LR-Oil Palm -- P001434","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,General Technology,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"Liberia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960924221918"},"subsc":"(Historic)Perennial crops","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            households,agricultural production,Agriculture,Bank\n            loans,cocoa,coconuts,coffee,crop,crop\n            production,crops,cultivation,debt,development\n            projects,development strategy,ecological conditions,economic\n            circumstances,economic growth,economic impact,Economic Rate\n            of\n            Return,employment,equipment,expenditures,exports,extension,extension\n            services,farm,farm\n            practices,farmer,farmers,farming,farms,financial\n            management,forest products,forestry,Fresh\n            Fruit,fruits,GDP,harvesters,husbandry,income,income\n            levels,incomes,living conditions,Marketing,mines,Oil,Oil\n            Palm,oil prices,palm oil,palm oil prices,Palm\n            Products,plantations,planting,private\n            sector,Produce,productivity,rice,rural\n            development,seeds,Soils,sugarcane,sunk costs,technical\n            assistance,Total Costs,tree crops,trees,wages,yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            households,agricultural production,Agriculture,Bank\n            loans,cocoa,coconuts,coffee,crop,crop\n            production,crops,cultivation,debt,development\n            projects,development strategy,ecological conditions,economic\n            circumstances,economic growth,economic impact,Economic Rate\n            of\n            Return,employment,equipment,expenditures,exports,extension,extension\n            services,farm,farm\n            practices,farmer,farmers,farming,farms,financial\n            management,forest products,forestry,Fresh\n            Fruit,fruits,GDP,harvesters,husbandry,income,income\n            levels,incomes,living conditions,Marketing,mines,Oil,Oil\n            Palm,oil prices,palm oil,palm oil prices,Palm\n            Products,plantations,planting,private\n            sector,Produce,productivity,rice,rural\n            development,seeds,Soils,sugarcane,sunk costs,technical\n            assistance,Total Costs,tree crops,trees,wages,yields"}},"owner":"AFC","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"9572"},"723816":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1979/10/723816/liberia-decoris-oil-palm-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1979/10/723816/liberia-decoris-oil-palm-project","new_url":"1979/10/723816/liberia-decoris-oil-palm-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/12/13/000178830_98101902334526/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/12/13/000178830_98101902334526/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"1765","datestored":"2000-12-13T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1979-10-31T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Liberia - Decoris Oil Palm Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project would help expand and\n            diversify the country's export base, provide\n            employment, increase the income levels of rural families,\n            and strengthen the institutional capability of the country\n            for the development of the oil palm sub-sector.

The\n            project faces no unusual risks, but the success of the\n            institution building program under the project would depend\n            on the ability of the government and DOPC to recruit, train\n            and retain competent Liberians."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Liberia - Decoris Oil Palm Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Liberia - Decoris Oil Palm Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1979/09/726537/liberia-decoris-oil-palm-project","projn":"LR-Oil Palm -- P001434","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Wetlands,Agricultural Research,Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Environment,Agriculture,Water Resources","count":"Liberia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912455919"},"subsc":"(Historic)Perennial crops","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Agriculture,Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ADB,African Development Bank,agricultural\n            development,agricultural households,agricultural\n            inputs,AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION,Agriculture,annual\n            crops,Audits,Average annual rainfall,Average yields,balance\n            of payments,cash\n            crops,cassava,cattle,climate,cocoa,coconut,coconut\n            industry,coconuts,coffee,crop,crop production,crop\n            products,Cultivation,Cultivation Techniques,development\n            projects,drainage,drainage systems,dry season,Economic\n            Development,economic\n            growth,employment,equipment,Exploitation,extension,Farm,Farmer,farming,Farming\n            Systems,farms,fertilizers,food crops,forest\n            products,forestry,forests,Fresh Fruit,fruit\n            trees,fruits,gardens,GNP,Gross National\n            Product,harvesting,housing,income,Income\n            distribution,incomes,infrastructure investments,labor\n            force,labor inputs,Lands,Livestock,Livestock\n            development,living\n            conditions,logging,Marketing,Mines,nurseries,Oil\n            Palm,overhead costs,Palm Oil,palm oil production,Palm\n            Products,perennial\n            crops,plantation,plantations,planting,Population\n            growth,private property,private\n            sector,Produce,producers,productivity,Rice,rice\n            production,Rural\n            Development,seed,seedlings,seeds,sheep,shifting\n            cultivation,small farmers,soil\n            surveys,Soils,streams,Sugar,sugar cane,swamps,tree crops,trees,Vegetation,wages,weeds,Yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"ADB,African Development Bank,agricultural\n            development,agricultural households,agricultural\n            inputs,AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION,Agriculture,annual\n            crops,Audits,Average annual rainfall,Average yields,balance\n            of payments,cash\n            crops,cassava,cattle,climate,cocoa,coconut,coconut\n            industry,coconuts,coffee,crop,crop production,crop\n            products,Cultivation,Cultivation Techniques,development\n            projects,drainage,drainage systems,dry season,Economic\n            Development,economic\n            growth,employment,equipment,Exploitation,extension,Farm,Farmer,farming,Farming\n            Systems,farms,fertilizers,food crops,forest\n            products,forestry,forests,Fresh Fruit,fruit\n            trees,fruits,gardens,GNP,Gross National\n            Product,harvesting,housing,income,Income\n            distribution,incomes,infrastructure investments,labor\n            force,labor inputs,Lands,Livestock,Livestock\n            development,living\n            conditions,logging,Marketing,Mines,nurseries,Oil\n            Palm,overhead costs,Palm Oil,palm oil production,Palm\n            Products,perennial\n            crops,plantation,plantations,planting,Population\n            growth,private property,private\n            sector,Produce,producers,productivity,Rice,rice\n            production,Rural\n            Development,seed,seedlings,seeds,sheep,shifting\n            cultivation,small farmers,soil\n            surveys,Soils,streams,Sugar,sugar cane,swamps,tree crops,trees,Vegetation,wages,weeds,Yields"}},"owner":"Country Director Groups","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"2526"},"facets":{}}}
