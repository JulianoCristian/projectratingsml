Some lessons learned included: land projects\n            tend to be long and complex and require a great deal of\n            patience and preparation. This project was envisioned as a\n            nine-year long project and was completed with a ten-month\n            extension. The Bank needs to take a long term vision of\n            engagement and work with the client to reach the mutually\n            agreed goals despite the many hardships that emerge. The\n            Bank should not rely on the promise of political reform\n            alone but engage with governments only once their commitment\n            to the reform agenda has been proven. In case the political\n            commitment to reform remains unproven, the Bank should\n            design projects that are flexible and can work around the\n            existing, somewhat unstable, political economy conditions in\n            the country. The lack of clarity and reliance on subjective\n            targets and indicators make it difficult to assess project\n            progress and allows people to rely on the more formulaic\n            institutional indicators that may not fully capture the\n            impact that a project is having. In terms of promoting legal\n            or institutional reforms in Ukraine, the Bank should look at\n            all its instruments as a set of tools that can be used but\n            requiring that the structure is in place prior to project\n            implementation may be a more reasonable solution. The role\n            of the independent quality assurance contractor is important\n            to ensure that the system is fully documented and to\n            encourage the local team to introduce international\n            standards for version control, testing, and system maintenance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - Rural Land Titling and Cadastre\n            Development

The SLCC have been unable to\n            undertake this work because of resistance from the Ministry\n            of Justice and it has now been agreed that resolution of the\n            differences between the institutions is highly unlikely and\n            that the project outcomes relating to this part can not be\n            met. The project also included a part on farm restructuring\n            that has seen little progress and is no longer required.\n            Other parts of the project are progressing satisfactorily.\n            The project restructuring is necessary in order to amend the\n            project development objective, revise the project outcomes\n            and reallocate resources to ensure that land titling and\n            cadastre systems in rural areas function effectively. This\n            also entails cancellation of the sub-loan agreement between\n            the government and the SLCC and cancellation of the project\n            agreement between Industrial Bank for Reconstruction and\n            Development (IBRD) and the SLCC."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - Rural Land Titling and Cadastre\n            System Development Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ukraine - Rural Land Titling and\n            Cadastre System Development Project : restructuring"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/11/10034848/ukraine-rural-land-titling-cadastre-system-development-project-restructuring","projn":"UA-Rural Land Titling & Cadastre\n            Development Project -- P035777","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Access to Finance,Environmental Economics & Policies,Housing & Human Habitats,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Debt Markets","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Environment","count":"Ukraine","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20081119022154"},"theme":"Legal institutions for a market economy,State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization,Rural markets,Personal and property rights","subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Environment","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"advisory services, Bank management, Bank\n            Policies, beneficiary, Borrower, business development,\n            CADASTRE, CADASTRE SYSTEM, cadastre systems, deeds,\n            description, disbursements, economic efficiency,\n            Environmental, equipment, existing contracts, expenditures,\n            farm enterprises, farms, government support, ID, immovable\n            property, income, institutional arrangements, institutional\n            development, intervention, investor confidence, issuance,\n            land assets, land issues, land markets, land parcel, land\n            parcels, land registration, Land Resources, land rights,\n            land titles, LAND TITLING, land use, leasing, legal\n            framework, legislation, liquidity, Loan, loan agreement,\n            loan amount, loan proceeds, negotiations, operating costs,\n            pension, pensions, Private Property, privatization,\n            procurement, procurement plan, property markets, property\n            rights, real property, registration fees, registration\n            system, registry system, return, return on investments, Risk\n            Mitigation, rural areas, safety, safety net, self-financing,\n            social costs, title, title registration, title registration\n            system, transaction, transaction costs, urban areas,\n            vulnerable groups, withdrawal"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF025449-PHRD-HEALTH SECTOR\n            RESTRUCTURING PROJ.,TF029537-PHRD-TITLE REGISTRATION PROJECT,TF034032-UKRAINE - AGRICULTURE,TF034354-UKRAINE - NATIONAL TITLE\n            REGISTRATION PROJECT,TF036049-UKRAINE - TITLE REGISTRATION PROJECT,TF038444-UKRAINE:  TITLE REGISTRATION\n            & LAND REGISTRATION PROJECTS,TF040887-UKRAINE: RURAL LAND TITLING PROJECT,TF040898-UKRAINE: RURAL LAND TITLING PROJECT","majtheme":"Rural development,Financial and private sector development,Rule of law","repnb":"46377"},"facets":{}}}
