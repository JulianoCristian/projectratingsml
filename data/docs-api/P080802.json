Some lessons learned included: a key\n            recommendation for future project design is to avoid\n            subsuming a broad range of objectives and sectors under the\n            umbrella of a single emergency project. It is more effective\n            to focus projects on specific sectors and activities that\n            are directly related to the immediate reconstruction\n            efforts. Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL) may not be the most\n            appropriate lending instrument for 'softer' or\n            longer term interventions such as disaster preparedness and\n            prevention since ERLs are typically designed for a three\n            year project implementation period. Economic recovery\n            initiatives are best formulated under a separate project\n            with clear and measurable employment, income, and\n            empowerment outcome/impact indicators. Incompatibilities\n            must be resolved up front in dealing with bidding and\n            contract regulation mechanisms in countries where they are\n            different from those of the World Bank. Emergency\n            reconstruction projects of this nature should have a\n            monitoring and evaluation system in place upfront with\n            mechanism to track core performance indicators. Community\n            participation in identifying sub-projects is essential. Many\n            of the EERP subprojects were identified and implemented with\n            very limited consideration given to this aspect, for\n            example, in some cases subprojects were contrary to local\n            priorities bringing public dissatisfaction, conflicts and delay."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran - Earthquake Emergency Response

potable water, storm water\n            drains, and drainage systems. There will be anticipated\n            impacts, and mitigating measures. During construction, the\n            total closure of roads should be avoided and single line\n            traffic maintained wherever possible. Where existing\n            services such as water, sewerage, electricity and telephone\n            lines have to be temporarily disconnected, the period of\n            disconnection should be kept to a minimum. Heavy transport\n            and equipment activity should be restricted to normal\n            working hours. The development of new water sources must be\n            linked to the availability of resources without derogation\n            of existing supplies. For new boreholes, a survey of\n            adjacent wells must be undertaken and data on ground water\n            levels, pumping rates and water quality collected. All new\n            boreholes will be subjected to test pumping on completion,\n            at a discharge rate greater than that at which they will be\n            expected to operate. Wastewater sub-projects require\n            particular attention to the disposal of raw sewage flows.\n            Where this is to a regional trunk collector, the capacity of\n            the pipeline to take the increased flows must be\n            established. Where sewage is ultimately discharged to a\n            treatment works, its capacity must be adequate to take the\n            additional flows. The generation of dust and exhaust fumes\n            should be kept to a minimum. Access and haul roads should be\n            kept swept and sprayed with water.

Earthquake Emergency Recovery Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Earthquake Emergency Recovery\n            Project will relieve the socioeconomic hardships caused by\n            the earthquakes in Kermanshah (April 2002), and in Qazvin,\n            Zanjan, and Hamedan (June 2002), through the reconstruction\n            of public, and private assets, and, by developing an\n            effective monitoring, mitigation, and management system\n            designed to reduce the impact of future earthquakes. The\n            project will finance: a) reconstruction of housing, and\n            social and public infrastructure; b) economic recovery to\n            reduce vulnerability; c) capacity building and project\n            management; and, d) disaster insurance preparation. The\n            project will directly benefit affected populations, by\n            supporting the restoration of economic activities, in\n            particular, agricultural production, which is the main\n            source of income in the affected areas. Technical assistance\n            will provide wider public benefits, by strengthening the\n            public sector capacity, to become responsive in the face of\n            natural disasters. However, the major risk is the potential\n            delay in project implementation, given limited knowledge of\n            both the implementing agency in procurement procedures, and\n            the Bank with Iranian authorities. To minimize this risk, at\n            appraisal time, procurement training was provided to\n            Government authorities, while finance management training\n            will be provided to the Project Management Unit during\n            implementation, in addition to intensive Bank supervision\n            closely monitoring implementation. Furthermore, the\n            insurance component creates another risk, in that it\n            requires a separate committee and a working group, but\n            provision of technical assistance, including studies,\n            advisory services, and the preparation of a regulatory\n            reform, should minimize this risk."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran - Earthquake Emergency Recovery
