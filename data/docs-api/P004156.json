Lessons\n            learned from the project are: a) the close relationship\n            between the Bank and the borrower provided the basis for\n            wide-ranging discussions, not only to create appropriately\n            designed projects, but also for provision of well trained\n            institutions to support and operate the facilities,\n            environmental monitoring, and the ability of operating\n            agencies to further develop the systems; b) where sewerage\n            facilities are located close to residential areas,\n            discussions should be held at an early stage with\n            residents' representatives to reach acceptable plant\n            design standards, as well as tolerable methods of operation;\n            failure to do this can lead to construction delays; c) as an\n            alternative to using the rate of return covenant to measure\n            satisfactory financial performance of a sewerage utility\n            where assets are mainly underground, out of sight and\n            difficult to value, an acceptable measure is the\n            agency's contribution to investment from internal\n            resources; this covenant was adopted for the follow-up\n            sewerage project in Pusan; and d) the potential for the\n            success of any project is increased if it fits into the\n            government's sector development policy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Korea -
