Through the following\n            lessons, it is suggested that the policy framework - macro\n            and sectoral - conducive to reforms, should be in place\n            prior to implementing a major institutional reform program,\n            including a firm borrower commitment for institutional\n            changes. Additionally, efficient, and effective water user\n            associations - key to sustainable irrigation and\n            agricultural development - need to be set at the early\n            stages, involved in planning, design, and implementation\n            levels. It is also suggested that, while projects should\n            have a firmly time-bound program for institutional reform,\n            in advance of a major investment project in capital works,\n            the absence of such, could ideally, prod an initial project,\n            or project phase, supporting institutional reform, and\n            development, to be followed by a second project, or project\n            phase in which the reformed institutions implement an\n            investment works project. Finally, advance action, and\n            readiness on the part of the borrower, or implementing\n            agencies, are required for timely project implementation,\n            and capacity building."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

           the Haryana Water Resources Consolidation Project (WRCP).\n            The project is involved with the irrigation of the Haryana\n            area including the construction of various canals and pipe\n            systems.  The following potential negative impacts are\n            identified:  1) soil erosion mitigated by the proper design\n            and layout of furrows, hillside terraces, and sprinkler\n            systems; 2) waterlogging, leaching and salinization of soils\n            mitigated by: a) water application regulation; b) an\n            adequate drainage system c) use of lined canals or pipes; d)\n            sprinkler or drip irrigation; e) periodic soil flushing; f)\n            special crop cultivation; and g) nutrient replacement; 3)\n            scouring of canals mitigated by system design; 4) clogging\n            of canals by sediments and weeds mitigated by the design and\n            management of canals, access provisions, and nutrient\n            release reduction; 5) downstream impacts (water quality and\n            quantity deterioration, sea water intrusion, and ground\n            water contamination) mitigated by: a) improved water\n            management, agricultural practices, and input controls; b)\n            imposition of water quality criteria; c) reduction of\n            takeoff; and c) recharge of coastal aquifers through\n            injection wells; 6) wildlife and ecosystem effects\n            (encroachment on sensitive areas, habitat alteration or\n            destruction and impediments to wildlife movement) mitigated\n            by project location, compensatory area establishment,\n            animal rescue and relocation, and movement corridor\n            provision; 7) dislocation of population mitigated by project\n            location and a resettlement scheme; 8) water-related disease\n            prevented by: a) the use of lined canals or pipes; b)\n            avoidance of stagnant water; c) use of straight or slightly\n            curving canals; d) gate installation; e) filling or draining\n            of borrow pits; f) disease prophylaxis and treatment; g)\n            wastewater treatment; and h) enforcement of waste water use\n            standards; and 9) over-pumping of ground water mitigated by\n            withdrawal limitations.  The report concludes that while\n            direct environmental impacts from Haryana Irrigation\n            Department activities are minor and can be dealt with\n            through simple mitigation measures, there is a justifiable\n            scope for regional environmental planning for water\n            resources development using a multisector approach."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Haryana Water Resources\n            Consolidation Project : Haryana irrigation department\n            environmental action program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Haryana Water Resources\n            Consolidation Project : Haryana irrigation department\n            environmental action program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/11/699500/india-haryana-water-resources-consolidation-project-haryana-irrigation-department-environmental-action-program","projn":"IN-Haryana Water Resources Consolidation\n            Project -- P009964","subtopic":"Water Resources Law,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry,Water Law","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"India","authors":{"authr":"Seatec International, Ltd."},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970716150320"},"subsc":"Sub-national government administration,Irrigation and drainage,Water supply","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural activity,agricultural\n            runoff,Bulk Water,Bulk Water Supply,conjunctive\n            use,Construction,construction activities,dams,decision\n            makers,distribution system,Distribution\n            Systems,Drainage,drainage system,effluent\n            quality,effluents,environmental assessments,Environmental\n            Impact,Environmental Impact assessment,Environmental\n            Impacts,Environmental Issues,ENVIRONMENTAL\n            MANAGEMENT,environmental protection,Flood\n            Control,Groundwater,Groundwater Depletion,Groundwater\n            Management,industrial users,irrigation,irrigation\n            canals,irrigation systems,irrigation water,jurisdiction,land\n            use,monitoring program,natural resources,operational\n            activities,PH,Pollution,Pollution Control,programs,provision\n            of water,Public Health,public participation,Public Works,raw\n            water,sanitation facilities,sustainable water,sustainable\n            water use,Urban Water,use of water,waste\n            management,wastewater,water management agencies,Water\n            Quality,water quantity,water resource,Water Resources,water\n            resources development,water resources management,Water\n            Supply,water use"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural activity,agricultural\n            runoff,Bulk Water,Bulk Water Supply,conjunctive\n            use,Construction,construction activities,dams,decision\n            makers,distribution system,Distribution\n            Systems,Drainage,drainage system,effluent\n            quality,effluents,environmental assessments,Environmental\n            Impact,Environmental Impact assessment,Environmental\n            Impacts,Environmental Issues,ENVIRONMENTAL\n            MANAGEMENT,environmental protection,Flood\n            Control,Groundwater,Groundwater Depletion,Groundwater\n            Management,industrial users,irrigation,irrigation\n            canals,irrigation systems,irrigation water,jurisdiction,land\n            use,monitoring program,natural resources,operational\n            activities,PH,Pollution,Pollution Control,programs,provision\n            of water,Public Health,public participation,Public Works,raw\n            water,sanitation facilities,sustainable water,sustainable\n            water use,Urban Water,use of water,waste\n            management,wastewater,water management agencies,Water\n            Quality,water quantity,water resource,Water Resources,water\n            resources development,water resources management,Water\n            Supply,water use"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF022765-WATER RESOURCES/INSTITUTIONS SPECIALIST,TF032813-MALI - INSTITUTIONAL REFORM PROGRAM,TF021377-PHRD-HARYANA & ORISSA WATER\n            RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT,TF023101-PHRD-WATER RESOURCES INNOVATION\n            AND TRAINING,TF029431-PHRD-INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT","repnb":"E148"},"facets":{}}}
