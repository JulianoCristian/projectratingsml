     Project outcome is satisfactory; sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is modest; Bank performance\n            is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is satisfactory.\n            Among the lessons learned: 1) Good project management\n            facilitates effective project implementation. 2) Flexible,\n            supportive supervision by Bank staff is essential to ensure\n            effective implementation and respond to changed\n            circumstances. 3) Major road improvements need to be\n            integrated into urban structure. 4) Controlling access to\n            new roads requires more than by-laws. 5) Proper design\n            procedures are essential. 6) Final engineering designs and\n            full bidding documents must be completed and checked as\n            compliant before tendering. 7) QLI-type schemes can be\n            mainstreamed but local ownership is essential. 8) Capacity\n            building can be successful even with changes in the\n            organizational structure if the capacity building comprises\n            modular training programs related to specific technical\n            topics and guidelines on good practice in planning, design\n            and procedures that can be applied by a group of technicians\n            or professional staff in their daily operational tasks 9)\n            There are several steps to decentralization of functions\n            from central to local government, which take time to\n            implement and then more time for various organizations and\n            their staff to settle into their new roles. 10) For\n            effective formulation and dissemination, urban transport\n            policy needs a single strong agency to be responsible."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Strategic Urban Roads\n            Infrastructure Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Strategic Urban Roads\n

usage of the\n            national road network in these urban areas; 3) assist the\n            government of Indonesia (GOI) in the process of\n            decentralizing responsibility for the planning, design,\n            construction, maintenance, management and regulation of\n            urban transport from central to local government as set out\n            in recent government regulations; 4) strengthen technical\n            and institutional capabilities, particularly with respect to\n            dealing with environmental and social issues, of GOI's\n            central and local government agencies involved in urban road\n            development and management; and 5) assist GOI in the\n            formulation, articulation and implementation of urban\n            transport policy. The project comprises the following five\n            components: 1) road construction; 2) urban management and\n            quality of life improvements; 3) institutional and human\n
