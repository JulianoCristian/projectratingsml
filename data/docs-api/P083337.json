Lessons learned\n            include: the broad-based operation did allow flexibility to\n            seize opportunities where both development impact and\n            likelihood of implementation were high; it is recommended\n            that future policy-based loans take a more focused view,\n            pursuing a core theme in each leg of the overall operation,\n            even while maintaining an integrated approach to the larger\n            agenda, given the long-term nature of most reforms; at the\n            end of the day, lack of ownership cannot be substituted by\n            more conditionality; monitoring indicators need to be given\n            as much care as the conditions themselves; the National\n            Strategy for Social and Economic Development's close\n            link with the World Bank reduced donor buy-in in some cases;\n            donor coordination pays strong dividends when successful;\n            complementarity with investment operations should continue\n            to be pursued; future lending should try to ensure that\n            policy-based operations receive a significant share of\n            overall lending, and are strategically tied to the\n            investment lending agenda; much of the agenda is long-term,\n            and needs persistence, and sustainability cannot be defined\n            independently of development community support; analytical\n            work should continue through the program; the contrast\n            between health and education speaks to the importance of\n            seeing the big picture at the outset of the program, and is\n            echoed in the business environment; the partnership between\n            the Bank and the IMF has been a fruitful one."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Third Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Third Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit

         Credit supports the National Strategy for Social and\n            Economic Development (NSSED), in line with the Bank's\n            strategy presented in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).\n            The project supports the implementation of key reforms aimed\n            at promoting economic growth, strengthening public sector\n            governance, and improving social service delivery.\n            Furthermore, the project will help consolidate reforms in\n            public administration, public expenditure management and\n            accountability, and social sector service delivery,\n            supporting the country's efforts to increase the\n            Government's accountability, responsiveness, and\n            effectiveness. Civil service administration reforms would\n            help increase professionalism among civil servants, and,\n            together with reforms aimed at improving the performance of\n            social sector line agencies, and the social insurance\n            institute, would thus improve the public sector's\n            capacity to effectively regulate, monitor, and deliver\n            services. Reforms in the areas of public expenditure\n            management, financial accountability, and procurement,\n            improve transparency and the effectiveness of public\n            spending. There is however, the risk that the institutional\n            mechanisms and frameworks put in place to improve\n            transparency, and accountability in the public sector, may\n            at times be circumvented to reap political benefits in the\n            run- up to the mid-2005 elections. Nonetheless, the\n            Government's track record in maintaining macroeconomic\n            stability through prudent fiscal, and monetary policies,\n            constitutes a strong mitigating factor. In addition, the\n            support provided under this project will be followed by\n            balance of payments support from the European Community. On\n            a longer term basis, the Government is committed to\n            increasing budgetary revenues, through improvements in tax\n            administration, and revenue collection, to help strengthen\n            its fiscal position, and external balance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Third Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Third Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/11/5325529/albania-third-poverty-reduction-support-credit-project","projn":"AL-Poverty Reduction Support Credit 3 (Prsc\n            3) -- P083337","docty":"Program Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Poverty Assessment,Governance Indicators,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Albania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20041112131151"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Health,General education sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Poverty reduction;
