The project only partly achieved its main\n            objectives, institutional development was negligible,\n            sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was less than satisfactory. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, since\n            feeder roads and maintenance projects that are scattered\n            over large areas of a country require extensive and\n            time-consuming supervision, the Bank should only approve\n            such projects if it is willing to commit the necessary staff\n            resources to oversee them on a continuing basis. Second, the\n            limitations of executing works by force account need to be\n            assessed more realistically. Third, the consultant's\n            contract should have covered all the project works. Fourth,\n            design standards, plans, and specifications should be\n            prepared and agreed upon for force account works before they\n            are allowed to start. Fifth, clear cut accounting and\n            auditing controls should be set up at appraisal. Finally,\n            the organization for follow-up maintenance on works\n            completed should be agreed upon before commencing works."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ivory Coast - Feeder Road and
