Their sustainability is likely, and\n            institutional development impact is substantial. Bank and\n            Borrower performances were also satisfactory. This\n            assessment confirms a number of lessons: 1) It is possible\n            to target successfully poor areas for interventions aimed at\n            increasing enrollments, even in times of financial crises.\n            Scholarships administered to the poor and disbursed to them\n            promptly may be effective in sustaining enrollments and\n            preventing dropout. 2) Community involvement may be a\n            cost-effective and reliable means to build and support\n            schools. Nevertheless, school committee members may not be\n            able or willing to keep school expenditures low, may not\n            have much time-to spend on school affairs, and may be unable\n            to advise the principal effectively on educational matters.\n            3) Decentralization promotes effective use of resources.\n            However, a central government may find it necessary to meet\n            the basic educational needs of the poorest communities\n            directly if national goals for basic education are to be\n            achieved. 4) International comparative assessments of\n            student achievement may provide critical feedback to\n            governments interested in increasing the competitiveness of\n            their human capital.

Estimates should be made down to the\n            village level. Also there should be a pre-commitment to\n            update the \"map\" each year - thereby overcoming\n            the static nature of most poverty map schemes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Sumatra Junior Secondary\n            Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia -

This\n            will be pursued by: 1) expanding access to junior secondary\n            education in a cost-effective and equitable way; 2)\n            improving the quality of junior secondary education; and 3)\n            strengthening the education management capacity at all\n            levels. To meet these objectives, the following components\n            and subcomponents will be implemented selectively and in\n            varying degrees in the public and private systems of the\n            five project provinces: DI Aceh, West Sumatra, Jambi, South\n            Sumatra, and Lampung. The first objective will involve: 1)\n            creation of a total of 53,520 student school places; 2)\n            gradual expansion of alternative equivalency programs; 3)\n            student and teacher accommodations for public schools in\n            rural and remote areas; and 4) financing of scholarships for\n            32,600 talented poor students with priority given to girls.\n            The second objective will require: 1) strengthening of\n            teachers' subject-matter knowledge and pedagogical\n            skills; 2) enhancement of learning environment; and 3)\n            provision of contract teachers for rural areas. The third\n            objective will be achieved by: 1) training school principals\n            and other administrators in managing schools and providing\n            pedagogical support to teachers; and 2) developing\n            managerial and data analysis capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Sumatra Junior Secondary\n            Education
