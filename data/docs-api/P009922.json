The objectives of NSP III were to: (a) reorient\n            the operations of national and state level public sector\n            seed corporations along commercial lines; (b) stimulate\n            greater private sector investment (including in research and\n            development); (c) improve the management of public sector\n            variety development programs, and increase the quantity and\n            improve the quality of breeder seeds produced; and (d) make\n            seed industry regulation and control more effective. The\n            main lessons learned during project implementation are as\n            follows: The project has demonstrated that it is possible to\n            commercialize the operations of public sector enterprises\n            providing it is well planned and there is government\n            commitment to change. However, the experiences of both State\n            Seed Corporation (SSCs) and certification agencies clearly\n            indicate that reform, leading to the commercialization of\n            public sector organizations, is less effective when the\n            chief executive of an organization is deputed from another\n            government department or agency. The project has\n            demonstrated the importance of the private sector. Subsidies\n            could discourage private participation and could easily miss\n            the target groups. Subsidies are currently paid only to SSCs\n            or the supply of certified seed of new varieties (up to 10\n            years) of Open Pollinated Varieties (OPV) such as rice and\n            wheat. Public sector involvement in the supply of quality\n            OPV Seed. The public sector will also remain the principal\n            supplier of quality seed in remote areas where transport\n            costs absorb any marginal profit from producing such seed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Third National Seeds Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Third National Seeds
