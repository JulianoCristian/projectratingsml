Bank's\n            performance was deficient. Borrower's performance was\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            there has to be a conservative assessment of the\n            Government's ability to meet its financial obligations\n            under the project and the Bank has to be more responsive to\n            increasing its share of financing operating costs; (ii)\n            project management responsibilities must be clearly defined\n            and detailed from the onset of the project to facilitate\n            working relationships and coordination between units; (iii)\n            implementation of technology disseminaton processes cannot\n            be done in isolation of availability of farm inputs, market\n            demand and accessibility, and producer credit; (iv) although\n            the Borrower has the ultimate responsibility for the\n            selection of TA staff, \"no objection\" to the\n            selection should only be given after a thorough review of\n            qualifications, experience and skills; (v) staffing of Bank\n            supervision missions should give importance to\n            continuity;and (vi) an extension system must respond to\n            local environmental, technical and socioeconomic conditions\n            and evolve accordingly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Togo - Agricultural Extension Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Togo - Agricultural
