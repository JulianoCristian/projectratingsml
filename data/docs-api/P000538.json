The\n            existing road is inadequate for the present traffic\n            amounting to about 300 vehicles per day, of which about 80\n            are heavy trucks. The road provides the transport for\n            commuters and supplies to the CPC potash mine and refinery\n            at St. Paul, and to the adjoining town of Makola where the\n            mine workers live. The project road is also used to\n            transport timber and a growing volume of agricultural products."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo - Evaluation d'un projet\n            d'amelioration du reseau routier"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Congo - Highway Improvement\n            Project : Congo - Evaluation d'un projet\n            d'amelioration du reseau routier"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1970/04/15579986/congo-highway-improvement-project-congo-evaluation-dun-projet-damelioration-du-reseau-routier","projn":"CG-Highway (Pt Noire Bo -- P000538","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Airports and Air Services,Transport and Trade Logistics,Common Carriers Industry,Transport Security,Ports & Waterways","teratopic":"Transport,Industry","count":"Congo, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20111226020934"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","colti":"Transportation projects series,no.
