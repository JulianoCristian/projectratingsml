Lessons convey the following.\n            The project's success is attributable to the coherence\n            of its policy objectives, and to the demonstration of new\n            approaches, where following a gradual process of reforms,\n            demonstration of new products succeeded, even under\n            uncertain circumstances. However, the project lacked\n            continuity, and ownership among both the finance, and\n            housing sector officials; only to be recognized later on,\n            allowing enough time to convey an understanding of the\n            project. Nonetheless, during the economic transition, it\n            became important to understand demand, as exemplified by the\n            project design, and policies, established on the basis of an\n            assessment of projects under construction, and an assumption\n            that solving the resource constrain, would encourage banks\n            to lend, and households to borrow for financing homes.\n            Probably the most important contribution to the success of\n            the project, was the process of capacity building, and\n            understanding of market-based finance instruments, in spite\n            of severely underestimated timing in the disbursements\n            projections, and allocation of resources. Though it may be\n            argued that a policy, or technical assistance loan would be\n            instrumental in achieving policy, or sector reforms in the\n            context of transitional economies, it is fair to say that\n            the appropriateness of credit lines for financing\n            demonstration products/procedures, encouraged the emergence\n            of a competitive hosing finance system, and the separation\n            of subsidies from finance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Housing Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Poland - Housing Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/05/1346254/poland-housing-project","projn":"PL-Housing Project -- P008590","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Urban Economics,Banks & Banking Reform,Housing Finance,Non Bank Financial Institutions,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Poland","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01060704095455"},"subsc":"Housing construction,Housing finance","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Urban Development","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting practices,BALANCE\n            SHEET,Bank Performance,banking,banking law,banking\n            services,banking system,bonds,budget expenditures,capital\n            markets,commercial banks,commercial credit,commercial\n            loans,Construction,construction finance,credit\n            line,disbursement,employment,financial\n            institutions,financier,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreclosure,Housing,housing construction,Housing\n            Finance,housing finance institutions,housing finance\n            system,housing loans,housing policy,Housing\n            subsidies,inflation,Institutional Development,interest\n            rates,law,laws,legal framework,level playing\n            field,liens,liquidation,local government,macroeconomic\n            conditions,Mortgage,mortgage banking,mortgage banks,mortgage\n            bonds,mortgage finance,mortgage lending,mortgage\n            loan,mortgage loans,mortgage market,mortgage\n            markets,mortgage payments,mortgages,national budget,private\n            housing,private sector,profitability,property rights,public\n            housing,public sector,real estate,regulatory\n            framework,rents,Retained earnings,Revaluation\n            surplus,Savings,systemic risk,tax,technical\n            assistance,underwriting,Urban Housing,wages"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting practices,BALANCE\n            SHEET,Bank Performance,banking,banking law,banking\n            services,banking system,bonds,budget expenditures,capital\n            markets,commercial banks,commercial credit,commercial\n            loans,Construction,construction finance,credit\n            line,disbursement,employment,financial\n            institutions,financier,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreclosure,Housing,housing construction,Housing\n            Finance,housing finance institutions,housing finance\n            system,housing loans,housing policy,Housing\n            subsidies,inflation,Institutional Development,interest\n            rates,law,laws,legal framework,level playing\n            field,liens,liquidation,local government,macroeconomic\n            conditions,Mortgage,mortgage banking,mortgage banks,mortgage\n            bonds,mortgage finance,mortgage lending,mortgage\n            loan,mortgage loans,mortgage market,mortgage\n            markets,mortgage payments,mortgages,national budget,private\n            housing,private sector,profitability,property rights,public\n            housing,public sector,real estate,regulatory\n            framework,rents,Retained earnings,Revaluation\n            surplus,Savings,systemic risk,tax,technical\n            assistance,underwriting,Urban Housing,wages"}},"owner":"Private/Financial Sectors Devt (ECSPF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF020250-FRENCH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF025300-TECH.
