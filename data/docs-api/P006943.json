The land titling and settlement consolidation\n            component will provide resources to: a) IDA for land\n            titling; and b) the Ministry of Public Works and Transports\n

will support Costa\n            Rica's sustainable agricultural growth by improving the\n            efficiency and effectiveness of public sector institutions\n            and their expenditures.  The project consists of three\n            components.  The sector institutional development components\n            will: a) strengthen policy coordination of sector planning\n            and budgeting; b) support the design and implement an\n            agricultural information network; c) support a shift of\n            financial and technical responsibilities to regional\n            offices; d) improve land use classification, assess\n            ecosystems susceptible to soil losses and measure the extent\n            and cost of the actual and/or potential damage to the\n            natural resources base; and e) demarcate the boundaries of\n            national parks, biological reserves, and other protected\n            areas.  The agricultural research and extension component\n            will: a) consolidate and/or foster the emergence of private\n            technical assistance services for small and medium-size\n            producers; b) transfer extension responsibility; c)\n            concentrate research and extension activities on small\n            producers; and d) develop a group extension approach to\n            transfer simple and cost effective technologies to small\n            farmers.  The land titling and settlement consolidation\n            component will provide resources to: a) IDA for land\n            titling; and b) the Ministry of Public Works and Transports\n            for consolidation of small holder settlements by providing\n            basic rural infrastructure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Costa Rica - Agricultural Sector Investment\n            and Institutional
