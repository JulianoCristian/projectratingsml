Some lessons\n            learned includes: the rapid enactment of legislation\n            regulating the functions and mandates of Local Councils\n            (LCs) prevented delays at the implementation stage; in the\n            view of the legislative framework, the devolution of\n            functions did not need to await the development of adequate\n            capacity within the institution of LC. The design of a\n            relatively simple and transparent intergovernmental fiscal\n            system (first generation grants) set the stage for\n            predictable and (in general) timely vertical transfers to\n            the LCs. Decentralization is one of the most contested and\n            politically difficult reforms to implement in any national\n            policy.
