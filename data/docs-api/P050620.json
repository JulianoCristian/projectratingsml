Some lessons learned included: a\n            demand-driven competitive funding mechanism is an effective\n            instrument for allocating public funding aimed at fostering\n            innovation, relevance and quality in tertiary education as\n            long as the selection criteria are clear, transparent, and\n            well publicized.

Education Sector Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objectives of the Education Sector\n            Project for Ghana are to: (i) improve equitable access to\n            and completion of basic education in deprived districts; and\n            (ii) improve quality of teaching and learning, management\n            efficiency and relevance of post-basic education. The\n            changes include: (i) revisions to the project development\n            objectives; (ii) introduction of new activities and improved\n            alignment of planned activities with the national sector\n            strategy; (iii) revisions to outcome and output indicators\n            and targets; (iv) a reallocation of credit proceeds; and (v)\n            a two-year extension of the project's closing date from\n            October 31, 2009 to October 31, 2011. Since appraisal, Ghana\n            has enjoyed fast economic growth, and improvements in\n            accessing basic educational services. As a result, demand\n            for post-basic education has increased and so has the need\n            to improve links between the world of work and the world of\n            education. The new National Education Reform Program (NERP)\n            attempts to tackle these challenges in the context of the\n            decentralization process of public services taking place in\n            the broader framework of public administration. Although\n            this process has not progressed as fast as it had been\n            expected at project appraisal, some new Government\n            priorities have emerged in the process, including the need\n            to strengthen further the capacity at the district levels.\n            This is warranted in view of the importance of their role in\n            achieving more equitable access and also efficiencies in education."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Education Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Education Sector Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/05/10658669/ghana-education-sector-project","projn":"GH-Education Sector Project -- P050620","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Access & Equity in Basic Education,Teaching and Learning,Primary Education,Education For All,Tertiary Education","teratopic":"Education","count":"Ghana","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20090611011413"},"theme":"Decentralization,Other accountability/anti-corruption,HIV/AIDS,Education for all","subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education,Sub-national government administration,Primary education","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"assessment mechanisms, basic education,\n            decentralization, decision making, district education,\n            education administration, education finance, education\n            institutions, education management, education offices,\n            education Outcomes, education policy, Education Reform,\n            Education Reforms, Education Sector, education strategy,\n            education system, educational services, employment,\n            employment opportunities, equitable access, Gender Parity,\n            Gender Parity Index, graduate programs, Gross Enrollment,\n            Gross Enrollment Rate, Gross Enrolment, Gross Enrolment\n            Rate, higher education, higher education finance, higher\n            education financing, higher education institutions, higher\n            education system, human resource development, information\n            systems, interventions, job market, junior secondary, junior\n            secondary schools, learning, learning outcomes, National\n            Education, performance indicators, polytechnics, Primary\n            Completion, Primary Completion Rate, Primary Gross Enrolment\n            Rate, Primary Level, private higher education, private\n            higher education institutions, quality assurance, quality of\n            teaching, regular supervision, retraining, retraining\n            programs, scholarships, schools, skill levels, skilled\n            labor, skilled professionals, skills development, skills\n            training, Sports, teaching, teaching materials, teaching\n            staff, technical skills, technical training, technical\n            training institutions, tertiary education, tertiary\n            education financing, tertiary institutions, tertiary level,\n            trainees, training activities, training institutes, training\n            needs, universities, vocational education, Youth"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 2 (AFTH2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF021432-UN SPECIAL INITIATIVE FOR AFRICA,TF025634-PHRD-GHANA: EDUCATION SECTOR\n            DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM,TF038827-GHANA - PREPARATION OF\n            EDUCATION SECTOR DEVELOPMENT,TF0388287-GHANA - PREPARATION OF\n            EDUCATION SECTOR DEVELOPMENT,TF053697-TRUST FUND FOR SUPERVISION OF\n            CATALYTIC FUND GRANTS TO AFR COUNTRIES,TF054671-EDUCATION FOR ALL FAST TRACK\n            INITIATIVE CATALYTIC FUND GRANT FOR GHANA,TF057076-GHANA : EDUCATION FOR ALL -\n            FAST TRACK INITIATIVE (EFA FTI) CATALYTIC F","majtheme":"Public sector governance,Human development","repnb":"48849"},"facets":{}}}
