Some of the lessons learned from the Project\n            are: (1) institutional deficiencies are the source of\n            National Electric Power Authority (NEPA's) technical\n            and financial problems and any project that attempts a\n            technical solution without a major institutional change that\n            guarantees autonomy in operations will produce results that\n            are not sustainable and waste scarce investment resources.\n            Therefore the priority for any follow on project should be a\n            restructuring that will allow the company to manage its\n            physical plant and financial resources efficiently and\n            provide reliable electricity service to its customers\n            according to sound international utility practice; (2) in\n            co-financing arrangements for power system rehabilitation\n            projects, or other projects which have components that are\n            not interdependent, conditionality that requires all\n            agreements to be in place before the project as a whole can\n            be counter productive. In the case of the Power VII Project,\n            the delay in the conclusion of one agreement caused a\n            year's delay in the entire project, and constrained the\n            project from taking the emergency actions for which it was\n            designed; and (3) for a state-owned power company in a very\n            weak technical and financial position, the partnership with\n            an experienced, efficiently managed utility should be\n            considered an investment in improved power system\n            performance in all areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Power System Maintenance and\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Power System\n            Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/06/731826/nigeria-power-system-maintenance-rehabilitation-project","projn":"NG-Power Maintenance/Re -- P002146","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Business Environment,Information Technology,Economic Theory & Research,Business in Development,Power & Energy Conversion","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Nigeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3971023103918"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion,(Historic)Distribution and transmission","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,acquisition,acquisitions,automatic\n            fuel,automatic fuel adjustment,Bank\n            Loans,basic,billing,contractors,Data\n            Processing,debt,decision making,devaluation,financial\n            crisis,financial system,grid,low tariffs,Macroeconomic\n            Policies,macroeconomic stabilization,maintenance\n            costs,Power,power company,power plant,power supply,Power\n            System,price increases,procurement,quality of\n            service,reporting,technical assistance,Total costs"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,acquisition,acquisitions,automatic\n            fuel,automatic fuel adjustment,Bank\n            Loans,basic,billing,contractors,Data\n            Processing,debt,decision making,devaluation,financial\n            crisis,financial system,grid,low tariffs,Macroeconomic\n            Policies,macroeconomic stabilization,maintenance\n            costs,Power,power company,power plant,power supply,Power\n            System,price increases,procurement,quality of\n            service,reporting,technical assistance,Total costs"}},"owner":"WB Off: Abuja - Western AFR 2 (AFCW2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"16825"},"737450":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1989/07/737450/nigeria-power-system-maintenance-rehabilitation-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1989/07/737450/nigeria-power-system-maintenance-rehabilitation-project","new_url":"1989/07/737450/nigeria-power-system-maintenance-rehabilitation-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1989/07/28/000009265_3960927143512/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1989/07/28/000009265_3960927143512/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"3116","datestored":"1989-07-28T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1989-07-28T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Power System Maintenance and\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objectives of the Power System\n            Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project are to: 1) assist the\n            National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) in carrying out\n            much delayed maintenance and rehabilitation of selected\n            generation, transmission and distribution facilities, so as\n            to improve the supply of power in the near term and 2) help\n            establish institutional strengthening of NEPA and provide\n            the basis for a commercially viable entity, capable of\n            delivering a reliable and economic supply of electricity to\n            its customers.
