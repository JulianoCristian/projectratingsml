The major\n            objectives of the projects are: (i) help restore the\n            efficiency of the SNCZ railways; (ii) rehabilitate and\n            improve track; (iii) improve availability of rolling stock;\n            and (iv) develop management capability in SNCZ. The projects\n            while generating some positive results failed to achieve\n            their financial and managerial objectives. Continuous and\n            costly efforts and investments are necessary to maintain at\n            a reasonable level of efficiency a railways network whose\n            traffic is modest. Most investments are long term, but the\n            long term future of the railways is uncertain since the\n            Shaba to Lobito line in Angola may be reopened and deprive\n            the Voie Nationale (VN) of part of its traffic. The projects\n            are hardly sustainable. Continued support to a VN based\n            railways system is questionable, in particular in light of\n            the economic disruption caused by the unsettled political\n            situation in Zaire in 1991. The recent collapse of SNCZ\n            occurred as a consequence of the public sector management of\n            the enterprise which has given priority to keeping on or\n            hiring new staff when the priority should have been to\n            maintain the enterprise's assets. Operating costs have\n            gradually increased while revenues have decreased. The drop\n            in transport demand is mainly due to the fall-off in\n            Gecamines activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zaire - First and Second Societe Nationale\n            des Chemins
