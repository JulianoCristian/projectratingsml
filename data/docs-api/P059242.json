In order to understand\n            community based procurement in relation to value for money\n            (VfM), governance and accountability, a study was needed to\n            explore these concepts and their dynamics. The present study\n            focuses on Community Based Procurement (CBP) outcomes across\n            completed sub-projects with a focus on the following key\n            questions: 1) value for money - is community based\n            procurement more economical for implementation? 2)\n            Sustainability - is there evidence of better operation and\n            maintenance of items and services created through CBP? 3)\n            Participation - what is the extent of community\n            participation in CBP? 4) Enabling factors - what are the\n            facilitating processes and environmental factors that\n            positively influence the outcomes in CBP? The study on CBP\n            was carried out in 84 successful subprojects from three\n            community driven development (CDD) projects in India (in the\n            states of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu) and\n            local government units (Gram Panchayats1) in the state of\n            Kerala, to explore linkages both in terms of enablers and\n            outcomes.

follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: instead of operating stand-alone projects,\n            it is better to make them as part and parcel of mainstream\n            schemes so that the government can avail of all available\n            resources. The role of private sector in playing an active\n            role as a partner in Bank projects on livelihood and poverty\n            alleviation needs to be looked into for future projects. All\n            manual and guidelines should be prepared at the beginning of\n            the project itself and not after the project has started.\n            Capacity building should be given very high priority.\n            Implementation of sub projects should start only after\n            sufficient capacity building is achieved. Any attempt to\n            fast track without proper foundation can result in\n            manipulation and diluting project objectives. Enhancing the\n            capacity and skills of project coordinators to manage\n            projects through relevant training and exchange programs is\n            important for effective project implementation. It will be\n            important to provide them opportunities for platform for\n            sharing and cross-learning from the experience of other\n            projects in the

     the rural poor, empowering disadvantaged groups through the\n            promotion of village organizations. The project components\n            follow. 1) Community investments will finance demand-driven\n            sub-projects, proposed by the Common Interest Groups (CIGs),\n            to be approved by the village development committees, and\n            discussed by district sub-committees. Based on social\n            assessments, it is expected that CIG subprojects will fall\n            into three categories: a) skills and organizations, such as\n            micro-enterprises; b) infrastructure, such as roads and\n            housing; and, c) livelihood security, such as\n            micro-irrigation. Village funds, established through\n            community cash contributions would finance operation, and\n            maintenance costs, and, Innovation Funds, would finance\n            demonstration projects, proposed by non-governmental\n            organizations. 2) Institutional, and human capacity building\n            will develop self-reliant, and self managed community based\n            organizations, focused on project administration, human\n            resource development, communications, organization\n            strengthening, and, monitoring and
