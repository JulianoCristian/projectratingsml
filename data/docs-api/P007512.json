In the Region Lagunera District the\n            irrigated area would be expanded from 52,660 hectares to\n            approximately 85,000; in the San Juan del Rio District the\n            increase would be from 5,400 hectares to approximately\n            10,000. In addition, the project would regulate the water\n            supply and reduce damage from floods; it would also reduce\n            the construction or rehabilitation of 620 km of roads in the\n            project areas. Adequate agricultural extension services,\n            including demonstration programs and long, medium and\n            short-term credit to farmers would be assured by the Government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Third Irrigation Project Mexico"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Third Irrigation Project Mexico"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1966/04/1556788/third-irrigation-project-mexico","projn":"MX-Irrigation-270717 -- P007512","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Public Sector Economics,Strategic Debt Management","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Mexico","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101902533551"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aggregate demand,Agricultural\n            Credit,agricultural production,agricultural\n            subsidies,Agriculture,balance of payments,Bank loans,Bank\n            reserves,bond issues,bonds,borrowing,capital markets,Central\n            Bank,climatic conditions,Cost of living,current\n            expenditures,debt,DEBT OUTSTANDING,debt service,debt service\n            ratio,debts,deposits,devaluation,Domestic borrowing,economic\n            growth,electricity,employment,exports,external debt,External\n            Public Debt,farms,financial\n            performance,fishing,forecasts,foreign borrowing,foreign\n            debt,foreign exchange,forestry,GNP,Government\n            expenditures,Gross Domestic Product,Gross National\n            Product,Gross national savings,growth\n            rate,imports,income,installments,INTEREST\n            RATE,legislation,Market Prices,maturities,metals,money\n            supply,municipalities,net value,population growth,price\n            controls,price fluctuations,price stability,private\n            sector,producers,productivity,productivity\n            increases,provisions,public debt,public investment,public\n            investment programs,public investments,public savings,public\n            sector,public sector investments,Public sector\n            savings,refinance,repayment,Roads,savings,savings\n            deposits,tax,total output,Transport,Treasury,wage\n            rates,water supply,wholesale prices"},"1":{"cdata!":"aggregate demand,Agricultural\n            Credit,agricultural production,agricultural\n            subsidies,Agriculture,balance of payments,Bank loans,Bank\n            reserves,bond issues,bonds,borrowing,capital markets,Central\n            Bank,climatic conditions,Cost of living,current\n            expenditures,debt,DEBT OUTSTANDING,debt service,debt service\n            ratio,debts,deposits,devaluation,Domestic borrowing,economic\n            growth,electricity,employment,exports,external debt,External\n            Public Debt,farms,financial\n            performance,fishing,forecasts,foreign borrowing,foreign\n            debt,foreign exchange,forestry,GNP,Government\n            expenditures,Gross Domestic Product,Gross National\n            Product,Gross national savings,growth\n            rate,imports,income,installments,INTEREST\n            RATE,legislation,Market Prices,maturities,metals,money\n            supply,municipalities,net value,population growth,price\n            controls,price fluctuations,price stability,private\n            sector,producers,productivity,productivity\n            increases,provisions,public debt,public investment,public\n            investment programs,public investments,public savings,public\n            sector,public sector investments,Public sector\n            savings,refinance,repayment,Roads,savings,savings\n            deposits,tax,total output,Transport,Treasury,wage\n            rates,water supply,wholesale prices"}},"owner":"WB Off:Mexico - MX & CO CMU (LCC1C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"repnb":"P478"},"facets":{}}}
