Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, complex financing\n            transactions and related procurement activities require\n            added sophistication in the handling of foreign financiers\n            and suppliers. Second, it would be beneficial to create a\n            small specialized unit inside the Directorate General of\n            T&T (Telegraph and Telephone Department) that is\n            responsible for handling complex financial and procurement\n            questions, such as bidding with price and teams, and\n            coordinating multilateral and bilateral sources of\n            financing.
