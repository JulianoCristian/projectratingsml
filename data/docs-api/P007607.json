While the project contributed\n            to increase the agricultural productivity in selected\n            rainfed areas, not all instruments foreseen in the\n            achievement of project objectives, were used in a balanced\n            way, thus having a negative impact in the extent of project\n            development impact. Several lessons are drawn from the\n            project. The absence of adequate technical assistance (TA)\n            for infrastructure outputs failed to support development\n            objectives, for although adequate infrastructure may be\n            enough to promote expansion of irrigation, and an increase\n            in crop yields, it does not induce changes in crop patterns,\n            and production. Not only should project design have included\n            safeguards against low demand for TA, but elements such as\n            macroeconomics, in accord with private financial support,\n            should complement on-farm investments, and technical\n            assistance. Furthermore, a comprehensive operational\n            framework should have been enforced, to ensure coordination\n            among components, particularly in light of two implementing\n            agencies controlling different components. Project\n            experience acknowledges the importance of performance\n            indicators, beneficiary participation in project design, and\n            assessment of commitments, particularly in meeting\n            counterpart funds requirements under macroeconomic instability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Rainfed Areas Development

This will be done through: (a) investing in\n            small-scale irrigation and other productive investments; (b)\n            transferring both new and existing agricultural technologies\n            through private sector extension; (c) reducing costs of soil\n            erosion; and (d) strengthening the capacity of the executing\n            agency. The project is targeted at small farmers in the ten\n            states, chiefly in semiarid and temperate zones, with\n            rainfall less than 1,000 mm annually and where moisture\n            deficit is the main constraint to productivity. The\n            operation will have three components: (a) rural investment;\n            (b) agricultural technology transfer; and (c) institutional\n            development and training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Proyecto de Desarrollo de Areas de Temporal"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"M\u00e9xico: Proyecto de Desarrollo de\n            Zonas de Secano : M\u00e9xico - Proyecto de Desarrollo de \u00c1reas\n            de Temporal"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/06/12316379/mexico-rainfed-areas-development-project-mexico-proyecto-de-desarrollo-de-areas-de-temporal","projn":"MX-Rainfed Areas Develo -- P007607","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Agricultural Research","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Environment,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Mexico","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20100525063804"},"subsc":"Central government administration,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"Spanish","historic_topic":"Environment,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural production; Farmers;\n            Institutional reform; Investments; Irrigation development;\n            Rain fed areas; Rain fed farming; Soil erosion; Technology\n            transfer; Training,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural production; Farmers;\n            Institutional reform; Investments; Irrigation development;\n            Rain fed areas; Rain fed farming; Soil erosion; Technology\n            transfer; Training,,"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"repnb":"12533","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Proyecto de Desarrollo de Areas\n            de Temporal"}}},"facets":{}}}
