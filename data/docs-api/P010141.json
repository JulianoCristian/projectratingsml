The Bank served as a\n            vehicle to bring about policy changes towards the project.\n            Some of the shortcomings encountered in the implementation\n            could have been mitigated through careful scrutiny of: (a)\n            construction designs and costs at appraisal stage; and (b)\n            qualitative aspects of plantation development and\n            beneficiary issues during the supervisory phase. The main\n            lessons of this project experience are: Preparation and\n            appraisal missions should have a clear focus on local\n            funding needs, budgetary procedures and flow of fund\n            arrangements. Equally important is the need, both at\n            preparation and appraisal stages, to ascertain the\n            availability of land, physical plans and designs for civil\n            works and pay attention to details of construction costs,\n            including physical contingencies. Sustained management of\n            community planted forests is only likely if the communities\n            themselves have a large measure of responsibility for site\n            selection, and plantings. If their harvest rights are known\n            from the beginning, innovative projects requiring a large\n            degree of beneficiary involvement are likely to be slow in\n            starting, and this should be allowed for preparation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Community Forestry Development and\n            Training Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Community Forestry\n            Development and Training Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1991/04/736064/nepal-community-forestry-development-training-project","projn":"NP-Forestry I -- P010141","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Forests and Forestry,Wood Manufacturing and Industry,Forestry,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Rural Development","count":"Nepal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960925183458"},"subsc":"Forestry","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ADB,Afforestation,Agriculture,Community\n            Forestry,degradation,degraded forest,ecology,environmental\n            degradation,environmental impact,erosion,FAO,farm\n            forestry,farming,fodder,Forest,forest cover,Forest\n            Department,forest law,forest law enforcement,forest\n            management,forest plantations,forest resource,Forest\n            Watchers,Foresters,forestry,forestry activities,Forestry\n            Department,Forestry Development,forestry operations,forestry\n            personnel,forestry policy,Forestry Project,forestry\n            projects,forestry research,forestry resources,forestry\n            sector,Forestry Training,forests,fuelwood,Identity,National\n            Forestry,natural\n            forests,pines,planting,reforestation,regeneration,rural\n            population,state forest,state forest lands,Structural\n            Adjustment,timber,timber\n            extraction,training,trees,UNDP,United Nations,United Nations\n            Development Programme,USAID,wood"},"1":{"cdata!":"ADB,Afforestation,Agriculture,Community\n            Forestry,degradation,degraded forest,ecology,environmental\n            degradation,environmental impact,erosion,FAO,farm\n            forestry,farming,fodder,Forest,forest cover,Forest\n            Department,forest law,forest law enforcement,forest\n            management,forest plantations,forest resource,Forest\n            Watchers,Foresters,forestry,forestry activities,Forestry\n            Department,Forestry Development,forestry operations,forestry\n            personnel,forestry policy,Forestry Project,forestry\n            projects,forestry research,forestry resources,forestry\n            sector,Forestry Training,forests,fuelwood,Identity,National\n            Forestry,natural\n            forests,pines,planting,reforestation,regeneration,rural\n            population,state forest,state forest lands,Structural\n            Adjustment,timber,timber\n            extraction,training,trees,UNDP,United Nations,United Nations\n            Development Programme,USAID,wood"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"9520"},"723704":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1980/04/723704/nepal-community-forestry-development-training-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1980/04/723704/nepal-community-forestry-development-training-project","new_url":"1980/04/723704/nepal-community-forestry-development-training-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/02/03/000178830_98101902350176/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/02/03/000178830_98101902350176/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"1008","datestored":"2000-02-03T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1980-04-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Community Forestry Development and\n            Training Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The proposed project would be the first\n            phase of a twenty year national forestry program aiming to\n            develop community forestry in the Hills and to establish\n            training facilities in Nepal to satisfy needs for qualified\n            forestry, soil and water conservation personnel.

The annual sustainable yield of fuelwood from\n            Panchayat Protected Forests and private plantings would be\n            sufficient to provide the full requirements of 10 percent of\n            the project area population."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Community Forestry Development and\n            Training Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Community Forestry\n            Development and Training Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/03/726465/nepal-community-forestry-development-training-project","projn":"NP-Forestry I -- P010141","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Forests and Forestry,Wood Manufacturing and Industry,Forestry,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Rural Development","count":"Nepal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912472448"},"subsc":"Forestry","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ADB,Afforestation,agricultural\n            land,Agricultural Sector,Agriculture,animal nutrition,animal\n            products,arable land,area under\n            cultivation,Audits,Botany,cattle,CIDA,commercial\n            forestry,commercial wood production,Community\n            Forestry,community forests,conifers,Conservator of\n            Forests,crops,cultivation,degraded\n            forest,droughts,farmers,farming,felling,Fodder,Forest,Forest\n            Act,forest administration,forest areas,forest cover,Forest\n            Department,forest destruction,Forest Development,Forest\n            Guards,Forest Land,Forest Land Ownership,forest lands,forest\n            law,forest law enforcement,forest management,Forest\n            Officer,Forest Products,forest protection,forest\n            regeneration,Forest Resources,Forest\n            Watchers,Foresters,Forestry activities,forestry\n            activity,Forestry Development,Forestry Institutions,Forestry\n            Officer,forestry operations,forestry production,Forestry\n            Program,Forestry Project,Forestry Projects,Forestry\n            Research,Forestry Sector,Forestry Sector Review,Forestry\n            Training,Fuelwood,furniture,groundwater,hardwood,innovation,irrigation,livestock,logging,Maize,millet,National\n            Forestry,overgrazing,plantations,Planting,plywood,Private\n            forests,reforestation,regeneration,rural areas,rural\n            development,rural population,Sawlogs,sawmills,sawnwood,Soil\n            Erosion,soil fertility,soils,Timber,timber extraction,timber\n            production,timber sales,Tree Planting,trees,USAID,use of\n            forests,watershed,wheat,Wildlife,Wood,wood shortages,woodlots"},"1":{"cdata!":"ADB,Afforestation,agricultural\n            land,Agricultural Sector,Agriculture,animal nutrition,animal\n            products,arable land,area under\n            cultivation,Audits,Botany,cattle,CIDA,commercial\n            forestry,commercial wood production,Community\n            Forestry,community forests,conifers,Conservator of\n            Forests,crops,cultivation,degraded\n            forest,droughts,farmers,farming,felling,Fodder,Forest,Forest\n            Act,forest administration,forest areas,forest cover,Forest\n            Department,forest destruction,Forest Development,Forest\n            Guards,Forest Land,Forest Land Ownership,forest lands,forest\n            law,forest law enforcement,forest management,Forest\n            Officer,Forest Products,forest protection,forest\n            regeneration,Forest Resources,Forest\n            Watchers,Foresters,Forestry activities,forestry\n            activity,Forestry Development,Forestry Institutions,Forestry\n            Officer,forestry operations,forestry production,Forestry\n            Program,Forestry Project,Forestry Projects,Forestry\n            Research,Forestry Sector,Forestry Sector Review,Forestry\n            Training,Fuelwood,furniture,groundwater,hardwood,innovation,irrigation,livestock,logging,Maize,millet,National\n            Forestry,overgrazing,plantations,Planting,plywood,Private\n            forests,reforestation,regeneration,rural areas,rural\n            development,rural population,Sawlogs,sawmills,sawnwood,Soil\n            Erosion,soil fertility,soils,Timber,timber extraction,timber\n            production,timber sales,Tree Planting,trees,USAID,use of\n            forests,watershed,wheat,Wildlife,Wood,wood shortages,woodlots"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"2663"},"facets":{}}}
