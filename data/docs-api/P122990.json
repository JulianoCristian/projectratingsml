Some lessons learned included:\n            political and governance risks need to be carefully\n            mitigated in project design to ensure financial\n            sustainability. Among the political risks to be factored in\n            is that the Bank itself will be hesitant to apply remedies\n            in case the client fails on its financial commitment to\n            preserve client relationship. A governance project should,\n            whenever possible, contribute to the international agenda on\n            aid effectiveness, including the commitment by development\n            partners to use country systems. A PIU needs to be endowed\n            by the government with both operational capacity and the\n            authority on beneficiary agencies to ensure adequate\n            internalization of the project inputs. For that purpose,\n            active support from political authorities is indispensable.\n            Their piloting of the project should ensure the alignment of\n            the project with the political agenda, alert the Bank and\n            the PIU of any policy shifts, and impose interagency\n            coordination across public entities benefitting from the\n            project. Some of the decisions which were needed for the\n            project to remain meaningful and be successful belong\n            exclusively to the political leadership. The project could\n            not perform as expected for want of sufficient leadership on\n            the part of the authorities. Project coordination is a\n            full-time responsibility from which the project coordinator\n            and the PIU should not have been taken out."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo, Republic of -
