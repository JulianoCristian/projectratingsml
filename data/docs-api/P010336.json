The\n            project substantially achieved its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development has been substantial,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of the Bank\n            was highly satisfactory while the Borrower's was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, the design of a sectoral reform program\n            should involve extensive consultations with the Government,\n            as well as potential beneficiaries. Second, the designation\n            of a single agency to coordinate policy-making and\n            implementation activities under the loan facilitated timely\n            decisions, as well as actions by GOP and other entities.\n            Third, a continuous dialogue and monitoring of the program\n            by GOP and the Bank helped in developing a correspondence of\n            views and consistency of policies and strategy. Fourth,\n            there is a need for preparatory and continuous training of\n            staff in the executing agencies to develop and maintain the\n            required procurement skills. Fifth, there is a need for more\n            intensive investigation of issues before any agreement on\n            the scope and phasing of price rationalization programs is\n            reached between GOP and the Bank. Finally, agreements on\n            policy reforms should be limited in number, and more\n            explicit linkages between priority actions and availability\n            of resources should be defined."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -

This adjustment program,\n            comprised of policies and institutional reforms, will be\n            introduced during the Seventh Plan. It will support the\n            implementation of the Core Investment Program (CIP)\n            (FY89-91) which will comprise new investments to be launched\n            during the Seventh Plan and, in some cases, completion of\n            those which were launched during the Sixth Plan. It will\n            also mobilize resources for CIP by rationalizing energy\n            pricing, integrating donor cofinancing, mobilizing private\n            sector financing, and coordinating access to the credit and\n            capital markets. Finally, it will support the macroeconomic\n            adjustment program by facilitating an adequate level of\n            imports.  As a supplement to the ongoing investment program,\n            the loan will provide additional assistance for two priority\n            energy sector projects in the Core Investment Program,\n            involving the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and the Water\n            and Power Development Authority (WAPDA). Their\n            implementation is necessitated by the adverse impact on\n            Pakistan's balance of payments resulting from the Gulf\n            crisis.  The SSGC component for installation of a gas\n            purification plant will help SSGC's gas delivery\n            capacity and will reduce the imports of petroleum products.\n            The WAPDA component, which is to modify the Kot Addu Power\n            Plant to permit the use of natural gas in lieu of diesel\n            oil, will have a beneficial environmental impact.  The\n            Supplemental Loan will:  (a) cover the foreign exchange\n            costs of goods and services for the installation of a gas\n            purification plant for SSGC; and (b) part of the foreign\n            exchange costs of gas conversion equipment to be installed\n            at WAPDA's Kot Addu Plant, to allow substitution of\n            domestically supplied natural gas for high speed diesel fuel."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -

Second Energy Sector Loan (ESL) Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Second Energy Sector Loan Project\n            will contribute to macroeconomic adjustment aimed at\n            achieving energy targets by continuing the process of\n            sectoral adjustment outlined in the Long Term Strategy for\n            the Development of Energy (LES). This adjustment program,\n            comprised of policies and institutional reforms, will be\n            introduced during the Seventh Plan. It will support the\n            implementation of the Core Investment Program (CIP)\n            (FY89-91) which will comprise new investments to be launched\n            during the Seventh Plan and, in some cases, completion of\n            those which were launched during the Sixth Plan. It will\n            also mobilize resources for CIP by rationalizing energy\n            pricing, integrating donor cofinancing, mobilizing private\n            sector financing, and coordinating access to the credit and\n            capital markets. Finally, it will support the macroeconomic\n            adjustment program by facilitating an adequate level of\n            imports.  As a supplement to the ongoing investment program,\n            the loan will provide additional assistance for two priority\n            energy sector projects in the Core Investment Program,\n            involving the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and the Water\n            and Power Development Authority (WAPDA). Their\n            implementation is necessitated by the adverse impact on\n            Pakistan's balance of payments resulting from the Gulf\n            crisis.  The SSGC component for installation of a gas\n            purification plant will help SSGC's gas delivery\n            capacity and will reduce the imports of petroleum products.\n            The WAPDA component, which is to modify the Kot Addu Power\n            Plant to permit the use of natural gas in lieu of diesel\n            oil, will have a beneficial environmental impact.  The\n            Supplemental Loan will:  (a) cover the foreign exchange\n            costs of goods and services for the installation of a gas\n            purification plant for SSGC; and (b) part of the foreign\n            exchange costs of gas conversion equipment to be installed\n            at WAPDA's Kot Addu Plant, to allow substitution of\n            domestically supplied natural gas for high speed diesel fuel."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Second Energy Sector Loan (ESL) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Second Energy Sector\n            Loan (ESL)
