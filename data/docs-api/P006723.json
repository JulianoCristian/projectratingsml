On the other hand,\n            construction of the Barranquilla Bridge and completion of\n            the Buga-Buenaventura highway were successfully carried out\n            under the project and resulted in estimated economic returns\n            well above those expected at appraisal. The revised project\n            was completed in late 1981, about eight years after the\n            original appraisal date. The project completion report (PCR)\n            identifies the following reasons for such poor project\n            performance: (a) financial difficulties of the Government\n            causing tardiness in payment of contractual advances; (b)\n            contractors' financial problems stemming from contracts\n            based on unrealistically low bids; (c) contractors having\n            insufficient equipment; (d) inadequate design plans\n            requiring Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MOPT) to\n            modify pavements and alignments; (e) lack of experience of\n            some field supervision engineers; (f) heavy rains; and (g)\n            asphalt shortages."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -
