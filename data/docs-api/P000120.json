Some objectives were\n            either not achieved or only partially achieved, such as\n            strengthening the capacity of the district technical staff\n            to assist producers, training of the remaining personnel,\n            contributing to the transfer of knowledge to and building\n            the capacity of the farmers' groups and organizations,\n            and helping redundant personnel to find new employment.\n            Project sustainability is unlikely, and both performances of\n            the Bank and the Borrower are rated overall unsatisfactory.\n            the overall outcome of the Community-Based Food Security\n            Project (PILSA) is rated satisfactory, with sustainability\n            rated likely. Bank performance and that of the Borrower are\n            rated overall satisfactory. Lastly, the assessment rates the\n            overall outcome of the Second Rural Savings and Loans\n            Cooperatives Rehabilitation (Rural Credit II) as\n            unsatisfactory; the project was undermined by the severe\n            problems with the Federation of Rural Savings and Loans\n            Cooperatives, including insufficient training at the local\n            level, defaulted loans owing to the lack of due diligence,\n            and inadequate records on repayment schedules, among other\n            problems. sustainability is unlikely Both the Bank and the\n            Borrower's performances are rated unsatisfactory.\n            Experience with this project confirms a number of OED\n            lessons: 1) A feasible plan (both functional and financial)\n            that can be fully implemented is essential when changing the\n            institutiona structure of a major government organization\n            such as the Ministry of Agriculture. The plan must be\n            flexible and capable of being changed as it is being\n            implemented, and periodically monitored so that management\n            can learn what is working and what parts need to be altered\n            during the implementation phase. 2) A decentralized and\n            demand-driven system is a viable approach to the successful\n            delivery of food security and nurition programs. The PILSA\n            project was successful because each community was able to\n            tailor the specific program delivery to its own needs, and\n            because of the expertise of both international and local\n            nongovernmental organizations to implement micro-projects\n            and deliver the nutrition programs. Local NGOs were able to\n            identify with local populations. This occurred as a result\n            of the decentralized implementation of PILSA coupled with\n            the strong leadership of the implementing agencies and their\n            firm commitment to the success of the project. 3) The\n            sustainable provision of rural credit requires appropriate\n            institutional development and training. If a good monitoring\n            and evaluation system had been present in the FECECAM\n            network and more attention given to appropriate training,\n            FECECAM would not be facing such an acute problem with arrears."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin -

The World\n            Bank's overall performance is assessed as satisfactory.\n            In view of the achievements of the network and the\n            substantial impact it is estimated to have had, the overall\n            performance of the Borrower is rated as satisfactory. This\n            rating is accompanied by a caution that the plans to improve\n            the financial performance of the weaker units in the network\n            will be implemented as planned. Some of the major lessons\n            emerging from the project are as follows: Because a pilot\n            project will not provide all the lessons needed and because\n            circumstances change, the design of the follow-on project\n            must be flexible enough to allow for corrective actions\n            (such as the change in lending rules). External pressure\n            should not be allowed to influence internal decisions, or\n            even the best plans fail. Early success in project\n            implementation can foster realistic unrealistic expectations\n            and expansion of objectives, especially if there is\n            political pressure for quickly delivering the services or\n            output expected from the project. This was the case in\n            Benin--where all the projections with regard to membership,\n            savings, and loans of the organization were exceeded in the\n            early years of project implementation. Careful consideration\n            must be accorded to the short and long-term implications of\n            each rule and regulation given to the participating units."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin -

2086-BEN). The project\n            supports the development of a privately-owned financial\n            intermediation system in rural areas, organized along\n            mutualist lines. Globally, it is expected that the Network\n            reaches full financial viability and autonomy only in the\n            longer term (10 to 15 years). The specific objectives of the\n            project assist the Network in establishing an efficient\n            institutional structure and making substantial progress\n            toward financial viability. It is expected that by the end\n            of the project, all primary level cooperatives (CLCAMs) will\n            not only break even financially, but also finance up to 30\n            percent of the Network's regional and national levels,\n            in charge of providing policy guidance, assistance and\n            supervision to CLCAMs. The project supports: (i) the\n            establishment of efficient service units at the Regional\n            Union of CLCAMs (URCLCAMs) to provide CLCAMs with the\n            necessary technical backstopping (accounting and financial\n            management) and training; (ii) the establishment of a\n            National Federation of S&L Cooperatives to be the\n            Network's policy-making and supervisory body;\n            (iii)technical assistance, equipment, training and annual\n            audits; and (iv) funding for completing the financial\n            restructuring of CLCAMs and providing limited financial\n            assistance to a few CLCAMs operating in the poorest areas of\n            the country and having a potential to reach a deposit base\n            necessary to break even financially."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin -
