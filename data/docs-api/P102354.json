It is difficult to plan and design successive\n            phases of a longer-term program to prevent gaps from\n            occurring between phases. As much as possible, however, such\n            gaps should be avoided. Local participation is vital for\n            involving people in development by discussing plans,\n            agreeing on priorities, and gaining an understanding of how\n            to implement planned activities and monitor the\n            sustainability of their investments. It is the policy of the\n            Bank and the Government of Niger to integrate development\n            projects gradually into regular government activities and\n            obviate the need for separate project coordination or\n            management units. The implementation completion report (ICR)\n            mission noted that the project was more of a\n            decentralization and communal development project than an\n            agricultural project, and it recommended that the issue of\n            the supervisory ministry be reviewed during the appraisal of\n            CAP-III. Participation in the economic micro projects for\n            CAP-I required a contribution of 10-20 percent of micro\n            project costs, making it impossible to accommodate the\n            poorest people. It is more challenging to foster the kind of\n            entrepreneurship needed to operate an economically\n            successful farmer organizations. Entrepreneurial, economic,\n            and commercial skills are not easily taught. They require\n            not only classroom teaching but also follow-up instruction\n            and coaching, often for years after the original training.\n            To interest people in long-term natural resource management\n            and environmental protection (including the maintenance of\n            trees), it is absolutely necessary to give them concrete\n            incentives, such as food or cash for work, and perhaps to be\n            more supply-driven."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Second Phase of Adaptable Program\n            Loan of the Community Action

The project\n            constitutes the second phase of the Community Action Program\n            (a 12 year APL). The country's political and\n            institutional context is challenging. Implementation of the\n            Project is on track but could experience difficulties if an\n            adjustment is not made to the disbursement scheme so that\n            the underestimated cost of selected activities is\n            appropriately corrected. The initial estimation for\n            operating costs was based on the PAC1 coverage of 54\n            communes instead of the actual 164 communes covered by the\n            PAC2.
