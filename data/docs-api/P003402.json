Similarly, both performances\n            by the Bank and Borrower are rated highly satisfactory, in\n            light of the precise project identification, design, and\n            supervision, as well as the timely, and adequate\n            implementation performance, respectively. Regardless of\n            success, some lessons may be drawn from the overall project\n            design, and specific project components. By sequencing the\n            implementation of the project, attention was mainly focused\n            on training, and planning, diverting attention from\n            infrastructure building, and in addition, limiting the time\n            period (and probably) the impact of the management action\n            phase. Instead, an early start on capacity building at\n            project design, and the provision of on site technical\n            assistance throughout implementation, would have further\n            strengthened processes, and activities. Such framework,\n            could also impact the nature reserve management planning,\n            i.e., initial data collection, and analysis should focus on\n            priority species, and habitats in order to identify short-\n            to medium-term management actions, while a comprehensive\n            inventory should be made during implementation of the\n            management plan phase. Most importantly, funding by the\n            central government for targeted conservation research,\n            should be made available on a competitive basis, to meet the\n            priority
