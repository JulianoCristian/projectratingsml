The project was\n            not implemented, and the credit was kept in abeyance and\n            later canceled. As a result, the project did not achieve any\n            of its objectives. The performance of both the Bank and\n            Borrower was deficient. Several lessons can be learned from\n            this project. First, IDA should avoid self-imposed pressure\n            to accelerate project processing when preparation is not\n            complete. Second, IDA should not ignore the dynamics of the\n            political and economic environment in the country and region\n            where it is located. Third, early recognition and evaluation\n            by IDA of the Arun Access Road Project as a component within\n            a larger hydroelectric project might have avoided later\n            changes in the project's objectives and alignment\n            change. Fourth, IDA should insist on compliance with its\n            policies and operational directives, where they are\n            applicable, even in the case of a project for which\n            implementation of the investment component never began and\n            the credit is kept in abeyance. Finally, IDA should ensure\n            ownership by the borrower of any project it approves."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Arun Access Road Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Arun Access Road Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/09/733360/nepal-arun-access-road-project","projn":"NP-Arun III Access Rd -- P010331","docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Rural Microfinance and SMEs,Airports and Air Services,Roads & Highways,Urban Housing","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Nepal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970311114127"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other transportation","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Access Road,civil\n            works,communities,concrete,construction,construction\n            period,construction site,construction\n            supervision,construction works,crowding out,economic\n            analysis,Economic Development,economic situation,electric\n            power,environmental protection,gravel,Hydroelectric\n            Project,IDA,income,land acquisition,maintenance\n            operations,Marginal Cost,overflow spillway,property\n            owners,reference,Regional\n            Office,rehabilitation,resettlement,River,road alignment,road\n            construction,road costs,road maintenance,Roads,route,Safety,streams,terminal,terrain,topography,Transport,tunnel,tunnels,vehicles,watershed"},"1":{"cdata!":"Access Road,civil\n            works,communities,concrete,construction,construction\n            period,construction site,construction\n            supervision,construction works,crowding out,economic\n            analysis,Economic Development,economic situation,electric\n            power,environmental protection,gravel,Hydroelectric\n            Project,IDA,income,land acquisition,maintenance\n            operations,Marginal Cost,overflow spillway,property\n            owners,reference,Regional\n            Office,rehabilitation,resettlement,River,road alignment,road\n            construction,road costs,road maintenance,Roads,route,Safety,streams,terminal,terrain,topography,Transport,tunnel,tunnels,vehicles,watershed"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"16037"},"4297693":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1995/06/4297693/nepal-arun-iii-hydroelectric-project-investigation-report","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1995/06/4297693/nepal-arun-iii-hydroelectric-project-investigation-report","new_url":"1995/06/4297693/nepal-arun-iii-hydroelectric-project-investigation-report","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/06/16/000265513_20040616150801/Rendered/INDEX/28477.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/06/16/000265513_20040616150801/Rendered/PDF/28477.pdf","credit_no":"2029","datestored":"2004-06-16T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1995-06-22T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Arun III Hydroelectric Project :\n            Investigation Report"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This report describes the process and\n            summarizes the findings of the Inspection Panel's\n            investigation into alleged non-compliance by IDA with its\n            Operational Directives on environmental assessment, on\n            indigenous peoples, and on involuntary resettlement during\n            the preparation and appraisal of the Arun Hydroelectric\n            Project.

To achieve these objectives, the project comprises:\n            (i) construction of a gravel surfaced road, from near the\n            end of the existing road, to the Arun III construction site,\n            including a six kilometer spur road to the administrative\n            center of Chainpur; (ii) a road maintenance depot at\n            Tumlingar to support maintenance of the project road and\n            monitor maintenance operations carried out by contractors;\n            (iii) rehabilitation of families adversely affected by the\n            construction of the access road through implementation of a\n            Land Acquisition, Compensation, and Rehabilitation Plan\n            (ACRP); and (iv) consultancy services for construction\n            supervision, training of
