Some lessons learned included: the Bank needs\n            to be alert to the potentially de-mobilizing impacts of\n            prolonged delay between operations and disruptive changes in\n            leadership and staffing, especially technical. Cooperar is\n            an experienced and committed project unit which needs\n            specific forms of institutional support to enable it to\n            perform to potential. The institutionalization of monitoring\n            and evaluation (M and E) is essential and successive\n            projects should update and reinforce M and E capacity and\n            utilization. The community-driven development (CDD)\n            methodology remains a cost-effective avenue to basic social\n            infrastructure acquisition and to social capital formation\n            but more systematic employment and income generation\n            requires significant changes. Productive activities in\n            semi-arid zones with water difficulties are increasingly\n            unsustainable.
