Firstly,\n            the project design was rigorous and realistic in its\n            identification of potential risks. It accurately\n            pre-identified a number of high risks that surfaced during\n            the course of implementation and as such, could be addressed\n            by the project team in a timely manner. Among the highest\n            risks identified were inadequate or late counterpart\n            funding, potential political interference in drawing up\n            annual work programs, inability of the government to acquire\n            additional land, if required, selection of inappropriate\n            contractors, and inability to motivate participating\n            communities to comply with contract conditions. The second\n            reason for the project's success was that recognizing\n            the small size of the civil service in PNG, and the relative\n            inexperience with Bank guidelines and procedures, the\n            project funded a long term, full time Employer's\n            Project Manager to supplement (not supplant) Department of\n            Works (DOW) staff numbers and capabilities. Thirdly,\n            recognizing the large number of potential risks, the Bank\n            project team was proactive in closely supervising the\n            project through regular missions and site visits with\n            government counterparts to verify implementation progress\n            against agreed work plans, the quality of remote works, and\n            compliance with safeguards. Fourthly, the socio-economic\n            impacts of the project works were systematically monitored\n            across beneficiary and control (non-beneficiary) communities\n            in all provinces. The results of these surveys were\n            presented to DOW and other technical staff during the course\n            of the project, highlighting the educational, health and\n            local economic development benefits of improved access, and\n            also identified some of the negative impacts of the program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Papua New Guinea - Road Maintenance and\n

of this project is in\n            response to the relevant request from the Government of\n            Papua New Guinea (GoPNG) and is limited to the extension of\n            the project closing date from December 31, 2011 to June 30,\n            2012 and reallocation among project categories.\n            Implementation progress of the additional financing of Road\n            Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project (RMRP) is rated as\n            satisfactory, with a disbursement rate of 86 percent (end\n            October 2011). All works contracts of RMRP are now\n            completed, apart from two significant roads rehabilitation\n            contracts which were due to be completed in November 2011,\n            but have faced delays and are currently under continuing\n            execution. Delays with the remaining contracts were\n            primarily due to adverse working conditions (mainly\n            extremely adverse weather, which has hindered access to\n            construction materials and delayed overall progress) and\n            under resourcing of plant, labor and equipment by the key\n            contractor of the projects. The performance of the\n            implementing agency has been satisfactory and project\n            implementation is satisfactory despite often challenging\n            circumstances. The construction of a Liquefied Natural Gas\n            pipeline and processing facility has taxed the domestic\n            contracting capacity and caused fierce competition for\n            contractors. The inflationary price environment in PNG has\n            also affected contracting capacity. This project\n            restructuring would extend project closing date from\n            December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012 with the Regional Vice\n            President's approval.

The supply and maintenance\n            of roads and related infrastructure in the country was\n            complicated due to the rugged, mountainous landscape, a\n            widely dispersed population, and unconnected road networks.\n            Further, the roads sector suffered from inadequate funding,\n            land acquisition difficulties, law and order problems, a\n            small base of private contractors, and limited private\n            sector and community participation. The primary goal of the\n            Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project funded by World\n            Bank was to promote an efficient, safe, and reliable roads\n            transport system in the participating provinces. It focused\n            on the financing of road maintenance and the rehabilitation\n            of national roads and bridges.
