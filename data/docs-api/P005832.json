Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (a) emphasis on\n            policy change and institutional   development can have a\n            major impact on sector performance, especially if pursued\n            consistently in a series of operations; and (b) in an\n            inflationary environment,the implementation of civil works\n
