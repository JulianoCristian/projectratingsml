Even\n            though the physical objectives were somewhat met, the\n            project failed to meet the agreed financial targets on\n            break-even requirement, accounts receivable, and debt\n            service coverage minima. Subsequently, at the time of\n            retrofitting in mid-1997, several covenants were deleted\n            from the Development Credit Agreement and the project\n            development objectives as included in the Project Status\n            Report were modified to reflect the project's revised\n            goal of rehabilitating Aden's war-damaged power\n            facilities. The sustainability of the physical investments\n            financed under the project is assessed as likely since they\n            form an integral part of the transmission and distribution\n            system for the Aden Branch of the Public Electricity\n            Corporation (PEC). However, PEC as an entity has yet to\n            achieve financial viability. World Bank performance is\n            adjudged satisfactory while Borrower performance is rated\n            unsatisfactory. Key lessons concerned avoiding disagreements\n            over contract awards by precisely drafting evaluation\n            criteria in bidding documents; re-assessing the\n            appropriateness of initial project objectives when major\n            changes in the political, fiscal, and institutional\n            environment are called for; avoiding procuring materials for\n            works needed to fulfill project objectives and leaving it to\n            the implementing agency after credit closure; supporting\n            agreed loan covenants with appropriate action plans; and\n            improving project implementation with close supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic of Yemen -
