Lessons learned\n            from this assessment included: in disaster prone countries,\n            regular monitoring and reporting of rainfall patterns, food\n            balances (domestic consumption, production, imports\n            including informal cross border trade), and crop prices is\n            critical for timely mitigation and emergency response\n            measures; Bank assistance should pay particular attention to\n            food security issues in countries with chronic food\n            insecurity and vulnerable to natural disasters; reducing\n            food insecurity requires inter alia broad-based sources of\n            livelihood including non-farm incomes; effective management\n            of a strategic grain reserve requires the management of

- Emergency Drought Recovery Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Project ratings are as follows: Project\n            outcome is satisfactory; sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is substantial; Bank\n            performance is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. Several lessons were cited including the\n            following: (1) A technically sound emergency operation can\n            only be designed on the basis of sound statistics and\n            credible policy. (2) For emergency recovery loans to be\n            successful there should be no impediments in the\n            institutional arrangements that could slow down\n            disbursements as this would defeat the purpose of the loan.\n            (3) To make the fullest impact, emergency projects have to\n            demonstrate quick wins in the shortest possible time. This\n            entails starting with income transfer programs and quick\n            disbursements that gain momentum rapidly and reach their\n            peak in the first year. (4) Since the emergency operation\n            should focus on impacting the affected target group\n            immediately, it is important that safety nets be given a\n            high priority and be appropriately costed. (5) To be readily\n            responsive to Government in an emergency setting, it is\n            essential that the supervision task team is country office\n            based. (6) To avoid being in a response mode all the time,\n            Government needs to look at ways of developing ex-ante\n            instruments for responding to and managing extreme\n            weather-based shocks to the system. (7) Especially for\n            Emergency Relief Operations, an efficient monitoring and\n            evaluation system needs to be developed and implemented in a\n            very short time. (8) Disbursements based on prior claims and\n            the submission of detailed supporting documents and original\n            receipts are not ideal for Economic Recovery Loans, nor for\n            speedy disbursements, nor suited for an environment where\n            foreign exchange transactions are liberalized."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi -

Emergency Drought Recovery Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objectives of the Emergency Drought\n            Recovery Project are to allow the Government maintain key\n            commitments to economic priorities, and investments\n            consistent with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)\n            process, and fulfill immediate obligations to avert famine.\n            Moreover, the project will help restore the productive\n            capability of the populations, and support longer term\n            disaster management by the Government. Activities financed\n            by the project will complement relief efforts, contribute to\n            recovery, facilitate continued progress on key economic\n            priorities and investments, and address the needs of\n            vulnerable groups during this difficult period of crisis.\n            The components include: 1) a quick disbursing assistance to\n            support critical imports, 2) support for expansion of public\n            works programs, and essential social investments, and\n            services to vulnerable groups; and, 3) support for\n            implementation, technical assistance, and studies to\n            facilitate economic recovery. Risks however point at\n            potential delays in the delivery of pledged humanitarian\n            assistance by other donors, and, given the magnitude of the\n            effort and logistical challenges, relief may not be fully\n            successful. To mitigate this, donors have sent a joint task\n            force to coordinate, monitor, and report on pledges,\n            shipments and disbursements. Risk of mismanagement of\n            project funds will be minimized by establishing effective\n            mechanisms to ensure transparent utilization of resources,\n            through strict auditing, and reporting requirements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Emergency Drought Recovery Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malawi - Emergency Drought\n            Recovery Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/09/2022850/malawi-emergency-drought-recovery-project","projn":"MW-Emergency Drought Recovery Project -- P080368","docty":"Technical Annex","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Business in Development,Business Environment,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"Malawi","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02100804010737"},"subsc":"Other social services,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,Accounting,accounting\n            policies,accounting practices,accounting\n            standards,Accounts,Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            equipment,agricultural growth,agricultural\n            technology,Agriculture,animal health,animal\n            products,audits,cassava,CIDA,Commodities,conditionality,crop\n            harvests,crop yields,cropping,crops,debt,decision\n            making,Deregulation,diseases,Employment,equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,Expenditure,expenditures,extension,extension\n            services,FAO,farmers,farming,fertilizers,Financial\n            Management,Financial Reporting,financial reports,financial\n            statements,food security,Food\n            supply,hunger,imports,income,income\n            distribution,incomes,internal audit,Irrigation,land\n            resources,livelihoods,livestock,logging,maize,malnutrition,market\n            prices,Marketing,NGOs,Nutrition,potatoes,Poverty\n            Alleviation,poverty reduction,private\n            sector,Procurement,producers,productivity,public\n            services,purchasing,purchasing power,roots,Rural\n            Development,sales,soil fertility,UNDP,United Nations,United\n            Nations Development Programme,United States Agency for\n            International Development,USAID,water logging,weather patterns"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,Accounting,accounting\n            policies,accounting practices,accounting\n            standards,Accounts,Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            equipment,agricultural growth,agricultural\n            technology,Agriculture,animal health,animal\n            products,audits,cassava,CIDA,Commodities,conditionality,crop\n            harvests,crop yields,cropping,crops,debt,decision\n            making,Deregulation,diseases,Employment,equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,Expenditure,expenditures,extension,extension\n            services,FAO,farmers,farming,fertilizers,Financial\n            Management,Financial Reporting,financial reports,financial\n            statements,food security,Food\n            supply,hunger,imports,income,income\n            distribution,incomes,internal audit,Irrigation,land\n            resources,livelihoods,livestock,logging,maize,malnutrition,market\n            prices,Marketing,NGOs,Nutrition,potatoes,Poverty\n            Alleviation,poverty reduction,private\n            sector,Procurement,producers,productivity,public\n            services,purchasing,purchasing power,roots,Rural\n            Development,sales,soil fertility,UNDP,United Nations,United\n            Nations Development Programme,United States Agency for\n            International Development,USAID,water logging,weather patterns"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 1 (AFTS1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"T7557"},"facets":{}}}
