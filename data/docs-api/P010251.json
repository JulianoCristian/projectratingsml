The\n            project achieved some of its overall objectives, its impact\n            on institutional development has been significant,\n            sustainability is unlikely, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was marginally satisfactory. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, project\n            design should be simplified, focused on specific\n            sub-sectors, and have more modest objectives. Second, while\n            designing institutional strengthening and revenue generation\n            proposals, political compulsion and administrative\n            capabilities should be carefully analyzed. Third,\n            inter-agency coordination must be improved and\n            responsibilities consolidated at the metropolitan level for\n            the efficient delivery of urban services. Fourth, greater\n            community participation and ownership is required for\n            upgrading low income communities. Fifth, greater borrower\n            ownership and a longer term commitment of resources for\n            technical assistance/training is required for making\n            sustainable institutional improvements. Finally, private\n            sector participation in the financing and operation of urban\n            services may have a greater impact on the provision of\n            services in the future than the traditional approach that\n            has relied on the institutional and financial strengthening\n            of public sector agencies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -

These objectives will be\n            achieved through a series of subsectoral interventions, with\n            physical improvements combined with specific institutional\n            and financial measures in the area of water and sewerage,\n            flood control and drainage, transportation, katchi abadi\n            upgrading, solid waste management, resource generation, and\n            metropolitan management. The main risk to the project will\n            be the ability of some of the implementing agencies to\n            attract and retain capable staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Karachi Special Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan -
