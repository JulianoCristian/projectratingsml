Its\n            re-estimated economic and financial rates of return exceed\n            those estimated at appraisal. It also has large, though\n            difficult to quantify, environmental and institutional\n            benefits. The project is likely to have an enduring impact\n            on the development of commercial forestry, particularly the\n            development of the non-state sector. The Bank's\n            performance was good. It reacted positively and swiftly to\n            the government's initial proposal in early 1988,\n            maintained a proper focus on afforestation to the exclusion\n            of complicating factors, provided continuity in staffing,\n            and capitalized on the preparation of two follow-on projects\n            to accelerate dissemination of research findings. The\n            Borrower's performance was highly satisfactory in all\n            stages of the project. Physical implementation, financial\n            management, planning and monitoring, and preparation of\n            documents were all rated as highly satisfactory.\n            Sustainability is rated as likely, and in particular the\n            plantations are virtually certain to survive and generate\n            economic returns as forecasted. Six key lessons are as\n            follows. First, the Borrower took ownership as the project\n            was initiated by the highest level of government and enjoyed\n            strong political support throughout implementation. Second,\n            where institutional capacity is robust, an investment\n            project can be treated as a program or sector loan. Third, a\n            project with highly focused investment objectives can\n            nonetheless generate a broad sectoral impact. Fourth,\n            further sectoral policy reform is needed to complete the\n            transition to a market economy. Fifth, the project achieved\n            a high impact from research that had already been done, but\n            did not address the broader constraints affecting future\n            research. Sixth, the linkage of financial control with\n            technical standards was critical to project success."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - National Afforestation
