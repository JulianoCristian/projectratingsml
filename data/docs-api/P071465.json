Both the Banks\u0092 and the Borrowers\u0092\n            performances were moderately satisfactory. In March 2009, a\n            reallocation of GEF proceeds was approved to increase the\n            allocation of funds for training. In September 2009, a\n            mid-term review (MTR) of the Project was conducted and\n            several changes were agreed. The Project Implementation Unit\n            (PIU) adopted these changes immediately after the MTR,\n            including changes in staff, adoption of revised indicator\n            targets and a revised work plan. The corresponding formal\n            restructuring (Level 2) happened in August 2011, due to\n            Government\u0092s delays in officially sending the request for\n            Project restructuring. At the time of restructuring, partial\n            disbursement of IDA credit and GEF grant had been disbursed,\n            and resulted in changes to the Project\u0092s indicator targets,\n            reallocation of Grant proceeds and changes to some Project\n            activities. In March 2012, a second Level 2 restructuring\n            was approved to allow some corrections in the disbursement\n            categories of Consultant Services and Training of the IDA\n            Credit and GEF Grant Agreements. In March 2013, the closing\n            date was extended from June 30, 2013 to June 30, 2014. There\n            were several lessons learned from this project and are as\n            follows: (1) Continued and high-level political commitment\n            to conservation is needed to move the agenda forward,\n            particularly when pressures from other sectors on protected\n            areas are strong. (2) Long-term World Bank engagement in the\n            conservation and tourism agendas is needed to foster\n            institutional changes. (3) Developing nature-based tourism\n            asset is a long-term process. (4) Tourism as a means to\n            generate sustainable financing for PAs. (5) Enhancing the\n            benefits from PAs to local communities needs to go beyond\n            the promotion of tourism, and encompass a broader array of\n            integrated conservation development activities, particularly\n            those related to sustainable natural resource management.\n            (6) Professional facilitation is needed for the public\n            sector to be able to attract private investment into PA\n            concessions. (7) Importance of innovative partnerships in\n            conservation. In order to mitigate the lack of local\n            capacity and appropriate institutional coordination, the\n            Project partnered with NGOs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Transfrontier
