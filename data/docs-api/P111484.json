Ratings for the Education Reform\n            Project in Albania were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: 1) in a country emerging from\n            difficult financial and social circumstances, emergency\n            civil works repairs are a necessary and appropriate\n            investment. To deal with the lack of experience and limited\n            human capital available, simple project designs are also\n            appropriate; 2) curricular structures determine numbers of\n            teachers, qualifications, textbooks, and building use and\n            may thus have long-term effects. Streamlining curricula can\n            help reduce sectoral inefficiency and improve use of\n            financial resources. The Bank should be more proactive in\n            advising governments about efficient curricular structures;\n            3) if timed right, budget support loans may encourage\n            governments to take action in implementing reforms, such as\n            obtaining parliamentary approval for laws that are important\n            for various sectors. When designing these operations, the\n            Bank must be careful to maximize complementarities and to\n            establish feasible monitoring mechanisms; and 4) for new\n            Bank clients, objectives and expectations for outputs and\n            outcomes should be kept simple and realistic. Intensive\n            supervision is required, for which the Bank must\n            appropriately assign resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - School Rehabilitation and Capacity\n
