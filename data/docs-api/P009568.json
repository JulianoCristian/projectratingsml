The overall outcome of the project is rated\n            highly satisfactory; the performance of the World Bank is\n            rated satisfactory and the performance of the Royal\n            Government of Bhutan (RGOB) was rated satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from this project are as follows: (i) Legal\n            framework - It is essential for trust funds to have a legal\n            framework to institutionalize collaboration between donors\n            and recipients, make decision making and implementation\n            transparent, and make management accountable. (ii)\n            Benchmarks - Concrete conservation program benchmarks during\n            the first five years served as useful incentives, as clear\n            indicators of achievement, and as mechanisms to mobilize\n            donor support additional to that which was initially\n            provided by the trust fund. It would have been helpful if\n            the benchmarks addressed not only conservation program\n            achievements, but also institutional development of the\n            trust fund entity itself. (iii) Start-up Funding - World\n            Wildlife Fund. U.S. (WWF-US) provided valuable support\n            during the start-up of the benchmark activities, separate\n            from the uncertain investment income. During the initial\n            period of trust fund establishment, it is essential to have\n            reliable funding that does not depend upon investment\n            income. (iv) Donor Support - RGOB's strong reputation\n            for integrity in governance, its demonstrated commitment to\n            conservation, and the small size of the country (with\n            associated support from interested European countries) all\n            contributed to willingness of donors to make relatively\n            large contributions. These conditions may limit the\n            likelihood of replicating comparable levels of support for\n            trust funds in many other countries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bhutan - Environmental Conservation Trust\n            Fund Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bhutan - Environmental\n            Conservation Trust Fund Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/04/731738/bhutan-environmental-conservation-trust-fund-project","projn":"BT-Trust Fund For Env. -- P009568","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Tourism and Ecotourism,Environmental Management,TF054599-PHRD-KYRGYZ REPUBLIC: WATER\n            MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT PROJECT,Water Conservation,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Bhutan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980624164533"},"subsc":"Other social services,Roads and highways,Central government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Biodiversity,biodiversity\n            conservation,biological diversity,civil\n            service,collaboration,commitment,community\n            participation,consensus,conservation activities,conservation\n            objectives,conservation of biodiversity,Conservation of\n            Nature,conservation policies,Conservation Trust,Conservation\n            Trust Fund,consultation,counterpart,counterpart\n            funds,disbursement,Disbursements,Environmental\n            Conservation,environmental degradation,Environmental\n            Strategy,environmental trust\n            funds,fauna,feasibility,financial\n            resources,flexibility,flora,Forestry,fund management,funding\n            proposals,Global Environment,Global Environment\n            Facility,Governmental Organization,habitat,habitat\n            destruction,institutional capacity,institutional\n            development,institutional strengthening,Loan,local\n            capacity,local government,National Park,national\n            parks,National Protected Areas,Natural Resource,natural\n            resource base,natural resource management,Nature\n            Conservation,negotiations,park management,participatory\n            planning,preparation,programs,Rural Development,service\n            training,species of flora,stakeholder,stakeholder\n            involvement,stakeholders,Sustainability,tranche,transparency,trust funds"},"1":{"cdata!":"Biodiversity,biodiversity\n            conservation,biological diversity,civil\n            service,collaboration,commitment,community\n            participation,consensus,conservation activities,conservation\n            objectives,conservation of biodiversity,Conservation of\n            Nature,conservation policies,Conservation Trust,Conservation\n            Trust Fund,consultation,counterpart,counterpart\n            funds,disbursement,Disbursements,Environmental\n            Conservation,environmental degradation,Environmental\n            Strategy,environmental trust\n            funds,fauna,feasibility,financial\n            resources,flexibility,flora,Forestry,fund management,funding\n            proposals,Global Environment,Global Environment\n            Facility,Governmental Organization,habitat,habitat\n            destruction,institutional capacity,institutional\n            development,institutional strengthening,Loan,local\n            capacity,local government,National Park,national\n            parks,National Protected Areas,Natural Resource,natural\n            resource base,natural resource management,Nature\n            Conservation,negotiations,park management,participatory\n            planning,preparation,programs,Rural Development,service\n            training,species of flora,stakeholder,stakeholder\n            involvement,stakeholders,Sustainability,tranche,transparency,trust funds"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF028602-GET-BHUTAN ENV.

The\n            second is to test the feasibility of trust funds as a\n            mechanism for providing long-term and sustainable support\n            for conservation of biological diversity.  The specific\n            activities supported under the project will include, but not\n            be limited to:  (a) upgrading the Department of\n            Forestry's Wildlife Division to a Nature Conservation\n            Division, providing additional staff and training, and\n            strengthening its capacity to plan and manage a national\n            protected areas system and to monitor changes in biological\n            diversity; (b) establishing a national system of protected\n            areas by identifying areas for protection, designating\n            different protection categories, and prioritizing protected\n            areas for management; (c) gazetting four priority protected\n            areas and developing one detailed management plan that will\n            serve as a model for other areas; (d) strengthening the\n            management of two existing priority protected areas among\n            other things through the provision of additional staff,\n            training inventories and research, and infrastructure\n            development; and (e) establishing, in phases, additional\n            protected areas such as the Black Mountain
