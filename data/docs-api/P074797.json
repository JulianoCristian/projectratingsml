Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) the critical importance of committed\n            and reform minded senior management team, and capable\n            project team, for implementing and sustaining deep\n            institutional reforms, especially technologically and\n            institutionally complex reforms in an institution, which\n            historically worked like a rigid and bureaucratic government\n            department, 2) this lesson relates to implementation of\n            large scale 'state of the art' Information\n            Technology (IT) programs in a public sector setting, with\n            limited initial in-house IT knowledge or capacity. The\n            experience under the TABS was very challenging for both the\n            Bank and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) teams, 3) the Bank\n            team believes that delays in completion of project\n            activities could have been avoided if there was greater\n            realism built into assessing the Implementing Agency (IA)\n            capacity for handling complex transactions especially those\n            involving IT and automation, and 4) the final lesson relates\n            to ex-ante assessment of the likelihood of reforms bringing\n            about the expected level of improvement in the\n            institution's performance. The critical issue is to\n            rigorously examine whether the IA has the necessary legal\n            and administrative autonomy and 'space', so that\n            the reformed IA and its better trained staff fully deliver\n            on the institution's key mandates. While better\n            qualified staff, market linked salaries and merit based\n            promotions are necessary, they are not sufficient in\n            themselves to ensure institutional performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Banking Sector Technical\n            Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Banking Sector\n            Technical Assistance
