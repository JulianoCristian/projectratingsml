The ratings for the Education Enhancement\n            Program Project of Egypt are as follows: outcome was\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to development was moderate;\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and the\n            performance of the Borrower was also rated as moderately\n            satisfactory. The main lessons from the experience of these\n            two projects are as follows: 1) governments may carry out\n            project activities as expected in lending documents but\n            hesitate to implement policies at the agreed pace. Donors\n            who finance hardware activities in expectations of policy\n            changes may face difficult decisions. The donor community\n            may use study results and other information to invite wider\n            public debate on necessary policy changes; 2) in all\n            sectors, a line of reasoning is necessary for linking\n            expected outcomes with activities undertaken during\n            implementation. A clear line of reasoning and attribution of\n            causality is critical in complex projects with multiple\n            components. Efforts must be made to measure intermediate\n            outcomes (such as instructional time use or reading fluency\n            in education) in order to test hypotheses and determine\n            which activities contribute the most to development\n            outcomes; 3) during appraisal and implementation, emphasis\n            is often on the big picture and on global indicators of\n            development objectives. To achieve the expected effects,\n            however, the Bank should pay closer attention to execution\n            of the details, the pixels which constitute the big picture.\n            State-of the art sectoral knowledge and local language\n            knowledge are important in monitoring the degree to which\n            basic skills are achieved; 4) targeted awareness campaigns\n            make it possible to increase female enrollments even in\n            areas that are hard to reach. However, mere enrollments may\n            not be sufficient to help girls' labor market outcomes.\n            Quality education is necessary to increase educational\n            attainment among the poor and disadvantaged; and 5) donor\n            coordination is important in the financing of activities\n            that are to benefit the poor. Complementary skills among\n            donor staff can result in improved project performance in\n            ways that can benefit large and complex countries, like Egypt."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt

- Education Enhancement Program Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Education Enhancement\n            Program Project for Egypt were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the long\n            disbursement profile indicates that different approaches to\n            project design need to be adopted. Bank and government may\n            want to consider using loan instruments other than standard\n            investment projects such as developing policy lending, which\n            is linked to policy changes and indicators rather than the\n            management of outputs. If standard investment projects are\n            to be used, more realistic assessments of the disbursement\n            profile need to be incorporated into project design. Merge\n            sector dialogue with government-wide discussions. In many\n            cases, the impact of education projects is circumscribed by\n            government-wide constraints. Education sector improvements\n            are linked to progress in other government-wide reforms and\n            initiatives, such as decentralization, promotion of the\n            private sector, and civil service reform. To address\n            structural issues such as Ministry of Educations\n            (MOE's) absorptive capacity, teacher incentives, and\n            decentralization, policy dialogue that includes the MOE, as\n            well as a wide range of other government authorities and\n            education stakeholders, should be undertaken. Create the\n            conditions to successfully generalize promising approaches.\n            There are several successful initiatives introduced by the\n            project, such as the ESP, the use of community\n            participation, improvements in pre-service training, and\n            changes to the Educational MIS (EMIS) that have been\n            undertaken as pilots. To build on these successes, efforts\n            should focus on ways to incorporate and maintain them into\n            standard practice."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Education Enhancement Program
