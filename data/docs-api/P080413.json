Such mobility, particularly as a result of\n            conflict-related displacement, can act as a source of HIV\n            infection to host populations and can create situations in\n            which these populations are extremely vulnerable to HIV\n            infection. According to the World Bank draft guidelines for\n            social assessment of HIV/AIDS projects, a major analytical\n            and operational tool for development interventions\n            associated with HIV/AIDS prevention, care, support, and\n            mitigation, poverty and gender issues are at the heart of\n            the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This implies that social, cultural\n            and economic factors are likely to play a significant role\n            in the spread of HIV/AIDS. Further, as a result of this\n            mobility and the vulnerability of these populations to HIV\n            transmission and infection, special initiatives are needed\n            to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS in the GLR. This requires a\n            collaborative effort between the six countries that\n            constitute the GLR if the spread of HIV/AIDS is to be\n            controlled. Therefore, such initiatives must be based on a\n            thorough understanding of factors influencing HIV/AIDS\n            transmission within these populations, and between these\n            populations and others. Social and gender assessment of\n            HIV/AIDS in refugee and Internally Displaced Populations\n            (IDPs) in the three selected GLR countries, Tanzania,\n            Uganda, and the DRC; was designed to investigate these\n            social, economic, cultural, and behavioral factors that\n            influence the transmission of HIV. This assessment will\n            provide information to the recently formalized Great Lakes\n            Initiative on AIDS (GLIA) as well as national stakeholders\n            that will guide the development of the appropriate HIV/AIDS\n            initiatives in the region. The overarching objective of this\n            study was to: (i) improve the understanding of the social,\n            gender and economic patterns of interaction within the\n            refugees and IDP; and (ii) advance policy-makers and program\n            managers knowledge of how HIV/AIDS affects these populations\n            and the host communities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"A social and

This\n            component will provide important reinforcement of national,\n            and under-funded regional advocacy efforts to reduce the\n            stigma of those infected and affected; and, engage in the\n            sharing and testing of people living with HIV/AIDS, through\n            support practices by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs),\n            and the private sector for this vulnerable population.\n            Component 3 - support to Regional health-sector\n            collaboration will be provided for a) an inventory of\n            effective interventions and information sharing, b) review\n            of protocols, materials and training opportunities for\n            prevention and treatment, c) information exchange on\n            refugee, displaced, or returnee concerning HIV/AIDS\n            health-related programs, d) transport sector HIV/AIDS\n            strategy coordination and piloting of targeted transport\n            packages along two main regional roads, and. e) information\n            exchange on drug policies and procurement. Finally,\n            Component 4 - Management, capacity strengthening, monitoring\n            and evaluation, and reporting, covers three activities: 1)\n            administration and management; 2) capacity strengthening and\n            Policy discussion/technical support; and, 3) monitoring and\n            evaluation, and reporting activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Un projet a l'appui de\n            l'initiative des pays des Grands Lacs dans la lutte\n            contre le SIDA (GLIA)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"R\u00e9gion Afrique \u2013 Un projet \u00e0\n            l\u2019appui de l\u2019Initiative des pays des Grands lacs dans la\n            lutte contre le SIDA (GLIA) : Un projet \u00e0 l\u2019appui de\n            l\u2019initiative des pays des Grands Lacs dans la lutte contre\n            le SIDA (GLIA)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/02/6469692/africa-region-great-lakes-initiative-hivaids-glia-support-project-un-projet-lappui-de-linitiative-des-pays-des-grands-lacs-dans-la-lutte-contre-le-sida-glia","projn":"3A-Great Lakes Initiative On Hiv/Aids (Glia)\n            Support -- P080413","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,HIV AIDS,Health Economics & Finance,ICT Policy and Strategies,Poverty Impact Evaluation","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Poverty Reduction,Information and Communication Technologies","count":"Africa","entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20051212102529"},"subsc":"Health,Other social services","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Poverty Reduction,Information and Communication Technologies","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, adults, advocacy, aged,\n            audits, Bidding, budgeting, capacity, civil society,\n            collaboration, communities, Competitive Bidding, Councils,\n            data capture, data collection, data sources, decision\n            making, decision-making, disasters, drug policies, ethnic\n            groups, Exchange Rate, expenditures, families, Financial\n            Analysis, Financial Management, health policies, health\n            sector, HIV infection, Human Development, infants,\n            institutional capacity, international assistance,\n            intervention, knowledge sharing, learning, legal framework,\n            Lessons learned, Management, management capacity, Management\n            Contract, management information, management training,\n            Migration, mothers, operating costs, operations research,\n            Partnership, patients, performance indicators, pregnant\n            women, private sector, Procurement, programs, project cycle,\n            project implementation, Project Preparation, Refugees,\n            rehabilitation, service delivery, sexual intercourse, social\n            development, Supervision, teams, technical assistance,\n            Tuberculosis, UNAIDS, workers, World Health Organization"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 3 (AFTH3)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF020999-THE MULTI-COUNTRY HIV/AIDS\n            PROGRAM FOR AFRICA,TF052162-BNPP-GENDER:TRUST FUND FOR\n            GENDER MAINSTREAMING (GENFUND),TF052677-PHRD-RWANDA: GREAT LAKES\n            INITIATIVE ON HIV/AIDS (GLIA),TF053609-TFESSD-GLIA ON HIV/AIDS AND REFUGEES","repnb":"30267","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Un projet a l'appui de\n            l'initiative des pays des Grands Lacs dans la lutte\n            contre le SIDA (GLIA)"}}},"5324877":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/11/5324877/africa-region-great-lakes-initiative-hivaids-glia-support-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/11/5324877/africa-region-great-lakes-initiative-hivaids-glia-support-project","new_url":"2004/11/5324877/africa-region-great-lakes-initiative-hivaids-glia-support-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","docm_id":"090224b0828a6bf9","chronical_docm_id":"090224b0828a6bf9","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/11/11/000104615_20041112092827/Rendered/INDEX/GLIA0PID010Nov09.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/11/11/000104615_20041112092827/Rendered/PDF/GLIA0PID010Nov09.pdf","credit_no":"Q454","docdt":"2004-11-10T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2004-11-12T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Revised","versiontyp_key":"1309936","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Africa Region -
