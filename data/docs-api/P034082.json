Lessons suggest\n            that: 1) implementation of the pension system reform, has\n            proved extremely popular among the working population,\n            attracting a much larger number of workers than previously\n            thought. The voluntary decision to switch to the new\n            multi-pillar pension system - comprising a public\n            Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system, and a funded, and\n            privately-managed system - was motivated by several factors,\n            largely because of higher returns expectations, and the\n            perception of political risk in the public system. However,\n            overselling of the new system seems to have occurred, making\n            older workers switch, when actually they would be better-off\n            staying in the reformed PAYG; 2) the changes introduced by\n            the new Government to the original design, which reflected\n            different policy objectives, such as the cost to employers\n            of social security contributions, and concerns about the\n            impact of reforms on public finances, caused the Government\n            not to proceed as prescribed by law in 1997. Unless such\n            increases are effected in the short run, serious\n            implications for both members, and market participants could\n            arise; and, 3) in the area of disability pensions, the\n            program has been unsatisfactory, since none of the reforms\n            were incorporated, nor implemented. Restoring contribution\n            rates, and strengthening pension funds' regulatory, and\n            supervisory framework should be achieved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Hungary - Public Sector
