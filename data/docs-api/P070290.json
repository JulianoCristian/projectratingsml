Some lessons learned includes:\n            first, to adequately address the potential trade-off between\n            a project's technical scope and its geographical reach,\n            project design must be both simple and adaptable to changes\n            in both the policy and political environments. Second, while\n            a previous health Implementation Completion Report (ICR)\n            concluded that it was essential to focus on results, another\n            was somewhat more nuanced arguing that a supply approach\n            needs strong capacity to strategically administer, combine\n            and utilize inputs to achieve results. Third, rigorous\n            national-level monitoring and evaluation measures with\n            accountability at state and local levels are crucial for\n            project success. Finally, technical staff of the state\n            ministry of health and the state ministry of local\n            government should participate in project preparation to\n            engage and
