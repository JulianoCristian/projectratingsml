Both\n            the Bank and the borrower performances were moderately\n            satisfactory. The main lessons learned include: (1)\n            Political economy challenges reduced the effectiveness of\n            the project. The shift in political situation in the country\n            prevailing for most of the project implementation did not\n            allow the Government of Eritrea to demobilize all the\n            200,000 soldiers as envisaged, leading to the adjustments in\n            the project which were made during the MTR in 2005 to\n            partially reflect the new situation. (2) Unrealized funding\n            pledges can affect project implementation and results. (3)\n            Project management effectiveness is enhanced by support\n            arising from highest level of the Government. The high level\n            support enabled the NCDRP to mobilize other actors in the\n            country behind common policy goals. (4) Timely reinsertion\n            payments effectively delivered immediate benefits to the\n            demobilized soldiers (DS). (5) The social reintegration\n            process holds the key for the overall DS reintegration\n            process. (6) Targeting reintegration support to the DS in\n            combination with support to the wider community with a\n            gradual shift towards the latter lead to effective\n            achievement of results.

Reintegration Project are to: 1) demobilize and provide\n            reinsertion support to about 200,000 soldiers in three\n            phases; 2) support the social and economic reintegration of\n            demobilized soldiers, including strengthening of\n            institutional capacities of relevant government and local\n            implementing partners; and 3) support macroeconomic\n            stability. This Credit , constituting the first phase of the\n            Program finances the demobilization of 60,000 soldiers.\n            There are three project components: demobilization,\n            reinsertion support in the form of a transitional safety net\n            (TSN); and social and economic reintegration. Activities\n            under the first component include: assembly; identification;\n            collection of socioeconomic data; pre-discharge orientation;\n            and transport to communities of return. With the second\n            component, demobilized soldiers will receive allowances to\n            cover his/her personal or family's basic material\n            needs. Additional support will be provided to demobilized\n            soldiers with severe or moderate disability and those with\n            severe chronic illness. The third component focuses\n            attention on these vulnerable groups: female soldiers, those\n            who were disabled because of war, and HIV positive soldiers.\n            Activities include information and sensitization, social and\n            economic information and referral services, counseling, and\n            strengthening of social capital.
