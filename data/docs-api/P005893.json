The principal objectives of the project, to\n            increase the capacity for potable water production for the\n            city of Al Mukalla, was achieved after the project was\n            redesigned, and, institutional capability was strengthened.\n            Effective demand for water is expected by the year 2002,\n            thus to ensure sustainability, the Government is committed\n            to grant the Al Mukalla branch of the National Water and\n            Sanitation Authority, full autonomy, to further improve cost\n            recovery, and focus on the expansion of water distribution\n            and sewerage networks. This autonomy will also strengthen\n            financial management, to set its own tariffs ensuring its\n            own viability. The lessons experienced from this project\n            suggest that: 1) close supervision, and flexibility to\n            changes may prod success, even when facing serious\n            implementation problems as was this case; 2) it is critical\n            for the implementation of complex projects to attain\n            experienced contractors; 3) local currency funds should be\n            ensured at the early stages, since delays will cause\n            implementation interruptions; 4) Long term sustainability of\n            project benefits, is ensured by sector reforms, which foster\n            institutional strengthening, and financial/management\n            systems; and, 5) while problems were encountered, close\n            cooperation and agreement with the borrower was paramount to\n            the success of the operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Al Mukalla Water Supply Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen - Al Mukalla Water Supply Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/06/728596/yemen-al-mukalla-water-supply-project","projn":"RY-Al Mukalla Water Supply -- P005893","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Yemen, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_9912140530381"},"subsc":"Water supply","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adequate water,adequate water\n            supply,available water,available water resources,clean\n            water,collection of water,cost recovery,debt,distribution\n            system,distribution systems,economic\n            analysis,effluent,effluents,environmental\n            benefits,Environmental Impact,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,exploitation,financial\n            viability,groundwater,groundwater\n            resources,inflation,investment costs,investment\n            program,iron,liters per second,living conditions,operational\n            costs,pipeline,potable water,productivity,Public\n            Water,Public works,pumping,pumping station,raw\n            water,replacement costs,reservoirs,sale of water,Sanitation\n            Authority,savings,sewerage system,Sud,supply of water,tariff\n            setting,towns,urban growth,wages,wastewater,wastewater\n            management,water charges,water demand,water\n            distribution,water distribution system,water meters,water\n            production,water resources,water sales,water sector,water\n            shortages,water sources,water supplies,Water Supply,water\n            supply projects,water supply system,water tables,water tariffs"},"1":{"cdata!":"adequate water,adequate water\n            supply,available water,available water resources,clean\n            water,collection of water,cost recovery,debt,distribution\n            system,distribution systems,economic\n            analysis,effluent,effluents,environmental\n            benefits,Environmental Impact,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,exploitation,financial\n            viability,groundwater,groundwater\n            resources,inflation,investment costs,investment\n            program,iron,liters per second,living conditions,operational\n            costs,pipeline,potable water,productivity,Public\n            Water,Public works,pumping,pumping station,raw\n            water,replacement costs,reservoirs,sale of water,Sanitation\n            Authority,savings,sewerage system,Sud,supply of water,tariff\n            setting,towns,urban growth,wages,wastewater,wastewater\n            management,water charges,water demand,water\n            distribution,water distribution system,water meters,water\n            production,water resources,water sales,water sector,water\n            shortages,water sources,water supplies,Water Supply,water\n            supply projects,water supply system,water tables,water tariffs"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF037102-YEMEN - SANA'S WS.,\n            NAT'L COM.
