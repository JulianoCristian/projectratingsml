The significant delay in start-up reflected\n            the underlying problems which beset the project. Despite\n            remedial efforts the project failed, even partially, to meet\n            its objective. None of the project components has sustained\n            its activities. Fundamental weaknesses in design and\n            preparation stemmed from ignoring the risk of\n            socio-political instability; ignoring the views of\n            commercial banks; failing to reach an agreement with the\n            Bank of Central African States; delaying project start-up;\n            and slowly responding to the Borrower's perceived\n            inertia. Consequently, World Bank performance was\n            unsatisfactory. The considerable efforts made during\n            supervision to place the project on track were thwarted by\n            mutinies and do not alter this conclusion. Borrower\n            ownership and commitment to the project were weak throughout\n            the project. Furthermore, the complex nature of the project\n            demanded a high level of determination and coordination that\n            was not forthcoming. Therefore, Borrower performance was\n            rated as highly unsatisfactory. This type of project should\n            not be launched when there is uncertainty about the\n            necessary conditions for investment and business. Critical\n            stakeholders--the government ministries, banks, business\n            associations, leading entrepreneurs--should be involved in\n            designing and setting up well thought through project\n            implementation arrangements. When a project repeatedly\n            performs unsatisfactorily, the Bank should act sooner to\n            cancel i"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central African Republic - Enterprise\n
