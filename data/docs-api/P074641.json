Supervision budgets need to be\n            sufficient to allow teams enough presence in the country to\n            develop an in-depth understanding and to conduct first-hand\n            reviews of project implementation in detail. Clear\n            implementation arrangements must be in place at start of\n            implementation, both in terms of institutional and fiduciary\n            arrangements. Financial arrangements and the flow of funds\n            mechanisms should respond to the implementation set-up,\n            particularly in a project where a large portion of funds\n            must be spent on the regional and local levels, where there\n            is not always the experience in filling out complex\n            procurement documentation and where the number of suppliers\n            may be limited. Decreases in prevalence should not be used\n            as indicators of success or failure of HIV/AIDS projects\n            because increased testing and treatment measures may\n            actually increase prevalence rather than reduce it. Clearly,\n            an overall reduction in prevalence should be a long-term goal."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jamaica
