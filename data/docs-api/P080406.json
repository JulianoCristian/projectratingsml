Some lessons learned included: enhance\n            outreach to rural practitioners, especially in the public\n            health offices. This group of health care workers was\n            underrepresented among ARCAN Trained Graduates (ATGs), due\n            mainly to the lack of internet and other communication\n            services. Heterogeneity in audience exposure to HIVIAIDS\n            service delivery caused challenges. Some ATGs had extensive\n            experience in delivering these services, whereas others were\n            more novices, which occasionally caused frustration during\n            trainings. Respond to changing technical landscape. At\n            project design, the Bank was the leading actor in the field\n            and national systems were not mature. Working with regional\n            institutions of learning worked. This allowed the\n            flexibility of updating course content with cutting edge\n            information, kept the costs low and strengthened these\n            institutions. The regional approach was a high win. This\n            allowed the exchange of best practices across different\n            countries, established relations between practitioners and\n            most importantly, responded appropriately in helping\n            alleviate the regional epidemic.

The project\n            will support HIV/AIDS-related health sector, human resource\n            capacity building in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Tanzania using a\n            \"training-of-trainers\" (TOT) model. It is expected\n            that, as a result of increased capacity in the sub-region,\n            this project will contribute to enhanced delivery of\n            HIV/AIDS-related services, stronger linkages between\n            prevention and care interventions, and expanded South-South\n            partnerships.

Routine dissemination of HIV/AIDS-related program\n            information will also be financed, to ensure greater\n            knowledge sharing between, and within counties. The project\n            will explore options for distance learning, to maximize\n            resources, and to ensure a broader regional approach for\n            sharing experiences and enhancing skills; and, 3) support\n            strong coordination, and capacity building between the\n            project counties, and their governing agencies.
