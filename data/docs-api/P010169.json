The four projects were\n            a successful part of the early implementation of the RAP\n            strategy. However, they drifted away from this strategy and\n            did not achieve their projected results and impact. While\n            the projects had some worthwhile and widespread poverty\n            alleviation impact, they also provided large transfers of\n            public resources to some of the rural elite. The\n            institutional outcomes of the projects were not up to\n            expectations. While the sustainability of the improvements\n            made to watercourses under the projects is not in doubt, the\n            method of financing adopted, with its heavy reliance on\n            external aid and subsidies, is not sustainable. Even so, the\n            four projects were generally successful in achieving their\n            main physical objectives but the greater institutional and\n            social problems affecting system performance remain and may\n            have increased. Two major lessons can be learned from these\n            projects. First, there is a need for disaggregated\n            investment packages which are tailored closely to the\n            specific physical, social, and economic characteristics of\n            the very different areas within the system instead of broad\n            scale national projects. Lastly, there is a need for an\n            improved and independent analytical base on water sector\n            issues, routinely maintained in current status rather than\n            being periodically updated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - On-Farm and Command Water\n            Management and Irrigation Systems Rehabilitation Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - On-Farm and Command\n            Water Management and Irrigation Systems Rehabilitation Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/06/441891/pakistan-on-farm-command-water-management-irrigation-systems-rehabilitation-projects","projn":"PK-On Farm Water Manage -- P010160,PK-Water Management II -- P010220,PK-Command Water Manage -- P010202,PK-Irrig.

The\n            project achieved most of its objectives, its impact on\n            irrigation systems has been substantial, sustainability is\n            likely with continued maintenance and repair, and both the\n            Bank and Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, when co-financing\n            is arranged, the co-financier should be in full agreement on\n            concept, objectives, and focus of the project they support.\n            Second, to prevent the under-utilization of equipment\n            provided under co-financing arrangements, the Bank should\n            make sure that only specific project needs are satisfied and\n            adequate budgetary allocation is made for operating\n            expenses. Third, in order to permit meaningful agro-economic\n            evaluation, a baseline survey should be carried out before\n            project works start and monitoring should continue after\n            project completion. Fourth, to ensure that irrigation and\n            drainage systems produce acceptable agricultural benefits, a\n            continuing program of maintenance and repair is essential.\n            Fifth, techniques of system modernization developed by\n            foreign technical assistance should be tested under local\n            conditions before they are propagated. Lastly, to prevent\n            delays in the start of project works, field engineers should\n            receive instruction in the desired standard for selection\n            and preparation of schemes right from the beginning."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Irrigation Systems Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Irrigation Systems\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1990/06/738017/pakistan-irrigation-systems-rehabilitation-project","projn":"PK-Irrig.
