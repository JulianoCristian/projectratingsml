The overall performances of\n            both the Bank and the Borrower are rated satisfactory as\n            well. Some of the many lessons learned include the\n            following:1) This project demonstrates how a relatively\n            small investment (50 percent less than originally allocated)\n            can generate useful breakthroughs and innovations in teacher\n            education, a field generally considered to be conservative\n            and resistant to change. The project's model of using\n            centers of innovation to create and try out, on a limited\n            scale, new curricula, student screening and enrichment\n            programs, stronger linkages to secondary schools, improved\n            student teaching approaches, action research related to\n            instructional improvement, and in-service There are five\n            main lessons arising from this project's\n            implementation. 1) The quality and attitude of leadership\n            are the main elements that affected project  performance:\n            The Bank's standard approach has been to provide\n            \"traditional\" technical assistance, assuming that\n            technical understanding and skill alone would automatically\n            and significantly facilitate project implementation.\n            However, this has not been validated under this project. In\n            most cases, the agency being supported for management\n            improvement, such as a PDAM (local government water\n            enterprise), did have the minimum understanding and skill\n            required to implement its component(s), but its leadership\n            lacked the willingness or commitment to carry it out. The\n            fact that the sewerage pilot in Banjarmasin succeeded, for\n            example, was, to a large part, determined by the strong\n            commitment, dedication and integrity of the project manager.\n            Technical assistance packages should be phased, with clear\n            benchmarks, in such a way that allows the Bank to monitor\n            the willingness of the agency to grow and improve. 2)\n            Establishing client ownership of covenants early in\n            implementation is essential: The Bank needs to foster an\n            understanding of and appreciation for the rationale behind\n            the covenant. A good example is the covenant on water tariff\n            increases. Despite the covenant, some local governments gave\n            various reasons for not implementing it. But in one city,\n            after a series of discussions, an understanding was reached\n            with the client that the tariff increase was essential for\n            the sustainability of the PDAM's operations. As a\n            result, the tariff was increased beyond the minimum level\n            required under the covenant. 3) Integrated urban development\n            projects are suitable for secondary cities (less than 1\n            million). The integrated approach can be useful in\n            addressing urban development issues in a comprehensive\n            manner. This is even more valid now in the decentralized\n            environment of Indonesia. 4) Participation and consultation\n            with the beneficiaries significantly increase ownership of\n            the investments. The Bank and local governments should\n            invest the necessary time and resources to build the\n            beneficiary's understanding of and appreciation for the\n            project investments. In the case of the sewerage schemes in\n            Banjamasin and Balikpapan, significant time was invested to\n            educate and increase the understanding of the beneficiaries\n            the citizens themselves resulting in their strong support\n            for the investments. 5) Facilitation role of Bank missions.\n            To accommodate significant circumstantial changes such as\n            those experienced by Indonesia during this project, the role\n            of Bank missions will necessarily have to stretch well\n            beyond traditional supervision. As part of supervision, the\n            Bank team, all Jakarta office staff, took the time to meet\n            with each city's parliament and explain the various\n            project issues, covenants and requirements, and was, in\n            general, warmly welcomed by both the implementing agencies\n            and the parliaments. These efforts were instrumental to\n            maintaining project implementation momentum during the crisis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Kalimantan Urban Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia -
