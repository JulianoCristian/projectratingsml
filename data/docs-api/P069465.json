Some lessons\n            learned included: innovations should be vetted through pilot\n            and stakeholder consultations to ensure suitability for the\n            local context. A pilot for the formal and informal linkage\n            program will have highlighted implementation challenges,\n            which can then have been addressed before scaling up.\n            Widening financial intermediation by reaching new markets or\n            sectors requires appropriate strategies or innovative\n            products that address these markets. The design of an\n            effective training program requires clear identification of\n            the content of the training to be imparted, the capacity of\n            trainers, and who and how many will be trained. Despite\n            regular policy dialogue, the project team on its own was not\n            successful in reducing subsidies even though directed credit\n            and subsidies had a direct bearing on the project's\n            intermediate objective of financial widening and deepening.\n            The shortage of measurable indicators and an appropriate\n            monitoring and evaluation (M and E) system can reduce a\n            project's ability to make timely corrections as well as\n            to track its impact. Project teams should be careful to\n            avoid project development objectives that are too general to\n            be effectively monitored."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Rural Financial

to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: improving financial services to the poor\n            requires substantial effort to strengthen rural Microfinance\n            Institutions (MFIs) including Rural and Community Banks\n            (RCBs) in order to expand their outreach. A comprehensive\n            competency profile is required to understand their capacity\n            building needs, and to tailor training appropriately. There\n            is a tension in the appropriate role of the Apex Bank. It\n            has an important role to play in monitoring the performance\n            of its member RCBs, and in promoting deepening of links\n            between the RCBs with other MFIs to expand access of the\n            poor to financial services. At the same time, it needs to\n            enhance commercial viability and move away from its reliance\n            on government and donor funding. The quality of training\n            providers and business development services for rural MFIs\n            cannot be assumed. Development of curricula and the constant\n            screening of capable training providers are required and\n            must be constantly updated to reflect evolving best practice\n            and the dynamic needs of the sector. Robust and efficient\n            project management is more likely with strong state\n            institutions that have an existing compliance ethos. This\n            can be further supported by ensuring internal control\n            systems for the project are based on those prevailing in the\n            implementing institution, thereby being familiar to project staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Rural Financial Services Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Rural Financial Services
