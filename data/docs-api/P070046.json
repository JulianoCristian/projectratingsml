The lessons learned\n            indicate that the project's successful outcome can be\n            attributed to the following facts: The Term of Reference\n            (TORs) were comprehensive and clear. The Consultants carried\n            out all their work in Kosovo. The Consultants fielded a\n            competent team and they were assisted by effective local\n            participation. Detailed and multiple reviews were carried\n            out by professional staff having the requisite expertise on\n            behalf of the Bank, United Nations Interim Administration\n            Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), The Power Company of Kosovo\n            (KEK), and the district heating companies, greatly\n            contributed to the quality of the output. The timeframe for\n            the study was realistic given the comprehensive nature of\n            the study and the iterative approach required; sufficient\n            time was available for regular exchange of views, and\n            multiple reviews. The Consultants provided on-the-job\n            training and transferred relevant software packages. The\n            results of the Study were presented to a wide audience and\n            feedback received was incorporated into the Final Report."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kosovo - Energy Sector Technical

will assist in the development of satisfactory\n            long-term plans, for the economically efficient\n            reconstruction, rehabilitation, and restructuring of the\n            power, lignite, and district heating, in addition to the\n            petroleum sectors, and the development of a natural gas\n            sector. The project consists of a technical assistance (TA)\n            component to prepare an energy sector study. The study would\n            have thirteen modules as follows: 1) develop a household\n            energy survey to evaluate feasibility, and costs of\n            alternative energy sources; 2) determine production\n            capability of existing power generating facilities, and\n            identify options for future power generating capacity; 3)\n            prepare alternative programs for rehabilitation, and\n            expansion of the power transmission system, and analyze\n            least-cost power generation investments to determine\n            expansion plans; 4) analyze technical losses in power\n            transmission, and distribution, to propose immediate\n            long-term measures on loss reduction targets, and costs; 5)\n            evaluate the feasibility of a new System Control and Data\n            Acquisition (SCADA), and associated telecommunications\n            facilities for power system dispatching; 6) prioritize\n            investment requirements in distribution capacity; 7) propose\n            a lignite mine development strategy for supply to existing\n            thermal power stations; 8) evaluate the current state of\n            district heating facilities, and compare competitiveness\n            with other heating options; 9) investigate the technical,\n            and economic feasibility of importing natural gas to Kosovo,\n            estimating gas demand, and required pipeline infrastructure;\n            10) estimate future demand for petroleum products; 11) based\n            on the above modules, prepare recommendations on investment\n            plans for power and energy sub-sectors; 12) estimate\n            economic costs of electricity, and tariff structures, based\n            on least-cost generation/transmission programs;
