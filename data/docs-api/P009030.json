Key lessons learned\n            follow. Lack of an independent outside auditor reduced\n            project success. A strong policy dialogue, linked to the\n            provision of resources, would be more effective than\n            resources alone. MOH ability to provide adequate staff must\n            be an integral part of a project involving construction of\n            new facilities.
