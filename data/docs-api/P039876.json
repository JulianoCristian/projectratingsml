The\n            world-class collections held at National institute of\n            Biodiversity (INBio) represent the results of 10 years of\n            hard work and have a high scientific value. The project\n            overestimated the degree to which local communities and\n            stakeholders would be able to understand or define their\n            needs for biodiversity information. Create an enabling\n            environment for science to work with local and international\n            communities. Biodiversity information is so vast that no one\n            institution can specialize in all groups or all areas.\n            Product-based thinking is important for the sustainability\n            of knowledge-based institutions. The discussions and\n            donor-funded work revealed that the sustainability of the\n            conservation areas depends on the benefits generated for\n            society and the local communities. INBio staff are motivated\n            and committed to the success of the institution. Training\n            local individuals, such as park rangers and hunters, to\n            become parataxonomists empowered them to become one of the\n            most successful elements of the biodiversity development program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Costa Rica - Biodiversity Resources\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Costa Rica - Biodiversity\n            Resources Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/06/6946500/costa-rica-biodiversity-resources-development-project","projn":"CR-Biodiversity Resource Development (Gef)\n            -- P039876","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Biodiversity,Environmental Management,Wildlife Resources,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Agriculture,Environment","count":"Costa Rica","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20060725110537"},"subsc":"Central government administration,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture,Environment","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agriculture, ants, BIODIVERSITY,\n            biodiversity conservation, Biodiversity Information,\n            biodiversity inventories, Biodiversity Inventory,\n            Biodiversity Law, biodiversity management, biodiversity\n            products, biodiversity research, BIODIVERSITY RESOURCES,\n            biodiversity theme, biodiversity use, biological\n            collections, Biological Diversity, biological information,\n            biological material, biological resources, bioprospecting,\n            breeders, butterflies, butterfly, Central America, Central\n            American, Conservation, Conservation Area, Conservation\n            Areas, conservation awareness, conservation decisions,\n            conservation efforts, conservation management, conservation\n            measures, conservation policy, conservation status,\n            Conservation Strategy, conservation value, conserve\n            biodiversity, cultivation, deer, ecological studies,\n            ecosystem, ecosystems, educators, effective use,\n            Environmental, environmental conservation, environmental\n            conservation efforts, environmental issues, Environmental\n            policies, equipment, Exchange Rate, expenditures, field\n            guides, financial management, financial resources, fishing,\n            forest, forest health, forestry, forestry sector, Genetic,\n            Genetic Resources, geographic locations, Global\n            Biodiversity, GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT, GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT\n            FACILITY, GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY TRUST FUND, herbaria,\n            hunters, income, indigenous communities, indigenous groups,\n            Indigenous Knowledge, insects, integration, intellectual\n            property rights, issues, local biodiversity, local\n            communities, Marginal cost, marketing, moth, moths, National\n            Biodiversity, National Biodiversity Institute, National\n            Biodiversity Inventory, natural resource, natural resource\n            management, natural resources, natural resources management,\n            nature, nematodes, new species, NGOs, nongovernmental\n            organizations, Orchid, parataxonomists, park management,\n            park rangers, pests, Plant, private sector, protected areas,\n            scientific knowledge, scientific research, scientists,\n            species, specimens, Sustainable Development, sustainable\n            management, sustainable use, Sustainable Use of\n            Biodiversity, Sustainable Uses of Biodiversity, taxonomic\n            groups, taxonomic impediment, taxonomist, tourism, Tropical\n            Forest, universities, variety"}},"owner":"Environment (LCSEN)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"trustfund":"TF028324-GEF1: COSTA RICA - BIODIVERSITY\n            RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT,TF028453-GEF1 PDF B: BIODIVERSITY\n            RESOURCE DEV.
