Some\n            lessons learned included: in hindsight, an in-depth\n            discussion and the adoption of a common approach across\n            Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF)- funded projects will have\n            been beneficial, because many issues across projects or\n            sectors were similar and related to state building and\n            development of government systems, for example, the\n            establishment of a civil service and ministry structures,\n            and technical and fiduciary capacity building. Education\n            Rehabilitation Project (ERP) will have benefit from a more\n            rigorous assessment of project readiness for implementation,\n            realism of its targets, and time frame. Building strong\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E) systems as integral part\n            of project implementation from the start is essential It is\n            vital to begin stakeholder dialogue early on and maintain it\n            throughout preparation and implementation. This includes\n            dialogue and regular communication with donors, but also\n            beneficiaries and their communities. The project will have\n            benefit from an even larger staff presence on the ground and\n            intensified management guidance and support. State capacity\n            building approach may slow down implementation initially,\n            but will pay off in the medium to long term through enhanced\n            ministry ownership and capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"South Sudan -
