Project sustainability is\n            non-evaluable at this stage. Bank performance is rated\n            unsatisfactory because project design had significant\n            shortcomings despite the long preparation period, and\n            supervision was also wanting on several fronts. Borrower\n            performance is rated satisfactory. This project offeres\n            several lessons for similar interventions in Mali and\n            elsewhere, among them: 1) The importance of budgeting\n            adequate time and resources in a follow-on project to\n            consolidate the achievements and overcome the challenges of\n            the predecessor project cannot be overemphasized. 2) It is\n            important that appropriate incentives be provided to Bank\n            and Borrower project teams so that they design performance\n            indicators that monitor outcomes. Only then can effective\n            results be achieved. 3) Given the poverty alleviation\n            mandate of the Bank, in a Program of Targeted Intervention\n            it is important that development objectives be framed partly\n            in terms of poverty reduction. This should be done in a way\n            that is monitorable and should be backed up in a design by a\n            monitoring and evaluation system capable of measuring\n            poverty impact."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali -

Also essential is project ownership\n            by the communities, to be achieved by involving local\n            participants in most aspects of the project : currently,\n            villagers are not only encouraged to actively participate in\n            the sustained use of forest areas, but are given exclusive\n            user rights over the land. Furthermore, project support\n            should provide basic management, and accounting training, so\n            that villagers become responsible for dispute settlements\n            regarding ownership rights of forest areas. This may also\n            induce villagers to establish rural markets, for only if\n            benefits are clear to them, will they do so.

The implementation\n            objectives of the project are to promote popular\n            participation in household energy activities, rational use\n            of household energy resources and improved end-use of\n            household fuels. Specific objectives are: 1) to create an\n            enabling regulatory and policy environment for project\n            implementation; 2) to provide technical assistance and\n            training to peasants, charcoal makers, producers and sellers\n            of stoves as well as urban consumers to respectively\n            efficiently harvest and carbonize fuelwood, to manage the\n            natural forest in a sustainable manner, to effectively\n            market new energy end-use equipment and to rationally use\n            improved biomass and kerosene stoves. The basic principle\n            underpinning this project is that the Government establishes\n            the policy environment, but commercial decisions are left to\n            private economic agents. The project will consist of two\n            main components covering demand and woodfuel supply of\n            household energy. The woodfuel supply component consists of\n            the following interventions: 1) design of woodfuel supply\n            master plans for the main towns and determine the maximum\n            annual sustainable wood supply in the catchment areas of the\n            towns concerned; 2) preparation of and assistance to\n            implement village forest management plans; 3)\n            identificaiton, design and implementation of an improved\n            carbonization program for local charcoalers; 4) provision of\n            institutional support for central and local government\n            authorities to help with project management and assist rural\n            communities in implementing their forest management plans;\n            and 5) launching of a comprehensive training, client\n            consultation, and Information, Education and Communication\n            (IEC) program on forest management. The demand side\n            component will consist of the following: 1) provision of\n            institutional support to help with project management and\n            private sector production; 2) identification, design and\n            assistance to implement a marketing program for the sale of\n            these improved biomass and kerosene stoves; 3) support for a\n            comprehensive IEC program and systematic consumer\n            consultation, executed by private sector operators, on the\n            importance of the rational use of energy through the\n            purchase and proper use of the improved stoves."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali -
