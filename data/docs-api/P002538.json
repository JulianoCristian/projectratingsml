Lessons learned from the project are: (i)\n            political stability and sustained government commitment are\n            essential. The \"stop-go\" approach in the\n            implementation of SAC II and the resulting delays can be\n            clearly linked to the prevailing political climate combined\n            with weak human resources; (ii) Flexibility in program\n            implementation is necessary to respond to evolving, fragile\n            situations, performance criteria should be tailored to suit\n            country-specific conditions with close Bank supervision;\n            (iii) reliance on a single commodity for economic growth can\n            impair longer-term stability, even with temporary adjustment\n            aided by donors; and (iv) structural measures in the absence\n            of macroeconomic stability are unlikely to have a\n            significant impact. The experience of SAC II illustrates\n            clearly the dependence between a sound macroeconomic\n            framework and the response to structural measures, even when\n            appropriately designed and implemented. In such cases, even\n            when specific conditionality's are met, careful thought\n            should be given to invoking the general conditionality\n            related to macroeconomic
