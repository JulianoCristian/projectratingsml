(TSEDP) in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz\n            Republic (KR) are to: a) reduce anthropogenic pressure on\n            natural ecosystems and natural resources through development\n            of sustainable tourism and increase of income of local\n            population; b) earn incomes from selling certified carbon\n            received as a result of afforestation in the Kyrgyz Republic\n            and to share this practice in the region; c) increase income\n            of rural population by means of wood and non-wood forest\n            products and incomes from selling certified discharges\n            received as a result of afforestation and foresting; d)\n            reduce water and wind erosion of soil by creation of\n            erosion-preventive and wind-protective forest strip by means\n            of ecosystem approach. Plant 13,950 ha of new forests to\n            reduce erosion of soil, prevent avalanches and mudflows and\n            decrease water logging caused by deteriorated drainage\n            systems; and e) increase financial sustainability of the\n            State Agency for Environment Protection and Forestry (SAEPF)\n            under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and local\n            Self-Government Administration (AO) thanks to revenue\n            generated by carbon trading. The involuntary resettlement\n            policy (OP 4.12) is triggered because forestation activities\n            may restrict access to resources such as pasture resources\n            for livestock producers. Project activities will not require\n            or entail any land acquisition and/or physical relocation of\n            people. In addition, the strengthening biodiversity\n            conservation component does not have the objective of\n            enlarging protected areas, but only to improve the\n            management of existing ones. To address the risk that access\n            to pasture resources will be curtailed, an access\n            restriction process framework has been prepared. This\n            participatory process is primarily focused on the\n            identification of afforestation and reforestation sites that\n            do not conflict with either formal or informal pasture use.\n            Measures to assist in improvement or restoration of\n            livelihoods will only apply in exceptional circumstances\n            where no alternative sites can be identified."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz Republic - Tien Shan\n            Ecosystem Development Project : resettlement plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz Republic -\n            Tien Shan Ecosystem Development Project : resettlement plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/02/10330227/kazakhstan-kyrgyz-republic-tien-shan-ecosystem-development-project-resettlement-plan","projn":"7C-Tien Shan Ecosystem Development Project\n            -- P104670","docty":"Resettlement Plan","subtopic":"Common Property Resource Development,Forests and Forestry,Climate Change and Environment,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Forestry","teratopic":"Rural Development,Environment","count":"Central Asia","entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20090309082956"},"theme":"Biodiversity,Rural non-farm income generation,Regional integration,Environmental policies and institutions,Climate change","subsc":"Forestry,General public administration sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Environment","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"afforestation, arable land, biodiversity,\n            Biodiversity Conservation, communal pasture, compensation,\n            Conflict Resolution Mechanism, conflict resolution\n            mechanisms, ECOSYSTEM, forage, Forest, Forest Enterprises,\n            forestry, fuel, fuelwood, land acquisition, land use,\n            livelihoods, livestock, Natural Resource, pasture, pastures,\n            planting, poverty alleviation, reforestation, resource\n            mapping, State Forest, State Forest Fund, timber, timber\n            forest products"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF091930-GEF PPG - TIEN SHAN ECOSYSTEM\n            DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - KYRGYZ REPUBLIC,TF091931-GEF PPG - TIEN SHAN ECOSYSTEM\n            DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - KAZAKHSTAN","majtheme":"Rural development,Environment and natural resource management,Trade and integration","repnb":"RP774"},"facets":{}}}
