Some\n            lessons learned included: measures to increase efficiency\n            and cost effectiveness in the sector are well received by\n            the market. Users responded positively to the Project by\n            increasing the size of vessels operating in the project\n            waterways. Developments similar to the Project can be\n            replicated taking advantage of experience gained in inland\n            waterway network planning, macro-economic considerations,\n            technical design, safety provisions and environmental and\n            social safeguards.

upgrading navigation conditions on the\n            region's major east-west river and other waterways\n            feeding traffic into the Pearl River Delta region. A\n            secondary objective is to harness water flow in two of these\n            rivers to generate environmentally clean electricity to help\n            meet growing energy demand in the provinces of Guangdong\n            Autonomous Region and Guangxi. There are two components,\n            each with multi-subcomponents. The first component for\n            Guangxi constructs a dam, power station, and shiplock;\n            builds access roads; provides bank protection with\n            reservoirs and a dam; installs turbines, lock gates, and\n            other equipment; supports channel improvement; supports\n            institutional strengthening, consultants services, and\n            training; and provides finance for resettlement and land\n            acquisition, as well as for site management. The second\n            component for Guangdong Autonomous Region supports channel\n            improvement; replacement of two bridges, construction of a\n            dam, power station, shiplock, and access road; the\n            installation of turbines, lock gates, and other equipment;\n            upgrades navigational aids; the purchase of computer\n            hardware for electronic mapping, shiplock management, and a\n            management information system; the financing of service\n            vessels, services vehicles, a survey, monitoring, and\n            ancillary
