Some key lessons include: 1) The Performance\n            Agreement signed as a condition of effectiveness, and which\n            was designed as an instrument to enhance Nepal Electricity\n            Authority's (NEA) autonomy and monitor its\n            institutional performance, has proven to be difficult to\n            enforce. 2) Effective training and recruitment of qualified\n            staff should have been given more priority to ensure\n            institutional development actions are sustainable. 3)\n            Setting specific performance targets and having to rely on\n            other donors funding for implementation creates risks,\n            particularly in a situation where strong corporate\n            management is not yet in place. 4) Key issues and\n            procurement must be addressed early in the project cycle. 5)\n            Appropriate external audit arrangements can be used as a\n            tool for increasing accountability and institution building.\n            6) Environmental impact assessments should be initiated\n            early in the project cycle. 7) Public consultations should\n            be made an integral part of the preparatory process to\n            create a political consensus on proposed hydropower investments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal -
