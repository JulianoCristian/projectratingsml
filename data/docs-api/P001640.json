The objectives of the\n            EDDRP were to broaden economic participation, to enable a\n            sustainable supply response, and to prevent widespread\n            starvation as a result of severe drought through a set of\n            mutually reinforcing policy measures in the following areas:\n            (i) improvement of the environment for entrepreneurial\n            activity and investment in labor-intensive activities; (ii)\n            expansion of access to financial capital and deepening of\n            financial markets; (iii) reorientation of fiscal and labor\n            policy towards human capital development; and (iv)\n            procurement of commercial maize imports. Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower's performance\n            was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows:\n            (i) with strong government commitment a country can stay on\n            the adjustment course despite large unanticipated external\n            shocks; (ii) adjustment in countries with extremely low\n            income levels like Malawi, is a long-term process and will\n            continue into the next decade; (iii) cross-conditionality\n            with other International Development Association (IDA)\n            projects resulted in \"marginalizing\" some\n            objectives and created supervision problems; (iv)\n            flexibility in the design and implementation of the program\n            to respond to new information or emerging problems during\n            implementation is criticalfor success; (v) irreversible\n            up-front actions enhance prospects for successful\n            implementation; and (vi) timely Balance of Payments (BOP)\n            support to address natural disasters can be extremely\n            important for keeping the overall adjustment program on track."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Entrepreneurship Development and\n            Drought Recovery Program Project

Drought Recovery Program Project aims at\n            removing constraints that have inhibited private sector\n            entrepreneurship and initiative. The core of the adjustment\n            program is a set of specific policy reforms which will\n            remove these contraints. To create an enabling environment\n            for private sector entrepreneurs to respond and invest in\n            physical capital, the program includes regulatory,\n            administrative and policy measures to encourage investment\n            by both small and large scale enterprises and extend trade\n            reform to ensure an outward orientation of the private\n            sector response. To promote access to financial capital for\n            new clients and activities, the program focuses on\n            increasing financial sector competition, including\n            introduction of market-oriented monetary control instruments\n            and open entry of new domestic and foreign institutions into\n            banking activities. To broaden access to human capital and\n            expand employment opportunities, the program includes the\n            reorientation of public expenditures in favor of human\n            capital combined with measures to improve functioning of\n            labor markets. Also, a serious drought has affected the\n            entire Southern African region. The Government has\n            approached donor communities to meet additional maize import\n            requirements to avoid widespread hunger and food insecurity\n            in Malawi."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Entrepreneurship Development and\n            Drought Recovery Program (supplemental financing arrangement)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malawi -
