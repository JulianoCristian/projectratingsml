The results of some\n            studies funded through the project were disappointing,\n            however, and the corresponding reports of little use. Other\n            factors, unforeseen at the appraisal stage, disrupted\n            implementation and explain the shortcomings in performance\n            noted on the part of both Bank and Borrower who were both\n            rated satisfactory. There were three key lessons learned\n            from this project and are as follows: (1) Works execution\n            capabilities were overestimated, (2) A road project can be\n            supervised, even in difficult circumstances, when the\n            services of active local consultants are available, and it\n            is monitored by a Bank headquarters team which is well\n            acquainted with the country's general difficulties and\n            its road sector problems in particular and has been able to\n            create a climate of mutual confidence between Bank and\n            Borrower. (3) Terms of reference for studies need to spell\n            out clearly what is expected of consultants. In addition,\n            care should be taken not to dictate work organization\n            patterns to consultants, and especially not after signature\n            of a contract. While the principle of partnership between\n            local consultants and expatriate consultants is\n            unquestionably a sound one, it should not be\n            \"pushed\" by the authorities without insisting on\n            performance requirements, on subjects, where local\n            experience is still limited; the handling of contract\n            performance should be left to the more experienced of the\n            two groups. To that extent, it would have been preferable\n            not to undertake the studies, as they proved to have been a\n            mistake and a poor use of loan proceeds."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Fifth Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria - Fifth Highway Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/12/733682/algeria-fifth-highway-project","projn":"DZ-Highways V-114639 -- P004900","subtopic":"Business Environment,Roads & Highways,Teaching and Learning,Business in Development,Banks & Banking Reform","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Algeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961019162640"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,Achievement,achievements,acquisition,aggregates,audit\n            reports,audits,Bank Performance,Bank\n            supervision,bitumen,bookkeeping,civil\n            engineering,contracting\n            out,contractors,depreciation,expenditure,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,framework,Freeways,fuel,Highway\n            Projects,Highways,Inflation,inflation rates,Institutional\n            development,Key Performance Indicators,land\n            transport,maintenance costs,oils,pavement,pavement\n            strengthening,periodic maintenance,Planning Research,primary\n            roads,procurement,Public enterprises,Quality\n            Control,questioning,Railways,reinforcement,road\n            construction,road deterioration,road investment,road\n            maintenance,road management,road pavement,road\n            system,roads,routes,routine\n            maintenance,sharing,span,teaching,technical\n            assistance,terrain,tertiary roads,traffic,traffic\n            counting,training courses,training\n            programs,Transport,Transport Planning,urban\n            transport,vocational training,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,Achievement,achievements,acquisition,aggregates,audit\n            reports,audits,Bank Performance,Bank\n            supervision,bitumen,bookkeeping,civil\n            engineering,contracting\n            out,contractors,depreciation,expenditure,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,framework,Freeways,fuel,Highway\n            Projects,Highways,Inflation,inflation rates,Institutional\n            development,Key Performance Indicators,land\n            transport,maintenance costs,oils,pavement,pavement\n            strengthening,periodic maintenance,Planning Research,primary\n            roads,procurement,Public enterprises,Quality\n            Control,questioning,Railways,reinforcement,road\n            construction,road deterioration,road investment,road\n            maintenance,road management,road pavement,road\n            system,roads,routes,routine\n            maintenance,sharing,span,teaching,technical\n            assistance,terrain,tertiary roads,traffic,traffic\n            counting,training courses,training\n            programs,Transport,Transport Planning,urban\n            transport,vocational training,working capital"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"15156"},"739681":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1987/04/739681/algeria-fifth-highway-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1987/04/739681/algeria-fifth-highway-project","new_url":"1987/04/739681/algeria-fifth-highway-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1987/04/17/000009265_3960926044123/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1987/04/17/000009265_3960926044123/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2808","datestored":"1987-04-17T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1987-04-17T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Fifth Highway Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Fifth Highway Project is designed to\n            assist the Government in concentrating its reduced resources\n            on preservation of existing roads, in effectively\n            implementing institutional changes and in improving the\n            financial viability and efficiency of road transport.
