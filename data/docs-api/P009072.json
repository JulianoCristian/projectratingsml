The lessons learned\n            indicate that the original project concept involved only\n            equipment for Operation and Maintenance (O&M), with\n            rehabilitation of irrigation schemes added later. Because\n            they are being given increased responsibility for managing\n            and funding O&M, Water Users' Organization (WUOs)\n            need effective training in management, finance, water\n            distribution techniques, and rehabilitation priorities, as\n            well as other areas. Functioning within a new paradigm,\n            State Hydraulic Works (DSI) needs to reorient its mission to\n            more explicitly focus on WUO support, and it might require\n            training in the modalities of its relationships with WUOs.\n            The Participatory Privatization of Irrigation Management and\n            Investment Project (PPIMIP) had little or no identification\n            of meaningful monitoring indicators, establishment of\n            initial benchmarks, or systematic data collection. The pilot\n            drip irrigation component was probably overlooked by General\n            Directorate of Rural Services (GDRS) also due to the\n            relatively small amount of funds allocated and due to the\n            prominent role the other implementing agency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -

There are three components. The first\n            purchases irrigation operations and maintenance equipment\n            including wireless sets, motorcycles, vehicles, computers,\n            cranes, winches and small backhoes/loaders, trucks, gradalls\n            (truck-mounted machines with telescopic booms and wide\n            buckets), graders, bulldozers, excavators, and draglines.\n            The second component provides for consultants, training and\n            study tours, computers, office and training equipment, and\n            field vehicles. The third component helps a WUO purchase and\n            install a drip irrigation system, which receives water from\n            a small dam through an installed pipeline system, thus\n            eliminating the need to use electricity for pumps to create pressure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Participatory Privatization of\n            Irrigation Management and Investment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Participatory\n            Privatization of Irrigation Management and Investment Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/09/440575/turkey-participatory-privatization-irrigation-management-investment-project","projn":"TR-Privatization Of Irrigation Project -- P009072","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Irrigation and Drainage,Water Use,Drylands & Desertification,Agricultural Research,Irrigation and Drainage","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Turkey","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980728143129"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural investments,agricultural\n            productivity,Agriculture,Billing,Crops,cubic meters of\n            water,delivery of water,distribution of water,Drainage,DRIP\n            IRRIGATION,Farmers,fertilizers,gravity irrigation,Irrigated\n            land,Irrigation,irrigation area,irrigation\n            development,Irrigation Investment,irrigation land,Irrigation\n            Management,irrigation management transfer,irrigation\n            network,irrigation networks,irrigation pipes,irrigation\n            project,irrigation projects,IRRIGATION SCHEME,irrigation\n            schemes,IRRIGATION SECTOR,irrigation system,irrigation\n            water,large irrigation systems,livestock,Natural\n            Resources,Participatory Irrigation,Participatory Irrigation\n            Management,pollution,pumping stations,Rural\n            Development,salinization,trees,use of irrigation,water\n            availability,water charges,Water Resources,water\n            shortage,Water User,Water User Associations,Water User\n            Organizations,Water Users,WUA"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural investments,agricultural\n            productivity,Agriculture,Billing,Crops,cubic meters of\n            water,delivery of water,distribution of water,Drainage,DRIP\n            IRRIGATION,Farmers,fertilizers,gravity irrigation,Irrigated\n            land,Irrigation,irrigation area,irrigation\n            development,Irrigation Investment,irrigation land,Irrigation\n            Management,irrigation management transfer,irrigation\n            network,irrigation networks,irrigation pipes,irrigation\n            project,irrigation projects,IRRIGATION SCHEME,irrigation\n            schemes,IRRIGATION SECTOR,irrigation system,irrigation\n            water,large irrigation systems,livestock,Natural\n            Resources,Participatory Irrigation,Participatory Irrigation\n            Management,pollution,pumping stations,Rural\n            Development,salinization,trees,use of irrigation,water\n            availability,water charges,Water Resources,water\n            shortage,Water User,Water User Associations,Water User\n            Organizations,Water Users,WUA"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"3":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"4":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF034985-ECA REGION - IRRIGATION,TF033757-TURKEY - PRIVATIZATION OF IRRIGATION","repnb":"16525"},"facets":{}}}
