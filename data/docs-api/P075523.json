           were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was

Some lessons learned included:\n            long-term projects, particularly those that make use of\n            restructuring and more than one source of finance, should\n            use the restructuring to close out completed components, or\n            to update legal covenants, monitoring indicators, and other\n            design elements. \u0091building resilience\u0092 is time consuming and\n            should seek to empower communities to identify and implement\n            local solutions to manage their specific risk levels. As a\n            corollary, communities do not always have the means to build\n            resilience with only their own resources. In small countries\n            where the Bank has few operations and local implementing\n            agencies have to contend with many different external\n            support partners with differing procedures, clearly\n            establishing the roles and responsibilities of different\n            stakeholders, including the Bank, and doing this early on\n            can help to ensure that

objectives (PDO)\n            of the Second Infrastructure Asset Management Project\n            (SIAM-2) of Samoa are to: (1) enhance the economic,\n            environmental and social sustainability of transport and\n            coastal infrastructure assets; and (2) manage those assets\n            and natural resources and respond to national emergencies,\n            through an effective partnership with private sector\n            stakeholders. This Restructuring paper reflects changes\n            discussed with the Ministry of Finance and the Land\n            Transport Authority (LTA) during the January 28 to February\n            7, 2013 mission to supervise the Second Infrastructure Asset\n            Management Project and recorded in the Aide M\u00e9moire dated\n            February 11, 2013. The closing date of the original project\n            was June 30, 2010. When the additional financing was\n            approved in 2007, the closing date matched that of the\n            original project. Shortly after the additional financing was\n            approved, the closing date was extended by 18 months to\n            December 31, 2011. When the PRIF trust fund was added to the\n            project, the project was restructured and the closing date\n            of SIAM-2 was extended once more to June 30, 2013.

The modifications proposed under this\n            restructuring will not change the PDO, and the PDO will\n            still be achieved with the activities being carried out\n            under the remaining project components.
