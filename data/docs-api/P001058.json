First,\n            project design should be focused on a few key economic\n            management functions, supported by a few co-financing\n            partners, in order to minimize the additional burden on\n            local management capacities. Second, project sustainability\n            could be improved through a closer monitoring of the\n            transfer of skills and closer supervision of in-service\n            training. Finally, implementation could be improved through\n            more rigorous supervision of progress reports, prepared by\n            both the experts and local teams, and the definition of\n            performance targets to monitor progress."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Second Economic Management Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea - Second Economic\n
