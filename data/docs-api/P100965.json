Lessons from this operation --\n            prepared and approved in a 3-month span period -- cannot be\n            drawn independently of SAC III and the HIPC process. For the\n            latter, a close coordination with the IMF team was critical\n            to the successful dialogue with the authorities along the\n            path to completion point, thus allowing the approval of this\n            operation. Other lessons could be drawn from the ICR of SAC\n            III and include: formulating a realistic timeframe for the\n            government to meet the triggers of the completion point and\n            ensuring that the government puts in place a strong focal\n            point/unit to coordinate and monitor the implementation of\n            the completion point triggers and facilitate related post\n            completion point actions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Debt Relief Grant Under the\n            Enhanced HIPC Initiative"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon -
