However, several sub-components of\n            the locomotive and rolling stock system of the Fifth Railway\n            Project were technically not met. Furthermore, the Strategic\n            Plan Study under the Fourth Railway Project, intended to\n            promote a broad-based dialogue between the Bank and the\n            Ministry of Railways (MOR), was narrowly defined. The\n            lessons learned suggest that, since previous lending\n            policies appear to impact fundamentally on both the Bank and\n            MOR's approach, particularly that of the Fifth Railway\n            Project, regarded as a transitional operation, special\n            attention should be given to future operations, upon\n            evaluation, and whether meaningful cooperation with MOR was\n            achieved. Similarly, the challenge posed to MOR, of\n            extensive studies in order to visualize future investment\n            requirements, was ambitious. Therefore, evaluations should\n            consider whether they really enhanced MOR's\n            contribution to the transport sector. Complex operations,\n            requiring highly professional skills, may cause unexpected\n            expenses, or further contribute to inadequate\n            implementation. The suggestion is, to specifically target\n            the assistance to transport objectives, and attain\n            efficiency and cost-effectiveness. However, MOR's\n            reluctance to an involvement in broader strategic planning,\n            namely technical assistance, should be brought to terms, for\n            full support and

material, components, and equipment for rehabilitation of\n            locomotives and rolling stock; (b) two capacity expansion\n            components, to complete double-tracking of the 944 Km Zhegan\n            line, and to expand capacity at the Xuzhou marshalling\n            yards; and (c) an action plan for the implementation of the\n            Railway Traffic Costing System leading to formulation of\n            recommendations for tariff restructuring. In addition, the\n            project will rely heavily on five studies which were started\n            as part of the project preparation, focusing on track\n            maintenance and rehabilitation, an integrated system plan\n            for electrification, an integrated system plan for\n            telecommunications, and a railway investment study."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Fifth Railway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Fifth Railway Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1991/08/737012/china-fifth-railway-project","projn":"CN-Railways V -- P003486","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Early Child and Children's Health,Agricultural Research,Roads & Highways,Railways Transport,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Transport","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960928220724"},"subsc":"Railways","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Afforestation,AgricuLtural Research,audit\n            reports,carrying capacity,Civil\n            works,Coal,corridor,diseases,dust,effective use,electric\n            locomotives,environmental impact,environmental\n            issues,Environmental Protection,exchange\n            rate,Expressway,Fisheries,Forestry,freight,freight\n            ton,freight traffic,gross national\n            product,imports,income,Irrigation,ItC,locomotives,marshalling\n            yards,noise,noise pollution,passenger,passenger\n            coaches,passenger trains,pollution control,PRC,Rail,Rail\n            traffic,Railroads,Railway,railway costing,railway\n            infrastructure,Railway Project,railway projects,railway\n            technology,Railway traffic,railway transport,Railways,Rate\n            of Return,rolling stock,routes,Soils,spreading,track,traffic\n            growth,traffic volumes,UNDP,waste management"},"1":{"cdata!":"Afforestation,AgricuLtural Research,audit\n            reports,carrying capacity,Civil\n            works,Coal,corridor,diseases,dust,effective use,electric\n            locomotives,environmental impact,environmental\n            issues,Environmental Protection,exchange\n            rate,Expressway,Fisheries,Forestry,freight,freight\n            ton,freight traffic,gross national\n            product,imports,income,Irrigation,ItC,locomotives,marshalling\n            yards,noise,noise pollution,passenger,passenger\n            coaches,passenger trains,pollution control,PRC,Rail,Rail\n            traffic,Railroads,Railway,railway costing,railway\n            infrastructure,Railway Project,railway projects,railway\n            technology,Railway traffic,railway transport,Railways,Rate\n            of Return,rolling stock,routes,Soils,spreading,track,traffic\n            growth,traffic volumes,UNDP,waste management"}},"owner":"Trnsprt, Energy & Mining Sector (EASTE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"repnb":"P5269"},"facets":{}}}
