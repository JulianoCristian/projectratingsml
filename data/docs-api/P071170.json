Some lessons learned included: Integrated\n            Water Resources Management (IWRM) is an effective way to\n            promote coordination between the many and diverse government\n            ministries and institutions involved in watershed\n            management, irrigation and drainage, agriculture and\n            forestry, and municipal water supply within a basin. It is\n            imperative to fully identify land acquisition requirements\n            before commencement of project implementation and to\n            complete land acquisition as soon as possible after the\n            start of the project to avoid implementation delays. It is\n            imperative that irrigation and drainage projects have\n            up-to-date detailed civil works designs with up-to-date\n            project design cost estimates before loan effectiveness so\n            that tendering can start as soon as loan effectiveness is\n            declared to avoid cost increases for civil works. A strong\n            central Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E) system within\n            the lead implementation agency should be standard in large\n            projects with multiple agencies involved so that problems\n            are detected early and signaled to the bank and to the\n            government. Capacity building through adequate training of\n            both staff and senior management at the outset, so that the\n            relevance and importance of M and E to project\n            implementation is understood, is key to M and E success.\n            Financial and economic analysis, aside from the rate of\n            return number itself, provides valuable information in the\n            form of various indicators (yield, income) that can be\n            tracked from appraisal through to project closing and that\n            show how the main beneficiaries (farmers) take part and\n            benefit from the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran -

The implementation of the compensation includes\n            two main stages. In the first stage, the affected households\n            are informed and the amount and method of compensation is\n            determined by the implementing agency. The stakeholders are\n            then informed of the results. In the second stage, the legal\n            procedure for the actual payment of the compensation is\n            carried out. The first stage starts by sending a letter of\n            invitation and a brochure which explains in simple language\n            the rights of affected population according to the category\n            of acquisition. In addition, each household is separately\n            approached by social workers and the situation is explained\n            in a face-to face discussion. Then two Land Acquisition and\n            Resettlement Committee (LARC) meetings are organized. At the\n            same time the village is visited by legal experts to\n            document the present condition of properties and determine\n            the price of property to be acquired and the compensation\n            method. This stage is finalized by informing the\n            stakeholders on the results of this assessment. In the\n            second stage if an agreement is reached with the stakeholder\n            on the amount and method of compensation, the necessary\n            legal documents are prepared and the compensation is paid."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Irrigation areas in the Raies Kola Diversion\n            Weir and Halil Dashit pumping station"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Iran - Alborz Integrated Land and\n            Water Management Project (Vol. 2) : Irrigation areas in the\n            Raies Kola Diversion Weir and Halil Dashit pumping station"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/07/8209231/iran-alborz-integrated-land-water-management-project-vol-2-irrigation-areas-raies-kola-diversion-weir-halil-dashit-pumping-station","projn":"IR-Iran - Alborz Integrated Land And Water\n            Management Project -- P071170","docty":"Resettlement Plan","subtopic":"Common Property Resource Development,m,Gender and Law,Urban Housing,Access to Finance","teratopic":"Gender,Urban Development,Rural Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020439_20070831111751"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Irrigation and drainage,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Forestry,Central government administration","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender,Urban Development,Rural Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural productivity, agricultural\n            products, Agriculture, annual income, banks, beneficiaries,\n            brochure, brochures, cash payment, communities,\n            Compensation, Compensations, construction, consulting firm,\n            Contingencies, contingency, court, credit institutions,\n            customary practice, damages, deposit, economic development,\n            Employment situation, endowments, exploitation, families,\n            farmer, farmers, Female, financial assistance, financial\n            loss, forest, households, houses, immovable properties,\n            income, incomes, information dissemination, Irrigation,\n            judge, Justice, lands, laws, Literacy, local newspapers,\n            lost income, monthly income, natural resource, ownership\n            rights, Pensioner, Possession, private land, private lands,\n            private property, property owner, property owners, public\n            good, Public Lands, Rangeland, Resettlement, residence,\n            Resource Management, responsibilities, retired, river, river\n            basin, Rural Development, sale, Self employment, soil,\n            sources of income, stakeholder, stakeholders, Title\n            Registration, transaction, transaction fees, Village,\n            villages, vulnerable groups, vulnerable households, wage,\n            Water Resource, will"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Water & Environ Group (MNSRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF026483-PHRD-IRAN: WATERSHED\n            CONSERVATION PROJECT,TF030314-DANISH CTF GENERAL FY03 - (ALL\n            EXCEPT SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA),TF030330-JAPAN CTF FY03 - GENERAL,TF030389-JAPAN CTF - FY03 GENERAL: MNA\n            (ALL COUNTRIES IN MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH A,TF030666-JAPAN CTF - FY05 GENERAL: MNA\n            (ALL COUNTRIES IN MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH A,TF030798-JAPAN CTF - FY06 GENERAL: MNA\n            (ALL COUNTRIES IN MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH A,TF051031-BNWPP-WATER\n            RESOURCES/LIVELIHOODS FOR THE POOR,TF056929-BNPP-WATER: WATER RESOURCES\n            MANAGEMENT PROGRAM II - (BNWPP)","repnb":"RP466"},"facets":{}}}
