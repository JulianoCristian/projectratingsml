Some lessons learned included:  the\n            evaluation of the rural development program evaluation found\n            that RDP has significantly contributed to women\u2019s\n            empowerment. Community leader groups that were surveyed for\n            the evaluation stated that the project enabled women to\n            influence decision-making more than other community\n            projects. Over 50 percent of those surveyed reported that\n            the project processes encouraged women to be more active in\n            their communities. The project SIC membership was often the\n            first major community responsibility of the women involved.\n            In 81 percent of villages surveyed, the community leader\n            groups reported that women on the sub-project implementation\n            committees participated more in village activities than\n            before joining the SIC. Close to all community leader groups\n            reported that being in the SIC increased the status of the\n            female members. Thus women\u2019s involvement in decision-making\n            bodies such as the SICs and ward development committees can\n            empower women and provide a platform for broader community\n

As a part of this evaluation\n            process, a follow up survey was conducted in eighty\n            villages, equally distributed across four provinces\n            (Choiseul, Malaita, Temotu and Western) between June and\n            July 2013. In each village we utilised two survey\n            instruments, a) a household survey which was administered on\n            ten randomly chosen households and b) a second questionnaire\n            administered on community leaders (which also included\n            members of the RDP\u0092s subproject implementation committee).\n            The data collected in the baseline survey, conducted between\n            2010 and 2011, was the main basis for comparison and\n            subsequent impact evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Evaluation of the Solomon Islands rural\n            development program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Evaluation of the Solomon Islands\n            rural development program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2013/10/20474567/evaluation-solomon-islands-rural-development-program","count":"Solomon Islands","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Health and other social services,Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Economic & Sector Work","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Access to Health, Access to Markets, Access\n            to Sanitation Facilities, access to services, access to\n            water supply, Accountability, agricultural practices,\n            allocation of water, average travel time, basic sanitation,\n            best practices, church leaders, clean water, communities,\n            Community Development, community groups, community leaders,\n            community members, community ownership, community\n            participation, community projects, consensus, Consultation,\n            Data Analysis, data collection, decision making, drinking\n            water, driving, Female, fieldwork, figures, focus groups,\n            Food Security, fresh water, Gender, Government services,\n            household use, households, houses, infrastructure projects,\n            infrastructures, interest groups, local community, mode of\n            transport, outreach, participatory development, Program\n            Evaluation, project implementation, project Participation,\n            quality of water, quality water, reflection, rivers, road,\n            Roads, Rural Development, Sanitation, Sanitation Facilities,\n            suppliers, toilets, trains, transport, Travel time, true,\n            Village, village level, villages, water projects, water\n            quality, water resources, water services, water source,\n            water sources, water supply, water system, Water Table,\n            Water Tanker, wells, youth"}},"majtheme":"Rural development,Financial and private sector development","projn":"SB-Rural Development Program -- P089297","topic":"Social Accountability m1326920 733,Water Supply and Sanitation m1327240 1199,Governance m1327255 831,Land and Housing m1327648 817,Transport Economics m1326662 162","subtopic":"Social Accountability,Housing & Human Habitats,Transport Economics Policy & Planning,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions","docty":"Rural Development Assessment","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Transport,Water Supply and Sanitation,Social Development","entityids":{"entityid":"000470435_20141205102940"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!80466"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!80466"}},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Other social services,General transportation sector,General public administration sector,Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","theme":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural policies and institutions,Rural non-farm income generation","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Transport,Water Supply and Sanitation,Social Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Social Accountability m1326920 733,Water Supply and Sanitation m1327240 1199,Governance m1327255 831,Land and Housing m1327648 817,Transport Economics m1326662 162","owner":"Urban, Rural & Soc Dev -
