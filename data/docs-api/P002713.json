It will significantly raise smallholder incomes\n            and increase Tanzania's foreign exchange earnings.\n            Specifically, the project will finance bulking bags,\n            grading/baling centers, marketing centers, vehicles and\n            related maintenance equipment, storage warehouses and\n            ancillary facilities, and incremental staff and technical\n            assistance for TAT. The project faces no special risk. While\n            implementation could proceed at a slower rate than\n            anticipated as a result of institutional deficiencies, this\n            risk has been minimized through the provision of technical assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Tobacco Handling Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Tobacco Handling Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/04/726953/tanzania-tobacco-handling-project","projn":"TZ-Tobacco Handling -- P002713","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Early Child and Children's Health,Economic Theory & Research,Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Tanzania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912374868"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural commodities,agricultural\n            extension,agricultural extension services,agricultural\n            inputs,Agricultural Marketing,agricultural\n            production,agricultural research\n            institutes,Agriculture,Audits,baling,capita incomes,capital\n            goods,cassava,CGIAR,coffee,Cooperatives,Cost\n            Savings,cotton,Crop,Crop Development,crop production,crop\n            residues,crop storage,crops,Cultivation,Cultivation\n            techniques,dairy products,Decentralization,development\n            projects,Development Strategy,diseases,diseconomies,Economic\n            Research,eggs,equipment,exchange rate,export\n            crops,exports,extension services,farm,farm\n            storage,Farmer,Farmer Incomes,farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,farms,fertilizer,field crops,fish,fisheries,food\n            crops,food production,food\n            products,foodgrains,forecasts,forestry,fruits,fuelwood,GDP,GNP,grain,growth\n            rate,harvesting,harvests,imports,Income,income\n            distribution,institutional change,interest\n            rates,international agricultural\n            research,jute,legislation,livestock,maize,Natural\n            Resources,overgrazing,overhead costs,per capita income,per\n            capita incomes,plantations,population growth,price\n            increases,private sector,produce,producers,production\n            increases,productive infrastructure,purchase\n            price,rice,Rural Development,seed,seedlings,sisal,small\n            farmers,soil fertility,soil\n            types,sugar,tea,Tobacco,vegetables,village water\n            supply,wheat,wholesale prices,wilt,yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural commodities,agricultural\n            extension,agricultural extension services,agricultural\n            inputs,Agricultural Marketing,agricultural\n            production,agricultural research\n            institutes,Agriculture,Audits,baling,capita incomes,capital\n            goods,cassava,CGIAR,coffee,Cooperatives,Cost\n            Savings,cotton,Crop,Crop Development,crop production,crop\n            residues,crop storage,crops,Cultivation,Cultivation\n            techniques,dairy products,Decentralization,development\n            projects,Development Strategy,diseases,diseconomies,Economic\n            Research,eggs,equipment,exchange rate,export\n            crops,exports,extension services,farm,farm\n            storage,Farmer,Farmer Incomes,farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,farms,fertilizer,field crops,fish,fisheries,food\n            crops,food production,food\n            products,foodgrains,forecasts,forestry,fruits,fuelwood,GDP,GNP,grain,growth\n            rate,harvesting,harvests,imports,Income,income\n            distribution,institutional change,interest\n            rates,international agricultural\n            research,jute,legislation,livestock,maize,Natural\n            Resources,overgrazing,overhead costs,per capita income,per\n            capita incomes,plantations,population growth,price\n            increases,private sector,produce,producers,production\n            increases,productive infrastructure,purchase\n            price,rice,Rural Development,seed,seedlings,sisal,small\n            farmers,soil fertility,soil\n            types,sugar,tea,Tobacco,vegetables,village water\n            supply,wheat,wholesale prices,wilt,yields"}},"owner":"WB Off:DaresSalaam-Eastern AFR 1 (AFCE1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"1866"},"facets":{}}}
