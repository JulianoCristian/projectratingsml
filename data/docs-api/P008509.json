The two\n            most important lessons from this operation are: (1) the\n            transition from a command to a competitive and growing\n            market economy is more complex and will take longer, than\n            many assumed initially. This is especially true in the case\n            of countries such as Kazakstan which in the past have had\n            very little contact with Western market economies; and (2)\n            fundamental to the success of any adjustment operation is\n            the borrower's commitment to the program. A core team\n            of national officials with whom Bank staff can work, and\n            whose reform efforts can be supported by Bank lending, is\n            essential if the Bank's assistance

The Kazakstani government recognizes\n            that it must deliver growth and employment as it\n            restructures the economy. The program discussed in this\n            report will provide the systematic support for macroeconomic\n            stabilization and long term efficient development. The\n            project will finance imports comprised of a foreign exchange\n            component and a preidentified imports component. The foreign\n            exchange component will support access of importers to the\n            foreign exchange auction market for financing imports\n            through established commercial practices. The preidentified\n            import component will finance essential imports required for\n            the continued delivery of essential public services and a\n            recovery in key
