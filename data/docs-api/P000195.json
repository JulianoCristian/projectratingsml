The broad objectives of the project were\n            to increase the quantity and improve the quality of food\n            crop, coffee and livestock production and to increase farm\n            income Up to October 1993, project impact was positive. With\n            the revision in the extension methodology in 1992 from a\n            top-down to a participative approach, project impact on the\n            ground improved remarkably. The project was highly\n            successful in introducing improved seeds and agroforestry\n            trees to farmers and in enlisting groups of farmers to\n            produce these seeds and trees. The overall assessment of the\n            project's outcome must be rated as unsatisfactory,\n            notwithstanding the important achievements made prior to\n            October 1993 and some even afterwards. There are three main\n            lessons to be learned from this project: (a) an in-depth\n            institutional analysis of participating institutions has to\n            be done as part of project preparation and the\n            implementation schedule needs to be established on the basis\n            of this assessment; (b) the project has clearly underscored\n            the importance and positive impact of involving\n            beneficiaries in the execution of the project, as was the\n            case with the revised approach to extension and the positive\n            response to providing support to farmers voluntarily\n            organized in groups; (c) the importance of selecting a\n            technical assistant that is capable of transferring skill\n            and knowledge to local staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Muyinga Agricultural Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi - Muyinga Agricultural\n            Development
