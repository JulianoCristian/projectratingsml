Connectivity Development Policy Loans"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Connectivity Development Policy\n            Loans for Indonesia were moderately satisfactory with\n            substantial risk to the development outcome. The\n            performances by both the Bank and the Borrower were\n            moderately satisfactory. There were no significant changes\n            or restructuring made to to this program. There were seven\n            recorded lessons learned from this project and are as\n            follows: (1) The Bank needs to strike a balance between\n            (Development Policy Loans) DPLs supporting reform in narrow\n            areas with narrower outcomes but less risk, versus a widely\n            cross-cutting DPLs supporting reform in broader areas that\n            is riskier but often could have more development impact. (2)\n            A cross-cutting DPL does not automatically translate into\n            improved coordination within the implementing ministries. A\n            suggested approach would be for the Government to focus on\n            policy actions themselves and structure the coordination\n            meetings around their relation to the strategic-level\n            Government connectivity agenda. (3) Complementing Bank\n            instruments, such as TAs, could be used for an effective\n            implementation of widely cross-cutting DPL. The\n            cross-cutting nature and the lack of focus of the\n            Connectivity DPL made it difficult to use complementing\n            existing Bank instruments to improve its effectiveness. (4)\n            Having more than one strong counterpart is a suitable\n            arrangement for cross-cutting DPLs involving several\n            ministries and agencies. It is key that the counterpart\n            champions policy reforms, as in the case of Bappenas that\n            had a high-level representative, whereas some of the other\n            agencies were represented by echelons 3 or below. (5)\n            Electoral cycles may have an impact on the momentum of\n            reforms and it is important to consider the potential\n            bureaucratic obstacles to reforms that appear especially\n            during the pre-election period. (6) In a middle-income\n            country without problems to access financial markets, a DPL\n            should be seen as one instrument, among others, to improve\n            the chances of long-term, structural, reforms. (7) In light\n            of the experience of the first two Connectivity DPLs, a\n            number of factors would need to be considered (see Section 6\n            for further elaboration)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Connectivity Development Policy Loans"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Connectivity\n            Development Policy

Connectivity\n            Development Policy Loan (DPL) program is to assist the\n            Government of Indonesia to strengthen the policy framework\n            for improved national trade logistics, transportation,\n            Information and Communication Technology, or ICT, and trade\n            facilitation. Policy reforms supported by this operation\n            will focus on the following pillars: i) strengthening\n            national coordination and regulation; ii) strengthening\n            intra-island connectivity; iii) improving inter-island\n            connectivity; and iv) improving International connectivity\n            (trade facilitation). The DPL to Indonesia for US$100\n            million is designed to assist the Government of Indonesia\n            (GoI) to strengthen the policy framework for improved\n            national trade logistics, transportation, and ICT and trade\n            facilitation. In developing the operation, the Bank and the\n            Government considered several design alternatives, including\n            the possibility of supporting such reforms through a single\n            multisectoral DPL. The overall focus of the INSTANSI DPL,\n            Connectivity DPL and Financial Sector and Investment Climate\n            Reform and Modernization Development Policy Loan (FIRM DPL)\n            is consistent with the World Bank's Development Policy\n            Review (2008), and they are fully aligned with the 2009-2012\n            Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR). The\n            connectivity DPL is expected to further enhance coordination\n            and implementation of GoI reforms in the connectivity\n            agenda, which is critical for accelerating growth to 7\n            percent and beyond, and continuing improvements in social\n            outcomes over the medium term."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Connectivity Development Policy\n
