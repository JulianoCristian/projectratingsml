One important lesson learned from the\n            project is the need to develop consensus through dual and\n            parallel track approaches to forge an agreement on various\n            technical matters in an international river organization. In\n            the case of the Mekong River Commission (MRC), the four\n            countries differ in terms of geographical location as well\n            as the level of the development; therefore, the demand for\n            the water resources development differs 17 substantially\n            from country to country. The project adopted a method of\n            formal negotiations among representatives from the\n            respective governments, comprising technical (line\n            ministries) and legal/administrative aspects. These\n            negotiations often encountered difficulties in the early\n            stage as participants from one country did not understand\n            other countries' positions. The process for developing\n            rules will have been more efficient if the project had\n            organized more informal national and regional workshops and\n            by inviting additional stakeholders to deepen their\n            understanding of each country's view to help develop\n            consensus among the member countries. A formal meeting will\n            then be organized only after certain achievements and\n            understandings have been assured. A better communication\n            strategy to the stakeholder regarding the application of the\n            hydrological models and water utilization procedures could\n            have been considered. The Decision Support Framework (DSF)\n            is now used as the main tool for planning water resources\n            investments. However, sources of the models need to be\n            disclosed to the general public for independent review and\n            examination, at least through a step-by-step approach to\n            confirm the accuracy and robustness to make the model more\n            credible and trustworthy; otherwise, the model will be\n            considered as a black box that cannot be evaluated\n            objectively. Further, the progress and final outcome of the\n            water utilization procedures will have been disclosed and\n            disseminated not only to the line ministries, but also to\n            the riparian communities and local governments which were\n            directly affected by the procedures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam -\n            Mekong Water Utilization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and\n            Viet Nam -
