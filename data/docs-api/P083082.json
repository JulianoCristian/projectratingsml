Some\n            lessons learned includes: results framework should be\n            designed to measure direct impact of the project. This\n            includes ensuring that monitoring and impact indicators\n            directly correspond to the project objective and are easily\n            measurable. This is essential not only to assessing whether\n            project objectives have been achieved, but also to ensuring\n            that the targets are practically achievable and within the\n            control of the project management. In case of significant\n            project delays, which may affect implementation of original\n            project design, a review of planned project activities\n            should be conducted to confirm that they can be practically\n            implemented. As a result of long delays, operational and\n            political circumstances may change. Implementing entities\n            should include key staff with required qualification and\n            experience with World Bank procedures from the very start of\n            the project. As there was no suitable entity within the\n            government, and based on previous experience with government\n            run projects in Nigeria, a private entity was tasked with\n            project management. The Project Management Unit (PMU) also\n            employed national staff in some key positions thus building\n            local capacity, while the Project Implementation Unit (PIU)\n            was staffed with civil servants. As a result, it is likely\n            that the local staff capacity to implement complex projects\n            was increased, and should provide a significant human\n            resource for future projects. While the engagement of a\n            private sector operator may have increased overall\n            implementation capacity in a complex implementation\n            environment, the private PMU has also experienced initial\n            challenges with applying World Bank procurement guidelines.\n            All core project management functions should be within a\n            single implementing entity. Implementation arrangements\n            envisaged both the private PMU and government led PIU. While\n            most of the project management functions were with the PMU,\n            including procurement, the responsibility for financial\n            management and disbursements and compliance with World Bank\n            rules in these areas rested with the PIU. Though it was a\n            pilot project, which allowed for a more flexible design and\n            testing of new approaches, the breadth of the operation may\n            have been too ambitious. This is especially true with regard\n            to numerous activities aimed at reforming the investment\n            climate which required wide institutional support which\n            could not be fully secured."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Micro, Small and Medium\n            Enterprise

- Micro, Small and Medium\n            Enterprise Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise\n            (MSME) Project in Nigeria aims to increase the performance\n            and employment levels of MSMEs in selected non-oil industry\n            sub-sectors and in three targeted states of the country. To\n            achieve this, the project in Nigeria will: (i) develop and\n            strengthen the capacity of local intermediaries to deliver\n            financial and non-financial services to MSMEs; (ii) reduce\n            selected investment climate barriers that constrain MSME\n            performance; (iii) mobilize, via (i) and (ii), increased\n            private investments in MSMEs, and intermediaries. The\n            project has the following five components: Component 1) will\n            seek to deepen and broaden the financial services available\n            to MSMEs. This will be achieved through the provision of\n            grants to assist qualifying institutions and companies to\n            provide up to four types of commercially sustainable\n            financial services to MSMEs. These grants will be used to\n            finance technical and capacity building assistance to the\n            providers. Component 2) will seek to develop the market for\n            business development services (BDS) by supporting\n            intermediaries to respond to unmet MSME demand for BDS\n            focusing on the three target States. This will be done\n            through the provision of grants and technical assistance to\n            qualifying institutions and companies to develop products\n            and to strengthen their operations in order to be able to\n            respond commercially and over a sustained period to market\n            demand. Component 3) Technical and capacity building support\n            will be provided through the IDA credit to assist in the\n            following initiatives of the Government of Nigeria: (a)\n            Registration Reform, (b) Commercial Dispute Resolution, (c)\n            Leasing services, (d) Credit Bureau, and (e) Secured\n            Transaction System. Component 4) IDA resources will be\n            allocated to provide selected Federal and target State\n            Government Agencies with MSME development responsibilities\n            the opportunity to access global best practices.\n            Specifically, advisory services would be available to\n            provide best practice capacity-building to institutions with\n            policy and related responsibilities for the MSME sector.\n            Component 5) IDA funds will be allocated to finance the\n            execution, reporting, review (semi-annual and mid-term) and\n            monitoring of project components and independent evaluations\n            of selected issues, particularly through case studies.\n            Provisions will also be made for equipment and operational\n            costs and other financial, audit, training and consultant\n            assignments as required and laid out in the approved annual\n            procurement plan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria -
