Russian men and women had a combined life expectancy\n            of 66, about 14 years below the life expectancy of those in\n            the European Union. High mortality and morbidity rates were\n            caused primarily by non-communicable diseases like heart\n            disease, strokes, cancer, and injuries from road traffic\n            crashes. At the same time, since the early 1990s, factors\n            including poverty, under-funding of health services, and\n            technical inadequacies have also contributed to Russia\n            having one of the highest rates of TB in the world. This has\n            been aggravated by the spread of multi-drug resistant TB and\n            HIV and AIDS. Since 2003, the International Bank for\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has financed projects\n            in the health sector in Russia. A TB and AIDS Control\n            Project developed policies and guidelines in line with\n            international standards for prevention, diagnosis, treatment\n            and follow-up of patients with TB and HIV, targeting both\n            civilians and prisoners.
