The main\n            objectives of this project are to: (a) support the\n            Government's stabilization and structural reform\n            program; (b) improve the incentives framework for private\n            sector development; and (c) ease the shortage of foreign\n            exchange needed to finance critical imports to facilitate a\n            supply response.
