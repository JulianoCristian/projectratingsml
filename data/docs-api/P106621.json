Some\n            important project lessons learned were: (1) Accelerated\n            teacher training is an effective approach in the Haitian\n            context in which there is an undersupply of qualified\n            teachers. One important advantage of the program was that\n            student teachers were actively educating primary students\n            after only one year of pedagogical training. (2) If there is\n            a stipend for student-teachers, it is critical to ensure at\n            the outset that that stipend can and will be paid. The Bank\n            and the recipient need to ensure that the institutions with\n            decision-making power regarding the stipend are on-board\n            with its timely payment. Failure to regularly disburse the\n            stipend can demoralize and disillusion the student teachers\n            and jeopardize the program. (3) A progressive implementation\n            of stipends may provide a solution to fiscal constraints and\n            to retention of student-teachers. (4) Implementation of a\n            teacher training program should be coordinated with the\n            academic year to ensure greater efficiency and less\n            disruption to the training institutes. The teacher training\n            program began its first cohort in March of 2009 which\n            misaligned graduation of student-teachers with the beginning\n            of the next school year. This meant that graduates would be\n            released from the program with a long hiatus. It also was\n            disruptive to the Teacher Preparation Institutes who had\n            ongoing programs and had to suddenly accommodate the influx\n            of new students."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Meeting Teacher Needs for\n            Education-For-All Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Haiti - Meeting Teacher Needs for\n

The major changes to the Project and\n            rationale are as follows: (a) reflect that Participation\n            Performance Agreements (PPAs) include support for the\n            participation of student-teachers in teacher training\n            through the provision of stipends. The decision to\n            restructure the activities under the Project was made to\n            facilitate the consolidation of the Haiti education sector\n            portfolio; (b) in view of the sector portfolio\n            consolidation, and by reducing the scope of activities, it\n            is expected that implementation of the Project will be\n            completed earlier than was originally projected. It is in\n            that regard to reduce the Project implementation period by\n            eight months. The closing date will, therefore, be brought\n            forward from January 15, 2013 to June 30, 2012; (c) the\n            Project outcome indicators will be revised. The target\n            values for two outcome indicators will be adjusted, and one\n            intermediate outcome indicator will be revised in view of\n            changes to project activities; and (d) a corresponding\n            reallocation of the proceeds of the grant will also be made\n            in line with the adjustments that have been introduced to\n            the Project costs
