Some lessons learned includes:\n            keeping the scope of the project straightforward and simple\n            while including some forward looking, developmental\n            elements, and allowing for maximum feasible flexibility of\n            implementation greatly facilitates successful implementation\n            of projects of such nature. The project's design\n            included flexible and adaptable elements that helped it\n            thrive in difficult circumstances and laid the groundwork\n            for continued improvements to municipal finances and overall\n            municipal strengthening. Taking advantage of existing\n            implementation capacity and extending the life of an already\n            proven and tested Project Completion Unit (PCU) rather than\n            creating new structures, helped improve the success of the\n            project in a difficult environment. This project built on\n            what was already there and working, rapid response from the\n            Bank project staff based in Lebanon for a large part,\n            contributed to the success of project. They were able to\n            quickly respond to problems when they arose and facilitated\n            project restructuring as needed. The success of the project\n            is linked to the overall effort that was sustained over\n            time, in a context of political turmoil and uncertainty.\n            Whilst focusing on emergency needs, the project was also\n            able to address capacity building issues and to set the\n            basis for effective municipal strengthening and\n            decentralization. It also contributed to improving the life\n            of people on a daily basis. Such an approach can only be\n            developed and implemented over time as it is essential to\n            establish meaningful reforms and achieve concrete progress\n            on the ground. The short time allotted to the preparation of\n            emergency operations, coupled with a rapid preparation\n            process may require further development of the monitoring\n            and evaluation framework at the early stages of\n            implementation. The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)\n            framework is a key element of the project design which can\n            only be well apprehended and developed after the initial\n            steps of implementation of emergency reconstruction\n            projects. It then can be at the core of project monitoring."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lebanon - First Municipal Infrastructure Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lebanon - First Municipal\n            Infrastructure Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/10/16913847/lebanon-first-municipal-infrastructure-project","projn":"LB-- Municipal Infrastructure -- P103875","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Urban Slums Upgrading,Urban Services to the Poor,Public Sector Management and Reform,Municipal Financial Management,Regional Governance","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Governance,Public Sector Development,Urban Development","count":"Lebanon","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20121105005712"},"theme":"City-wide Infrastructure and Service Delivery,Urban Economic Development,Municipal governance and institution building,Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","subsc":"General industry and trade sector,Urban Transport,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Governance,Public Sector Development,Urban Development","prdln":"Special Financing","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"assets, basic services, Capacity Building,\n            cities, housing, Indigenous Peoples, intergovernmental\n            transfers, local government, local government performance,\n            local governments, local level, MIDDLE EAST, MUNICIPAL,\n            Municipal Administration, municipal buildings, Municipal\n            Infrastructure, municipal services, Municipalities, NORTH\n            AFRICA, public, sanitation, schools, street lighting,\n            technical assistance, urban development, urban roads, Urban Sector"}},"owner":"Urban (MNSUR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF057333-DGF -

Overall, the project is on track. During the early\n            years of project implementation the reconstruction or repair\n            of damage municipal infrastructure (under component one)\n            received highest priority in order to address the\n            population's most pressing needs. Similarly, the\n            capacity building activities (component three) have also\n            been fully delivered. The launch of the local development\n            investments (component two) had, however, been intentionally\n            postponed to fully concentrate the local implementation\n            capacity on the most urgent activities until the emergency\n            work was sufficiently advanced. Because of the political\n            uncertainties and security conditions experienced in 2007\n            and 2008, the time and efforts required to carry out the\n            agreed scope of work were much greater than initially\n            anticipated. As a result of the delays faced during the\n            initial stage of the project, and in response to a request\n            by the Government of Lebanon (GOL), the Bank approved on\n            December 16, 2009 an 18-month extension of the grant's\n            closing date. This additional time allowed for the\n            completion of emergency reconstruction work and advancing\n            the more complex implementation of the municipal\n            investments. As the project enters in its final phase, there\n            are now only 15 ongoing works contracts aimed at reviving\n            the local economy, fostering social integration and\n            promoting local development, which will need a little more\n            time to reach completion."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lebanon - Additional Financing\n            Grant for the First Municipal Infrastructure Project :\n            restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/03/14244625/lebanon-additional-financing-grant-first-municipal-infrastructure-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"LB-- Municipal Infrastructure -- P103875","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Post Conflict Reconstruction,E-Business,Social Accountability,Housing & Human Habitats,Debt Markets","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Conflict and Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Social Development","count":"Lebanon","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20110525004118"},"subsc":"General industry and trade sector,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways,Other social services,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Conflict and Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Social Development","prdln":"Special Financing","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"action plan, capacity building, conflict,\n            disbursement, elections, Expenditure, expenditures,\n            financing requirements, IBRD, implementation plan, local\n            economy, municipal investments, political uncertainties,\n            procurement, procurement processes, project implementation,\n            Project Management, reconstruction, result, social\n            integration, Trust Fund"}},"owner":"Sustainable Development (MNSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF057333-DGF - LEBANON: RAPID SOCIAL AND\n            LIVELIHOODS ASSESSMENT,TF057505-LEBANON: FIRST MUNICIPAL\n            INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT (FMIP) - ADDITIONAL FIN","repnb":"62075"},"facets":{}}}
