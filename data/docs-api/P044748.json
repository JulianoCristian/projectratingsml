Some lessons learned\n            included: when re-launching an investment program with a\n            country, it is key to determine a sector for which the\n            Government has sufficient commitment, and the new project\n            should have visible economic and social benefits, even in an\n            uncertain macroeconomic and structural environment. In order\n            to measure the results of the project, it is important to\n            have the baseline and end-of-project indicators quantified\n            prior to implementation and to have measurable indicators.\n            In projects that have many project sites that are widely\n            dispersed throughout the country and contracts that are too\n            small to be of interest to international bidders, it is\n            necessary to provide workshops, and information to local\n            bidders; to revise the conditions and terms of the bidding\n            documents as needed to attract a sufficient number of bids;\n            and for both the Bank team and the Project Management Unit\n            (PMU) to meet with potential local bidders to inform them\n            about the Bank's procurement procedures and determine\n            the reasons for their failure to bid. It is important to\n            have accurate basic data for the technical specifications\n            and require the beneficiary institution to sign off on the\n            data, have the design and supervision consultant and the\n            project implementing agency visit the sites before\n            finalization of the technical specifications to verify the\n            basic data, and request the contractors to visit the sites\n            before the start of works in order to avoid costly change\n            orders and contract amendments during implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Belarus -
