Ratings for the\n            Second Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project in Mexico were as follows: outcome\n            was unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. Ratings for\n            the Third Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project in Mexico were as follows: outcome\n            was moderately unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome\n            was significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory and\n            borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Lessons\n            learned include: the expected outcomes and scope of an\n            operation should be subject to several reality checks at\n            appraisal. An important one is to ensure that essential\n            partners such as INFONAVIT (National Housing Fund for\n            Private Sector Workers) in this case-are fully on board and\n            committed to the operation. If they are not, or cannot be\n            engaged for reasons of political economy, then an\n            operation's scope should be contained to cover the more\n            modest outcomes that can reasonably be obtained without such\n            partners. In large and sophisticated middle-income countries\n            like Mexico, an operation should avoid promising sector-wide\n            reforms when commensurate results cannot be realistically\n            achieved in the short timeframe and with the relatively\n            modest scale of assistance offered. Operations aiming to\n            support affordable housing and urban poverty reduction need\n            to be explicit about their target beneficiary populations,\n            with quantification of baselines and targets, and at\n            completion, achievements. Contrary to down-market aims,\n            establishing a sound reputation in financial markets and\n            sustaining a high quality and expanding portfolio can lead a\n            new mortgage financier up-market, by targeting higher income\n            borrowers with larger loans. Markets perceive such loans as\n            less risky. They are also less costly to manage and\n            contribute more to business growth."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - FOVI Restructuring Project,\n            Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty

Ratings\n            for the Second and Third Programmatic Affordable Housing and\n            Urban Poverty Development Policy Loan Projects for Mexico\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            a policy-based loan is not the best instrument to address\n            technical issues requiring considerable investment and which\n            are not backed by an adequate policy framework. Instead, a\n            combination of policy and investment loans might have been\n            more effective in meeting the Program's goals.\n            Inefficiencies and redundancies were produced due to the\n            involvement of too many institutions, which were often at\n            odds with each other over policy issues. This was largely\n            due to the large number of components and sectors under the\n            umbrella of the Program. A more focused approach, as\n            previously mentioned, could have reduced these\n            inefficiencies and redundancies. The comprehensive nature of\n            the Program required that adequate Monitoring and Evaluation\n            (M&E) provisions be written into the design of the\n            operation; however this was not done until preparation of\n            the second operation was well advanced. Housing and Urban\n            Technical Assistance Loan (HUTAL) should have played a role\n            in fixing the shortcomings of the Program and its\n            implementing institutions in this area. The timing of HUTAL\n            should have been better aligned with the Program in order to\n            provide added value to each component."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Affordable Housing and

is satisfactory,\n            sustainability likely, and institutional development impacts\n            substantial. This simplified Implementation Completion\n            Report provides some findings and implications for\n            subsequent operations as follows. Reforms supported by HUSAL\n            have contributed to the recent expansion and diversification\n            of market-rate housing credit in the moderate-income\n            segment, by leveraging private sector resources, as\n            evidenced by an increase in the outstanding mortgage to GDP\n            ratio from 4.9 percent in 2000, to 7.3 percent in 2004. To a\n            large extent, the elements included in the agreed policy\n            matrix will promote this outcome; however special attention\n            should be given to the subsidy component. It would be\n            advisable to incorporate into the policy matrix the\n            development of a comprehensive housing sector database that\n            could provide the housing commission with an essential tool,\n            necessary to exercise the role as policy body. The\n            Program's main objective - improving the living\n            conditions of the poor- depends on a broad array of\n            variables identified in each of the project's\n            components. To different degrees, reform is needed in all of\n            them to address the main goal. It is expected these reforms\n            will occur gradually, and this is the reason the\n            programmatic structure of the project design suits the\n            operation. Moreover, there are substantial benefits to be\n            gained in favor of sector policy from the Bank's role\n            as facilitator between different government agencies,\n            fostering policy discussion towards reform. This has been\n            recognized by the client as an important, positive impact of\n            the Bank's role."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Affordable Housing and Urban\n            Poverty Sector Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico -

To this end, the project goals focus on seven key\n            areas: a) develop a sound national policy and institutional\n            framework for housing, and urban development; b)design and\n            establish a unified housing subsidy policy that facilitates\n            access of low/moderate-income families, to housing, and\n            leverages household savings, and private credit finance; c)\n            strengthen the housing credit, and savings systems; d)\n            strengthen urban real property registries, and rights; d)\n            increase the supply of urban land and its access by the\n            poor, and improve real estate market functions; e)\n            coordinate and support physical and social investments, to\n            systematically upgrade poor neighborhoods; and, f) improved\n            prevention and management of the impacts of natural\n            disasters. Risks however, include a relatively ambitious\n            cross-sectoral approach, risking the timing approval of the\n            second and third loans in the program. However, this risk\n            should be mitigated through the well-designed, integrated\n            strategy, and a small number of key prior actions, including\n            the intended reform

   adversity that may result from implementation of the\n            Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty Structural Adjustment\n            Loan Project in Mexico. From an institutional perspective,\n            the report suggests active participation by environmental\n            authorities in the housing sector, on policy planning, and\n            implementation, supported by a strong legal, and regulatory\n            framework. To this end, the conflicts between federal, and\n            state programs should be addressed, to then establish\n            mechanisms strengthening housing information management\n            systems for the provision of housing environmental\n            indicators, low-income housing costs, and housing market\n            estimates.
