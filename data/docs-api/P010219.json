The project achieved\n            its objectives, its impact on institutional development has\n            been substantial, sustainability is likely, and both the\n            Bank and Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, most of the\n            technical issues should be investigated during project\n            preparation. Also, sample bidding documents should be\n            provided and the procurement process initiated prior to loan\n            approval. Second, changes in the scope of the project were\n            introduced by WAPDA once the project got underway. While the\n            changes introduced were technically sound, timely\n            implementation of the project was affected since additional\n            time was required to obtain the necessary approvals. Also,\n            changes can make it difficult to evaluate project outcomes\n            relative to appraisal targets. Third, WAPDA should pay\n            closer attention to the timely finalization of financing\n            arrangements, ensure adequate counterpart funds, and\n            maintain stricter controls over its suppliers and\n            contractors. Finally, WAPDA should strengthen the\n            supervision systems of its ongoing projects to get timely\n            feedback for taking remedial actions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Fifth WAPDA Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Fifth WAPDA Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/04/733400/pakistan-fifth-wapda-power-project","projn":"PK-Wapda V (Power Trans -- P010219","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Teaching and Learning,Business Environment,Business in Development,Pharmaceuticals & Pharmacoeconomics,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Education","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961214174835"},"subsc":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Account,accounting,accounts,accounts\n            receivable,Achievement,Achievements,Borrower,borrowings,commitment,contractors,cost\n            overruns,counterpart,counterpart\n            funds,disbursement,disbursement\n            procedures,Disbursements,expenditures,feasibility,financial\n            resources,Guarantee Agreements,LOAN,Loan Effectiveness,Local\n            Competitive Bidding,operating costs,procurement,PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION,sales,suppliers"},"1":{"cdata!":"Account,accounting,accounts,accounts\n            receivable,Achievement,Achievements,Borrower,borrowings,commitment,contractors,cost\n            overruns,counterpart,counterpart\n            funds,disbursement,disbursement\n            procedures,Disbursements,expenditures,feasibility,financial\n            resources,Guarantee Agreements,LOAN,Loan Effectiveness,Local\n            Competitive Bidding,operating costs,procurement,PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION,sales,suppliers"}},"owner":"SAS","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"15897"},"740050":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/05/740050/pakistan-fifth-water-power-development-authority-wapda-power-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/05/740050/pakistan-fifth-water-power-development-authority-wapda-power-project","new_url":"1985/05/740050/pakistan-fifth-water-power-development-authority-wapda-power-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/05/01/000009265_3970625094649/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/05/01/000009265_3970625094649/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2556","docdt":"1985-05-31T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1985-05-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Fifth Water and Power\n            Development Authority (WAPDA) Power Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Fifth WAPDA Power Project will\n            assist the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) in\n            the expansion of the extra high voltage power transmission\n            network, thereby permitting the optimal operation of\n            interconnected generation facilities and contributing to\n            reduced transmission losses.
