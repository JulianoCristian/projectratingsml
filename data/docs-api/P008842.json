Among the several lessons learned, it\n            is emphasized that institutional stability is crucial to\n            project success; thus, the Bank should be informed of\n            upcoming institutional changes, and potential implications\n            to the project, and as well, the Project Unit should be\n            given clear terms of reference, to minimize outside negative\n            influences. The nature of eco-tourism, and the economic\n            value of natural habitats is just beginning to be\n            recognized, but the approach to interfacing the work of\n            reserve managers, with that of local communities, i.e.,\n            participation through formal surveys, and consultations\n            during the development of the Sustainable Development\n            Strategies, provided a key lesson to be expanded by the\n            protected area managers in the future. Regardless of\n            success, the project was somehow overly ambitious, both in\n            terms of implementation plans, and objectives, and, in terms\n            of an over optimistic implementation schedule. It is thus\n            suggested that explicit targets, and performance indicators\n            be in place at the onset of the project, to help identify\n            the success, cost-effectiveness, and basic usefulness of\n            components throughout implementation. And, a number of\n            causal factors conduced to a slower timeframe\n            implementation, namely: GEF projects are inherently\n            comprehensive, therefore complex, and, institutional\n            capacity building is a process that takes time. Both the\n            absence of performance indicators, and the implementation\n            schedule are considered a design flaw, a lesson to be taken\n            into account for subsequent operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Slovak Republic - Biodiversity Protection Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Slovak Republic - Biodiversity\n            Protection Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/04/1089575/slovak-republic-biodiversity-protection-project","projn":"SK-Biodiversity Gef Project -- P008842","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Biodiversity,Wetlands,Forestry,Environmental Management,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Slovak Republic","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01042804184020"},"subsc":"Central government administration,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agriculture,animal species,arable\n            land,Biodiversity,Biodiversity Action Plan,Biodiversity\n            Conservation,Biodiversity Protection,biodiversity\n            research,Biodiversity Strategy,Biological\n            Diversity,Biosphere,Biosphere\n            Reserves,birds,breeding,capacity\n            building,Catchment,climate,climate\n            change,Conservation,conservation projects,Conservation\n            Strategy,cropland,Ecology,ecosystem,ecosystems,endangered\n            species,Erosion,erosion\n            control,farmers,fish,Flooding,FLOODPLAINS,floods,Forest,forest\n            biodiversity,Forest Department,forest land,forest\n            management,Forest Nursery,forest restoration,forest\n            systems,forestry,forestry development,forestry\n            issues,forestry sector,forests,Geographic\n            Information,GIS,Global Environment,Global Environment\n            Facility,Innovation,land management,land ownership,land\n            restitution,land use,land use planning,land\n            uses,meadows,mitigation,National Biodiversity,national\n            parks,native species,Natural Resources,Natural Resources\n            Management,Nature,nature\n            conservation,parks,pollution,protected areas,public\n            awareness,RAMSAR,regional planning,remote\n            sensing,restoration,restoration activities,riparian\n            vegetation,sheep,silviculture,soil erosion,Sustainable\n            Development,vegetation,Waterfowl,Waterfowl Habitat,Wetlands,Wildlife"},"1":{"cdata!":"agriculture,animal species,arable\n            land,Biodiversity,Biodiversity Action Plan,Biodiversity\n            Conservation,Biodiversity Protection,biodiversity\n            research,Biodiversity Strategy,Biological\n            Diversity,Biosphere,Biosphere\n            Reserves,birds,breeding,capacity\n            building,Catchment,climate,climate\n            change,Conservation,conservation projects,Conservation\n            Strategy,cropland,Ecology,ecosystem,ecosystems,endangered\n            species,Erosion,erosion\n            control,farmers,fish,Flooding,FLOODPLAINS,floods,Forest,forest\n            biodiversity,Forest Department,forest land,forest\n            management,Forest Nursery,forest restoration,forest\n            systems,forestry,forestry development,forestry\n            issues,forestry sector,forests,Geographic\n            Information,GIS,Global Environment,Global Environment\n            Facility,Innovation,land management,land ownership,land\n            restitution,land use,land use planning,land\n            uses,meadows,mitigation,National Biodiversity,national\n            parks,native species,Natural Resources,Natural Resources\n            Management,Nature,nature\n            conservation,parks,pollution,protected areas,public\n            awareness,RAMSAR,regional planning,remote\n            sensing,restoration,restoration activities,riparian\n            vegetation,sheep,silviculture,soil erosion,Sustainable\n            Development,vegetation,Waterfowl,Waterfowl Habitat,Wetlands,Wildlife"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF020855-AUSTRIAN CONSULTANT TRUST FUND\n            FOR E & C EUROPE,TF031024-POLAND & SLOVAK REPUBLIC -\n            FORESTRY;
