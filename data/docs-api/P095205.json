Some lessons\n            learned included: certain aspects of the World Bank's\n            policies and guidance on development policy lending should\n            be clarified. Particularly for DPLs focused on reforms in a\n            sector - rather than on macro-economic stability - the\n            impacts of the actions supported can often not be adequately\n            perceived within the short timeframe of the loan, making\n            monitoring and evaluation of outcomes difficult.\n            Back-loading of reforms in a DPL programmatic series can\n            increase the risk of later loans in the series being\n            canceled without full realization of the objectives of the\n            series. In future, when attempting to support reforms in\n            state-owned banks like National Bank for Economic and Social\n            Development (of Brazil) (BNDES) that finance both public and\n            private-sector investments, it will be important to take a\n            one World Bank Group approach. The level of government\n            targeted by DPL reforms should be consistent with the\n            outcomes intended and the client country's\n            institutional
