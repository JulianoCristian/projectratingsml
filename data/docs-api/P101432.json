Some lessons learned\n            includes: OSE's senior management commitment to enhance\n            utility performance and the Bank's long term\n            relationship with OSE promoted innovation and institutional\n            reform. The Adaptable Program Loan (APL) instrument and an\n            experienced implementation unit played a key role in the\n            project's full disbursement and on-time completion. The\n            Bank's global knowledge and convening power played a\n            key role in transforming OSE into an outward looking\n            utility. Prior to the project, OSE had a reputation for\n            being an inward looking utility. Focusing on best practices\n            is oftentimes more important than focusing on numeric\n            results. Human capacity development is a key to sustainably\n            reducing Non-Revenue Water (NRW). OSE found that human\n            capacity development was perhaps the most essential tool for\n            reducing water losses and that companywide day-to-day\n            operations have the greatest impact on NRW reduction."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay - Second Phase (APL-2) of the OSE\n            Modernization and Systems Rehabilitation

The\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)\n            worked with Uruguay to modernize its water utility company,\n            Obras Sanitarias del Estado (OSE), helping in its\n            transformation from an inefficient monopoly into a more\n            accountable public utility providing better quality water to\n            more Uruguayans than ever before. With the help of IBRD,\n            Uruguay\u2019s OSE had slowly evolved from a highly inefficient\n            water utility into a solid one over the course of the last\n            two decades. As a result of IBRD involvement, Uruguay has\n            created a more transparent and accountable water sector.\n            OSE, which formerly acted as de facto policymaker and\n            regulator in addition to service provider in the water\n            sector, has become a part of a wider system that includes an\n            autonomous water and electricity regulator, and a separate\n            policy-making agency, created in 2006."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Modernizing public water services in Uruguay"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Modernizing public water services\n            in Uruguay"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2010/10/25490147/modernizing-public-water-services-uruguay","count":"Uruguay","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Energy and mining,Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Information and communications","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"sanitation, water quality, sanitation\n            tariffs, water services, treatment plant, public utilities,\n            infrastructure services, operational performance, public\n            utility, performance comparisons, access to water,\n            utilities, benchmarking, connections, water sector, water\n            utility, systems, operational improvements, water meters,\n            water supply, water production, sanitation sector,\n            transmission system, quality water, regulation, regulatory\n            reform, water supply rehabilitation, sewage treatment,\n            pumping, electricity regulator, sanitation services,\n            network, sanitation utility, meters, performance, water\n            treatment, distribution network, internal benchmarking,\n            water, public service providers, water service, sanitation\n            coverage, basic water supply, service provider, public\n            water, service provision, accountable water, customer\n            service, investment costs, utility, quality of service,\n            sewerage, service providers"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Technical Assistance Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Technical Assistance Loan"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Environment and natural resource management,Public sector governance,Rule of law,Financial and private sector development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Modernizar servicios de agua en Uruguay"}},"topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation m1327240 1199,Water Allocation and Water Economics\n            m1326745 427,Water m1326522 137,Energy and Water m1327476 142,Agricultural Water Management m1326881 140,Water Resources Management m1326089 141","projn":"UY-Public Services Modernization Technical\n            Assistance -- P070058,UY-Ose Modernization And Systems\n            Rehabilitation -- P063383,UY-Apl2 Ose Modernization & Systems\n            Rehabilitation Project -- P101432","subtopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Urban Water Supply and Sanitation,Infrastructure Regulation,Water and Industry","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Water Resources,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,Water Supply and Sanitation","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b083529b0a_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"}},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","theme":"Environmental policies and institutions,Administrative and civil service reform,Regulation and competition policy,Legal institutions for a market economy,Other urban development,Pollution management and environmental health,Decentralization","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,Water Supply and Sanitation","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Water Supply and Sanitation m1327240 1199,Water Allocation and Water Economics\n            m1326745 427,Water m1326522 137,Energy and Water m1327476 142,Agricultural Water Management m1326881 140,Water Resources Management m1326089 141","owner":"Water - GP (GWADR)","trustfund":"UN008760-RED/SEA GULF OF ADEN REG GEO\n            STUDY II,TF029194-PHRD-WATER SUPPLY PROJECT,TF096575-IE - Sewarage access in Uruguay,TF027092-PHRD-WATER SECTOR REFORM PROJECT","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"repnb":"95254"},"facets":{}}}
