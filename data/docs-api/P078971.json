Some lessons learned included: given the scope\n            and pace of health sector reform, the two-phased adaptable\n            program lending (APL) was an appropriate approach for\n            ensuring achievement of the project development objectives\n            and long-term sustainability. Strong governmental ownership\n            and close coordination with development partners are\n            critical. Continuity of staff, particularly on the\n            government and project management unit (PMU) sides, is a\n            critical element of project success or failure.

Health\n            Sector Reform (APL) Project for Romania are to: (i) provide\n            more accessible services, of increased quality and with\n            improved health outcomes for those requiring maternity and\n            newborn care and emergency medical care, and (ii) provide\n            support for the preparation of the primary health care\n            strategy. The nine and a half-month extension are required\n            to complete a few ongoing activities, necessary for the full\n            attainment of the overall APL program development objectives\n            (PDOs). In addition, the extension will allow the completion\n            of technical assistance activities needed to support the\n            Ministry of Health\u0092s commitment in fulfilling requirements\n            under the precautionary stand-by agreement with the\n            International Monetary Fund. These activities suffered an\n            implementation delay due to changes in the Government\n            following the general election of December 2012, and this is\n            why an additional extension of the project is being sought.\n            This fifth extension of the Project closing date from March\n            15, 2013 to December 31, 2013 will enable the preparation of\n            the financial impact assessment of the envisaged health\n            sector reforms, under revised terms of reference prepared by\n            the new Government. This assessment is a performance\n            criterion included in the precautionary stand-by agreement\n            with the International Monetary Fund and in the memorandum\n            of understanding agreed with the European Commission.
