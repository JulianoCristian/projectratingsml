Some lessons\n            learned included: the project was highly effective in\n            providing a quick response to Togo's difficult\n            situation after fifteen years of socio-economic decline. The\n            experience showed that rapid impact on poverty in such a\n            situation can be achieved by a CDD approach backed up by an\n            institutional structure that empowers local communities by\n            decentralizing decision taking and strengthens their\n            capacity through sustained support and capacity building.\n            The principal lesson is that effective poverty reduction\n            through community-level initiatives requires well-structured\n            support and implementation mechanisms together with\n            intensive supervision and capacity building. In the\n            particular case of Togo, the resulting recommendation is\n            that the Government and Bank now need to focus on how to\n            institutionalize, strengthen and finance the functions\n            currently carried out by the central (Technical Secretariat)\n            and regional (AGAIB) organizations to provide the continued\n            investment finance, institutional and technical support and\n            capacity building necessary to sustain the CDD momentum in\n            communities already supported and to extend the CDD approach\n            to all poor communities nationwide."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Togo - Community Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Togo - Community Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2014/03/19336149/togo-community-development-project","projn":"TG-Community Dev.
