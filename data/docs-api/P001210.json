Several lessons are drawn\n            from the project. First, the existing current demand for\n            financial services, both in urban, and rural areas needs to\n            be met, but, the Government should provide an enabling\n            environment, and design a strategy based on decentralized\n            financial institutions, to effectively reduce poverty.\n            Second, the need for transforming savings into secure loans,\n            and ensuring financial autonomy is an enormous challenge,\n            however, good governance and enforcement of monetary, and\n            economic policies, (within an adequate legal framework), can\n            lay the foundation for a sustainable growth and development.\n            Regrettably, as demonstrated by the implementation of the\n            project, there is a prevailing weak support within the\n            government, contrary to the country's potential to\n            accomplish sustainability, provided it is adequately helped.\n            Third, centralized savings and loans institutions perform\n            inefficiently, generating high operating costs, thus making\n            decisions at the local level difficult to implement, and,\n            the lack of local management systems contributes to a\n            certain extent, to the high increase of overdue loans.\n            Nonetheless, these shortcomings will be professionally taken\n            care of through financial, and institutional audits to be\n            undertaken soon, and, the weak human resource management in\n            most credit union networks, can be mitigated by making\n            social interactions a central element of the development process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote D'Ivoire - Rural Savings\n            Rehabilitation and Promotion
