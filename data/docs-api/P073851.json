performance is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. Findings and implications for subsequent\n            operation(s) in the series are:  1) In view of the many\n            risks the implementation of this program faces, the\n            timeframe of future operations should be established with\n            care, taking into account possible political obstacles as\n            well as capacity constraints in the public service. 2) While\n            the provision of formal and informal technical assistance as\n            part of the preparation of the first operation has been most\n            useful, this may not be possible in future. It would\n            therefore be important to ensure that such assistance can be\n            provided in other ways, either through a technical\n            assistance credit or PHRD grant (Policy and Human Resources\n            Development Fund - Japan) or by other donors. Such\n            assistance is crucial for the success of the program. 3)\n            Future operations might have fewer trigger actions and\n            exclude measures that are expected to be taken as part of\n            other operations, whether by the International Development\n            Association or other donors; 4) There are areas covered by\n            the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, but so far not\n            included in the Poverty Reducation Support Credit for\n            various reasons. Subsequent operations need to take a fresh\n            look at the desirability of including new components in the\n            program, notably actions more focused on poverty\n            alleviation, taking into account planned activities of other donors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana - Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guyana - Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/06/4686397/guyana-poverty-reduction-strategy-credit-project","projn":"GY-Poverty Red.

The project will\n            be the Bank's principal lending instrument to Guyana\n            over the next few years. The Bank is prepared to assist the\n            Government with establishment of the National Protected\n            Areas System (NPAS) by assisting in establishing the legal,\n            regulatory, and technical framework for the system. Of the\n            various PRSC-supported policy reforms, the main ones of\n            environmental significance involve sugar, mining, factory,\n            water and private investment. The PRSC-supported actions of\n            highest environmental sensitivity involve the sugar and\n            mining sectors. These actions, along with those for\n            forestry, are anticipated to be conditions for the PRSC-II\n            (to be processed most likely in 2004). The one of the\n            PRSC-supported activities includes the construction of a new\n            sugar factory along with the expansion of sugar cane\n            cultivation by some 10,000 hectares. The drafting of a new\n            mining law is being considered to facilitate new mining\n            investments while promoting improved environmental\n            management. A new Forests Act is being drafted since the\n            current forestry law was enacted in 1953 and is outdated.\n            The project will also support wholesale restructuring of\n            Guyana's potable water supply system and the\n            establishment of national drinking water quality.
