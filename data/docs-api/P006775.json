It aims at developing viable\n            technical and organizational programs for: (a) slowing the\n            erosion of agricultural land and water catchment areas and\n            siltation of hydropower reservoirs; (b) maintaining aregular\n            water supply for irrigation and domestic use; and (c)\n            controlling runoff to alleviate flooding. To achieve these\n            goals, the project consists of pilot investments in three\n            subwatersheds of the Magdalena River designed to introduce\n            soil conserving cropping patterns, improvement of livestock\n            management, reforestation of marginal or extremely\n            vulnerable areas and construction of minor structures to\n            reduce erosion. The project also includes research and\n            evaluation components to provide the basis for preparing a\n            follow-up project covering the entire Upper Magdalena\n            Watershed.
