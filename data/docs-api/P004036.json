The project provided for: (a) imported goods for\n            specific rehabilitation activities in the transport,\n            agriculture, health, education, power, and water supply\n            sectors; and (b) critical imports required generally for the\n            rehabilitation of the Cambodian economy. The project\n            substantially achieved its objectives. The equipment\n            installed under the project is currently in use and the\n            budget support protected critical expenditures during the\n            recovery period. The performance of the Borrower was\n            commendable. The supervision performance of the Bank was\n            also good. Client satisfaction with the Bank's\n            performance is high. There are three main lessons learned in\n            this project. First, priorities do not necessarily qualify\n            as emergencies. Greater selectivity should have been applied\n            during project appraisal when identifying the types of\n            priorities that could be carried out in the very limited\n            time frame of the ERP. Second, in post-conflict countries\n            where operating conditions are very different from what\n            international contractors are accustomed to, construction\n            activities that rely on foreign expertise should be left out\n            of emergency rehabilitation projects. And third, government\n            commitment to the project and its responsiveness to our\n            requests in the course of project implementation compensated\n            for the borrower's weak institutional capacities. This\n            has had a favorable impact on both the outcome of the\n            project and time elapsed during implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Emergency Rehabilitation
