The lessons learned show that the\n            opportunities to promote and further the reform agenda\n            should be followed upon quickly if they arise during project\n            implementation. The dual track approach followed during\n            project implementation, intensive policy dialog at the\n            national level and implementation strategies designed at the\n            project level, facilitated and furthered achievement of the\n            objectives of the project. The comprehensive studies carried\n            out under the project allowed the Bank's timely\n            response to government queries about policies and actions\n            that would deepen and further the reforms. Government\n            ownership of and commitment to the reform process are more\n            important to the success of reforms than unrealistic and\n            dictated covenants. Appropriate technology transfer can\n            significantly step-up sector performance and availability of\n            resources. Under the project, it led to a 267 billion cubic\n            meter increase in the proven reserves of gas compared with\n            70 billion cubic meters estimated at appraisal, a production\n            capability of 10 billion cubic meters per year versus the\n            appraisal target of 8 billion cubic meters and a\n            transportation capability of 10 billion cubic meters per\n            year as against 8 billion projected at appraisal. The\n            long-term technical collaboration with an experienced\n            organization in the rehabilitation and capacity expansion of\n            gas processing and transportation infrastructure was highly\n            successful as it provided on-site managerial and technical\n            expertise, advice and training to SPA/PCL Southwest staff\n            and simultaneously facilitated decision making and state of\n            the art knowledge transfer. Procurement processing could be\n            streamlined in China to avoid delays in project\n            implementation. A delay of about 2 years was encountered on\n            this account in the implementation of this project. The main\n            constraints to efficient procurement processing were the\n            system of multi-layered approvals and processing through\n            intermediaries i.e., government approved agents."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Sichuan Gas Development and\n            Conservation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Sichuan Gas Development\n            and

  restructuring component, an investment component, and an\n            institution building component. The restructuring component\n            includes implementation of the first phase of restructuring\n            the upstream oil and gas sector, based on the\n            recommendations of an ongoing restructuring study, including\n            commercialization and corporatization of China National\n            Petroleum Corporation/Sichuan Petroleum Administration\n            (CNPC/SPA) through their transformation into joint-stock\n            companies, introduction of a commercial accounting system\n            and implementation of productivity enhancement and related\n            human resources development programs. The investment\n            component includes gas field development in Eastern Sichuan\n            through the drilling of about 100 wells, seismic survey and\n            interpretation, and construction of related surface\n            facilities; gas field stimulation and rehabilitation of\n            about 90 wells in Eastern Sichuan and 100 wells in Central\n            Sichuan; and expansion as well as rehabilitation and\n            environmental upgrade of SPA's gas transmission and\n            distribution system. The institution building component\n            includes technical assistance and training for the\n            implementation of the above two components as well as for\n            national petroleum education to upgrade the teaching and\n            research capabilities of the local petroleum institutes and\n            development of exchange programs between the local and\n            foreign institutes. The project aims to: (a) support the\n            implementation of the upstre and gas sector restructuring;\n            (b) rationalize both the levels and stru gas pricing; (c)\n            promote rational gas allocation; (d) reduce acute gas\n            shortages and environmental degradation in Sichuan through\n            increased g production (and avoidance of coal consumption)\n            and energy conservation improve the efficiency of gas\n            production and optimize ultimate recover reserves through\n            sound reservoir management and state-of-the-art enhan\n            recovery technology; (f) enhance the safety, reliability,\n            operational efficiency and environmental management of the\n            gas transmission and distribution (T&D) system,\n            including the reduction of gas leakage whic in turn, reduce\n            methane emissions and the greenhouse gas effect; and (\n            strengthen the institutional capabilities of China
