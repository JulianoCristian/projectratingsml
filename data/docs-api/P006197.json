Overall framework for\n            prioritizing and targeting is needed; although about 46\n            percent of Bolivia's total land area is either\n            regularized or in process, the perception that\n            regularization has not been effective persists. Andean\n            indigenous communities represent very different issues and\n            require a modified strategy. Maximize local ownership of\n            process and community participation for results; as the\n            project matured, it became increasingly clear that local\n            ownership of the process and community participation\n            facilitated the field work, improved the quality of\n            information and improved the involvement of women in the\n            process. Build in research/policy analysis, piloting and\n            evaluation schemes ahead of full-scale implementation; the\n            project accomplished a great deal of learning through its\n            large-scale contracts (for field work, technology). But the\n            project did relatively little policy analysis and research\n            to compare methodologies, prioritize areas, pilot\n            innovations or evaluate itself. For these reasons\n            institutional learning processes were slow."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - National Land Administration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia - National Land\n            Administration Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/06/6947938/bolivia-national-land-administration-project","projn":"BO-National Land Administration Project -- P006197","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Common Property Resource Development,Municipal Housing and Land,Land Use and Policies,Public Sector Management and Reform,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Public Sector Development,Urban Development,Rural Development","count":"Bolivia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20060725162814"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Law and justice","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Public Sector Development,Urban Development,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, Agrarian Reform,\n            agricultural areas, agriculture, capitals, community\n            participation, deforestation, financial management, forest,\n            forests, income, Institutional Development, Institutional\n            Development Impact, Institutional Reforms, Land\n            Administration, land claims, land distribution, Land\n            Management, land markets, land ownership, land prices, land\n            registration, land resources, land rights, Land Settlement,\n            land tenure, land titles, land use, land use planning, land\n            value, lands, laws, Legal Framework, legislation, market\n            value, Municipalities, Municipality, natural resource,\n            operating costs, points, Poverty Reduction, present value,\n            property registration, property rights, public, public\n            information, public land, public lands, public monitoring,\n            public sector, Public sector management, real property,\n            roads, settlements, site monitoring, sites, Subsidiary,\n            taxation, Technical Assistance, transaction costs, urban areas"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF020400-NETHERLANDS' CONSULTANTS\n            TRUST FUND,TF020460-NORWEGIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF021845-REFORMS IN THE BOLIVIAN PENSION SYSTEM,TF023018-PHRD-LAND ADMINISTRATION,TF030667-JAPAN CTF -

The project will have a major\n            component improving the land administration system within\n            the current framework and a minor component implementing the\n            legal and institutional land administration reforms, if and\n            when they are introduced. The major component will support\n            the formulation of a sound and coherent land policy and\n            legislation, carry out land mapping on three million ha to\n            obtain cadastre information and to regularize the land\n            tenure situation wherever possible, indentify 500,000 ha\n            suitable for small farmer settlement and increase the\n            efficiency and transparency of the land administration\n            system. In addition, the project will also finance: 1) title\n            regularization and land settlement programs by the National\n            Land Institute, when established; and 2) the introduction

land administration system, clarify the land\n            tenure situation, identify public land suitable for small\n            farmer settlements and promote a more sustainable use of the\n            country's land resources. The project will have a major\n            component improving the land administration system within\n            the current framework and a minor component implementing the\n            legal and institutional land administration reforms, if and\n            when they are introduced. The major component will support\n            the formulation of a sound and coherent land policy and\n            legislation, carry out land mapping on three million ha to\n            obtain cadastre information and to regularize the land\n            tenure situation wherever possible, indentify 500,000 ha\n            suitable for small farmer settlement and increase the\n            efficiency and transparency of the land administration\n            system. In addition, the project will also finance: 1) title\n            regularization and land settlement programs by the National\n            Land Institute, when established; and 2) the introduction of\n            an integrated legal cadastral registry system when the Legal\n            Cadastral Registry is established."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - National Land Administration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia - National Land\n            Administration Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/05/732828/bolivia-national-land-administration-project","projn":"BO-National Land Administration Project -- P006197,BO-National Land Administration\n            (Supplemental) -- P074819","subtopic":"Rural Land Policies for Poverty Reduction,Urban Housing,Environmental Economics & Policies,Land Use and Policies,Banks & Banking Reform","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Bolivia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961008013434"},"subsc":"Law and justice,Central government administration,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,Agrarian Reform,agricultural\n            areas,agricultural land,agriculture,arable\n            land,auditing,auditors,civil service,Climatic\n            conditions,communities,employment,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,farms,FISCAL YEAR,forestry,health\n            services,indigenous peoples,institutional development,land\n            acquisition,Land Administration,land claims,land\n            distribution,land management,land market,land markets,land\n            ownership,land parcels,land records,land resources,land\n            rights,land settlement,land speculation,land tenure,land\n            title,land titles,land titling,land use,land use\n            regulations,land values,laws,legal\n            framework,legislation,logging,migration,Municipal\n            Development,Municipalities,natural resources,operating\n            costs,Present Value,private land,property rights,public\n            land,public lands,rural areas,Rural\n            Development,sharecropping,site selection,social\n            services,soils,Structural Adjustment,Sustainable\n            Development,sustainable use,tax collection,technical\n            assistance,Water Supply,writeoffs"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,Agrarian Reform,agricultural\n            areas,agricultural land,agriculture,arable\n            land,auditing,auditors,civil service,Climatic\n            conditions,communities,employment,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,farms,FISCAL YEAR,forestry,health\n            services,indigenous peoples,institutional development,land\n            acquisition,Land Administration,land claims,land\n            distribution,land management,land market,land markets,land\n            ownership,land parcels,land records,land resources,land\n            rights,land settlement,land speculation,land tenure,land\n            title,land titles,land titling,land use,land use\n            regulations,land values,laws,legal\n            framework,legislation,logging,migration,Municipal\n            Development,Municipalities,natural resources,operating\n            costs,Present Value,private land,property rights,public\n            land,public lands,rural areas,Rural\n            Development,sharecropping,site selection,social\n            services,soils,Structural Adjustment,Sustainable\n            Development,sustainable use,tax collection,technical\n            assistance,Water Supply,writeoffs"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF021845-REFORMS IN THE BOLIVIAN PENSION SYSTEM,TF020460-NORWEGIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF035990-BOLIVIA - LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT,TF034295-BOLIVIA - RURAL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT,TF031509-BOLIVIA - AGRICULTURE,TF031506-BOLIVIA - AGRICULTURE,TF020400-NETHERLANDS' CONSULTANTS\n            TRUST FUND,TF023018-PHRD-LAND ADMINISTRATION","repnb":"P6433"},"facets":{}}}
