Some lessons learned\n            included: when community participation is to be relied upon\n            it is very important that enthusiasm, once created, is\n            maintained. If, through delays in payment or other problems,\n            initial enthusiasm is lost, it is very difficult to\n            resuscitate. Therefore, it is important to launch a\n            community construction project only when all systems are\n            fully in place so there will be no delays. Even without\n            delays, it is uncertain that community construction\n            activities will not be interrupted. Consequently, in\n            countries with significant inflation rates, some automatic\n            allowance for inflation should be built into construction\n            projects. The land tenure situation on some of the new sites\n            on which construction was to take place should have been\n            clarified before the agreements were signed with the local\n            communities. The final six-month extension of the project\n            was largely due to problems on sites where there were\n            conflicts between the schools and the landlords. Finally, it\n            should be emphasized that the efficiency in the development\n            and appraisal of this project demonstrates the advantages of\n            a strong field presence in the processing and implementing\n            of projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Community Secondary Schools\n            Construction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana -
