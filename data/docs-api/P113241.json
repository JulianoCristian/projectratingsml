The PRSF series has\n            provided important support to the Government to\n            operationalize its ambitious medium-term development\n            strategy i.e., the economic development and poverty\n            reduction strategy (EDPRS) by translating its objectives\n            into priority actions. The PRSF series provided substantial\n            financing to Rwanda's budget, including during the 2008\n            crisis. It was successful in fostering better donor\n            coordination, improved harmonization and reinforced support\n            for reforms among the country's budget support donors:\n            the World Bank, African Development Bank, and bilateral\n            donors -all partners in the Budget Support Harmonization\n            Group and part of the semi-annual joint budget support\n            reviews (JBSR). PRSF series focused on capacity building,\n            including sub-national levels of government in planning. The\n            success of the PRSF series was also largely helped by its\n            ability to base its design on strong sector dialogue. This\n            has helped to: (i) ensure the PRSF reflects substantive\n            policy agreements reached at the sector level; (ii)\n            strengthen the capacity of sector ministries to present\n            their needs and priorities during national level policy\n            discussions and budget negotiations; and (iii) facilitate\n            coordination of the Bank's inputs into the common\n            performance assessment framework (CPAF) policy discussions\n            in a timely manner. Considering the preparation and\n            implementation of the series coincided with the CPAF\n            establishment in 2008, this period can be regarded as a\n            transition or learning period for all parties involved in\n            budget support in Rwanda. Also, growing mutual understanding\n            of what each partner would need to get out of the process\n            helped it to become smoother over time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic of Rwanda -

       Grant Program (PRSG-6) continues to support the Government\n            of Rwanda as it implements measures to foster broad based\n            growth in the context of enhanced decentralization reforms.\n            PRSG-6 is the third operation in the second series of PRSGs\n            (beginning with PRSG-4). It forms an integral part of the\n            Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), approved by\n            the Board of Executive Directors on September 26, 2008 in\n            support of the Government's Economic Development and\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS). The EDPRS covers the\n            period 2008-2012 and takes stock of a decade of achievements\n            in rehabilitation and reconstruction. It presents a strategy\n            focused on accelerating growth and human development, with\n            an emphasis on decentralization, and a greater role for the\n            private sector. The EDPRS priorities are articulated through\n            three flagship programs aimed at promoting sustainable\n            growth and poverty reduction and improving governance. The\n            main risks to the program are: (i) continued instability in\n            the great lakes sub-region and the effects on economic\n            stability and donor support; (ii) government capacity to\n            implement the EDPRS; and (iii) continued global economic\n            slowdown. The downside risk to Rwanda's economic growth\n            should the global slowdown persist will arise from a likely\n            increase in the external account deficit from a reduction in\n            export earnings. The Bank is monitoring the situation and\n            providing additional finance of $29.8 million through the\n            crisis response window. Government will continue its policy\n            of identifying areas for contingent spending as more\n            external resources become available. Government will\n            continue to protect priority spending from reductions in\n            overall spending, expand the tax base and improve the\n            efficiency of the tax system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Sixth Poverty Reduction Support\n            Grant Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda - Sixth Poverty Reduction\n            Support Grant
