Agricultural Development Support Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Agricultural Development Support\n            Project for Zambia has a satisfactory outcome rating. The\n            rick to development is low or negligible; the Bank's\n            performance is satisfactory; and the borrower's\n            performance is satisfactory. This project supports increased\n            commercialization of smallholder agriculture through\n            improved productivity, quality and efficiency of value\n            chains where smallholders participate. The project\n            development objective was not changed during implementation.\n            With respect to the key performance indicators, the mid-term\n            review noted that the National Coordination Office (NCO)\n            faced issues in regularly updating the indicators due to\n            unclear data collection methodology and analysis between the\n            NCO and the project implementing agencies (IAs). The\n            indicators were therefore revised to better link to the\n            components and logically reflect the impact of ongoing\n            activities specifically supported by the project. The\n            revised key performance indicators were: i) agricultural\n            exports for target value chains (tons/year); ii) targeted\n            commodities produced by smallholder householders\n            (tons/year); iii) smallholder households growing targeted\n            crops (number); iv) average income per household in targeted\n            areas; and v) direct project beneficiaries (number), of\n            which females (percent). Improved value chain productivity,\n            quality and efficiency were assessed using above key\n            performance indicators in terms of increases in volumes and\n            numbers. There are six major lessons learned from the\n            project. First, innovations in project design, which the\n            project had in the Market Improvement and Innovation\n            Facility and Rural Roads Improvement Facility components,\n            should address capacity limitations upfront in order to\n            assure implementation success. In general, projects of this\n            type need to take into account country capacity in project.\n            Second, the OPRC-type contract, where road rehabilitation\n            design includes sufficient resources and practical\n            arrangements for post-rehabilitation maintenance for several\n            years, combined in one contract proved successful. Third,\n            the link between producers and markets is critical in a\n            project that seeks to increase commercialization in\n            agriculture. Fourth, strengthening government core functions\n            can build private sector trust in government. Fifth, good\n            continuous monitoring; periodic and regular evaluation; and\n            quality impact assessments played an important role in\n            learning from the project throughout implementation, and\n            once it was completed. Sixth, flexibility and being\n            opportunistic in implementation was key to the success of\n            this project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - Agricultural Development Support
