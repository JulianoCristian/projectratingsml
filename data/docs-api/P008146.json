Key lessons\n            learned from this project include: 1) Early commitments of\n            financing sources and advance procurement are key factors\n            for expediting project implementation. In this case, early\n            negotiation and approval of co-financing required for the\n            Tablada thermal power plant, and awarding of the\n            corresponding construction contract before loan approval\n            permitted UTE (National Power and Transmission Company) to\n            install quickly a thermal power plant compensating for low\n            hydroelectric generation in years of dry hydrology. 2) A\n            twinning arrangement with a foreign utility is an effective\n            method to reorganize and modernize the management and\n            operational practices, and associated training and\n            computerized tools of a local power utility. 3) In a\n            relatively small country, a power utility owned technical\n            training center equipped with appropriate laboratories and\n            meeting facilities is an effective tool to improve the\n            skills of personnel in charge of doing maintenance and\n            operation of power distribution systems. 4) Cumbersome\n            processes at company and government levels for procurement\n            of equipment and services are major obstacles introducing\n            exorbitant delays in project implementation. 5) A project\n            executing unit, inserted with the existing organization of\n            the borrower, with its own competent staff, and supported\n            with services from the rest of the organization, is an\n            effective way to carry out a project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay -
