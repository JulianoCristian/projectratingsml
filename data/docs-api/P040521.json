The performances of both\n            the Bank and the Borrower were satisfactory.

Here\n            also the performances of both the Bank and the Borrower were\n            satisfactory. Six lessons were suggested by these two\n            projects: 1) Translate the project's poverty objectives\n            into clearly defined outcomes and outputs in the Project\n            Appraisal Document that can be monitored and evaluated. 2)\n            Project management has to intervene at the community to\n            support poverty and gender issues and challenge the status.\n            3) Develop an infrastructure maintenance strategy that\n            addresses the total community infrastructure. 4) Reduce the\n            costs -including time spent in meetings -- of beneficiary\n            participation as the number of program's increases. 5)\n            Heed past lessons in rural finance: Effective and\n            sustainable rural finance calls for an institutional\n            capacity to evaluate debt capacity, a sustainable\n            institutional home, low costs, and strong incentives for the\n            borrower(s) to remain in good standing. In the Kecamatan\n            project it was a mistake to force an economic loans\n            component into a grants program outside a carefully prepared\n            rural finance intervention. 6) Define at the outset some\n            kind of baseline (and related milestones) regarding the\n            level of corruption, so as to measure progress."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -

Lessons learned from the First Village\n            Infrastructure Project (report no. 19099)(ICR) remain valid.\n            This project aimed at institutionalizing the VIP procedures,\n            and some lessons worth noting include: Programmatic and\n            flexible approaches and a franchise approach used to\n            replicate small-scale assistance, when shown to be feasible,\n            need to be evolved for a longer-term program. That is,\n            self-targeting instead of village targeting is preferable so\n            that assistance offered gets directed where demand is\n            demonstrated, and will benefit poorer segments within\n            villages.

The main objective is to build small\n            infrastructures in poor rural villages on Java and Sumatra.\n            This also creates cash employment for villagers. Secondary\n            objectives are to increase decentralization and community\n            participation. The project will provide a grant to each of\n            2,600 of the poorest villagers on Java and Sumatra for\n            building local infrastructures. The villagers will decide\n            what to build, from a menu of choices, and will build it by\n            themselves, the workers being paid by output. Much of the\n            grant may be used to purchase materials. Some equipment will\n            be leased. Field engineers will assist the villagers to plan\n            and implement the works, while also handling financial\n            aspects.
