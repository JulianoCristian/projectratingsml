The lessons learned indicated that\n            it is important to have a reform-oriented government not\n            only during the project preparation, but throughout the\n            entire project cycle as well. The experience in Ukraine has\n            shown that a reversal of the initially progressive course of\n            economic reforms have adversely affected the implementation\n            of the Bank's investment project. During the project\n            preparation the government indicated that improving\n            financial discipline in the energy sector, was a priority of\n            its reform program, and the project generated specific\n            pressure on the government to deliver in this regard. Cash\n            collections reached their highest levels only when included\n            as specific targets in the International Monetary\n            Fund's Extended Fund Facility Program, and the\n            Bank's Programmatic Adjustment Loan.
