Some\n            lessons learned included: assistance to children associated\n            with armed forces (particularly girls) that have children\n            themselves need to be varied and adapted to take into\n            account that their circumstances are similar to those of\n            adults. Therefore for some children's reintegration\n            package are not appropriate and the program needs to be\n            flexible and pragmatic to maximize their social and economic\n            reintegration. EDRP experience showed enhanced success rates\n            for both social and economic reintegration that targeted\n            support to economic associations which comprised of\n            ex-combatants and members of the community.

This was particularly so\n            in a country where there was continuing conflict and the\n            Government had a policy of army integration to absorb other\n            armed groups which

consolidate\n            peace and promote economic stability and sustainable\n            development in the DRC and the region through demobilization\n            of up to an estimated 150,000 ex-combatants and provision of\n            reintegration support during their transition to civilian\n            life; and (ii) to promote the reallocation of Government\n            expenditure from military to social and economic sectors.\n            The DRC was caught in a vicious cycle of poor governance,\n            poverty, and violent conflict throughout the 1990s. Since\n            2000, considerable progress has been made to restore peace\n            and security, but the situation remains very volatile in\n            North and South kivu. The 2006 democratic elections of the\n            President, Parliament, and provincial authorities now\n            present a unique window of opportunity for the World Bank to\n            support the DRC in consolidating and expanding peace and\n            development gains while attenuating the risk of renewed\n            conflict. In order to address the urgency of the maintaining\n            peace in the country's eastern regions, the Government\n            has asked the association to provide for the possibility of\n            retroactive financing that corresponds to its counterpart\n            requirement under the African Development Bank parallel\n            project. The proceeds of the additional financing will be\n            used to support the following activities which were included\n            as part of the original Project: (a) demobilization of\n            combatants; (b) reinsertion support to newly demobilized ex\n            combatants; (c) reintegration support for demobilized\n            ex-combatants; (d) release of children from armed forces;\n            and (e) specialized support for disabled ex-combatants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo, Democratic Republic of - Emergency\n            Demobilization and Reintegration Project :

objective of the Emergency\n            Demobilization and Reintegration Project is to help\n            consolidate peace and promote economic stability and\n            sustainable development in the Democratic Republic of Congo\n            and in the greater Great Lakes region. The specific\n            objectives of the program will be a) to demobilize up to an\n            estimated 150,000 ex-combatants and to help support their\n            return into civilian life b) to promote the reallocation of\n            Government expenditure from military to social and economic\n            sectors. The project is expected to have a significant\n            impact o n reducing poverty in the DRC by: establishing more\n            secure conditions in the rural areas that will encourage the\n            general population and internally displaced persons to\n            resume productive lives in the rural economy; freeing up\n            additional national resources for investment in social and\n            economic sectors; and investing in the human capital of\n            ex-combatants. The project consists of the following\n            activities: (i) Sensitization; (ii) Orientation/\n            demobilization; (iii) Transition; (iv) Reinsertion; (v)\n            Special groups; and (vi) Institutional development and\n            Program implementation support. The following demobilization\n            activities are envisaged: (i) the establishment of\n            orientation centers; (ii) verification of ex-combatant\n            status; (iii) provision of identity cards; (iv) collection\n            of socio-economic data; (v) pre-demobilization orientation\n            about civilian life and program benefits; and (vi) medical\n            screening (including HIV/AIDS counseling and voluntary\n            testing). Demobilization activities will be guided by the\n            Joint Operations Plan, which coordinates the military\n            restructuring with the demobilization process. As a part of\n            reinsertion assistance, all ex-combatants would receive a\n            Basic Needs Kit (BNK). The BNK would provide the following\n            assistance to facilitate the initial transition to civilian\n            life of ex-combatants: (i) transport and food allowance,\n            most probably in the form of a $30 cash grant; (ii) basic\n            household items kit. A transitional subsistence allowance\n            will be provided in cash in installments.  Reintegration\n            assistance will be provided to help ex-combatants\n            re-introduce themselves into their communities and establish\n            sustainable livelihoods. The following activities would form\n            the core of the assistance provided to ex-combatants during\n            this phase: provision of information, counseling and\n            referral services; vocational training, formal and informal\n            apprenticeship schemes, and educational opportunities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo, Democratic Republic of -
