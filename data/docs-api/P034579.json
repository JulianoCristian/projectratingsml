The lessons learned indicate that the\n            greatest successes of Land Reform Implementation Support\n            (LARIS) came about through a well designed and delivered\n            training program, much of it abroad, that gave highly\n            qualified experts insights into the practices in modern\n            systems, procedures and technologies used in successful\n            economies. The institutional structures for the registration\n            of property rights are more complicated now than they were\n            when the Project started and transactions are, as a result,\n            more difficult and expensive. In the first three years\n            following Board approval, there were many problems relating\n            to fundamental issues of institutional responsibility, law,\n            land policy, government counterpart funding, slow\n            procurement and sub-loan agreements with Subjects of the\n            Federation. Requirements for participation of regions in\n            projects need to be spelled out and agreed prior to Board\n            presentation. Practical solutions need to be found to the\n            procurement of complex information systems for Bank\n            projects. When working at a headquarters and planning it is\n            necessary to make some assumptions, but when actually\n            purchasing it is necessary to make visits, assess the\n            situation and wish-list of the local offices and then make\n            judgments accordingly. The impact of an efficient and\n            equitable cadastre system for land taxes has a huge and\n            fundamental benefit. Having multiple agencies responsible\n            for various aspects of transactions in land and real estate\n            is inefficient and creates problems, expense and time delays\n            for market participants, thus discouraging economic development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation - Russia Land Reform\n            Implementation Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Russian Federation - Russia Land\n            Reform Implementation Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/04/4268019/russian-federation-russia-land-reform-implementation-support-project","projn":"RU-Land Reform Implementation Support\n            Project (Laris) -- P034579","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Rural Land Policies for Poverty Reduction,Environmental Economics & Policies,Land Use and Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Russian Federation","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040615142833"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"actual costs,agricultural areas,agricultural\n            land,Bank Performance,Bank procedures,benefit analysis,cost\n            savings,Decentralization,economic activity,Economic\n            Development,economic growth,equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,Financial management,FISCAL YEAR,improved\n            land,income,incremental costs,Institutional\n            Development,integration,land administration,Land\n            management,land markets,land parcels,land records,Land\n            Reform,land registration,Land Resources,land rights,land\n            taxes,land use,land valuation,local government,market\n            prices,present value,private ownership,private\n            sector,privatization,productivity,property rights,real\n            estate,regulatory framework,sites,structural\n            adjustment,taxation,technical assistance,urban land"},"1":{"cdata!":"actual costs,agricultural areas,agricultural\n            land,Bank Performance,Bank procedures,benefit analysis,cost\n            savings,Decentralization,economic activity,Economic\n            Development,economic growth,equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,Financial management,FISCAL YEAR,improved\n            land,income,incremental costs,Institutional\n            Development,integration,land administration,Land\n            management,land markets,land parcels,land records,Land\n            Reform,land registration,Land Resources,land rights,land\n            taxes,land use,land valuation,local government,market\n            prices,present value,private ownership,private\n            sector,privatization,productivity,property rights,real\n            estate,regulatory framework,sites,structural\n            adjustment,taxation,technical assistance,urban land"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"4":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF023073-PHRD-AGRICULTURAL REFORM IMPLE.
