The RWS\n            program consisted of four successive projects (Rural Water\n            Supply Project, National Rural Supply Project, National\n            Water Supply and Sanitation Project, and Forth Rural Water\n            and Sanitation Project) that lasted over the last 17 years.\n            The total World Bank investment in these four projects was\n            US$628 million. The program succeeded at serving about 25\n            million people in 18 provinces and developed a very\n            effective cost recovery policy where the users finance up to\n            75 percent of the capital investment as well as the full\n            operation and maintenance (O&M) cost. With the World\n            Bank assistance, the RWS programs were designed to increase\n            rural access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation.\n            The first project was not specifically targeted at the poor\n            or based completely in rural areas, but both these policies\n            changed in succeeding projects. Within the selected\n            counties, denser areas were chosen to make the cost of\n            supplying piped water economically viable, and within the\n            selected villages, the network aimed to cover all economic\n            sections of the community. For the more remote and less\n            densely populated areas of the project provinces, the\n            approach was to provide hand pumps, rainwater collection\n            systems and small tube wells."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Willingness to charge and willingness to pay\n            : China Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Willingness to charge and\n            willingness to pay : China Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/03/9976970/willingness-charge-willingness-pay-china-rural-water-supply-sanitation-program","projn":"CN-Fourth Rural Water Supply Project -- P057352,CN-Rural Water S.

IDA performance is rated satisfactory and Borrower\n            performance is rated as highly satisfactory. Five key\n            lessons from this project have been taken into consideration\n            by follow-on projects. First, long-term loans to poor\n            villages can complement village resources to sustainably and\n            significantly improve water supply. The project demonstrates\n            that government capital subsidies can be substantially lower\n            than typically argued for when discussing improved rural\n            water for the poor. Second, demand for improved latrines is\n            correlated with higher income levels, and, in contrast to\n            improved water supply, the income levels of the rural poor\n            in this project were too low to support the latrine\n            improvement strategy. Third, investing in model villages is\n            not a successful strategy for yielding demonstration effects\n            when the external government financing needed to construct\n            the model is unavailable to other villages seeking to\n            replicate the model. Fourth, training of water plant\n            managers, operators, and accountants is critical to the\n            sustainability of the water plant subprojects and Credit\n            proceeds should be made available to ensure that adequate\n            training occurs. Fifth, in order to increase the acceptance\n            of health messages and encourage behavior modification,\n            inhibitors to improving practice must be identified and the\n            health education program refined accordingly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Rural Water Supply and\n
