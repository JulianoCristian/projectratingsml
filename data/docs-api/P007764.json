scheme, which will include about 37 wells, a pumping\n            station, about 25 km of transmission main, and water\n            storage; (ii) preparation of a detailed water demand study\n            for Managua; (iii) development of a distribution system\n            master plan for Managua and identification of a first stage\n            distribution improvement program necessary to adequately\n            distribute the water from the Tisma scheme; (iv) preparation\n            of plans, technical specifications and contract documents\n            for the construction of the
