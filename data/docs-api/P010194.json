The project achieved\n            its main objectives, its impact has been significant,\n            sustainability is likely, and the Bank's performance\n            was satisfactory while the Borrower's was mixed.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First, it\n            is important to utilize consultants for technical\n            assistance, especially in potentially complicated areas such\n            as field operations and seismic analysis. Second, it is\n            important to establish a realistic implementation schedule.\n            It will help to eliminate the unnecessary expenditure of\n            administrative time to negotiate and approve loan\n            extensions. Third, there is a need for better quality\n            control both in acquisition and processing. It will also\n            require staff training in overall petroleum work. Lastly,\n            since not all the promoted concessions have been taken for\n            exploration, it is recommended that OGDC approach the Bank\n            for follow up projects of this nature that include\n            acquisition of seismic data, promotion of concessions, and\n            training programs for OGDC professionals in new technology\n            for data acquisition processing and interpretation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -
