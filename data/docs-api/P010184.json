The project achieved\n            some of its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development has been significant, sustainability is likely\n            with donor financial support, and the Bank performed\n            satisfactorily while the Borrower did not. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, sustained political\n            support is crucial for a population operation to be\n            successful in a difficult socio-cultural environment that\n            currently exists in Pakistan. Second, projects should be\n            firmly grounded in recent sector work completed before\n            project preparation work. These analyses help identify the\n            issues and problems the sector will face and also enhance\n            the quality of dialogue between the borrower and lender.\n            Third, a PAC or Project Administration Cell should be\n            established to ensure project implementation. Lastly, the\n            IDA (International Development Association) staff should be\n            continuously knowledgeable about projects on supervision\n            missions and provide more intense supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Population Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Population Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1990/12/737847/pakistan-population-project","projn":"PK-Population -- P010184","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Research,ICT Policy and Strategies,Business Environment,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Education","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960925153823"},"subsc":"(Historic)Targeted health","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,achievement,Achievements,audit\n            reports,audits,birth\n            rate,budgeting,climate,clinics,collaboration,commodities,community\n            development,community involvement,cost\n            recovery,curricula,death rate,depreciation,Education\n            Courses,educational programs,Enrollment,expenditures,Family\n            Planning,health\n            services,Identity,illiteracy,image,isolation,let,media,motivation,population\n            growth,printing,Procurement,public health,public\n            sector,Radio,recurrent costs,schools,staff\n            development,Teacher,teachers,technical assistance,technical\n            constraints,technicians,Television,training\n            activities,Training Institutes,training programs,United\n            Nations,United States Agency for International Development,USAID,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,achievement,Achievements,audit\n            reports,audits,birth\n            rate,budgeting,climate,clinics,collaboration,commodities,community\n            development,community involvement,cost\n            recovery,curricula,death rate,depreciation,Education\n            Courses,educational programs,Enrollment,expenditures,Family\n            Planning,health\n            services,Identity,illiteracy,image,isolation,let,media,motivation,population\n            growth,printing,Procurement,public health,public\n            sector,Radio,recurrent costs,schools,staff\n            development,Teacher,teachers,technical assistance,technical\n            constraints,technicians,Television,training\n            activities,Training Institutes,training programs,United\n            Nations,United States Agency for International Development,USAID,workers"}},"owner":"SAS","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"9262"},"722958":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1983/04/722958/pakistan-population-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1983/04/722958/pakistan-population-project","new_url":"1983/04/722958/pakistan-population-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/03/21/000178830_98101902414492/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/03/21/000178830_98101902414492/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"1350","datestored":"2001-05-01T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1983-04-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Population Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objectives of the proposed project\n            are to assist the Government in implementing its new\n            Population Welfare Plan and in establishing a sound basis\n            for a sustained and effective population planning effort\n            over the longer term.
