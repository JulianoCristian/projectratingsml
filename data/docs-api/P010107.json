The only\n            significant delay experienced and the aspect of the project\n            where improvement could have been made was in identifying\n            and carrying out other studies/investigations in support of\n            the Accelerated Mahwell Program (AMP). However, the fact\n            that such assistance was not requested is evidence that this\n            project component was not particularly needed.
