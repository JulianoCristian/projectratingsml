The lessons learned indicate that significant\n            time is required to develop a model. Building blocks of\n            local processes and clear rules for decision making had been\n            instituted in the first Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL)\n            but required continuing development. Continuing leadership\n            from a recognized change agent remains important even as\n            local units and communities become more empowered.\n            Approaches need to be flexible and responsive to local\n            differences. Monitoring and evaluation systems need plenty\n            of time to develop and to demonstrate their usefulness at\n            the local and central levels. Standard economic and social\n            indicators may not be significantly sensitive to changes at\n            the community level; alternative measures may need to be\n            developed. Creating a climate of accountability among public\n            and private entities is a long-term venture. Specialized\n            expertise is needed for specific types of subproject\n            support. Loan financing of subprojects is an important tool\n            for financial sustainability. Even the most disadvantaged\n            communities have untapped stores of local vision and\n            leadership that can be mobilized through flexible and\n            responsive approaches."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Second Magdalena Medio Regional\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Second Magdalena Medio\n

responsive local\n            institutions, and able to enjoy tangible socioeconomic\n            benefits. Project components will: 1) support the\n            Corporation for Development and Peace Magdalena Medio's\n            program leadership role, by covering its core costs, and\n            incremental costs of offices, consultant services, and\n            related training, equipment, and operating costs. The\n            program will increase the role of community organizations,\n            will take into account the regional diversity, particularly\n            the armed conflict, and, will gradually decrease dependence\n            on the Corporation, who will transfer capacity, and\n            decision-making to regional organizations; 2) strengthen\n            local, and regional institutions, to improve accountability,\n            with particular attention to municipalities, by developing\n            information databases, and developing groups capacity to\n            influence policies, plans, and programs within the municipal\n            administration, with particular attention to the health\n            sector; 3) identify productive subprojects, concerning\n            improvements in small peasant farming practices, development\n            of agro-industrial projects, and small businesses, aiming at\n            employment, an income generation, supported by technical\n            assistance, and training; and, 4) finance social subprojects\n            in vulnerable communities, addressing food security, primary\n            health care, and
