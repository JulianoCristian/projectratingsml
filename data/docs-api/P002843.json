(b) related\n            infrastructure comprising: a railway line of about 80 km to\n            connect the plant with the port of Lome, and railroad\n            equipment; a rail/port terminal within the port of Lome; a\n            power link and sub-station connecting the plant to the\n            existing network; and a township. The project will provide\n            for: (i) management and technical assistance to help CIMAO\n            to achieve full capacity utilization rapidly; (ii) addition\n            quarry equipment to prevent quarry operations from becoming\n            a bottleneck (iii) spare parts and equipment to permit full\n            plant operations and the carrying out of an adequate\n            maintenance program; (iv) financing of fuel and (v)\n            restoration of working capital to a healthy level.

Governments have agreed to set\n            CIMAO's clinker prices according to an agreed price\n            schedule until 1983 and will review prices periodically\n            thereafter to maintain
