Government of Jamaica as part of its overall structural\n            adjustment program supported by the Bank's second SAL.\n            The objective of the Jamaican program is to create an\n            improved administrative environment in the Government to\n            support more effective and efficient performance on the part\n            of Jamaican line ministries, particularly those

The project finances consultants, training and\n            equipment for three major objectives: (i) to equip the\n            Government's human resource management agencies with\n            the capacity to rationalize and manage the Government's\n            compensation strategy and organizational structure, and to\n            assist in the decentralization of key personnel\n            responsibilities to line ministries; (ii) to improve the\n            Government's financial capability by installing a\n            performance budgeting system, strengthening accounting and\n            auditing functions; developing a financial officer corps,\n            providing training in accounting and finance, and\n            strengthening of the Ministry of Finance; and (iii) to\n
