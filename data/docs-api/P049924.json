Rural and Small Towns\n            Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Praguas) in Ecuador\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: 1) The PRAGUAS project\n            validates the viability of the demand-responsive approach to\n            rural water supply to operate at scale at a national level\n            and to deliver significant infrastructure outcomes over a\n            five-year timeframe while involving rural beneficiaries in\n            project selection, planning and operation; 2) The water\n            supply and Sanitation (WSS) sector reform needs to move\n            beyond line ministries and sector agencies to include the\n            Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), since sustainable\n            sector reform requires the development of consistent\n            financial incentives and coherent financial policies; 3) It\n            is important to be realistic and acknowledge the fact that a\n            community-driven project such as PRAGUAS requires more time\n            to get acceptance from the community and start\n            implementation; 4) In unstable country environments, a\n            strong Project Management Unit (PMU) may be essential to\n            project success; 5) The financial scheme of PRAGUAS was\n            proven to be socially acceptable; 6) The on-site sanitation\n            alternative of a basic sanitation unit comprising shower,\n            sink and toilet (UBS) has proven to be an important success;\n            7) The combination of technical assistance and clear,\n            performance-based financial incentives for service\n            delegation were effective in creating autonomous operators\n            in a large number of municipalities; 8) Sustainability can\n            be enhanced by pre-selecting municipalities that have: (i) a\n            technical, social and financial team; (ii) municipal plans\n            that include WSS and watershed protection plans; and (iii) a\n            capable administrative/financial team; 9) Water Boards and\n            communities should be assisted in the formulation of Social\n            Plans that include community planning, tax payment,\n            assessment of natural resources, and management of water\n            sources; and 10) PRAGUAS' Operation Manual for\n            financial and technical operations, administration, social\n            control and auditing, should be disseminated more extensively."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Rural and Small Towns Water Supply\n            and

Bank, started assisting\n            municipalities and local communities to carry out the Rural\n            and Small Town Water Supply and Sanitation Project\n            (PRAGUAS). By 2005, PRAGUAS had improved water supply and\n            sanitation (WSS) services for over 250,000 people. The town\n            component of the project supports municipalities which are\n            willing to make their utilities more autonomous and to raise\n            tariffs to obtain quick service improvements and choose\n            their own management models. PRAGUAS has become the\n            government's primary vehicle for addressing challenges\n            in the water supply and sanitation sector. The objective of\n            PRAGUAS is to increase the coverage and effective use of\n            sustainable WSS services. It focuses on rural areas and\n            small towns where two thirds of the country's poor reside."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Visible service improvements facilitate\n            reforms in town water

first phase of the\n            water and sanitation program in Ecuador, through investments\n            in sustainable water, and sanitation services, focused on\n            alleviating the poorest populations in rural communities,\n            and small towns. Furthermore, improved policies will be\n            developed, particularly through the implementation of sector\n            reforms. The components call for: 1) sector reform, and\n            institutional development, supporting a major restructuring\n            of the Sub-Secretaria de Saneamiento Ambiental (SSA), to\n            enable the agency formulate sector policies, and set general\n            regulatory guidelines. Provision of technical assistance,\n            and training to municipalities, and sector institutions,\n            will enable SSA to define increased water, and sanitation\n            coverage, and, set up a sector information system. Further\n            training programs will be financed, which will allow\n            non-governmental organizations, and private providers assume\n            their roles in the new sector structure; 2) implementation\n            of subprojects in rural areas, financing engineering, and\n            infrastructure works in water and sanitation aspects, and,\n            providing management training to the community, as well as\n            health and hygiene education; and, 3) provision of\n            non-refundable grants, to finance engineering studies, and\n            civil works for water, and sanitation subprojects in\n            municipal capitals."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Rural and Small Towns Water Supply\n            and Sanitation Project
