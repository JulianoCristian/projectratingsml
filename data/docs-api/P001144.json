The project failed to achieve its\n            objectives, institutional development was negligible,\n            sustainability is unlikely, and the performance of the Bank\n            was satisfactory while the Borrower's was\n            unsatisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, support prices for producers during an\n            extended period of low market external prices for a\n            commodity, coupled with an over-valued currency, are\n            non-sustainable, even by the healthiest of economies and can\n            have devastating consequences for agencies responsible for\n            bearing the cost of such support. Second, the sustainability\n            of a government commercial organization is closely linked to\n            a favorable economic framework, appropriate pricing\n            policies, and the availability of strong managerial and\n            financial skills related to the size of its operations.\n            Third, technical assistance personnel in charge of\n            implementing project activities are seldom able to devote\n            time to building local capacity or be advocates of major\n            restructuring of the operation they manage. Finally, if no\n            clear distinction is made between the social and\n            profit-oriented operations through government budgets,\n            supporting social activities from profits can soon become untenable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - Fifth Oil Palm\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cote d'Ivoire - Fifth Oil\n            Palm

and edible oils through both replacement of existing\n            aging oil palm plantings and development of new plantings in\n            selected areas; (ii) further diversify and strengthen the\n            Ivory Coast agricultural sector through investment in a crop\n            with substantial comparative advantages and good long-term\n            growth prospects; (iii) assist in maintenance of a tree\n            cover in an area where the forest cover is being depleted\n            rapidly. The project will consist of the following\n            components: (a) establishment of 11,600 ha of new\n            PALMINDUSTRIE industrial oil palm plantations and replanting\n            of about 15,000 ha of aging plantations; (b) development of\n            smallholder oil palm plantings through expansion and\n            replanting of existing areas by about 29,100 ha and new\n            planting of 6,900 ha; (c) establishment of a pilot scheme of\n            2,100 ha medium-sized private oil palm plantations; (d)\n            construction of two oil mills for PALMINDUSTRIE with\n            eventual capacities each of 40 tons FFB/hour; (e) a study of\n            effluent treatment systems and installation of an effluent\n            treatment prototype system at an existing PALMINDUSTRIE oil\n            mill and an effluent prototype digestor at Ehania; (f)\n            support of accompanying research; (g) technical assistance\n            to PALMINDUSTRIE."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ivory Coast - Fifth Oil Palm Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ivory Coast - Fifth Oil Palm\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1985/09/741813/ivory-coast-fifth-oil-palm-development-project","projn":"CI-Palm Oil V -- P001144","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Agricultural Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"Cote d'Ivoire","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970723103729"},"subsc":"(Historic)Perennial crops","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural activities,Agricultural\n            Development,agricultural growth,agricultural\n            output,agricultural production,agricultural\n            products,Agriculture,agronomy,Annual\n            Crops,Audits,bananas,book value,cash\n            crops,cassava,Cereals,climatic\n            conditions,Cocoa,Coconut,coconut\n            products,coconuts,Coffee,coffee\n            production,commodities,comparative advantage,complete\n            listing,cost analysis,cotton,Crop,crop production,Crop\n            Yield,Debt,Decentralization,development agencies,development\n            policies,Development Projects,disequilibrium,Economic\n            Analysis,Economic Cooperation,economic growth,Economic Rate\n            of Return,employment,exchange rate,Exploitation,export\n            crops,Exports,Extension,extension\n            services,Farm,farmer,farmers,farming,farms,Fertilizer,Fibres\n            Textiles,fixed costs,food\n            crops,forecasts,Forestry,Forests,Fresh\n            Fruit,GDP,GNP,Government Expenditures,gross domestic\n            product,growth potential,growth\n            rate,harvesting,HEveas,Imports,Income,interest rate,interest\n            rates,Land Use,Livestock,"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural activities,Agricultural\n            Development,agricultural growth,agricultural\n            output,agricultural production,agricultural\n            products,Agriculture,agronomy,Annual\n            Crops,Audits,bananas,book value,cash\n            crops,cassava,Cereals,climatic\n            conditions,Cocoa,Coconut,coconut\n            products,coconuts,Coffee,coffee\n            production,commodities,comparative advantage,complete\n            listing,cost analysis,cotton,Crop,crop production,Crop\n            Yield,Debt,Decentralization,development agencies,development\n            policies,Development Projects,disequilibrium,Economic\n            Analysis,Economic Cooperation,economic growth,Economic Rate\n            of Return,employment,exchange rate,Exploitation,export\n            crops,Exports,Extension,extension\n            services,Farm,farmer,farmers,farming,farms,Fertilizer,Fibres\n            Textiles,fixed costs,food\n            crops,forecasts,Forestry,Forests,Fresh\n            Fruit,GDP,GNP,Government Expenditures,gross domestic\n            product,growth potential,growth\n            rate,harvesting,HEveas,Imports,Income,interest rate,interest\n            rates,Land Use,Livestock,"}},"owner":"WB Office: Abidjan (AFMCI)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"5521"},"facets":{}}}
