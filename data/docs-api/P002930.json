These lessons can be\n            drawn: The project design should be adhered to to avoid the\n            confusion that arises when project and non-project\n            activities are planned and implemented differently.\n            Technically unprepared components will lead to\n            implementation difficulties, cost overruns, and delays. For\n            components dependent upon the local communities for\n            operations and maintenance, implementing agencies and the\n            World Bank must ensure that decisions are discussed with and\n            agreed upon by local stakeholders. Conditions set for\n            project effectiveness should be indispensable to the\n            project's implementation so as not to waste time. A\n            review of expected cash flows of would-be veterinarian\n            borrowers and of potential lending by commercial banks would\n            have revealed up front that there was no basis for a credit\n            component catering to private veterinarians. The frequency\n            and skills mix of supervision missions should match project\n            complexity. Quality supervision with components requiring\n            specialized technical skills can only be assured through a\n            team effort, and depends largely upon the task\n            manager's experience. Recurrent expenditures need to be\n            closely monitored. Using activities adopted by farmers as\n            part of their normal practice helps sustain project components."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Livestock Services

main objectives : a) to reverse the\n            decline in livestock numbers by dealing with the alarming\n            animal epidemic disease situation; and b) to bring about\n            improvements in the Ministry of Animal Industry and\n            Fisheries (MAIF) which will lead to a smaller, more cost\n            effective organization able to discharge its\n            responsibilities to the livestock sector in an efficient,\n            and effective manner.  Project components are the following\n            : 1) a national animal disease control program; 2) tsetse\n            fly control program in the Luwero, Mubende, Masindi and\n            Hoima districts (areas not covered by other donors); 3)\n            forage development through seed production and services\n            covering about 7,500 milk producing farms, 12,000 ha of\n            communal and ranch areas and 10,000 km of grass strips to\n            protect terraced cultivation in the southwest; 4) credit and\n            training to assist in the establishment of private\n            veterinary practices; 5) institutional development,\n            including technical assistance to help execute a program to\n            streamline MAIF's organizational structure and reduce\n            its staffing levels; and 6) project management support to\n            MAIF in the areas of financial management and procurement."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Livestock Services
