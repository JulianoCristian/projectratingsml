The project ratings are as follows : project\n            outcome is highly unsatisfactory; sustainability is highly\n            likely; institutional development impact is high; Bank and\n            Borrower performance is highly satisfactory. Lessons were\n            derived from the relevance that projects that replicate\n            successful models in a flexible manner can be highly\n            successful at relatively low risk; b) focus of project\n            design on development objectives facilitates\n            outcome-oriented project implementation; c) project\n            supervision strategy should be clear and transparent and\n            should promote a strong internal project supervision effort\n            by the Borrower; and d) building a strong Bank-Borrower\n            partnership needs consistency in task management and in the\n            composition of the task team."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

This is in line with the\n            objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which\n            support the assistance for better utilization of marginal\n            land through sustainable techniques, and, develop\n            income-generation programs in poorer provinces. The main\n            components call for, cropland improvement, which includes\n            the conversion of slope-lands to terraced lands, where soil\n            erosion is controlled and water retained, thus producing\n            higher crop yields. Control dams will be constructed to\n            retain sediments and flooding, and store water for\n            irrigation and water supply. Irrigation will consist of\n            small water cisterns which will catch run-offs from roads or\n            small water surface diversions, as well as small-scale\n            irrigation schemes, mostly in Inner Mongolia. The second\n            component, slope-land protection, will increase the\n            vegetation cover, improving the erosion control capacity in\n            project watersheds, which will be enhanced by planting and\n            protecting trees, shrubs, and grass. Besides various species\n            of trees to be planted on narrow terraces, fruit and\n            nut-bearing trees will also be planted, thus marketing will\n            be improved through investments in horticulture."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Second Loess Plateau Watershed\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Second Loess Plateau\n
