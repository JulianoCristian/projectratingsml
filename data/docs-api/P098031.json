Second Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Second Multi-Sectoral\n            HIV/AIDS Project for Ethiopia were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was high, the\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the establishment and\n            strengthening of HAPCOs (HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control\n            Office) at the federal, regional and woreda levels was a\n            major undertaking that has proven effective. The time,\n            staffing and other resources allotted for the continued\n            strengthening of the system are important in project\n            implementation. The project supported effective coordination\n            of an impressively wide range of public sector agencies.\n            Particular care is needed to ensure that the levels of\n            capacity are sufficient to manage large influxes of donor\n            funding; in the absence of this, smaller projects are likely\n            to receive insufficient attention. Availability of the\n            country based Task Team Leader (TTL) is critical for ongoing\n            supervision of the project and timely identification of\n            bottlenecks and appropriate solutions. Such a framework\n            needs to reflect the different Monitoring and Evaluation\n            (M&E) requirements and approaches to capacity building\n            of different partners, and to ensure timely integration of\n            different components of the system; in the case of project,\n            delays in establishment of the Community Information System\n            (CIS), and in integrating the Health Management Information\n            System (HMIS) and HIV/AIDS systems, led to lack of timely\n            information to report on program performance. The project\n            design underestimated the level of inputs and time which\n            will be needed to have an effectively functioning and fully\n            integrated system. The Epidemiological Synthesis study,\n            carried out with Bank support in 2008, was an important\n            contribution to national program development and updating,\n            and confirmed the importance of focusing on prevention and\n            targeting the most-atrisk population and hot spot areas, but\n            continued follow up was (and still is) required for a fully\n            effective response. A later survey15 identifying Institutes\n            of higher learning as emerging hot spots? for HIV\n            transmission and identified university students as a\n            previously
