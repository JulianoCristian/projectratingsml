Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Fifth, Sixth, and\n            Seventh Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) Project for\n            Cape Verde were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. One\n            key lesson that can be learned from this PRSC series is the\n            importance of the need for good indicators to evaluate the\n            success of the operation. Indicator data have to be\n            available and attributable to government actions, and\n            indicators should not simply restate prior actions. One\n            particular problem with development policy lending is that\n            institutional reform takes time to show effects. The\n            operation has also shown the need for strong M&E\n            systems. Even if indicators are attributable but data are\n            not available, necessary, evidence-based fine-tuning during\n            the operation as well as a thorough and fair evaluation upon\n            completion of the series is impossible. Investing in country\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) capacity, where\n            requires, is crucial. Another lesson is that donor\n            harmonization can be achieved without surrendering\n            flexibility for individual institutions' development\n            assessments. In Cape Verde, the budget support group had a\n            common donor matrix, bundling clout in policy areas\n            considered key by all development partners (e.g. Public\n            Financial Management, or PFM reform). In other areas, donors\n            maintained flexibility and could focus on their specific\n            areas of expertise (e.g. the Portuguese focusing on housing\n            and the Bank on State-Owned Enterprise, or SOEs). Within the\n            Bank, this approach has found recognition and can be\n            recommended to other country units."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cape Verde - Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh\n

The new series\n            will support policies and institutions aimed at developing a\n            dynamic private sector to be the engine of sustainable\n            growth and poverty reduction. In so doing, it will\n            selectively support the Government's efforts in the\n            five pillars of the GPRSP-II: government reform, human\n            resources, competitiveness, economic infrastructure and\n            social cohesion. The operation will have two main policy\n            areas: (i) good governance; and (ii) competitiveness and\n            growth. Good governance, broadly defined, includes fiscal\n            policy, public financial management (PFM), procurement,\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E), statistics and state\n            modernization. Competitiveness constitutes the main\n            multi-sector anchor for the operation and includes human\n            capital, trade, tourism, financial services, tax, land\n            management and energy issues. The operation builds on the\n            results achieved under PRSC I through IV, which supported\n            policies and reforms in the health and education sectors\n            that achieved sustained improvements in the well-being of\n            the population. This new series marks a shift of Bank\n            support from the health and education sectors towards growth\n            and competitiveness. This shift reflects the new priorities\n            of the Government's growth and poverty reduction\n            strategy as well as the positive results obtained in the\n            health and education sectors after a five-year period of\n            sustained Bank involvement."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cape Verde -
