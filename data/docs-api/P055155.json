Lessons from\n            the project are: 1) Having a diligent and flexible approach\n            to implementation helps address design shortcomings and\n            reorients the project to achieve development objectives. 2)\n            Put in place institutional structures to sustain project\n            activities early during project implementation, and phase in\n            their independence instead of suddenly cutting them off from\n            financial and technical support when the project closes. 3)\n            Clearly identify desired outcomes in pilot activities and\n            include follow-up. 4)When remediating contaminated land,\n            identify and address institutional aspects such as land\n            ownership and land use planning up-front to avoid illegal\n            land occupation. 5) Clarity regarding fiduciary\n            responsibilities, is important when an agency other than the\n            parent Ministry is responsible for implementing one\n            component. 6) Be realistic regarding how quickly it is\n            possible to transform activities and institutions that were\n            historically state-operated to a model based on a\n            commercial, market-based approach. 7) Capacity building\n            needs to address development of professional management\n            capability, not just technical aspects. 8) For technical\n            assistance to be effective, the government and implementing\n            agencies have to regard it as useful for achieving highly\n            desired outcomes.

In regard to the sturgeon\n            hatchery, water pollution during the hatchery operation will\n            be minimized by proper wastewater treatment. Hatchery wastes\n            will be collected in concrete bins and burned regularly. To\n            mitigate the impact of cross-breeding of sturgeon species,\n            tanks will be used to segregate various species of breeding\n            stock and roe will be hand fertilized from know donor\n            species. There will be measures to control dust from the\n            feedmill and worker training to minimize exposure. To clean\n            up the oil field, wastes will be categorized by contaminants\n            and severity for disposal. There will be adequate on-site\n            storage facilities for handling recovered oil. Anti-dusting\n            measures will be used during the oil field cleanup. The\n            major impact of the mercury cleanup is the removal and safe\n            disposal of a large amount of toxic mercury.

This\n            project has 5 components. Component 1 restores the capacity\n            of Azerbaijan to produce sturgeon fingerlings by building a\n            new hatchery; and creates a sustainable institutional and\n            financial basis for future hatchery operations. Component 2\n            demonstrates mercury cleanup technologies and procedures by\n            decontaminating one heavily polluted area. It tests\n            pilot-scale sludge treatment; develops and applies a\n            low-technology method for mercury recovery; transports\n            wastes; constructs a safe, new landfill; designs and\n            implements a monitoring program for mercury emissions; and\n            does a follow-up assessment. Component 3 tests cleanup\n            methodologies on a pilot basis and mitigates existing\n            pollution in one onshore oil field of the Abseron peninsula.\n            It finances a series of pilot projects to determine the most\n            cost-effective method for treating oil-contaminated\n            sediments and sludge; cleans up oil residues; and continues\n            operating the implementation unit in the state's oil\n            company. Component 4 strengthens the environmental\n            management system by reviewing its legislative and\n            regulatory framework and building the capacity of the State\n            Committee of Ecology.
