Some lessons learned include: as a Development\n            Policy Loan (DPL), the CAT DDO entails a combination of\n            financial transfer to the country\u0092s budget to provide\n            liquidity after an emergency, with an equally important\n            component of Disaster Risk Management (DRM) policy advice\n            and dialogue. Therefore, adequate resources and technical\n            assistance to support achievement of project outcomes should\n            be provided accordingly. DPL with CAT DDO operations can be\n            an opportunity to introduce broader concepts of Disaster\n            Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI) for countries developing\n            comprehensive strategies. Matching the CAT DDO with parallel\n            technical assistance can enhance the DRM policy dialogue.\n            The process of designing a CAT DDO can provide a platform to\n            bring other sectors and institutions. DPLs with CAT DDO\n            require coordination with development partners in order to\n            achieve more sustained and broader impacts. Given the\n            multidisciplinary nature of DRM, the implementation of a DPL\n            with CAT DDO requires partnerships with other sectors within\n            the World Bank Group. It is necessary to learn how to manage\n            early disbursements of CAT DDOs. DPLs with CAT DDO have a\n            revolving and renewal features that need to be analyzed by\n            the Bank and explained to governments during project\n            preparation. An operational manual can be helpful to address\n            emergencies and should be considered for future DPLs with\n            CAT DDO. Reporting mechanisms should be more specific in the\n            loan agreements, and agreed up front with the government\n            including the designation of the responsible party."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala - Disaster Risk Management\n            Development Loan with a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option\n            (CAT DDO)

development objective of the\n            Catastrophe Development Policy Loan Deferred Draw Down\n            Option Project for Guatemala is to enhance the\n            Government's capacity to implement its disaster risk\n            management program for natural disasters. This objective\n            will be achieved by supporting policy and institutional\n            reform in the following aspects of disaster risk management:\n            i) improving risk identification and monitoring; ii)\n            increasing disaster risk reduction investments; iii)\n            strengthening institutions and planning capacity for risk\n            management; and iv) developing risk financing strategies.\n            Local community capacity to prepare for, and respond to,\n            disasters caused by adverse natural events should be\n            improved and strengthened. During the last 10 years the\n            response and preparation capabilities in Guatemala have\n            increased. However, Hurricane Stan and the 2008 floods\n            revealed that despite good response capabilities at the\n            municipal level, National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction\n            (CONRED) response skills were still weak at the local level.\n            Rapid and flexible financing is critical for early recovery.\n            On average, 50 percent of the economic losses associated\n            with large natural disasters occur in the post-disaster\n            period. Guatemala and other countries have experienced the\n            critical need for immediately available liquidity in the\n            aftermath of a disaster event to ensure that the Government\n            can reestablish crucial services as fast as possible. If the\n            Government has access to untied liquidity, it will be\n            possible to accelerate recovery, minimize business\n            interruption, and secure the operation o f critical public\n            facilities, such as health services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala - Catastrophe Development Policy\n            Loan Deferred Draw Down Option
