Lessons learned from the project: In linking\n            the development of a business enterprise (container handling\n            and transportation) to a reform in government policy\n            (Customs regime), it was not foreseen that a change of such\n            significance might apply to the trade in general rather than\n            just the project enterprises. The business model of the\n            Inland Container Depot (ICD) enterprise, which relied\n            heavily on the availability of off-port clearance of\n            containers, did not take into account the competition that\n            could come about when alternative sources for obtaining the\n            service became available. The poor performance of the ICD\n            Development component highlights the importance of technical\n            assistance and the need for measures to mitigate risks when\n            a new business is embarked upon by an enterprise with no\n            prior experience."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
