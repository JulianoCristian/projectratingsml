Some lessons learned included:\n            project implementation capacity is a key determinant of\n            success for all Bank-financed projects in the country and\n            region and needs to be carefully assessed during project\n            implementation. The pooled account was expected to provide\n            flexibility to the client. It was also designed to\n            accommodate the partner donor requirements for visibility of\n            their contributions to the project. However, there were\n            challenges in accounting contributions from multiple donors\n            in various currencies and meeting the donor reporting\n            requirements. The pooled account also limited flexibility of\n            donors in adjusting the disbursement patterns to the\n            changing circumstances. In particular, when the project had\n            to be extended, adjustments in disbursement targets and end\n            dates were not easy to implement, (i.e., some donors had to\n            freeze their funding until others expedite disbursements to\n            meet their internal requirements and limitations). In the\n            end, the arrangement did not assure equal treatment of the\n            donors with respect to the funding shares that were to be\n            cancelled. International Development Association (IDA) had\n            to cancel the biggest share of its grant, compared to the\n            shares of funding undisbursed by other donors. It is\n            therefore not obvious that the pooled funding arrangement\n            used under the project was optimal under the circumstances.\n            The unintended effects of the funding arrangement used for\n            this project should be analyzed carefully to avoid similar\n            situations in other projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Public Sector Financial
