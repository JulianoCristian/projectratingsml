restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The development objective of the Better\n            Education through Reformed Management and Universal Teacher\n            Upgrading Project (BERMUTU) for Indonesia is to contribute\n            to the improvement of the overall quality and performance of\n            teachers through enhancing teachers' knowledge of\n            subject matter and pedagogical skills in the classroom. As a\n            follow up to the mid-term review of the project, the\n            proceeds of the said credit, loan and grant were reallocated\n            (dated November 23, 2011) to reflect the actual disbursement\n            as of 2010 and revised disbursement plan 2011-2013. However,\n            the Government of Indonesia changed the official exchange\n            rates used for budgeting purposes from IDR 9,200/USD in\n            FY2011 to IDR 8,800/USD in FY 2012. As a result, the actual\n            expenditures of each category up to December 2011, and the\n            budget allocation in FY 2012 (both in USD currency) are\n            slightly different from the agreed disbursement plan for\n            2011-2013 (used as a basis for the amendment of the proceeds\n            in November 23, 2011). This especially affected the\n            allocation for the working group program (under category 4)\n            increasing by USD 566,898, or about one percent. This amount\n            is to be covered by using the unallocated (category 7) and\n            some efficiency of categories 2, 3 and 5. The reallocation\n            of proceeds is to accommodate such changes in the exchange\n            rates and has been incorporated into the revised\n            disbursement plan for the remaining two years of the project\n            implementation (2012-2013).

As a\n            follow up to the mid-term review of the project, the\n            proceeds of the said credit, loan and grant were reallocated\n            (dated November 23, 2011) to reflect the actual disbursement\n            as of 2010 and revised disbursement plan 2011-2013. However,\n            the Government of Indonesia changed the official exchange\n            rates used for budgeting purposes from IDR 9,200/USD in\n            FY2011 to IDR 8,800/USD in FY 2012. As a result, the actual\n            expenditures of each category up to December 2011, and the\n            budget allocation in FY 2012 (both in USD currency) are\n            slightly different from the agreed disbursement plan for\n            2011-2013 (used as a basis for the amendment of the proceeds\n            in November 23, 2011). This especially affected the\n            allocation for the working group program (under category 4)\n            increasing by USD 566,898, or about one percent.

This substantial increase has a flow-on effect\n            for the budget required for supporting activities such as\n            training of trainers and master teachers, workshops and\n            program management under category three. The reallocation of\n            proceeds reflects these changes in the scope of activities\n            and is detailed in the revised disbursement plan for the\n            remaining three years (2011-2013). This is necessary to\n            properly finance project activities and meeting agreed\n            project development objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Better Education\n            through Reformed Management and Universal Teacher Upgrading\n            Project (BERMUTU) : restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/11/15495974/indonesia-better-education-through-reformed-management-universal-teacher-upgrading-project-bermutu-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"ID-Bermutu-Better Education Through Reformed\n            Management And Univer -- P097104","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Secondary Education,Teaching and Learning,Education For All,Primary Education,Tertiary Education","teratopic":"Education","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20111122234103"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"absenteeism, academic qualifications,\n            classroom, classroom instruction, junior secondary, junior\n            secondary teachers, number of teachers, pedagogical skills,\n            pedagogy, subject matter, teacher, teacher quality, teachers"}},"owner":"Education Sector Unit (EASHE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF090794-BETTER EDUCATION THROUGH\n            REFORMED MANAGEMENT AND UNIVERSAL TEACHER UPGR","repnb":"65706"},"15252931":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/10/15252931/indonesia-bermutu-better-education-through-reformed-management-universal-teacher-upgrading-p097104-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-07","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/10/15252931/indonesia-bermutu-better-education-through-reformed-management-universal-teacher-upgrading-p097104-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-07","new_url":"2011/10/15252931/indonesia-bermutu-better-education-through-reformed-management-universal-teacher-upgrading-p097104-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-07","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2011-10-09T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2011-10-09T00:00:00Z","docm_id":"090224b080fc309b","chronical_docm_id":"090224b080fc309b","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/EAP/2011/10/09/1E69BC7E85216484852579240066C408/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/P0971040ISR0Di009201101318185748367.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/EAP/2011/10/09/1E69BC7E85216484852579240066C408/1_0/Rendered/PDF/P0971040ISR0Di009201101318185748367.pdf","loan_no":"IBRD74760","credit_no":"IDA43490","datestored":"2011-10-09T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2011-10-09T00:00:00Z","volnb":"1","docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - BERMUTU-Better Education through\n            Reformed Management and Universal Teacher Upgrading :\n            P097104 - Implementation Status Results Report : Sequence 07"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - BERMUTU-Better\n            Education through Reformed Management and Universal Teacher\n            Upgrading : P097104 - Implementation Status Results Report :\n            Sequence 07"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/10/15252931/indonesia-bermutu-better-education-through-reformed-management-universal-teacher-upgrading-p097104-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-07","projn":"ID-Bermutu-Better Education Through Reformed\n            Management And Univer -- P097104","docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report","count":"Indonesia","authors":{"authr":"Iskandar,Susiana"},"entityids":{"entityid":"0000A8056_2011100914422931"},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-natl govt admin,Tertiary education","theme":"Education for all","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","majdocty":"Project Documents","owner":"Education Sector Unit (EASHE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF090794-BETTER EDUCATION THROUGH\n            REFORMED MANAGEMENT AND UNIVERSAL TEACHER UPGR","majtheme":"Human development"},"facets":{}}}
