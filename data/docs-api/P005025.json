The following lessons can be learned from the\n            project: (a) To ensure the successful restructuring of a\n            public enterprise, commitment to reform needs to be widely\n            shared to avoid possible policy shifts resulting from the\n            change of top government officials. (b)Attempting to pursue\n            the implementation of a project in the absence of clear\n            government commitment to its objectives is unlikely to be\n            successful. (c)Realistic assessment of risks should be\n            carried out during project preparation and projects dropped\n            if the chance of a successful project is low, even if large\n
