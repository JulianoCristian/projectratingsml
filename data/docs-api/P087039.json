Most\n            of the project development objectives (PDO) indicators and\n            the global environment objectives (GEO) indicators have been\n            achieved either completely, or to a large extent. This paper\n            pertains to the provision of a grant for the aforementioned\n            project. Significant lessons learned during the\n            implementation of the project are: 1) the project design in\n            terms of multi-sectoral approach and phase-wise\n            implementation models worked well and did not show any signs\n            of serious weaknesses; 2) the participatory Sustainable Land\n            Management (SLM) action planning methodology proved to be an\n            excellent approach for community-based planning of SLM,\n            enhancing community commitment and ownership, facilitating\n            inclusion of local knowledge in decision-making and\n            participation of all households including women; 3) the\n            participatory approach created a conducive environment for\n            allowing communities to work together and build social\n            capital, thus contributing to mainstreaming gender, ensuring\n            equity and improvement of livelihoods of the poor; 4) the\n            SLM implementation was hampered by the remoteness of rural\n            communities, and associated difficulties; and 5) the lack of\n            labor availability due to rural-urban migration at the\n            household level is a key constraint in adoption and\n            successful implementation of project interventions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bhutan - Sustainable Land Management

Project\n            for Bhutan will strengthen institutional and community\n            capacity for anticipating and managing land degradation. The\n            project has four components: (1) pilot projects to\n            demonstrate effective application of land degradation\n            prevention approaches in three geogs; (2) mainstreaming and\n            replication of practices for protection against land\n            degradation; (3) policy support and guidance for\n            mainstreaming land degradation prevention practices; and (4)\n            national level support for coordination of implementation of\n            land degradation prevention practices. All four components\n            are progressing satisfactorily. The project, based on its\n            current progress and achievements, is likely to achieve the\n            project development objectives within the six-month\n            extension. This extension of the grant closing date by six\n            months entails a level two project restructuring. The Royal\n            Government of Bhutan has requested the extension of the\n            project and, at several occasions, has indicated that the\n            approach to land management introduced through the project\n            is relevant and suitable for replication within the country.\n            The Ministry of Finance has endorsed this extension of the\n            project.
