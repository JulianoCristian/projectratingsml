This\n            includes: setting training objectives; ability to\n            identify/obtain good training material and trainers; and\n            developing post-training activities; 5) Systematic\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is critical to the\n            success of a project with widely dispersed project\n            activities and sites; 6) School Mapping can be an excellent\n            technique to support education planning, but there should be\n            a pre-commitment to update the 'map' each year -\n            thereby overcoming the potential static nature of the\n            process; 7) The establishment of a strongly staffed, and\n            well managed central project implementation unit (CPIU) must\n            be considered a key contributing factor to the successful\n            implementation of any project with widely disbursed\n            operations; 8) When a project has widely disbursed project\n            sites, local administrators, coordinators and teachers\n            should be more fully briefed regarding the advantages of\n            participating in the project as well as their\n            responsibilities; and 9) When technical consultants (i.e.,\n            architects, structural engineers, electrical engineers,\n            M&E specialists, and quantity surveyors) are selected\n            and contracted as individuals, rather than as teams\n            (organizations), by the Borrower, there is a strong\n            possibility that they may not form a cohesive working unit\n            so necessary in large projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Sulawesi and Eastern Islands\n            Basic Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Sulawesi and Eastern\n            Islands Basic Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/01/7606474/indonesia-sulawesi-eastern-islands-basic-education-project","projn":"ID-Sulawesi Basic Educ. -- P041895","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Teaching and Learning,Access & Equity in Basic Education,Primary Education,Education For All,Tertiary Education","teratopic":"Education","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070515100835"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education,Sub-national government administration,Secondary education,Primary education","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to books, achievement, active\n            learning, adults, BASIC EDUCATION, BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT,\n            basic education services, block grants, civic engagement,\n            civil service, classroom, classroom furniture, community\n            development, community involvement, community involvement in\n            education, community participation, costs of education,\n            curricula, curriculum, decentralization, decision making,\n            District Education, early grades, education enrollments,\n            Education Finance, Education for all, Education Law,\n            Education Management, Education Offices, education\n            personnel, education planning, education programs, Education\n            Projects, Education Sector, education strategy, educational\n            planning, educators, employment, enrollment of girls,\n            enrollment rates, equitable access, expenditures, external\n            efficiency, formative evaluations, Human Development, human\n            resource development, instructional materials, Junior\n            secondary, junior secondary education, Junior secondary\n            school, junior secondary schools, learning environment,\n            learning materials, levels of education, Ministry of\n            Education, National Education, National Education Ministry,\n            NER, net enrollment, net enrollment rate, numeracy, papers,\n            pedagogy, Performance Indicators, primary education, Primary\n            school, primary school completion, primary school completion\n            rates, Primary Schools, private junior secondary, Private\n            School, private schools, Quality Assurance, quality of,\n            reading, remote schools, repetition, repetition rates, rural\n            areas, rural schools, Scholarships, school affairs, school\n            age, school age children, School Committees, school\n            construction, school establishment, School Improvement,\n            School Improvement Program, school level, school levels,\n            school libraries, school location, school maintenance,\n            school management, school mapping, school participation,\n            school principals, school projects, School Quality, School\n            rehabilitation, schools, Secondary Education, Social\n            Development, socialization, staff development, student\n            assessment, student learning, student learning assessment,\n            student scholarships, study tours, supplementary reading,\n            target schools, teacher, Teacher Certification, Teacher\n            Management, teacher shortages, Teacher Support, teacher\n            training, teacher training activities, teachers, teaching,\n            teaching aids, technical assistance, Tertiary education,\n            textbooks, tutors, workers"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF023864-INDONESIA -- SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT\n            GRANT PROGRAM (SIGP),TF025521-PHRD-SOUTH SULAWESI/MALUKU\n            BASIC EDUC.

There are three project\n            components. 1) The crisis relief program will provide\n            scholarships to the poor and special assistance funds to\n            schools serving poor communities. 2) Institutional reform\n            will enable districts, subdistricts, and schools to plan\n            education activities within their district, manage the\n            education program between the different agencies, use\n            appropriate techniques for planning and implementation,\n            assign staff according to needs, and carry out targeted\n            activities. It will support project management,\n            implementation of the integrated plans, and establishment of\n            a monitoring and evaluation system. 3) Quality improvements\n            will finance primary school rehabilitation and maintenance,\n            teacher-training programs, procurement and distribution of\n            learning materials and equipment, teacher deployment in\n
