Some lessons learned included:\n            effective inter-agency coordination and management of the\n            different institutional agendas and interests across the\n            infrastructure sectors are important for the smooth\n            implementation of a project. This was seen to be\n            particularly relevant for the successful realization of the\n            Power, Gas-to-Power and to a lesser extent transport sector\n            objectives. It is important to build institutional capacity\n            in project management, financial management, and procurement\n            at the beginning of the project. In particular, emphasis\n            should be placed on having adequate procurement capacity in\n            place before project effectiveness. Thus after conducting\n            procurement capacity assessment of the implementing\n            agencies, issues identified should be adequately addressed\n            before effectiveness. Such issue will usually include having\n            adequate procurement capacity, preparation of draft\n            documents. Communications Strategy: It is important to have\n            an active and effective communications strategy that is both\n            pro-active in reaching out to specific stakeholders (e.g.\n            Assembly members, labor, and unions) and the broader public\n            and provide specific products and services to deal\n            reactively with media commentary and other eventualities.\n            Privatization is a process which depends on market\n            conditions. More thorough upstream investment and risk\n            allocation assessment would have better assisted the\n            government in the preparation of transactions for market.\n            While Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) capacity to\n            undertake this due diligence augmented considerably over the\n            life of the project, given the complexity of many of the\n            sector issues this involved, even deeper institutional\n            capacity and expertise was required. This will have included\n            more robust IT systems to record and utilize the\n            considerable diagnostic and technical data that has been\n            accumulated on the different transactions across the sectors\n            targeted. These lessons learned have been important to the\n            design of the next generation Nigeria Electricity and Gas\n            Improvement Project (NEGIP) and Public Private Partnership\n            (PPP) projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Privatization Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Privatization Support

There are six project\n            components. The first supports the government's program\n            for sector reform and privatization in telecommunications\n            and power infrastructure; finances preparation and execution\n            of public enteprise divestiture transactions in the other\n            sectors; finances competitively selected investment advisers\n            and legal and technical advisers; and finances consultant\n            studies. The second component finances and strengthens the\n            government institutions responsible for undertaking the\n            privatization program and sector reforms. The third\n            component helps mount a major communications and public\n            relations campaign at home and abroad to explain and\n            publicize the reforms. The fourth component develops a\n            national policy on telecommunications; reviews, develops,\n            and implements new and comprehensive telecommunications\n            legislation and regulations, among other telecommunications\n            reforms. The fifth component develops a national power\n            policy and a legal and regulatory framework, among other\n            power sector reforms.

As part of the divestiture processes,\n            environmental issues are being addressed during project\n            preparation, by including audits to analyze existing\n            conditions at, and around specific sites, and facilities of\n            the enterprises. The EA presents the results of the\n            environmental pre-audits, ranking the enterprises with\n            respect to requirements either for comprehensive or full\n            audit, partial, or no audit. Environmental concerns include\n            soil degradation, rapid deforestation, desertification, and\n            droughts, in addition to constraints in generation,\n            transmission and distribution of electricity to the national\n            grid from hydropower dams, and gas fired thermal plants,\n            with some immediate concerns, such as water, air, and noise\n            pollution, poor sanitation, drainage, and solid waste\n            management. Comprehensive, and partial audits address: 1)\n            development of appropriate waste management practices\n            regarding solid wastes, including oil spill contingency\n            plans for the prevention, and control of spillage into\n            downstream waters; 2) training assessment on environmental\n            management plans, in accordance with the regulatory\n            framework, and in liaison with the Ministry of the\n            Environment; and, development of environmental mitigation,\n            performance indicators, and monitoring; and, 3)\n            identification of equipment decommissioning plans, in\n            compliance with World Bank guidelines."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Privatization Technical Assistance\n            Credit Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Privatization Technical\n            Assistance Credit Project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/01/1000563/nigeria-privatization-technical-assistance-credit-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"NG-Privatization Support Project -- P070293","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Energy and Environment,Environmental Governance,Banks & Banking Reform,Environmental Economics & Policies","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Nigeria","authors":{"authr":"Malick, A.K.
