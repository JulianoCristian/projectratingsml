          Institutions Development Project of Tanzania were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: 1) The privatization of large\n            state-owned banks can directly lead to a sustained\n            improvement of access to financial services in rural areas;\n            2) Building a strong financial infrastructure is essential,\n            but progress can be slow and certain reforms may have to be\n            sequential; 3) Long-term investment in capacity building of\n            regulators is a key success factor for successful project\n            implementation, especially with regards to privatizations;\n            and 4) Mainstreaming of project implementation contributes\n            significantly to strengthening of client capacity and to\n            signaling clear lines of authority vis-\u00e0-vis the private sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Second Financial Institutions\n            Development

           small savers, and micro entrepreneurs, within a sound, and\n            competitive financial system environment. The components\n            are: 1) The restructuring, and privatization of major banks,\n            will provide considerable management expertise support in\n            banking operations, treasury, and micro-finance. Staff\n            training, management information systems, and, research, and\n            development funding for the micro-finance pilots, will be\n            provided. The component will also address bridge\n            compensation payments to redundant staff, bond\n            re-capitalization to fill financing gaps, and, review\n            options for the restructuring, and privatization of\n            remaining state-owned banks. 2) The financial infrastructure\n            strengthening, will upgrade the technical skills of the\n            banking supervision within the Bank of Tanzania, namely,\n            strengthening the financial data integrity, through improved\n            analytical skills, and, accounting standards. In addition,\n            the payments system, Credit Reference Bureau, and, the\n            Capital Markets and Securities Authority, will continue to\n            be supported, through operational financing. 3) Funding will\n            be provided for the establishment, and management - on a\n            pilot basis - of the first three years of the Privatization\n            Trust, to broaden
