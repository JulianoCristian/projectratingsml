The\n            project's energy efficiency investments into\n            essentially social public buildings had a catalytic effect\n            on local markets by demonstrating the exemplary role of the\n            government to the private sector and general public, while\n            at the same time stimulating nascent markets for EE goods\n            and services. During design and implementation supervision,\n            special attention should be given to ensuring that\n            implementation arrangements are fully integrated within the\n            government administration to build capacity.
