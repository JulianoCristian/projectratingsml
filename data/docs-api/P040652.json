Once again,\n            over-promising proves not to be a good strategy. Second,\n            whatever the financial instrument (investment project,\n            program support, or other), there is no substitute for\n            conducting the analytical work, which is essential for\n            avoiding major design flaws. In this case, the lack of\n            in-depth analytical work might explain why PDOs and many\n            intermediate objectives were not discussed realistically.\n            Third, though often agreed on in haste, the modalities for\n            entering into and transitioning from program arrangements\n            are complex and require careful study. Fourth, project\n            preparation must reach fundamental agreement on the\n            determinants of health status; otherwise, as the MTR points\n            out, funds are more likely to support activities which are\n            easier to implement rather than those which are more\n            difficult, but also more strategically important (e.g.,\n            human resources) or more broadly linked with improved health\n            status (nutrition, water and hygiene, literacy, etc.).\n            Fifth, implementation of health sector support is easier\n            when health sector decentralization (or at least\n            de-concentration) is ahead of overall administrative decentralization."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali -
