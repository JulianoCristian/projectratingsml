The\n            project achieved its overall objectives, institutional\n            development was partially achieved, sustainability is\n            likely, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, the expanded scope of activities undertaken\n            in CSSM required greater modifications in program strategy\n            than were adopted. Second, a country-wide project needs a\n            well-functioning MIS for monitoring and midcourse\n            corrections. CSSM lacked this. Also, a project with varied,\n            often competitive, activities and a \"life cycle\"\n            approach needs an MIS tailored to field operatives'\n            requirements for planning. Third, if involvement of the\n            private sector is imperative to meet project objectives,\n            mechanisms to ensure such involvement and monitor progress\n            must be built in, such as in performance reporting. Further,\n            the ways of involving the private sector need to be tailored\n            to its varied segments. Finally, systematic management\n            training must be a major concern for large and complex projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Child Survival and Safe Motherhood Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Child Survival and Safe\n            Motherhood Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/03/731996/india-child-survival-safe-motherhood-project","projn":"IN-Health I (Mch) -- P010387","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Early Child and Children's Health,Early Childhood Development,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Adolescent Health","teratopic":"Education","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970716145529"},"subsc":"Health","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Acute Respiratory Infection,acute\n            respiratory infections,adolescent,adolescent\n            girls,anemia,ARI,birth spacing,birth-weight,births,Child\n            Development,child mortality,Child\n            Survival,childhood,childhood diseases,children fully\n            immunized,community action,Community Health,Contraceptive\n            prevalence,CS,decentralization,delivery\n            kits,diarrhea,Diphtheria,drug kits,Drugs,early\n            detection,equipment,exercises,extension,Family Health,family\n            planning,Family Welfare,Gender,girls,health facility,high-\n            risk,high-risk,hospitals,Immunization,Immunization\n            coverage,Infection,institutional care,life cycle,Maternal\n            and Child Health,maternal health,maternal\n            mortality,MCH,Measles,media,Medical Research,minor\n            ailments,mortality,mothers,National Family Health\n            Survey,needs assessment,neonatal care,Nurse\n            Midwife,nurse-midwives,nursing,nutrition,Obstetric Care,oral\n            rehydration salts,parents,partnership,patients,Polio,Polio\n            Vaccine,pregnancies,pregnant women,preschool\n            children,private medical practitioners,private\n            practitioners,private sector,private voluntary\n            organizations,prophylaxis,public sector,PVOs,radio,radio\n            spots,reproductive health,respiratory infections,Safe\n            Motherhood,safety,Social Development,social\n            services,technical assistance,Tetanus,traditional birth\n            attendants,Universal Immunization,vaccines,vitamin A,vitamin\n            A deficiency,voluntary organizations,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"Acute Respiratory Infection,acute\n            respiratory infections,adolescent,adolescent\n            girls,anemia,ARI,birth spacing,birth-weight,births,Child\n            Development,child mortality,Child\n            Survival,childhood,childhood diseases,children fully\n            immunized,community action,Community Health,Contraceptive\n            prevalence,CS,decentralization,delivery\n            kits,diarrhea,Diphtheria,drug kits,Drugs,early\n            detection,equipment,exercises,extension,Family Health,family\n            planning,Family Welfare,Gender,girls,health facility,high-\n            risk,high-risk,hospitals,Immunization,Immunization\n            coverage,Infection,institutional care,life cycle,Maternal\n            and Child Health,maternal health,maternal\n            mortality,MCH,Measles,media,Medical Research,minor\n            ailments,mortality,mothers,National Family Health\n            Survey,needs assessment,neonatal care,Nurse\n            Midwife,nurse-midwives,nursing,nutrition,Obstetric Care,oral\n            rehydration salts,parents,partnership,patients,Polio,Polio\n            Vaccine,pregnancies,pregnant women,preschool\n            children,private medical practitioners,private\n            practitioners,private sector,private voluntary\n            organizations,prophylaxis,public sector,PVOs,radio,radio\n            spots,reproductive health,respiratory infections,Safe\n            Motherhood,safety,Social Development,social\n            services,technical assistance,Tetanus,traditional birth\n            attendants,Universal Immunization,vaccines,vitamin A,vitamin\n            A deficiency,voluntary organizations,workers"}},"owner":"S.A.
