There are at least five key lessons to be\n            derived from the design and implementation of the AIDS and\n            Sexually Transmitted Disease Control Project (LUSIDA)\n            project: (a) Ensuring up-front political support and\n            commitment for important, and often politically difficult,\n            HIV/AIDS policy changes is crucial to effectively address\n            the HIV/AIDS epidemic; (b) Involving NGOs during project\n            preparation is necessary to ensure buy-in from civil society\n            as main actors in project implementation and to ensure\n            accountability of policy makers in HIV/AIDS prevention\n            policy; (c) Reaching clear agreements and setting effective\n            monitoring of counterpart funds during project preparation\n            is essential to ensure they will be available during project\n            implementation; (d) Early and effective integration of\n            project activities to the mainstream implementing agency\n            responsibilities and organization is essential to ensure\n            project sustainability; (e) Ensuring ownership and\n            commitment by decentralized agencies and local governments,\n            who have the ultimate responsibility for implementing policy\n            and project activities, is essential for achieving both,\n

the\n            growth rate of the incidence of HIV infection by 15 percent.\n            The project components involve financing mostly HIV/AIDS-\n            and STD-related health promotion and disease prevention\n            activities, with an emphasis on the Federal Capital and on\n            the provinces of Buenos Aires, Cordoba, and Santa Fe, where\n            85 percent of HIV cases are concentrated. Specifically, the\n            components involve: (1) mass and targeted communication\n            campaigns, and primary and secondary educational materials,\n            teacher training, and participatory projects on HIV/AIDS and\n            STDS; (2) HIV/AIDS and STD prevention through Civil Society\n            Organization-based or governmental behavior intervention\n            subprojects for specific at-risk groups as well as for the\n            general population, blood bank quality control, and HIV\n            diagnosis and treatment in prenatal care; (3) diagnosis,\n            treatment, and care of HIV infection and STDs, by\n            establishing anonymous diagnostic and counseling centers,\n            strengthening or developing laboratories, day care services,\n            and home care services, and training physicians and other\n            health care personnel; (4) monitoring, evaluation, and\n            research, including strengthening the HIV/AIDS management\n            information system, training in completing official forms\n            and statistics, and in epidemiology and planning, reviewing\n            financial and
