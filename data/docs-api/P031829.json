The main lesson learned\n            pertains to the importance of an adequate policy and/or\n            regulatory environment. Key to timely implementation is\n            incentive, either of the carrot or stick variety, a lesson\n            that is hardly new. And key to incentive is an enabling\n            policy, and regulatory environment, in this case the\n            necessity of regulatory compulsion. The lesson of incentive\n            applies not only to the demand side, but also the supply\n            side. The Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), as\n            the sole intermediary, did not have the pressure of\n            competition on the supply side. But including a second\n            intermediary may not have been feasible in the present case,\n            however, given the relatively small size of the umbrella.\n            There is also a lesson of management process, which is\n            critical to timely implementation. Best practice suggests\n            organizing and running a project launch workshop, to bring\n            potential beneficiaries up to speed on the project and what\n            is offered, and how to go about availing of it. Likewise,\n            best practice suggests preparing a project implementation\n            manual (PIM) to lend clarity to the process, and thereby\n            surpass avoidable delays. Finally, it may be remarked that\n            IDBI stayed engaged and committed, although their\n            remuneration turned out to be less than anticipated, and the\n            burden of work greater. The lesson here is perhaps that some\n            enterprises take their commitments seriously, even when\n            these may not be to their benefit at times. There is much to\n            be said for a long-term partnership, and, the Bank's\n            investment in the relationship with IDBI has been an\n            important aspect of the highly successful Montreal Protocol\n            program in India over 12 years."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
