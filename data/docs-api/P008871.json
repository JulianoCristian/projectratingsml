Lessons drawn\n            from the project identify a generally positive grant\n            administration by the local, non-governmental agency, the\n            Technology Development Foundation (TDF), whose performance\n            was well regarded, and supported by confident Turkish\n            companies, who responded appropriately to TDF's\n            supervision of the fund supporting the ozone depleting\n            substances (ODS) phase-out. Nonetheless, inter-agency\n            coordination delays in reaching a policy consensus were\n            higher than expected, as were the delays in the development\n            of policy consensus with business (although finally highly\n            successful) on the National Ozone Plan. This lead to\n            inadequate allocation of funds to public, and industry\n            awareness campaigns, because of higher media costs than\n            previously estimated in the project. Furthermore, the\n            project evaluation process of the Montreal Protocol (MP)\n            Executive Committee is found to be very slow, based on\n            organizations' complaints that long periods elapse,\n            before their proposals can be even considered, and, in some\n            cases, the incomplete MP guidelines by which to evaluate\n            proposals, leads to delays, such as the approval of\n            Turkey's pending Refrigeration Plan, meaning an\n            increase of 2000 ODS imports by 56 tons."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -
