Some lessons learned included: improved donor\n            coordination in the health sector would have been desirable.\n            However, there are no clear signs that this lack of\n            coordination was costly since the targets were met and\n            exceeded. Overall, the education sector performed better\n            than the health sector in terms of implementation, even\n            though both equally suffered institutional instability,\n            including frequent changes of the Ministers, high attrition\n            rate and limited capacity. The use of a fiduciary agency for\n            project management was critical for successful\n            implementation by country institutions. Project\n            Administrative and Fiduciary Agency, or AFAP's role in\n            project implementation went far beyond fiduciary management;\n            it also acted as a technical assistant to the health and\n            education ministries in various aspects of project\n            execution, particularly by supporting the development of\n            terms of reference, contributing to technical discussions,\n            and training staff on monitoring and evaluation. In\n            addition, in a context of frequent ministerial change and\n            associated staffing instability, AFAP played a significant\n            role in maintaining dialogue within government and with its\n            external partners. By its experience and reputation, AFAP is\n            well placed to become a government agency for project\n            management. Having one project for the two social sectors in\n            a small country promoted relative economies of scale for the\n            fiduciary and procurement functions of the project, as well\n            as for Bank supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sao Tome and Principe  - Social Sector\n            Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sao Tome and Principe  - Social\n

Project (SSSP). The additional\n            financing (AF) is sought to provide additional resources to\n            scale up the original project activities and to implement\n            two additional activities under component B, Delivery of\n            Basic Health Services, and component C, Cross-Sector Issues\n            (Malaria and HIV/AIDS). The additional financing will cover\n            only the health and the cross-sector HIV/AIDS and malaria\n            components of the SSSP, as the Government's education\n            program has recently benefited from a US$3.6 million\n            Catalytic Fund Grant. The original activities to be scaled\n            up include: (i) rehabilitation of health facilities; and\n            (ii) institutional support to the Ministry of Health (MoH).\n            The additional activities include: (i) construction of\n            residences for health staff in remote areas in order to\n            improve the availability of health services; and (ii)\n            capacity development of the health training school, and\n            training of health personnel, including nurses, in order to\n            increase the availability and quality of human resources in\n            the sector. All activities to be financed under the\n            additional financing are part of the Annual Work Plan (AWP)\n            under the original project, which was agreed upon between\n            the Government and the Bank in October 2009."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sao Tome and Principe -
