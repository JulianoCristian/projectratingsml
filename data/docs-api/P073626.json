The two\n            interrelated objectives were to: (i) reduce non-tariff costs\n            of trade and transport; and (ii) reduce smuggling and\n            corruption.

Building a tradition of interagency\n            communication and information sharing as well as building\n            the mechanisms on which such communication can be based,\n            needs a high-level government commitment and ideally a\n            champion. Such a person/agency needs to be able to direct\n            concerns to the highest levels of management in the\n            ministries responsible for the agencies engaged in border\n            control. This implies knowledge of the national political\n            system and the power to navigate through that system.\n            Private sector/user involvement is an essential part of\n            trade facilitation. Such involvement enables an adequate\n            analysis of the trade patterns to find the main bottlenecks\n            and identify optimal measures for improvements. Also, it\n            must be ensured that the capacity building and modernization\n            of the private sector is analog to the reforms in customs,\n            so as to ensure that introduced reforms are applied in\n            private operations.

at border crossings. There\n            are five main project components besides project management.\n            Component 1 improves operations at pilot sites by assisting\n            in preparing automated procedures to collect management data\n            in order to monitor performance indicators, establishing\n            programs to implement new border processing procedures and\n            practices, and providing technical assistance and training;\n            re-engineers procedures by providing technical assistance to\n            MDC to improve control over goods in transit (reinforcing\n            the border, automating data exchange between customs\n            locations, integrating trade and transit data, and\n            interagency coordination), streamlining declaration and\n            transit procedures, and strengthening valuation and\n            post-release activities. Component 2 installs and implements\n            an ASYCUDA (Automated System for Customs Data) clearance\n            system and supports technical assistance and training,\n            finances training equipment, and computerizes the Moldovan\n            Department of Customs. Component 3 implements a transit and\n            inland control system through mobile intervention squads.\n            Component 4 improves border crossing facilities including\n            procurement of small equipment, supporting minor repairs,\n            and setting up secondary inspection areas.
