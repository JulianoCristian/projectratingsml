The experience of the\n            Rajasthan Agriculture Development Project offers four\n            lessons for future Bank supported, state-wide multi-sectoral\n            interventions in the agriculture sector in India and\n            elsewhere. 1) When several policy reforms and investments\n            are required in a sector, a multi-phase operation over a\n            longer period may be more appropriate. Early attention could\n            then be focused on critical policy reforms and the most\n            crucial investments to create the right platform for\n            subsequent investments. This would avoid the simultaneous\n            preoccupation with meeting multiple targets at the expense\n            of a sound policy framework. 2) Monitoring and evaluation of\n            outcomes should be integral to project design. Realistic\n            targets and indicators need to be linked to objectives. 3)\n            Complex Bank interventions require strong and constant Bank\n            management oversight to ensure the alignment of\n            implementation and design and strict adherence to Bank\n            procedures and policies. 4) Adequate understanding of the\n            financial situation of the government at the appraisal stage\n            can help ensure the financial health of a project during\n            implementation and the sustainability of activities\n            supported after closure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

Both World Bank and Borrower performances are\n            rated as satisfactory overall. The list of lessons learned\n            includes the following: This complex operation involving 12\n            government departments made Borrower coordination and\n            monitoring and World Bank supervision difficult. It would\n            have been better had investments concentrated on fewer\n            critical areas that responded most directly to objectives,\n            were technically robust, and had a higher chance of success.\n            Performance was generally better in those departments that\n            commissioned activity evaluation studies early enough and\n            then took decisive remedial actions. Continuity of key staff\n            contributes to successful implementation. Under typically\n            harsh field conditions, especially when migratory practices\n            are followed, animal breeding programs should avoid use of\n            exotic stock and focus upgrading on selection within the\n            locally adapted breeds (except for intensive dairying).\n            Future programs should focus on fewer high quality\n            demonstrations of technologies with good replication\n            prospects. While the project reform agenda successfully\n            focused on introducing full cost recovery on selected farm\n            inputs, relatively little was included to promote income\n            generation and financial sustainability in the implementing departments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Rajasthan Agricultural Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Rajasthan
