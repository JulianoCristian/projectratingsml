Some lessons\n            learned included: this project demonstrated once again the\n            importance of Governments preparing solid and reliable\n            damage assessments and reconstruction plans. In this case,\n            the Government's damage assessment was completed very\n            quickly, effectively and efficiently with assistance from\n            the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the\n            United Nation (UN) system. The availability of credible\n            lists of beneficiaries that was prepared very soon after the\n            disaster and were broadly accepted by the community ensured\n            the success and efficiency of the first round of\n            distribution of cash grants to households. Despite the\n            emergency character of the project, it should include some\n            kind of evaluation of results. Implementation of other\n            activities included in the Government's reconstruction,\n            and financed by other donors, did suffer because of the\n            absence of reliable beneficiary lists prepared in a timely\n            fashion. Medium and small contractors may sometimes be\n            better able to deliver in the aftermath of a disaster when\n            large contractors are typically
