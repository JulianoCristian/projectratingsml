Some lessons\n            learned included: if legislation is essential to the\n            achievement of reform objectives, it also essential to have\n            a risk assessment plan that outlines what measures could be\n            taken if the legislation is not passed. M&E planning\n            should also begin early in project preparation, even during\n            the analytic phases of sector work to establish what trend\n            data is available as potentially useful as indicators. The\n            indicators chosen for measuring achievement of PDOs, as is\n            often the case, presented difficulty in attributing outcomes\n            to project interventions, although arguments in terms of\n            plausibility can still be made. No control groups were used\n            or attempted. In such situations, which are common for\n            complex projects, it is useful to assemble baseline trend\n            data prior to the project interventions, as opposed to a\n            single data point at the start of the project, such as GPA\n            or time to first job. Also, it is important to assess the\n            capacity of the country to measure important variables. Then\n            resources needed to bolster this capacity could be included\n            in the project. In addition, procurement can play a major\n            role in developing an M&E system. The lack of\n            procurement capacity delayed the implementation of the\n            tracer survey, which is a critical element in higher education."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Managing

Some lessons\n            learned included: institutional autonomy of higher education\n            institutions is a complicated goal, requiring substantial\n            and often difficult and always lengthy legal, financial and\n            accreditation changes. Instead of focusing on autonomy as a\n            goal, the monitoring framework could have explored\n            indicators related to governance and accountability instead.\n            Project outcome indicators should not be based on the\n            results of a political process over which the project has no\n            control.
