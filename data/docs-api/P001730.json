A transport project, such as the Fifth Highway\n            Project, has both direct and indirect consequences on the\n            environment. An environmental analysis of such a project is,\n            therefore, a way of introducing (and teaching about) the\n            environmental issues in the transport administrations. It\n            can also serve as a reference for future projects. This\n            environmental analysis is the result of a mission realized\n            to study the environmental impact of the Fifth Highway\n            Project. The objectives of the mission were the following:\n            1) to identify the existing documentation and competence\n            necessary for the environmental analysis of transport\n            projects in Mali, and, most importantly, to put on record\n            the deficiencies; 2) to establish a first diagnosis on the\n            environmental impact of the Fifth Highway Project and to\n            make some recommendations for future projects; and 3) to\n            immediately create a dynamic involving information sharing\n            and teamwork between the different partners of these\n            national and international projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rapport de l'etude d'impact sur l'environnement"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali \u2013 Cinqui\u00e8me projet routier :\n            analyse de l\u2019impact sur l\u2019environnement (Vol. 2) : Rapport\n            de l\u2019\u00e9tude d\u2019impact sur l\u2019environnement"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/01/13883755/mali-cinquieme-projet-routier-analyse-de-limpact-sur-lenvironnement-vol-2-rapport-de-letude-dimpact-sur-lenvironnement","projn":"ML-Highways V-154082 -- P001717,ML-Transport Sector -- P001730","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Mali","authors":{"authr":"Mali"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20110309084313"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Roads and highways,Railways,General transportation sector,(Historic)Highways","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Airports; Construction materials; Engine\n            fuels; Environmental education; Environmental impact\n            assessment; Environmental management; Institution building;\n            Labor; Maintenance & repair; Parastatals; Railways; Road\n            & highway equipment; Road & highway transport; Road\n            surfaces; Roads & highways; Transport costs; Transport\n            equipment; Transport infrastructure; Transport policy,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Airports; Construction materials; Engine\n            fuels; Environmental education; Environmental impact\n            assessment; Environmental management; Institution building;\n            Labor; Maintenance & repair; Parastatals; Railways; Road\n            & highway equipment; Road & highway transport; Road\n            surfaces; Roads & highways; Transport costs; Transport\n            equipment; Transport infrastructure; Transport policy,,"}},"owner":"Transport Practice Group (AFTTR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020090-BELGIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND","repnb":"E117"},"5077074":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1994/07/5077074/conformed-copy-c2617-transport-sector-project-development-credit-agreement","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1994/07/5077074/conformed-copy-c2617-transport-sector-project-development-credit-agreement","new_url":"1994/07/5077074/conformed-copy-c2617-transport-sector-project-development-credit-agreement","docm_id":"090224b0807fa7bd","chronical_docm_id":"090224b0807fa7bd","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/AFR/2004/12/15/42023479764D065B85256F020081A84D/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/42023479764D065B85256F020081A84D.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/AFR/2004/12/15/42023479764D065B85256F020081A84D/1_0/Rendered/PDF/42023479764D065B85256F020081A84D.pdf","credit_no":"IDA2617A;IDA26170","datestored":"2004-09-01T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1994-07-08T00:00:00Z","unregnbr":"31826","docna":{"cdata!":"Conformed Copy -

A transport project, such as the Fifth Highway\n            Project, has both direct and indirect consequences on the\n            environment.

It\n            can also serve as a reference for future projects. This\n            environmental analysis is the result of a mission realized\n            to study the environmental impact of the Fifth Highway\n            Project. The objectives of the mission were the following:\n            1) to identify the existing documentation and competence\n            necessary for the environmental analysis of transport\n            projects in Mali, and, most importantly, to put on record\n            the deficiencies; 2) to establish a first diagnosis on the\n            environmental impact of the Fifth Highway Project and to\n            make some recommendations for future projects; and 3) to\n            immediately create a dynamic involving information sharing\n            and teamwork between the different partners of these\n            national and international projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Cinquieme Projet Routier : analyse de\n            l'impact sur l'environnement"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali \u2013 Cinqui\u00e8me projet routier :\n            analyse de l\u2019impact sur l\u2019environnement"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/06/441908/mali-cinquieme-projet-routier-analyse-de-limpact-sur-lenvironnement","projn":"ML-Highways V-154082 -- P001717,ML-Transport Sector -- P001730","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Mali","authors":{"authr":"Mali"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970716150000"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Roads and highways,Railways,General transportation sector,(Historic)Highways","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Airports; Construction materials; Engine\n            fuels; Environmental education; Environmental impact\n            assessment; Environmental management; Institution building;\n            Labor; Maintenance & repair; Parastatals; Railways; Road\n            & highway equipment; Road & highway transport; Road\n            surfaces; Roads & highways; Transport costs; Transport\n            equipment; Transport infrastructure; Transport policy"}},"owner":"Transport Practice Group (AFTTR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020090-BELGIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND","repnb":"E117"},"facets":{}}}
