Some\n            lessons learned included: the implementation of financial\n            administration reform projects benefit from the support from\n            high-level political actors within Ministries of Finance; in\n            spite of difficult political and economic circumstances,\n            these projects have high chances of survival because of the\n            strong interest of the government to obtain and utilize on\n            reliable information; flexibility during design and\n            implementation is essential to better reflect variance in\n            the government priorities and needs; bank management should\n            ensure the quality of documentation of Bank operations and\n            the effective transfer of knowledge and the records from
