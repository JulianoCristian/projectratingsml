Financial Sector Stability Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Financial Sector\n            Stability Credit (FSSC) Project for Nepal were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: by quickly\n            responding to the client's request for assistance, the\n            Bank continues to be regarded as a valued partner. It was\n            important to maintain sufficient flexibility to adapt and\n            respond to client needs and economic realities in the\n            country. Bank assistance and support in simply initiating\n            difficult reform actions through the operation facilitated\n            the client\u0092s ability and momentum to continue the full and\n            complete implementation of reform actions, even after the\n            operation closed, albeit at a slower pace. The slowdown in\n            implementation of some key policy actions after the release\n            of the FSSC funds implies that the scope of the reforms was\n            ambitious in the context of Nepal's political\n            circumstances. The implications of the short time frame for\n            the closure of the FSSC oblige the need for a more realistic\n            timeframe in the follow-on programmatic operations and\n            secondly, for a more narrowly defined project development\n            objective (PDO) and set of outcome indicators for the\n            planned programmatic operations. Cooperation among\n            international agencies (that is, Department for\n            International Development (DFID), International Monetary\n            Fund (IMF), and Asian Development Bank (ADB)) proved\n            essential, since extensive technical assistance has been\n            provided and coordinated with this operation and aligned\n            with the country\u0092s priorities and strategic goals. The\n            broadening of the DFID technical assistance program over the\n            coming years should also allow expansion of the scope of\n            forthcoming development policy credit (DPC) operations and\n            Bank-DFID cooperation is continuing as the preparation of\n            additional DPCs moves forward."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Financial Sector Stability Credit

The credit recognizes the important progress\n            made so far by the Nepalese authorities to tackle financial\n            sector vulnerability and supports the acceleration of a\n            medium term reform strategy which commenced implementation\n            in 2011. This program document describes a stand-alone,\n            single tranche, financial sector stability credit of US\n            dollar 30 million to support the Government's efforts\n            to address financial sector vulnerabilities that remain\n            critical to macroeconomic stability and economic growth. The\n            actions supported under the Development Policy Credit (DPC)\n            form part of a broader, medium term Government program aimed\n            at reinforcing banking sector stability and paving the way\n            for the development of a robust and more inclusive financial\n            sector. The key components of this medium term program are\n            also described in detail in the document. Sufficient overall\n            progress towards the objectives of the medium term program\n            would allow the Bank to provide additional support in the\n            form of a second DPC within about 18 months."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Financial Sector Stability Credit Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Financial Sector\n            Stability Credit
