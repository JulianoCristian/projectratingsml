the District Roads Improvement\n            and Maintenance Program (DRIMP) nationwide.  It would also\n            assist Malawi in continuing to provide for improvements of\n            main and secondary roads, upgrading of an important section\n            of the North-South road to a paved standard, and financing a\n            transport systems study of the northern access route linking\n            Malawi and the Tanzania/Zambia corridor.  The proposed\n            project would also strengthen transport planning and the\n            management capabilities of the Ministry of Works and\n            Supplies (MWS).  Specifically, it would finance:  (i)\n            completing the third and last phase of DRIMP; (ii) a\n            four-year maintenance and rehabilitation program for the\n            main and secondary road networks; (iii) constructing a\n            two-lane bituminous road between the Luwawa Turnoff and\n            Champhoyo; (iv) providing weigh bridges and vehicles for\n            axle load control; (v) furniture, training aids and\n            equipment for the MWS' new training center in Lilongwe;\n            and (vi) providing consultant services and training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi -
