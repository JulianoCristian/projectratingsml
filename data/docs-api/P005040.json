In addition, the project\n            will provide technical assistance in three areas: consulting\n            services for sector analysis, project identification, and\n            monitoring and evaluation systems; training courses and\n            fellowships; and development of computerization of the\n            monitoring and evaluation of data."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Second
