The three\n            projects addressed different, but important dimensions of\n            Mexico's transport sector, and, all three projects\n            largely achieved their objectives, despite significant\n            initial implementation problems in the case of the air\n            quality, and the highway projects. Three lessons emerge from\n            these operations. First, much progress can be achieved in\n            reducing the impact of road transport on air quality,\n            through a combination of public and private sector measures,\n            starting with an adequate system of incentives, put in place\n            by federal, and state governments. Second, allocation of\n            highway maintenance funding optimizes outcome, when\n            preference is given to routine, and periodic maintenance\n            over rehabilitation, but network condition is bound to\n            deteriorate if funding for rehabilitation is not made\n            available. Third, regarding infrastructure privatization\n            ,and in order to gain public acceptance, requires as\n            necessary (but not always sufficient) conditions, a\n            transparent privatization process, compliance with\n            commitments by private operators, and government provision\n            of social protection to users of non-commercial services,\n            and to staff made redundant."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Transport Air Quality Management\n            for Mexico City, Highway Rehabilitation and Safety, and\n            Infrastructure Privatization Technical Assistance Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Transport Air Quality\n            Management for Mexico City, Highway Rehabilitation and\n            Safety, and Infrastructure Privatization Technical\n            Assistance Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/06/2439807/mexico-transport-air-quality-management-mexico-city-highway-rehabilitation-safety-infrastructure-privatization-technical-assistance-projects","projn":"MX-Infra.

were either fully or\n            partly achieved although project implementation was slowed\n            for a number of technical, financial, and institutional\n            reasons. The probability that project benefits will be\n            sustained is high. World Bank and Borrower performances were\n            satisfactory overall. Key lessons learned related to program\n            support, flow of funds, credit lines, and the External\n            Panel. The project supported an on-going program to which\n            the government had demonstrated its commitment at the\n            federal and local levels. This gave considerable assurance\n            that the project would be implemented. Arrangements to\n            provide funds to implementing agencies should have been in\n            place prior to loan signing or Board presentation. Moreover,\n            if the Environmental Trust Fund were provided with a\n            reliable permanent source of funds, it would provide greater\n            assurance that key public environmental investments would be\n            carried out and program benefits would be sustained. Project\n            implementation was delayed by the decision to limit credit\n            line operations to BANOBRAS to finance taxes and minibuses\n            even though the National Finance Institution had begun a\n            program to finance taxis and had developed an extensive\n            group of financial intermediaries through which to channel\n            resources for this purpose.
