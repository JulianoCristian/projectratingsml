Some lessons learned included:\n            while a strictly technical public health approach would\n            direct resources from the start towards targeting\n            interventions to geographic areas and population groups with\n            the highest HIV prevalence, that direction may from a longer\n            term perspective not always be the right one. Money came to\n            the Mozambican communities because of AIDS. As a result,\n            communities organized themselves. They were empowered to\n            begin to take control of their lives. The income generating\n            activities assisted vulnerable groups to better cope with\n            their vulnerability, and demonstrated that a small amount of\n            money could go a long way. They focused on the enormous and\n            immediate needs of orphans and vulnerable children. These\n            impact mitigation efforts opened the door for an open\n            dialogue in the communities on the risks for HIV infection\n            and laid the foundation for a community-based approach to\n            prevention. Active involvement of civil society means that\n            one must be prepared to finance its priorities, even if\n            these are not immediately and evidently perceived as the\n            most cost-effective to curb the epidemic. The Bank responded\n            swiftly and appropriately to addressing the HIV/AIDS\n            situation in Mozambique when there were few development\n            partners on the ground and limited financing. The fact that\n            the basic design of the project could be maintained through\n            five amendments to the Development Grant Agreement (DGA)\n            proves that the Multi-country AIDS Program (MAP) instrument\n            was used in a flexible way and could respond to the\n            country's evolving needs as the national strategy\n            developed and new partners came on board."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - HIV/AIDS Response Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique - HIV/AIDS Response Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/12/15739392/mozambique-hivaids-response-project","projn":"MZ-Hiv/Aids Response Project -- P078053","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,HIV AIDS,Housing & Human Habitats,Disease Control & Prevention,Population Policies","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Mozambique","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20120127045808"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adolescents, Adult prevalence, aged, AIDS\n            Control, AIDS epidemic, AIDS epidemics, AIDS Program, AIDS\n            Relief, AIDS treatment, alleviation of poverty, ante-natal\n            care, architecture, awareness raising, Behavior Change,\n            behavioral change, behavioral changes, blood safety, blood\n            transfusion, blood transfusion equipment, Capacity Building,\n            case of AIDS, chronic disease, circumcision, civil society\n            groups, civil society organizations, civil war, clinics,\n            commercial sex, commercial sex workers, Commodity Security,\n            condom, condoms, dangers, development assistance,\n            Development Objectives, diagnosis, diagnosis of AIDS, drugs,\n            Emergency Plan, environmental requirements, families, family\n            members, Female, females, Gender, Gross National Product,\n            health care, health care facilities, Health centers, health\n            facilities, health ministries, Health Sector, health sector\n            reform, health services, Health systems, health workers,\n            high risk groups, HIV, HIV infection, HIV positive, HIV\n            Prevention, HIV testing, HIV transmission, HIV/AIDS,\n            hospital, hospitals, Human Development, infection rate,\n            institutional capacity, international trends, intervention,\n            journalists, large population, local authorities, male\n            circumcision, management of health, Medical supplies,\n            medicines, migrant, Ministry of Health, Multi-country AIDS,\n            multilateral organizations, National AIDS, National AIDS\n            Control, National Council, national government, national\n            leaders, national level, national plan, national strategy,\n            national surveillance, needles, neighborhood, nurses,\n            opportunistic infections, orphans, palliative care,\n            patients, Pharmaceuticals, population groups, population\n            movements, post -exposure prophylaxis, Post-exposure\n            prophylaxis, pregnant women, pretesting, prevalence rate,\n            prevalence rates, prevention activities, prevention efforts,\n            prevention interventions, preventive therapy, progress,\n            prostitute, public health, public health problem, Public\n            Service, quality control, radio, rate of condom use,\n            refugees, religious leaders, reproductive health, risk\n            groups, risk of transmission, rural communities, rural\n            development, safety nets, service delivery, sex with men,\n            sex workers, sexual behavior, sexual encounters, sexual\n            partners, sexual practices, sexual relation, sexual\n            relations, sexually transmitted infections, Social\n            Development, social services, STDs, STIs, surveillance data,\n            Syndrome, syringes, TB, technical assistance, trade unions,\n            Transmission, Treatment Acceleration Project, Tuberculosis,\n            TV, UNAIDS, UNFPA, United Nations Population Fund, unsafe\n            sex, Virus, Voluntary Counseling, vulnerability, vulnerable\n            children, vulnerable groups, waste, young girls, young men,\n            young people, young women, youth"}},"owner":"Hlth, Nutr & Pop.

The\n            strategy is designed to slow the spread of HIV/AIDS\n            infection, and mitigate the effects of the epidemic through\n            prevention, and care treatment.

The project has five components. The community and\n            civil society initiatives would empower communities to\n            respond effectively to the HIV/AIDS epidemic; the capacity\n            building for the civil
