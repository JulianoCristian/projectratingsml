This allows small\n            countries to benefit from the shared fixed costs of\n            regulatory institutions. Nevertheless, the approach\n            concerning spectrum management, and monitoring prior to the\n            project was rudimentary, and would not have been sufficient\n            to support the expansion of wireless services, had it not\n            been for the increased capabilities accorded by the Radio\n            Spectrum Monitoring and Management System (RSMMS), essential\n            during rapid growth in the use of the spectrum. A competent\n            spectrum management and monitoring system is necessary for\n            an expanding, modern telecommunications sector. Moreover, it\n            is highlighted that coordination of a regional project is\n            complex, and stretches very thinly both project management,\n            and supervision resources. Even with the best intentions,\n            there were delays, particularly in obtaining signatures from\n            the five countries on the two extensions of the closing\n            date. However, financing and retention of high caliber\n            technical advisor, critical in negotiations with dominant\n            operators, proved successful."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latin America and the Caribbean -

In 1998, the World Bank helped the OECS\n            countries set up a regional telecommunications authority,\n            which ultimately negotiated the terms for liberalization of\n            the eastern Caribbean's telecom market. So far, the\n            telecommunications project has reduced telephone and\n            internet charges by nearly half. Lower rates have helped to\n            stimulate new, more diverse businesses in these small economies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"R\u00e9duire les co\u00fbts de t\u00e9l\u00e9coms dans les Cara\u00efbes"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Reducing telecom costs in the\n            Caribbean : R\u00e9duire les co\u00fbts de t\u00e9l\u00e9coms dans les Cara\u00efbes"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2002/07/23825776/reducing-telecom-costs-caribbean-r\u00e9duire-les-co\u00fbts-de-t\u00e9l\u00e9coms-dans-les-cara\u00efbes","count":"OECS Countries","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to information, businesses, company,\n            economic development, monopoly, society, Telecom,\n            telecommunications, telecommunications authority,\n            Telecommunications Reform, telecommunications services,\n            teleconferencing, telephone, telephone system"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Technical Assistance Loan"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Financial and private sector development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"R\u00e9duire les co\u00fbts de t\u00e9l\u00e9coms dans les Cara\u00efbes"},"1":{"cdata!":"R\u00e9duire les co\u00fbts de t\u00e9l\u00e9coms dans les Cara\u00efbes"}},"topic":"Price Controls  m1326085 2107,Telecommunications Tariffs m1326459 2341,Telecommunications Law and Regulation\n            m1326415 289,Backbone Telecommunications Infrastructure\n            Development m1326454 2332,Price Subsidies m1326701 1623","projn":"6O-Oecs: Telecommunication Reform -- P035730","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Educational Technology and Distance Education,E-Business,Rural Communications,Telecommunications Infrastructure,Corporate Law","teratopic":"Education,Rural Development,Law and Development,Private Sector Development,Information and Communication Technologies","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150119130318"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Central government administration,Vocational training","theme":"Regulation and competition policy,Education for the knowledge economy,Infrastructure services for private sector development","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Education,Rural Development,Law and Development,Private Sector Development,Information and Communication Technologies","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Price Controls  m1326085 2107,Telecommunications Tariffs m1326459 2341,Telecommunications Law and Regulation\n            m1326415 289,Backbone Telecommunications Infrastructure\n            Development m1326454 2332,Price Subsidies m1326701 1623","owner":"Transport & ICT -
