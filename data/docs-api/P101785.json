Some lessons learned included: the\n            scope of the devastation caused by the tsunami, the size of\n            the reconstruction program and the specificities of the\n            historical institutional relationship between Aceh province\n            and the central government meant that achieving the right\n            implementation management for the recovery efforts was not a\n            given and that the reconstruction process will not be as\n            effective due to their weak capacity and the complexity of\n            the central government bureaucracy. Careful attention should\n            be provided to ensure the preparedness of local governments\n            to handle the assets, budgetary space for funding of\n            maintenance activities, existing capacity in infrastructure\n            management within local governments, and adequate status of\n            assets. The project is a successful example of stakeholder\n            participation and commitment, which led for instance to the\n            satisfactory design of the sub-projects priority list and\n            the support of the various authorities to facilitate and\n            safeguard project implementation.

- Infrastructure Reconstruction\n            Financing Facility for Aceh and North Sumatra Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objective of the Infrastructure\n            Reconstruction Financing Facility is to assist the province\n            of Aceh and 12 local governments in Aceh and Nias to\n            reconstruct/habilitate strategic infrastructure and extend\n            key infrastructure services of adequate quality standards\n            that meet the needs of communities where infrastructure was\n            damaged by the tsunami of 2004 and the subsequent\n            earthquake. The Project consists of 2 components. Component\n            1 is Financing of Infrastructure Reconstruction and\n            Rehabilitation Investments which will finance individual\n            infrastructure reconstruction subprojects in 12 local\n            governments - 9 of which are benefiting from the\n            Infrastructure Reconstruction Enabling Program (IREP)\n            technical assistance, and 3 of which are receiving technical\n            advice from existing consulting arrangements, as well as\n            strategic investments at the provincial level. Each\n            individual infrastructure subproject will be co-financed by\n            the Bureau for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (BRR) for\n            Aceh and Nias and the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Aceh and\n            North Sumatra. This component will provide resources for\n            civil works and goods in subprojects in the following\n            sectors: roads, ports, water and sanitation, drainage, flood\n            control, coastal protection and restoration of major\n            irrigation canals. Component 2 is the Targeted Support to\n            Infrastructure Subproject Planning, Design, Supervision, and\n            Implementation Oversight which will provide technical\n            assistance (TA): (i) to Aceh Besar, Banda Aceh and Sabang\n            that are currently receiving TA from existing consulting\n            arrangements for subproject identification and design (till\n            January 2007) for the period January 2007 to January 2010.\n            This component aims at strengthening the ability of the Aceh\n            Besar, Banda Aceh and Sabang local governments to improve\n            the provision of infrastructure in their respective\n            jurisdictions by providing technical experts to assist them\n            in planning and subproject identification, subproject\n            design, document submission, procurement, safeguards\n            compliance, implementation, construction supervision, and\n            monitoring; (ii) to support performance and financial audit\n            (over and above external audit) of the project financial\n            statements; and (iii) to provide technical assistance for\n            transition to a post-BRR timeframe and institutional\n            arrangements beyond April 2009, including extension of TA\n            provided under IREP, and capacity building and\n            infrastructure asset maintenance programs for local and\n            provincial governments. In order to mitigate uncertainty in\n            the implementation of this project, a portion of the project\n            funds is not allocated to any specific component."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Infrastructure Reconstruction\n            Financing Facility for Aceh and North Sumatra Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Infrastructure\n            Reconstruction Financing Facility for Aceh and North Sumatra Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/01/7467649/indonesia-infrastructure-reconstruction-financing-facility-aceh-north-sumatra-project","projn":"ID-Aceh Infrastructure Reconstruction\n            Financing Facility (Irff) -- P101785","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Urban Slums Upgrading,Banks & Banking Reform,Urban Services to the Poor,Non Bank Financial Institutions,Transport Economics Policy & Planning","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Urban Development,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070319091022"},"subsc":"General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,Roads and highways,Ports, waterways and shipping","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Urban Development,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"Recipient Executed Activities","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ADB, assurance, audits, bottlenecks, bridge,\n            bridge repairs, capacity building, communities, district\n            governments, drainage, economic development, efficient\n            transport, environmental impacts, Financial Management,\n            Financing of Infrastructure, housing, Indigenous Peoples,\n            inflation, infrastructure development, infrastructure\n            planning, infrastructure projects, infrastructure services,\n            key performance indicators, Local Government, local\n            governments, monies, O&M, Pacific Region, Resettlement,\n            road, roads, sanitation, sewage, Technical Assistance,\n            transaction costs, transport, transport network, transport\n            sector, true, Urban Development, waste, water supply"}},"owner":"Urban Development Sector Unit (EASUR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF055080-FUND FOR ACEH AND NORTH SUMATRA\n            - APPRAISAL, SUPERVISION, COMPLETION,TF057657-INFRASTRUCTURE RECONSTRUCTION\n            FINANCING FACILITY PROJECT","repnb":"38460"},"7197222":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2006/11/7197222/indonesia-infrastructure-reconstruction-financing-facility-project-safeguards-diagnostic-review","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2006/11/7197222/indonesia-infrastructure-reconstruction-financing-facility-project-safeguards-diagnostic-review","new_url":"2006/11/7197222/indonesia-infrastructure-reconstruction-financing-facility-project-safeguards-diagnostic-review","disclosure_date":"2006-11-13T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2006-11-13T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2006-11-13T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/11/13/000112742_20061113160431/Rendered/INDEX/SR70IRFF1Safeguards0framework.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/11/13/000112742_20061113160431/Rendered/PDF/SR70IRFF1Safeguards0framework.pdf","datestored":"2006-11-13T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2006-11-13T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Infrastructure Reconstruction\n            Financing Facility Project :  safeguards diagnostic review"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This safeguards framework for the\n            Infrastructure Reconstruction Financing Facility Project in\n            Indonesia covers the Infrastructure Reconstruction Enabling\n            Program (IREP) and Infrastructure Reconstruction Financing\n            Facility (IRFF).
