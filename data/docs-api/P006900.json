This will be the first transportation loan to Costa\n            Rica by the Bank or IDA. The project objectives are to\n            provide adequate facilities for present and expected future\n            automobile traffic through extensive improvement works and\n            new highway construction works. The three components of the\n            project are: a) the improvement of 54 existing national and\n            regional roads totaling 640 km (about one-third of the\n            total), and the construction of 3 new roads totaling 31 km;\n            b) the purchase of mechanical equipment, spare parts, and\n            materials for highway construction and maintenance; and c)\n            the foreign exchange cost of surveying instruments,\n            engineering studies, and consulting services. The nature of\n            the highway improvement work varies somewhat in different\n            localities and terrain but consists mainly of improving\n            existing geometric alignment, widening and strengthening\n            existing road foundations and shoulders, widening or\n            re-building existing bridges, paving, and improving\n            drainage. The project may also include engineering studies\n            for potential future highway works not included in the\n            present project. This report finds that the project is\n            technically sound and the cost estimates are realistic. The\n            borrower is the Ministry of Public Works, and boasts sound\n            organization and competent, if inexperienced, staff.\n            Financing arrangements appear satisfactory. The project\n            provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan and IDA credit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Costa Rica - Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Costa Rica - Highway Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1961/10/1556153/costa-rica-highway-project","projn":"CR-Road Constrn & Maint -- P006900","subtopic":"Educational Technology and Distance Education,General Technology,Information and Records Management,Information Technology,Transport Security","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","teratopic":"Education,Transport,Information and Communication Technologies","count":"Costa Rica","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!545133"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!545133"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!545133"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101903282523"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education,Transport,Information and Communication Technologies","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"HTML,HTTP,Port,server,URL"},"1":{"cdata!":"HTML,HTTP,Port,server,URL"}},"owner":"Central America Countries CMU (LCC2C)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"repnb":"PID10"},"17700764":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1961/10/17700764/costa-rica-highway-project-credit-0010-credit-agreement-conformed","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1961/10/17700764/costa-rica-highway-project-credit-0010-credit-agreement-conformed","new_url":"1961/10/17700764/costa-rica-highway-project-credit-0010-credit-agreement-conformed","disclosure_date":"2013-05-11T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2013-05-11T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2013-05-11T00:00:00Z","docm_id":"090224b081ba3b0d","chronical_docm_id":"090224b081ba3b0d","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/LCR/2013/05/11/090224b081ba3b0d/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/Costa0Rica000H0greement000Conformed.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/LCR/2013/05/11/090224b081ba3b0d/1_0/Rendered/PDF/Costa0Rica000H0greement000Conformed.pdf","docdt":"1961-10-13T23:03:15Z","datestored":"2013-05-11T00:00:00Z","docna":{"cdata!":"Costa Rica -

The project objectives are to provide adequate\n            facilities for present and expected future automobile\n            traffic through extensive improvement works and new highway\n            construction works. The three components of the project are:\n            a) the improvement of 54 existing national and regional\n            roads totaling 640 km (about one-third of the total), and\n            the construction of 3 new roads totaling 31 km; b) the\n            purchase of mechanical equipment, spare parts, and materials\n            for highway construction and maintenance; and c) the foreign\n            exchange cost of surveying instruments, engineering studies,\n            and consulting services. The nature of the highway\n            improvement work varies somewhat in different localities and\n            terrain but consists mainly of improving existing geometric\n            alignment, widening and strengthening existing road\n            foundations and shoulders, widening or re-building existing\n            bridges, paving, and improving drainage. The project may\n            also include engineering studies for potential future\n            highway works not included in the present project. This\n            report finds that the project is technically sound and the\n            cost estimates are realistic. The borrower is the Ministry\n            of Public Works, and boasts sound organization and\n            competent, if inexperienced, staff. Financing arrangements\n            appear satisfactory. The project provides a suitable basis\n            for a Bank loan and IDA credit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Costa Rica - Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Costa Rica - Highway
