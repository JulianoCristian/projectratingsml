Some lessons learned included: the\n            Project's demand-drivenness improves local governance\n            by giving poor rural communities a unique set of experiences\n            involving collective action, priority-setting,\n            decision-making, and investment financial management,\n            operation and maintenance. Social capital under this and\n            similar projects is both a benefit in its own right and an\n            element in the success of participatory rural poverty\n            reduction. By working with existing CMDRSs (Conselho\n            Municipal de Desenvolvimento Rural Sustentavel - Sustainable\n            Rural Development Municipal Council) in the project area and\n            successfully increasing their representation among potential\n            project beneficiaries, both the quality and targeting of\n            public resources (project and non-project) improved, while\n            leveraging complementary funding and deepening the\n            investment stock needed for faster rural poverty reduction.\n            Experience in Minas Gerais and elsewhere shows unequivocally\n            that demand-driven mechanisms not only enable women to\n            access the benefits of community investments, but provide\n            opportunities for women through the community associations.\n            The project demonstrated, albeit on a small scale, that\n            participatory, demand-driven mechanisms are cultural\n            practices of these groups and that they can manage the\n            subproject participatory mechanisms, effectively."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Rural Poverty Reduction Project -\n            Minas
