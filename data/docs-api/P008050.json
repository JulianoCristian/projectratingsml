Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) Borrower commitment is\n            critical to the success of a program; (ii) design and\n            implementation of a reform program is more effective when\n            the relevant legislation supporting the reforms has been\n            enacted; and (iii) a stable macroeconomic environment is a\n            necessary condition for
