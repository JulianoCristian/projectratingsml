Some\n            lessons learned included: 1) Project appraisals should be\n            more pro-active in anticipating the need for bridging\n            advisory services to the Project Support Units; 2) It might\n            be recommendable to hold very intensive consultations\n            between the Bank team (e.g., appraisal team), the Executing\n            Agency, and the implementing agency as early as possible; 3)\n            The implementing agencies should ensure that they only\n            appoint staff who are professionally qualified for, and\n            sufficiently experienced in, procurement using World Bank\n            procurement guidelines and standard procurement techniques\n            to the tender committees; 4) A major problem for project\n            implementation was the very slow pace of acquiring the\n            necessary political action toward the establishment of the\n            new waste management organizations, not to speak of their\n            longer-term maintenance; 5) Technical assistance (TA) for\n            the support of political processes should be provided in a\n            more suitable modality; and 6) It became obvious that some\n            of the implementing agencies were not familiar with the\n            implementation of sub-projects for the purpose of loan\n            preparation, so that the final result of implementation was\n            a series of reports but not a proposal for implementation in APL2."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -

drawing up\n            environmental strategies for the provinces West Java and\n            Jakarta Metro Areas, and then on drawing up local\n            environmental strategies for the eight PLG. 2) The solid\n            waste management component, consisting of seven TAs,\n            includes the establishment of waste management corporations\n            in Jabotabek and Greater Bandung,

focuses on support mechanism for\n            small and medium industries, soybean processing industry,\n            community environment facility. 4) The composting support\n            component,

It is\n            recommended that environmental monitoring plans be included\n            in contract specifications, and that an Environmental\n            Management Plan include: relevant descriptions of the\n            environmental context of proposed sites; a planning\n            analysis; and, a descriptive plan for community\n            consultations, including stakeholders arrangements.

The input of a social\n            planner/sociologist/institutional specialist is suggested to\n            guide communal participation. Construction of domestic, or\n            industrial facilities, with significant solid waste\n            discharges, will require wastewater treatment.
