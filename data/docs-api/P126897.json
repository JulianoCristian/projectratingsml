One lesson is that even in a\n            politically uncertain environment a well-designed and\n            closely supervised operation can deliver results. A second\n            lesson is that in a fragile country facing deep structural\n            reforms, insufficient political attention might derail the\n            entire reform program. This can be illustrated by how the\n            casual introduction to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n            of a proposal to create a revenue authority, contributed to\n            a liquidity crisis late in 2012. Inspired by similar\n            propositions in Burundi and Rwanda, the Togolese authorities\n            decided in early 2012 to work towards the introduction of a\n            revenue authority (OTR) by end 2012. The third lesson is\n            that in a fragile country a political economy analysis\n            should guide the team in selecting prior actions and\n            indicators. Finally, a fourth lesson is that ownership\n            requires political will as well as buy-in from technical\n            staff. The technical level there was (and still is)\n            considerable appetite to implement the reform program.\n            Still, these same reformists demonstrated limited\n            pro-activeness when it came to solving problems. This may be\n            a capacity problem, but is more likely to be the long term\n            effect from years of economic and financial mismanagement\n            during which the ability to maintain a position depended on\n            passive obedience to higher authorities. To change this,\n            clear leadership from the political top is needed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Togo - Fifth Economic Governance and\n            Recovery Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Togo - Fifth Economic Governance\n            and Recovery Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2013/06/17991187/togo-fifth-economic-governance-recovery-credit-project","projn":"TG-Economic Recovery & Gov.
