Implementation of the overall\n            Program, in particular the legal and organizational\n            restructuring to split a monolithic Railways into a number\n            of subsidiaries and the parent company, was highly\n            satisfactory. A protracted period of project preparation\n            time can be worthwhile when: (1) it enables the negotiations\n            necessary to build political will for a difficult social\n            change, (2) it keeps dialogue open while events bring more\n            clarity and pressure on the decision makers. Even\n            substantial restructuring successes can fail to achieve\n            financial goals when the overall business environment\n            evolves negatively. Neither PKP nor Agency for Retraining\n            and Reemployment ( KAAZ) really saw World Bank social\n            safeguards as part of their core activity and to undertake\n            the post-layoff social monitoring. The European Bank for\n            Reconstruction and Development loan did not include a social\n            monitoring component and started one year ahead of the Bank\n            loan. An explicit project performance indicator should have\n            been included related to the monitoring and evaluation of\n            the labor redundancy activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland -
