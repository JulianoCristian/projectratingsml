Some lessons learned\n            included: ASPOP showed that the introduction of competitive\n            funding mechanisms to support agricultural research can work\n            even in a poor country such as Chad. The competitive funding\n            mechanisms introduced under the project produced better\n            research proposals and led to more careful screening of\n            proposals for eventual financing based on broadly approved\n            criteria that took into account the actual and current needs\n            of the producers. The approach opened researchers' eyes\n            to the demands of the marketplace and its priorities, as\n            well as to means of identifying sources of funds for\n            research. Researchers and research institutions came\n            together to prepare joint proposals, engage in collaborative\n            research, and participate in training programs and\n            workshops. The collaborative review and monitoring process\n            led to better results and papers, some of which were\n            published. In a few cases, educational degrees were\n            upgraded. Early efforts to publicize the project were very\n            successful. Hundreds of rural communities were informed\n            about the potential economic, social, and environmental\n            benefits of the project and were led to believe that they\n            stood a good chance of securing financing to implement\n            subprojects. Later when it proved impossible to fund all of\n            the subprojects that had been approved, frustration erupted\n            among those who had prepared subprojects, especially when\n            beneficiaries had already mobilized their own contribution\n            and deposited it into a specially created bank account. This\n            created a negative legacy that an eventual follow-on\n            operation will have to overcome."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad - Agricultural Services and Producer\n

The project finances demand-driven\n            productive investments proposed by producer organizations\n            and the technical assistance required for proper\n            implementation, through a grant system with an up-front\n            farmers' contribution of at least 20% of subproject\n            cost as defined in the Project Implementation Manual, and\n            (b) competitive research as demand-driven subprojects to\n            support short-term (two to three years) applied research\n            aimed at finding solutions to constraints on the productive\n            investment subprojects, both cotton and non-cotton-related.\n            The project complements support from the French Cooperation\n            Agency and ADB. It finances small equipment, inputs,\n            operational costs for the implementation of subprojects,\n            training and study tours, and activities that support\n            effective development of linkages between small farmers and\n            agribusiness.

The component finances the small works and\n            equipment required to establish a National Project\n            Coordination and Management Unit (NPCMU) and six\n            Inter-Regional Coordination and Management Units-IRPCMUs\n            within the Ministry of Agriculture.
