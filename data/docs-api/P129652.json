Some lessons learned included: reform\n            processes require a long-term commitment and have a steep\n            learning curve, especially at their onset. The experience of\n            the State of Sergipe indicates that there is no unique\n            template of processes and institutions for a successful\n            management model. Actions that depend on the coordination\n            with other levels of the government require special\n            attention.
