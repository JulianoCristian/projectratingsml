Key lessons suggest\n            that based on the changing process the country was\n            undergoing, the appraisal team correctly understood, and\n            built flexibility into the project design. Interestingly,\n            the reform agenda provided the framework for a sustained\n            dialogue, which benefited from the project design\n            flexibility, allowing adjustments, particularly for the\n            financial sector reform, and, for bank privatization,\n            adjusting interest rate mechanisms, and eligibility criteria\n            under the line of credit. Moreover, the financial sector,\n            and reform agendas succeeded because of strong commitments\n            to reform by the Government, and the Central Bank, and,\n            because the Central Bank understood the importance to\n            introduce changes in monetary policy, to create competencies\n            capable of implementing such changes, as well as halting the\n            deterioration of the financial sector, through interventions\n            in two state-owned banks. The problems posed by weak\n            performances of state-owned banks during the 80s and early\n            90s, were correctly understood by the Government, and by the\n            technical staff of the banks under privatization, who\n            enabled reforms based on a technically solid approach,\n            supported by key stakeholders, while, the divestiture\n            process succeeded because of such technical input, and of\n            adequate allocation of redundant staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Financial Sector and Private\n            Enterprise
