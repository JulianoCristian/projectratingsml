The Region's immense concentration of rural\n            poor and persistent under-development result from\n            geographic, economic and political factors evidenced in the\n            harsh climate and poor natural resource base, inequitable\n            land tenure and distribution, a traditional and\n            clientilistic culture, illiteracy and lack of basic\n            infrastructure and services. The Bank has financed rural\n            development in the Brazilian Northeast since the 1970s. The\n            Northeast Rural Development Program (NRDP) -- of which\n            projects in the States of Sergipe, Rio Grande do Norte,\n            Bahia and Ceara are reviewed in this report -- sought to\n            alleviate rural poverty by improving the productivity and\n            incomes of small farmers. The Program was a component of a\n            larger package of Federally-funded sectoral programs to\n            improve regional socio-economic conditions, and was\n            consistent with government's new rural development\n            strategy for the Northeast initiated in 1982. The NRDP\n            acknowledged that in aggregate, the special programs,\n            sectoral projects and Federal irrigation projects until that\n            time, had not reduced rural poverty. The initial objectives\n            of the NRDP through its component state projects were to:\n            (i) increase regional agricultural production and\n            productivity; (ii) generate employment for low-income farm\n            families; (iii) increase the states' capacity to\n            provide efficient agricultural services to small farmers;\n            and (iv) promote water resource development and technology\n            generation and diffusion to reduce small farmers'\n            vulnerability to drought."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Northeast Rural Development Program\n            - Sergipe, Rio Grande do Norte, Bahia, and Ceara Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Northeast Rural\n            Development Program - Sergipe, Rio Grande do Norte, Bahia,\n            and Ceara Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/12/727170/brazil-northeast-rural-development-program-sergipe-rio-grande-norte-bahia-ceara-projects","projn":"BR-Nrdp Sergipe -- P006345,BR-Nrdp Bahia -- P006351,BR-Nrdp Ceara -- P006420,BR-Nrdp Rio Gra.
