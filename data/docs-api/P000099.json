Some objectives were\n            either not achieved or only partially achieved, such as\n            strengthening the capacity of the district technical staff\n            to assist producers, training of the remaining personnel,\n            contributing to the transfer of knowledge to and building\n            the capacity of the farmers' groups and organizations,\n            and helping redundant personnel to find new employment.\n            Project sustainability is unlikely, and both performances of\n            the Bank and the Borrower are rated overall unsatisfactory.\n            the overall outcome of the Community-Based Food Security\n            Project (PILSA) is rated satisfactory, with sustainability\n            rated likely. Bank performance and that of the Borrower are\n            rated overall satisfactory. Lastly, the assessment rates the\n            overall outcome of the Second Rural Savings and Loans\n            Cooperatives Rehabilitation (Rural Credit II) as\n            unsatisfactory; the project was undermined by the severe\n            problems with the Federation of Rural Savings and Loans\n            Cooperatives, including insufficient training at the local\n            level, defaulted loans owing to the lack of due diligence,\n            and inadequate records on repayment schedules, among other\n            problems. sustainability is unlikely Both the Bank and the\n            Borrower's performances are rated unsatisfactory.\n            Experience with this project confirms a number of OED\n            lessons: 1) A feasible plan (both functional and financial)\n            that can be fully implemented is essential when changing the\n            institutiona structure of a major government organization\n            such as the Ministry of Agriculture. The plan must be\n            flexible and capable of being changed as it is being\n            implemented, and periodically monitored so that management\n            can learn what is working and what parts need to be altered\n            during the implementation phase. 2) A decentralized and\n            demand-driven system is a viable approach to the successful\n            delivery of food security and nurition programs. The PILSA\n            project was successful because each community was able to\n            tailor the specific program delivery to its own needs, and\n            because of the expertise of both international and local\n            nongovernmental organizations to implement micro-projects\n            and deliver the nutrition programs. Local NGOs were able to\n            identify with local populations. This occurred as a result\n            of the decentralized implementation of PILSA coupled with\n            the strong leadership of the implementing agencies and their\n            firm commitment to the success of the project. 3) The\n            sustainable provision of rural credit requires appropriate\n            institutional development and training. If a good monitoring\n            and evaluation system had been present in the FECECAM\n            network and more attention given to appropriate training,\n            FECECAM would not be facing such an acute problem with arrears."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin -

The overall sustainability rating of\n            the project is uncertain because of the numerous risk\n            factors still existing and because project activities cannot\n            be expanded without a new project. However, there are\n            positive factors for sustainability: The Government is\n            systematically following the market-oriented policies put in\n            place nearly a decade ago. These policies have removed most\n            of the disincentives to increasing agricultural production,\n            and emphasized greater transparency, accountability, and\n            private-sector involvement in development of the rural\n            sector. The overall performances by the World Bank and the\n            Borrower were both rated satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            included the following: a pilot project will not give all\n            the lessons needed and the design of the first follow-on\n            must be flexible enough to allow for corrective actions.\n            Linking of the nutrition and micro-project components and a\n            community approach was essential for the success of this\n            project. Implementation of food security and other programs\n            using micro-projects can be trusted to local nongovernmental\n            organizations, but it is possible only if the government has\n            a positive attitude toward NGOs and allows that borrowed\n            funds can be disbursed for their programs. Strict selection\n            criteria needs to be applied when admitting NGOs into the\n            program. Early and firm action must be taken when NGOs are\n            failing or are misusing financing opportunities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Community-Based Food Security

The\n            project will focus on poverty alleviation in pre-identified\n            problem-areas, however, the situation would be regularly\n            monitored and the scope of the project adapted.

The approach will build upon specific\n            situations and constraints, aiming at their solution through\n            the empowerment of local communities, with particular\n            emphasis on women groups.
