The Manpower and Education Development\n            Project had four objectives: (a) To improve the coordination\n            of vocational training with labor market patterns; (b) To\n            increase access to primary education; (c) To upgrade the\n            relevance and quality of education at the primary and lower\n            secondary levels; and (d) To improve the management capacity\n            of the Ministry of National Education (MEN) while reducing\n            costs and better allocating resources. Overall project\n            outcome was partially satisfactory. With the exception of\n            the vocational training component, the Bank's\n            performance during the identification and preparation phase\n            was generally satisfactory. Overall, the Borrower's\n            performance was satisfactory during project preparation. The\n            Borrower, however, could have been more realistic and\n            functional in its approach to improving the coordination of\n            vocational training. Lessons learned from the project are:\n            (a) Planning, coordination and monitoring mechanisms should\n            be well developed priorto project-start up; (b) Sequencing\n            core training and project execution is essential for\n            capacity building and successful project implementation; (c)\n            Institutional strengthening occurs only with strong\n            government commitment and firm political decision making;\n            (d) Stakeholder participation in decision-making is\n            essential for fostering ownership of project activities and\n            outcomes; and (e) Allocation of Bank resources for\n            supervision should consider project scope and complexity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Djibouti - Manpower and Education\n
