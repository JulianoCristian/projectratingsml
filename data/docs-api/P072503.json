Some\n            lessons learned included: using investment lending in tandem\n            with budget support to implement difficult reforms may be\n            more effective than each instrument alone. The project under\n            review experienced that reforms are extremely difficult to\n            implement within a sector as strategic and as politically\n            sensitive as cotton. Even if it is clearly stated initially,\n            Government commitment can hardly be taken for granted on a\n            long period of time, unless irreversible steps are taken at\n            the beginning of the reform process, which was not the case\n            in the Benin reform process. The privatization of National\n            Company for agricultural production was finally completed\n            under joint support of specific investment lending and\n            budget support. Budget support can signal and facilitate\n            commitment to reforms. Strong sector teams from the\n            investment side are, however, needed to lead an effective\n            policy dialogue. Institutional development and structural\n            reforms should be outward looking and keep an eye on\n            evolving global developments. The project under review and\n            the underlying cotton sector reform were affected by\n            decisions of key stakeholders driven by internal struggles\n            and the political economy of the national cotton sector.\n            Evidence based analysis highlighting the performance of\n            alternative approaches followed in the region could have\n            improved decision making. The Bank is well suited to provide\n            such kind of input as shown by the recently completed\n            comparative analysis of Organization and Performance of\n            African Cotton Sectors (World Bank 2008). The project was\n            further affected by developments on international commodity\n            and financial markets. Designs need to be forward looking,\n            anticipate such external effects and be flexible enough to adapt."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Cotton Sector Reform

Following a\n            review of the country's environmental regulatory\n            framework, the EA points at the weak environmental\n            performance of cotton ginneries, which despite environmental\n            legislation, disregard the current regulatory framework.\n            Pollution control measures are inefficient, conducive to\n            detrimental socioeconomic consequences: vegetative\n            degradation, air pollution, inefficient drainage, and\n            contaminated effluents, in addition to oil spills, and noise\n            disturbances. Measures to mitigate adversity call for the\n            creation of an environmental management committee, to\n            establish, and validate the cotton ginneries environmental\n            plan of action, set in place environmental units, and\n            formulate pilot pollution control programs. The cotton\n            ginneries at Savalou, and Bohicon should be permanently\n            closed, proposing to transform Savalou into a museum, and,\n            Bohicon, into a cotton gin training school, following the\n            building's restoration. Modification of chimneys,\n            drainage, and canalization, as well as soundproof works, and\n            appropriate effluents discharge, should be implemented at\n            existing cotton ginneries, to reduce emissions, prevent\n            flooding, and reduce noise disturbances from power engines.\n            Capacity building, and training should be provided to\n            enforce environmental measures, equipment should be\n            adequately maintained, and public health surveillance ensured."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Projet de Reformes du Secteur\n            Cotonnier : etude d'impact environnementale"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"B\u00e9nin \u2013 Projet de r\u00e9formes du\n            secteur cotonnier : \u00e9tude d\u2019impact environnementale"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/03/1346374/benin-projet-de-reformes-du-secteur-cotonnier-etude-dimpact-environnementale","projn":"BJ-Cotton Sector Reform Project -- P072503","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Benin","authors":{"authr":"Kanbo, Marc Z., Ingenieur Consultant"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01062104023861"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Agro-industry,Agro-industry, marketing, and trade,Agricultural extension and research,Central government administration,Crops","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental assessment;
