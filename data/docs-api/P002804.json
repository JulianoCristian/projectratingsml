the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was substantial, and the\n            Bank and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The\n            lessons learned indicate that consensus needs to be reached\n            on how research programs should be evaluated, and these\n            goals need to be properly reflected in project objectives.\n            Key performance indicators should be clearly defined during\n            project preparation in order to guide the monitoring and\n            evaluation system. Public support for research undertaken by\n            non-public institutions is appropriate and in some cases\n            necessary. Decentralization of management of research to the\n            zones can result in improved performance and impact, but the\n            decentralization must be coherent, including financial\n            management and procurement, as well as technical decisions.\n            Farmers enjoy and benefit from their involvement in applied\n            research, and mechanisms to ensure greater farmer control\n            over research resource allocation decisions improves\n            research effectiveness. The research system must maintain a\n            critical mass of skilled staff, and this may require\n            modifications in standards of remuneration. There is a need\n            to look at agricultural research and extension as one\n            package for an effective dissemination and adoption of\n            improved agricultural technologies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania -

First,\n            strengthening agricultural research system will bring about\n            more effective and efficient agricultural research\n            institutions, and an effective arrangement for donor\n            coordination and for coordinating regional and other\n            collaborative research programs.  Second, organization and\n            management of agricultural research will provide\n            demand-driven, client oriented research, efforts to\n            introduce participatory techniques, and guidelines for\n            small-farmer oriented and gender-sensitive research.
