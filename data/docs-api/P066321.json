The project followed on the\n            earlier PAC (Second Basic Health Care Project - Programa de\n            Ampliacion de Cobertura) that had been rated highly\n            satisfactory for outcome, yet the Government's health\n            reform resulted in a major redirection in its sectoral\n            priorities. The pressure to move towards loan approval,\n            especially in the immediate aftermath of a change in\n            Government administration, may lead to supporting a project\n            that no longer responds to the new administration's\n            priorities. Financing large operations in federal states\n            pose unique challenges, especially given the different\n            institutional capacities and social realities of the various\n            federal entities. Targets for activities addressing\n            institutional capacity strengthening, for example, should be\n            conservative to take into account the challenges of working\n            with various levels of government with a wide range of\n            capabilities. In highly decentralized systems, successful\n            implementation of comprehensive health sector reforms hinges\n            on the effective use of incentive and support systems and,\n            yet, tends to require ample time (often up to two decades).\n            Projects should also have in place agreed, reliable and\n            efficient information systems that support the\n            project's monitoring and evaluation, from the start of\n            implementation. The adequacy of these systems should be\n            reviewed periodically by the Bank in the course of routine supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Third Basic Health Care

In 2002, the Government of Mexico\n            designed and initiated an ambitious sector reform agenda\n            that was subsequently adopted by all States. The\n            reform's key objective is to provide social protection\n            in health for the non-formally employed. With the launch of\n            the reform agenda, the original Project objectives became\n            too narrow or irrelevant and Project implementation\n            experienced substantial delays. The proposed changes align\n            the Project with the sector reform agenda and include\n            comprehensive changes to the Project's Development\n            Objectives, components, activities and outputs. The proposed\n            restructuring also includes changes to the Project's\n            fiduciary arrangements. These changes would permit the\n            Government to transfer funds to States that would execute\n            Project activities under unified procurement norms (SWAp\n            arrangements). Transfers would be monitored under a separate\n            disbursement category. As the majority of project activities\n            would be executed under the SWAP arrangements, the\n            restructuring entails a reallocation of approximately $60\n            million to the disbursement category of transfers. The\n            reallocation of undisbursed loan amounts across disbursement\n            categories with varying Bank financing shares would result\n            in a reduction of Government counterpart fund requirements\n            and the Project size of approximately $33 million or 7\n            percent of the original Project size."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -

A\n            Mexican government initiative, the expansion of basic health\n            services program, has sought to reach these people. The\n            program is backed by a 660 million dollars loan from the\n            World Bank. An unprecedented collaboration between the\n            federal and local governments created hundreds of mobile\n            health units that deliver a basic health care package\n            including: basic sanitation, diarrhea control, family\n            planning, prevention and treatment of parasitic diseases,\n            health and nutrition information, immunizations, child\n            delivery, and prevention and control of tuberculosis and\n            cervical cancer."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Le red\u00e9ploiement des soins de sant\u00e9 au Mexique"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Expanding health care in Mexico :\n            Le red\u00e9ploiement des soins de sant\u00e9 au Mexique"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2002/07/23808746/expanding-health-care-mexico-le-red\u00e9ploiement-des-soins-de-sant\u00e9-au-mexique","count":"Mexico","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Basic Health, basic health care, Basic\n            Health Services, cervical cancer, child delivery, diarrhea,\n            family planning, Health Care, health services, mobile health\n            units, nutrition, parasitic diseases, public health, public\n            health services, treatment, tuberculosis"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan"}},"majtheme":"Social dev/gender/inclusion,Rural development,Public sector governance,Human development,Urban development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Le red\u00e9ploiement des soins de sant\u00e9 au Mexique"},"1":{"cdata!":"Le red\u00e9ploiement des soins de sant\u00e9 au Mexique"}},"topic":"Health Care Performance Indicators\n            m1327298 1321,Health Equity and Access m1326151 1288,Health Facility Management m1326575 1397,Health Care Resource Allocation m1326825 628,Health Economics and Finance m1326577 625","projn":"MX-Iii Basic Health Care Project -- P066321,MX-Basic Health II -- P007689","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Health Economics & Finance,Disease Control & Prevention,Gender and Health,Health Systems Development & Reform,Health Monitoring & Evaluation","teratopic":"Gender,Health, Nutrition and Population","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150116134151"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"}},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Central government administration,Health,Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Health","theme":"Health system performance,Rural services and infrastructure,Urban services and housing for the poor,Indigenous peoples,Decentralization,Health system performance,Participation and civic engagement,Rural services and infrastructure,Decentralization,Administrative and civil service reform","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Gender,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Health Care Performance Indicators\n            m1327298 1321,Health Equity and Access m1326151 1288,Health Facility Management m1326575 1397,Health Care Resource Allocation m1326825 628,Health Economics and Finance m1326577 625","owner":"Health, Nutr & Population -
