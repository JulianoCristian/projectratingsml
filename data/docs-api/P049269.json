The overall\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower are\n            evaluated as satisfactory. Key lessons learned and\n            recommendations are as follows: 1) Self-targeted public\n            works programs can effectively direct the majority of cash\n            transfers to the poor, provided the wage rate is set no\n            higher than the ruling market wage for unskilled labor.\n            Setting the wage rate at this level also minimizes perverse\n            incentives by ensuring that the program does not attract\n            employed individuals. 2) Close monitoring is necessary\n            during project execution to ensure that the targeting is\n            working effectively and to be able to identify problems in\n            the project cycle or poor performance in some localities. 3)\n            The cost effectiveness of workfare programs like TRABAJAR\n            depends in large part on the value of the assets created\n            through the subprojects. Effective subproject evaluation,\n            monitoring and supervision are  critical to ensuring that\n            the subprojects produce benefits for poor communities that\n            go beyond temporary income transfers to unemployed members.\n            With respect to evaluation, visiting the site of the\n            proposed subproject prior to the approval decision is an\n            important instrument to ensure that subprojects are\n            appropriate and of high quality. After project approval,\n            effective supervision monitoring--including appropriate\n            on-site visits--is essential to ensure the high quality of\n            works and their timely completion 4) Rigorous, high-quality\n            evaluations can be successfully carried out with government\n            counterparts at a reasonable cost, if use can be made of\n            existing survey instruments, and can be effective in\n            building capacity. 5) Governments may not make use of\n            effective counter-cyclical instruments because of a\n            preference for financing other programs or because of\n            extremely tight fiscal constraints. It is recommended to\n            raise this issue at higher levels, for example the Ministry\n            of Economy and Production, to ensure consideration of this\n            issue at the highest levels. The issue should also be raised\n            as part of the overall country dialogue."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Third Social Protection Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina -
