The project\n            is located in the States of Kedah and Perlis in the\n            northwest of Peninsular Malaysia. The area is the\n            traditional rice bowl of Malaysia. Farms average 1.6 ha in\n            size and there is a high degree of tenancy. The primary\n            objective of the project was to achieve double cropping of\n            paddy in the area. There was little attention, at appraisal\n            or subsequently, to yields or alternative crops. Physical\n            construction of the project was completed six months behind\n            schedule and the first irrigation water was delivered in the\n            off-season of 1970. Three extensions of the closing date\n            were necessary to allow certain repair and improvement works\n            to be completed and for the loan to be fully disbursed. The\n            improvement works included pilot projects for water\n            distribution at the farm level. Even though the Muda Project\n            has fulfilled its original goals, there is still\n            considerable scope for further development. Proposals for\n            on-farm development, that is, the provision of ditches,\n            drain, and roads to serve individual farms have been under\n            investigation for some years. The project management has\n            recently embarked on a new systematic program of pilot\n            projects which, if properly directed and monitored, will\n            determine design standards, test the acceptability of the\n            works to the farmers and establish the feasibility of\n            project-scale development. If large-scale investment is\n            recommended, it could also include any necessary repairs to\n            the Muda and Pedu dams and possibly an expansion of the\n            irrigated area. This project appears to have high priority."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malaysia - Muda River Irrigation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malaysia - Muda River Irrigation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1975/06/1560051/malaysia-muda-river-irrigation-project","projn":"MY-Muda Irrigation -- P004217","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Economic Theory & Research,Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"Malaysia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101901343810"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            engineering,agricultural extension,agricultural\n            information,Agricultural Research,Agriculture,alternative\n            crops,balance of payments,chemical\n            inputs,cooperatives,coupons,crop,crop\n            production,Cropping,Cropping\n            intensity,Dam,deflators,Development Research,double\n            cropping,Drainage,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic growth,Economic\n            Impact,economic rate of return,equilibrium,exchange\n            rate,Exchange rates,extension services,FAO,FARM,farm\n            employment,FARM INCOME,farm\n            incomes,farmer,Farmers,farming,Farms,feasibility\n            studies,fertilizer,Field work,fish,geology,high-yielding\n            varieties,home economics,imports,income\n            distribution,inflation,insurance,interest\n            rate,irri,Irrigation,irrigation systems,land use,land use\n            planning,landless laborers,market prices,Marketing,national\n            income,opportunity cost,Paddy,plant protection,private\n            mills,produce,production costs,Production of paddy,Rice,Rice\n            Breeding,rice production,Rural\n            Development,seeds,Soils,sugar,sugarcane,United Nations,Wage\n            rates,Water use efficiency,weed growth,yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            engineering,agricultural extension,agricultural\n            information,Agricultural Research,Agriculture,alternative\n            crops,balance of payments,chemical\n            inputs,cooperatives,coupons,crop,crop\n            production,Cropping,Cropping\n            intensity,Dam,deflators,Development Research,double\n            cropping,Drainage,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic growth,Economic\n            Impact,economic rate of return,equilibrium,exchange\n            rate,Exchange rates,extension services,FAO,FARM,farm\n            employment,FARM INCOME,farm\n            incomes,farmer,Farmers,farming,Farms,feasibility\n            studies,fertilizer,Field work,fish,geology,high-yielding\n            varieties,home economics,imports,income\n            distribution,inflation,insurance,interest\n            rate,irri,Irrigation,irrigation systems,land use,land use\n            planning,landless laborers,market prices,Marketing,national\n            income,opportunity cost,Paddy,plant protection,private\n            mills,produce,production costs,Production of paddy,Rice,Rice\n            Breeding,rice production,Rural\n            Development,seeds,Soils,sugar,sugarcane,United Nations,Wage\n            rates,Water use efficiency,weed growth,yields"}},"owner":"SE Asia & Mongolia Country Unit (EACSM)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"795"},"1556811":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1965/11/1556811/malaysia-muda-river-irrigation-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1965/11/1556811/malaysia-muda-river-irrigation-project","new_url":"1965/11/1556811/malaysia-muda-river-irrigation-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/07/02/000178830_98101902513027/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/07/02/000178830_98101902513027/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","loan_no":"0434","docdt":"1965-11-30T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2002-07-02T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Malaysia -

About half of this area\n            is at present served by an irrigation system, which,\n            however, supplies water for a single crop of paddy; the rest\n            of the acreage is entirely dependent on the monsoon. The\n            project is designed, on full development, to produce an\n            increase in net farm benefits amounting to US$30 million per\n            year. The rate of return to the economy is estimated to be\n            10 percent per annum.
