In addition,\n            complementary investments to technology development should\n            be ensured in the project design, as well as a decentralized\n            rural development management, and a robust infrastructure.\n            The government needs to ensure the adequate rapport between\n            the public sector, and donor agencies, to attain\n            complementary arrangements, rather than duplication among\n            agencies. This rapport would also facilitate a focused\n            allocation of limited public funds, to priority\n            interventions for rural development.
