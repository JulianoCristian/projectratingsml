Lessons learned included: 1)\n            Provincial policy development operations such as\n            Catamarca's Provincial Reform Loan (PRL) are only\n            appropriate under stable macroeconomic conditions; 2) Under\n            stable macroeconomic conditions, policy-based operations\n            supporting a well-defined set of reforms can be effective\n            tools in promoting structural adjustment at the sub-national\n            level; 3) Provincial operations can be effective complements\n            of sector reforms and operations at the national level; 4)\n            For reforms to be successful, they have to follow the right\n            sequence, take into consideration interrelationship of\n            needed reforms, and be supported by a sound incentive\n            system; 5) For provinces to be fiscally responsible over the\n            long term, a consistent system of incentives must be in\n            place at the national level; 6)  The Bank's continuous\n            engagement during critical periods can help sustain ongoing\n            reforms and protect previous achievements; 7) Within a\n            difficult lending and operational environment, focusing on\n            the consolidation of more mature reforms appears to have\n            been an effective strategy; 8) The success of SAL loans\n            depends on a combination of factors, the most important of\n            which is strong political support; 9) Loan conditionality\n            should focus on results, going beyond the enactment of\n            legislation or executive decrees; 10) Overly complex\n            operations with a large number of conditionalities that lack\n            a clear hierarchy are difficult to implement and supervise;\n            11) Cross-sector operations at the provincial level require\n            strong coordination during both preparation and\n            implementation; and 12) Key impact and monitoring indicators\n            have to be developed during appraisal, including baselines\n            and targets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -

Catamarca was selected to participate in the\n            program, because of its reformist record since 1995, its\n            pressing needs to enhance the efficiency, and quality of\n            social sector spending, and the strong demonstration effect\n            it would have on other provinces, given its weak record on\n            social, and economic indicators. The project will support\n            fiscal adjustment, including structural reform in the social\n            sectors, based on the design of the Second Provincial Reform\n            Loan. Within the reform program to be supported, the health\n            component has the specific goal of reaching the poor,\n            providing basic health coverage to non-insured indigent\n            populations. Similarly, the education component seeks to\n            redirect spending, towards schools in poor neighborhoods,\n            and provide special retention programs, to reduce drop-out\n            rates among the poorest children. The single currency loan\n            will be disbursed in three tranches, between FY2001-2003."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Catamarca Provincial Reform\n            Adjustment Loan
