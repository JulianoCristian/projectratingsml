Project seeks to improve livelihood security, and achieve a\n            sustained participation of the rural poor in project design,\n            implementation, and in the monitoring and evaluation aspects\n            within the three project provinces. The project entails six\n            components: 1) Sustainable mountain agriculture - will\n            support agricultural development, and sustainable\n            livelihoods in villages where communities live in remote\n            mountainous environments. The design and implementation of\n            the component is based on the two principles of targeting\n            and reaching poor households, and achieving environmental\n            sustainability. The following activities are included:\n            improving household agricultural productivity and\n            diversification; developing farmer-to-farmer services; and,\n            agricultural training and technical support services. 2)\n            Basic rural infrastructure - includes construction and\n            improvement of roads, tracks and paths; provision of potable\n            water supplies for humans and livestock; construction of\n            small water conservancy works (including irrigation and\n            drainage) with associated land improvements; extension of\n            rural electrification and communications networks; and,\n            household energy and sanitation improvements. 3) Basic\n            education - will address the challenges of a limited access\n            to primary education by poor and vulnerable children,\n            particularly girls and disabled children, of ineffective\n            adult training and education for rural community\n            development, of inadequate skills and capabilities of\n            teachers for both schooling, and adult education, and, of\n            the high burden of education expenses on poor families, in\n            addition to the burden of poor infrastructure. To this end,\n            the component comprises a nine-year compulsory pilot\n            education program in selected project villages, seeking to\n            integrate schools and communities through the transformation\n            of schools into community learning centers. Innovative\n            teaching methodologies will be provided to teachers, and,\n            training services to adults will be provided in project\n            villages, with a focus on functional literacy education. 4)\n            Basic health -

PRCDP aims to improve livelihoods and\n            capacities for sustainable self development of the poorest\n            groups in provinces within the project. Effective\n            cooperation between the government, project and target\n            groups has become the key condition for success of PRCDP. To\n            achieve this, PRCDP is working to ensure sustained and\n            effective participation of poor groups, women, ethnic\n            minorities and marginalized groups throughout the whole\n            project cycle: from poverty analysis and development\n            planning to implementing, monitoring, evaluating and\n            revising project activities. Poverty alleviation projects in\n            China are increasingly using participatory approaches.\n            However, there are wide differences in understanding of\n            participation with no guidelines or manuals covering areas\n            such as poverty assessment, limited relevant practical\n            experience, and a shortage of facilitators. As a result, the\n            use and impact of genuinely participatory approaches\n            throughout the project cycle have been severely limited. The\n            most serious problem has been the failure of poor groups to\n            participate effectively, particularly in decision making,\n            which has directly impacted on the
