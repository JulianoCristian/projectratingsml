Third Programmatic Business\n            Productivity and Efficiency Development Policy Loan for\n            Colombia will be executed over a period of three years. This\n            operation will support policy and institutional reforms in\n            three areas: strengthening of fiscal management, the\n            financial system and capital markets; improvement of the\n            quality standards and technological innovation framework;\n            and strengthening of infrastructure and logistics. The loan\n            will support sustainable growth and alleviation of poverty\n            by: facilitating the operation of businesses, and promoting\n            investment to boost productivity, and employment levels; and\n            consolidating the financial sector and capital markets as\n            pillars of economic growth to address the needs of\n            individuals (particularly the poor and underserved), and the\n            productive sector. The combination of domestic economic\n            growth, improved international conditions, Colombian peso\n            appreciation, and revenue-enhancing policy reforms has\n            benefited the country's fiscal accounts, as did\n            improvements in tax administration. Revenue growth has\n            continued to outpace gross domestic product (GDP) growth and\n            as a result the general Government deficit decreased from\n            4.9 percent of GDP in 2002 to about 1.9 percent of GDP in\n            2007. The near stagnation of the economy during the early\n            2000s has given way to sustained economic growth and a\n            strengthening of consumer and investor confidence. The\n            turnaround was influenced by an improve global economic\n            environment in which demand for Colombia's primary\n            exports has risen along with prices, while the cost of\n            international borrowing has fallen. Sound macroeconomic\n            management has played a major part in the recovery as well\n            as improvements in internal security."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Third Programmatic
