The\n            self-financing irrigation and drainage district (SIDDs),\n            introduced as a pilot project were successful to a large\n            extent. Adequate and Timely Counterpart Funds are Critical.\n            Active participation by government leaders at all levels and\n            project beneficiaries is very important in ensuring smooth\n            project implementation, especially in raising by local\n            counterpart funds, organizing contributions of labor for\n            large volume earthwork construction, and resolving\n            day-to-day project implementation problems and issues. There\n            was keen competition among the bidders but there were no\n            foreign bidders and, in all cases, the successful bidders\n            were local suppliers and manufacturers. The project has\n            demonstrated positive economic viability of non-grain\n            production to meet changing market and demands when grain\n            production was less attractive."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Second Irrigated Agriculture\n            Intensification Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Second Irrigated\n            Agriculture Intensification Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/12/6504687/china-second-irrigated-agriculture-intensification-project","projn":"CN-Irrigated Agriculture Intensification II\n            Project -- P049700","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Banks & Banking Reform,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Poverty Reduction,Agriculture,Rural Development","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20051229131542"},"subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Roads and highways,Power,Law and justice,Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Poverty Reduction,Agriculture,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Transportation,Energy and mining,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, adverse environmental impacts,\n            Afforestation, Agricultural Development, Agricultural\n            Development Project, Agricultural Intensification,\n            agricultural mechanization, agricultural production,\n            agricultural productivity, agricultural support,\n            agricultural technology, AGRICULTURE, capita consumption,\n            capita incomes, cash crops, cash flow, cash-crop, chemical\n            fertilizers, Commodity, community participation, consumer\n            goods, consumption patterns, cooperatives, corn, cotton,\n            crop, crop area, crop production, crop varieties, crop\n            yields, cropping, cropping intensity, cropping patterns,\n            crops, DATES, development projects, Drainage, employment,\n            Environmental, environmental impacts, environmental issues,\n            Environmental Management, Environmental Protection,\n            equipment, Exchange Rate, expenditures, Extension, farm,\n            farm families, farm households, farm irrigation, farm\n            management, farmer, farmer associations, farmers, farming,\n            farming activities, farming technologies, farmland,\n            fertilizer, fertilizers, field crops, financial management,\n            financial resources, fishing, food security, forestry,\n            forestry sector, grain, grain prices, grain production,\n            groundwater, household incomes, housing, income, income\n            levels, incomes, Institutional Development, labor inputs,\n            land levelling, land resources, laws, livelihoods, local\n            government, local governments, meat, natural disasters,\n            Natural Resources, natural resources management, nurseries,\n            Pacific Region, payments in advance, per capita consumption,\n            Pest control, Pest Management, planting, plowing, poor\n            counties, poor households, poverty levels, poverty\n            reduction, Present Value, production technologies,\n            productivity, quality of life, quality seed, reduction of\n            poverty, rice, Rural Development, rural population, rural\n            road, rural roads, Rural services, savings, seed production,\n            seeds, soil fertility, sustainable use, technical\n            assistance, vegetation, Water Resources, Water Supply, Water\n            Users, wheat, yields"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF025509-PHRD-SECOND IRRIGATED\n            AGRICULTURE INTENSIFICATION PROJ.,TF025564-PHRD-IRRIGATED AGRIC.\n            INTENSIFICATION PROJ.

To minimize adverse effects on\n            farmers, caused by the project's land occupation,\n            construction, and housing relocation, recommendations\n            include quality upgrade of specified standards, by dredging,\n            and repairing existing branch canals, laterals, and ditches\n            as possible. Additionally, in some arable lands, the length\n            of ditches could be reduced, by replacing the curved on-farm\n            ditches with straight ones, and, if construction of new ones\n            is required, the farm land area of each household will be\n            adjusted during land leveling to ensure no area losses, and\n            ensure as well, that works be adjusted to the planting\n            season, to avoid any waste of crops. To maximize land uses,\n            canal profiles will be designed to control infiltration, and\n            reduce the canal cross-section areas. The study indicates\n            that the departments of land management have guaranteed\n            compensation, based on replacement costs, for those people\n            whose livelihoods may be affected by land acquisition, and,\n            provide as well, work benefits, and, grievance mechanisms,\n            to ensure their living standards, and rights are not disrupted."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Second Irrigated Agriculture\n            Intensification Project : resettlement plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Second Irrigated\n            Agriculture Intensification Project : resettlement plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/04/438155/china-second-irrigated-agriculture-intensification-project-resettlement-plan","projn":"CN-Irrigated Agriculture Intensification II\n            Project -- P049700","subtopic":"Rural Land Policies for Poverty Reduction,Environmental Economics & Policies,Land Use and Policies,Urban Housing,Forestry","docty":"Resettlement Plan","teratopic":"Urban Development","count":"China","authors":{"authr":"State Office for Comprehensive Agricultural Development"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00032205302843"},"subsc":"Power,Irrigation and drainage,Roads and highways,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Law and justice","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Urban Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Intensification,agricultural\n            population,agricultural production,Agriculture,arable\n            land,cities,construction,cultivated land,drainage,dry\n            lands,economic conditions,employment,environmental\n            protection,Farmland,fish,forestry,housing,income,Land\n            Acquisition,Land Law,land leveling,Land Management,land\n            use,planting,repair,resettlement,social economy,Soil Conservation,trees,unemployment,villages"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Intensification,agricultural\n            population,agricultural production,Agriculture,arable\n            land,cities,construction,cultivated land,drainage,dry\n            lands,economic conditions,employment,environmental\n            protection,Farmland,fish,forestry,housing,income,Land\n            Acquisition,Land Law,land leveling,Land Management,land\n            use,planting,repair,resettlement,social economy,Soil Conservation,trees,unemployment,villages"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF025564-PHRD-IRRIGATED AGRIC.\n            INTENSIFICATION PROJ.
