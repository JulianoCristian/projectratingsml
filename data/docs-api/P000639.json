The objectives of the Primary\n            Education Project were: (i) to support improvements of\n            primary school teaching through teacher training and the\n            provision of instructional materials; (ii) to expand and\n            improve the physical facilities in rural areas through\n            construction and furnishing of 100 new classrooms in 50\n            rural communities; and (iii) to reinforce the planning and\n            implementation capabilities of the Ministry of Education and\n            Science (MOES) through assistance to MOES' education\n            planning division and establishment of a Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) in the Ministry. Since its\n            conception, the project was plagued by many difficulties\n            including an overly complex design, lack of clear\n            coordination mechanisms for co financing of certain\n            components and, above all, the Government's very\n            limited administrative and implementation capacity. Bank\n            performance was mixed. The objectives of the project were\n            consistent with the needs of the country but its design was\n            flawed. The Borrower played a positive role at the\n            preparation stage but failed to deliver at the\n            implementation phase. The principal lessons learned from the\n            project are as follows: (i) project design needs to be kept\n            simple and in line with the public sector's capacity;\n            (ii) the lack of Government commitment and ownership have a\n            detrimental impact on all aspects of a Project; (iii) if the\n            successful completion of project objectives depends on co\n            financing, project appraisal must assure that this co\n            financing is secure; and (iv) projects under such field\n            onditions should be provided with a full complement of\n            technical assistance staff and up front mobilization of\n            qualified counterpart staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Primary Education

Further to this, the project entails (d)\n            assistance to rural communities for the construction and\n            furnishing of about 100 classrooms; and (e) strengthening of\n            the planning and implementation capacity within MOE.  As\n            part of this last component, the project finances studies\n            needed to prepare the 1990-1995 development plan and the\n            corresponding financial
