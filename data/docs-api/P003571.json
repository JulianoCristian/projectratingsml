To achieve\n            these objectives, MOR formulated a series of components on\n            policy reform and institutional development (PID),\n            investments, and studies.

To achieve\n            these objectives, MOR formulated a series of components on\n            policy reform and institutional development (PID),\n            investments, and studies. PID components include: 1) railway\n            enterprise reform; 2) railway tariff reform; and 3) labor\n            productivity enhancement. Investments include: 1) expanding\n            corridor capacity; 2) modernizing information systems; 3)\n            upgrading telecommunications systems; 4) commercializing\n            container transport; 5) enhancing environmental protection;\n            and 6) expanding system capacity. The studies include\n            components that will provide MOR with the technical\n            assistance and software needed to prepare future railway\n            projects or to develop and apply new railway technologies\n            and management techniques."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Seventh Railway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Seventh Railway Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/04/732758/china-seventh-railway-project","projn":"CN-7th Railways -- P003571","subtopic":"Early Child and Children's Health,Municipal Financial Management,Railways Transport,Banks & Banking Reform,Roads & Highways","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","teratopic":"Transport","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961008012151"},"subsc":"Railways,Central government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,Afforestation,assets,autonomy,Bank\n            supervision,Bicycles,bottlenecks,BRIDGE,BRIDGE\n            CONSTRUCTION,cables,CAPITALS,Cement,Cities,competition from\n            road,congestion,corridor,customer services,debt,DOUBLE TRACK\n            RAILWAYS,Economic Reform,electric\n            locomotives,engine,Expressway,Financial Management,financial\n            planning,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,freight,freight\n            operations,freight traffic,freight\n            transport,fuel,highways,housing,Institutional\n            Development,leasing,management information\n            systems,maturity,passenger,passenger\n            services,Ports,PRC,productivity,Provincial Highways,public\n            services,rail,rail line,Railway,railway\n            administrations,Railway Advisor,railway capacity,railway\n            construction,RAILWAY LINES,railway management,railway\n            network,railway operations,railway operator,Railway\n            Project,railway projects,Railway Reform,railway\n            sector,railway sector reform,railway services,railway\n            staff,railway system,railway track,Railways,Rate of\n            Return,Sanitation,savings,SINGLE TRACK\n            RAILWAYS,Soils,speed,Technical Assistance,track,Water Supply,Watershed"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,Afforestation,assets,autonomy,Bank\n            supervision,Bicycles,bottlenecks,BRIDGE,BRIDGE\n            CONSTRUCTION,cables,CAPITALS,Cement,Cities,competition from\n            road,congestion,corridor,customer services,debt,DOUBLE TRACK\n            RAILWAYS,Economic Reform,electric\n            locomotives,engine,Expressway,Financial Management,financial\n            planning,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,freight,freight\n            operations,freight traffic,freight\n            transport,fuel,highways,housing,Institutional\n            Development,leasing,management information\n            systems,maturity,passenger,passenger\n            services,Ports,PRC,productivity,Provincial Highways,public\n            services,rail,rail line,Railway,railway\n            administrations,Railway Advisor,railway capacity,railway\n            construction,RAILWAY LINES,railway management,railway\n            network,railway operations,railway operator,Railway\n            Project,railway projects,Railway Reform,railway\n            sector,railway sector reform,railway services,railway\n            staff,railway system,railway track,Railways,Rate of\n            Return,Sanitation,savings,SINGLE TRACK\n            RAILWAYS,Soils,speed,Technical Assistance,track,Water Supply,Watershed"}},"owner":"Trnsprt, Energy & Mining Sector (EASTE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF021251-PHRD-JAPANESE CTF (USD ACCOUNT),TF031676-CHINA - SEVEN RAILWAY PROJECT,TF029527-PHRD-FORESTRY RESOUR.DEV.&\n            CONSER.(ORIG.
