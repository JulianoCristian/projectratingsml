It is recommended that funding for\n            parallel flow technology be allocated not only on the basis\n            of cost, but also on the basis of technological factors that\n            ensure the most effective production of R-134a MAC units in\n            a particular enterprise."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
