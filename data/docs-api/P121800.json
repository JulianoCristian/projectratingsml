Some lessons learned\n            included: the Government of Mexico was fully committed to\n            developing its climate change strategy of which this DPL is\n            an important part. The DPL drew on the extensive analytical\n            work done on low-carbon development in Mexico, which was\n            also used to prepare Mexico's clean technology fund\n            investment plan, the energy efficiency and renewable energy\n            assistance programs, and the sustainable urban transport\n            program. The low-carbon DPL benefitted from the World\n            Bank's ongoing dialogue and good relationship with\n            Mexico on a range of climate change issues. This included\n            previous cross-sectoral DPLs, and other operations in Mexico\n            on both climate mitigation and adaptation. The DPL\n            benefitted by placing coordination of the substantive\n            aspects of the program with Ministry of Environment and\n            Natural Resources (Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos\n            Naturales) (SEMARNAT) which has an overall understanding of\n            Mexico's broad climate change program. SEMARNAT played\n            an important coordinating role taking responsibility not\n            only for those environment and resources aspects within in\n            domain (such as forestry), but assuming responsibility for\n            the broader global environmental goals of the DPL. This\n            project found that it was difficult to define meaningful\n            targets that can be achieved in only 18 months. As a partial\n            solution, and given the lack of mid-year data for many of\n            the indicators, the time period for measuring the targets\n            was extended to 24 months."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Low Carbon Development Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Low Carbon Development\n            Policy Loan

change mitigation targets under the\n            Special Program for Climate Change (PECC). The policy areas\n            that are included in the proposed DPL promote low-carbon\n            development for: (1) increasing renewable energy supply,\n            promoting energy efficiency through cogeneration, reducing\n            gas flaring and venting, and piloting the reform of the\n            rural agricultural electricity subsidy; (2) improving the\n            efficiency of the vehicle fleet and road transport\n            operations in Mexico; (3) strengthening the market for\n            energy-efficient housing; and (4) mainstreaming climate\n            change considerations into land-use and forestry activities.\n            In addition, the proposed operation will contribute to the\n            efforts of the Mexico government to: (i) facilitate\n            Mexico's involvement in the international carbon\n            market, and (ii) implement Nationally Appropriate Mitigation\n            Actions (NAMAs), in particular the ones adopted in the
