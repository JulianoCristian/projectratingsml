The\n            principal objectives of the project were (a) to continue\n            Bank support for pre-vocational secondary education; (b) to\n            improve access to education for disadvantaged groups; and\n            (c) to improve educational data. These objectives were\n            intended to be achieved by constructing and equipping 21\n            secondary schools; providing equipment for another eight\n            schools; training 700 staff as teachers and administrators;\n            financing technical assistance and fellowships and relevant\n            studies. The project was adversely affected by the priority\n            given to the reconstruction of schools damaged in the 1976\n            earthquake, changes in school sites, cumbersome government\n            procedures and, on occasion, lack of counterpart funds.\n            Lessons learned are as follows; (i) some covenants and\n            conditions were over ambitious. The Bank should limit the\n            number of covenants to those that are directly related to\n            the project and that can be monitored adequately; (ii) there\n            were minor problems with technical assistance. However,\n            accepting technical assistance from local agencies proved to\n            be feasible and cost effective in the Guatemalan context.\n            This practice should be encouraged in future projects; (iii)\n            education programs were somewhat fragmented in two different\n            ministries and there was poor coordination in the technical\n            committee under the Ministry of Communications and public\n            works. In future education/training projects in Guatemala\n            the Bank should verify that the unit in charge of\n            implementing the program is adequately staffed, and that the\n            coordinating committee has been placed under the\n            jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education and has been given\n            clear terms of reference before the loan is made; and (iv)\n            The scattered placement of buildings on sites resulted in\n            high ratios of circulation and covered walkway areas to\n            available space. More concentrated arrangements of buildings\n            should be sought in future projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala - Second Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guatemala -
