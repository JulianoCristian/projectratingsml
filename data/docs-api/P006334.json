of Mato Grasso. The program aims\n            at increasing the productivity, income, and social welfare\n            of the region's present and future population, and is\n            expected to benefit directly some 120,000 small-scale farm\n            families. At the core of the program is the paving of the\n            Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway, and the investments required to\n            achieve the balanced socio-economic development of the\n            road's area of influence while protecting the\n            region's Amerindian population and natural environment.\n            The proposed project seeks to provide land, facilities, and\n            assistance to migrant farm families arriving in Rondonia,\n            and to develop cost-effective settlement and environmental\n            protection methods for the Amazon region in Brazil. About\n            15,000 farm families would be settled in unoccupied areas\n            selected through surveys demonstrating their agricultural\n            aptitude. The project would support development of\n            appropriate agriculture, extension and research programs,\n            and small-scale forestry operations. Investment credit would\n            also be financed under the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Third Phase of the Northwest Region\n            Development Program  : new settlements"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Third Phase of the\n            Northwest Region Development Program  : new settlements"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1983/09/23978276/brazil-third-phase-northwest-region-development-program-new-settlements","topic":"Agricultural Innovation Systems m1327588 196,Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171,Agricultural Research m1326207 197,Agricultural Policies m1326884 170","projn":"BR-Nw Devt Iii-New Sett -- P006334","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Research,Housing & Human Habitats,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Agriculture,Rural Development,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20150210001221"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Agriculture,Rural Development,Communities and Human Settlements","seccl":"Public","topicv3":"Agricultural Innovation Systems m1327588 196,Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171,Agricultural Research m1326207 197,Agricultural Policies m1326884 170","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural development;
