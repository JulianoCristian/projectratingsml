Second HIV/AIDS Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Second HIV/AIDS Project\n            for Barbados were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            greater attention needs to be paid to implementation\n            capacity at project outset, beyond the successful completion\n            of a previous project. Implementation capacity assessments\n            should also include an evaluation of project staff relative\n            to project scope, and a skills assessment of staff needed to\n            conduct key tasks. A better training process for financial\n            management and procurement is necessary in the context of\n            complex project design. It would be good to provide training\n            in a timely fashion, and refresher training sessions when\n            there are significant changes to project staff. Task teams\n            should provide frequent and varied training opportunities to\n            address these challenges. Projects where countries are\n            reimbursed for eligible expenses should look into\n            difficulties with the project design in the event of slow\n            disbursement at the beginning of the project. Slow\n            disbursement may be a result of a lack of understanding of\n            eligible expenses or project design, or of financial\n            difficulties in raising funds to make payments, even if they\n            are reimbursed at a later date. Greater cultural\n            consideration should be given when designing project\n            activities and targets for indicators. Marginalization and\n            stigma may also impede implementation, such as de-emphasis\n            of certain key populations among other more acceptable\n            groups, reluctance for surveys of these groups to take\n            place, and poor outcomes due to late presentation to\n            treatment and care."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Barbados - Second HIV/AIDS

HIV/AIDS Project for Barbados. Its objectives are to:\n            (i) modify the Project's institutional arrangements to\n            strengthen the leadership and capacity by transferring\n            coordination, disbursement, and financial management\n            functions to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and by\n            transferring procurement, monitoring, evaluation, and\n            supervision functions to the Ministry of Health (MOH); (ii)\n            revise the results framework by changing the final target\n            year for three indicators from 2012 when the surveys were\n            expected to be done, to 2013, the end of the Project, and by\n            changing the target for one indicator; and (iii) increase\n            the percentage of Bank financing of Eligible Program\n            Expenditures under Component 1 from 35 percent to 65 percent\n            to accelerate the disbursement in order to successfully\n            achieve the project's objectives. The Bank has assessed\n            the institutional capacity under the MOF and MOH for\n            managing fiduciary functions and found it satisfactory. The\n            revised governance structure will strengthen project\n            leadership and improve capacity for better performance. The\n            change to the target date for three results indicators is\n            due to delays in conducting related surveys, the data for\n            which will only become available in 2013. The change to the\n            target for one indicator is intended to scale back a target\n            value which had already been revised significantly above the\n            initial target. The increase to the percentage of eligible\n            Bank financing is in response to the global economic and\n            financial crisis, which affected revenue generation in Barbados."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Barbados -
