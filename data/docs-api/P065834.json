Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are satisfactory: the Bank made a\n            significant contribution to FYR Macedonia's recovery\n            from the Kosovo crisis. The project signaled the beginning\n            of a more productive phase of relations between the Bank\n            Group and the country. Key lessons learned included the\n            following: In an emergency project, where quick disbursement\n            is crucial, the general principles of financial management\n            cannot be strictly applied because they would delay\n            disbursement. The QAG Quality at Entry Assessment concluded\n            that a dated covenant might have been more appropriate\n            rather than insisting that as a condition of effectiveness\n            that independent auditors be retained, and noted that while\n            appraisal to Board approval was achieved in less than 6\n            weeks, Board approval to effectiveness took more than 2\n            months. Also, for an emergency credit of this kind, more\n            appropriate indicators of overall impact might have been the\n            timeliness of the Bank response and the speed of\n            disbursements, both of which were highly responsive to the\n            country's needs. A final lesson is about the financial\n            covenants in the Development Credit Agreement --in\n            particular, the requirements of quarterly audits increased\n            considerably the cost of project administration and implied\n            that the project's financial management and internal\n            control arrangements were insufficient."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia, Former Yugoslav Republic of\n            Macedonia -

The project will provide\n            immediate, quick-disbursing support to finance a positive\n            list of imports needed for the recovery effort while\n            supporting macroeconomic objectives. Also, the project will\n            provide assistance for a broad range of imports by the\n            private sector, especially imported production inputs and\n            imported capital equipment. No disbursements will be made to\n            cover used or luxury goods, military equipment, or nuclear\n            reactors.
