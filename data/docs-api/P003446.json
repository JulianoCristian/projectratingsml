Even though some deficiencies in\n            recurrent costs were identified in the rural health\n            development component, success was achieved in upgrading the\n            quality of preventive, maternal/child health, and basic\n            health services. In addition, the drug component improved\n            the pharmaceutical quality and safety of products, while\n            research strengthened the capacity for health policy\n            formulation, as well as health insurance evaluation schemes.\n            Conversely, the delays and cost overruns in the vaccine\n            production, caused mixed results, though full production\n            will start by the year 2000, with a substantial transfer of\n            biotechnology. The key lessons learned suggest attention to\n            recurrent costs in the design and implementation of low-cost\n            rural health projects, with monitoring and evaluation\n            frameworks integrated in the formulation phase; testing and\n            verification during implementation could be achieved through\n            the development of a research agenda. The complexity in\n            vaccine production requires technical expertise and\n            industrial know-how, therefore this challenge would be\n            better achieved within industrial projects, in accordance\n            with financial and economic methods."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Rural Health and Preventive Medicine Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Rural
