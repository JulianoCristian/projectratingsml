Some lessons\n            learned included: complex project design in a low capacity\n            environment leads to poor implementation and non-attainment\n            of objectives. Major risks and adequate mitigations measures\n            should be comprehensively identified during project\n            preparation. Clear and performing institutional framework is\n            required to be put in place before implementing a rural\n            transport operation. Robust and realistic cost estimates\n            must be provided during the preparation of projects to avoid\n            funding gaps. The selection of monitorable indicators is\n            essential to monitor the results chain. The introduction of\n            the spot improvement concept on rural roads requires careful\n            preparation or advocacy or planning for it to work in the\n            field due to the tendency of road administrations,\n            contractors, and consultants to want to fully rehabilitate\n            rural roads. Realistic traffic forecasts and assumptions are\n            critical when assessing the viability of railway and port investments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Rural Transport
