Some lessons learned\n            included: the first and perhaps main lesson incorporated in\n            this project was the importance of linking the objectives of\n            environmental protection and sound land use and management\n            with tangible benefits for rural families. The project\n            placed emphasis on managing lands for improved natural\n            resource management and conservation which also helped to\n            return once abandoned lands to productive use, while at the\n            same time generating improved incomes for local stakeholders\n            and users of the land.

Additional lessons incorporated into the\n            design of the project were: (a) the importance of training\n            for project related activities such as procurement,\n            disbursement, supervision, and financial management; and (b)\n            the need to inform, disseminate and communicate relevant\n            information to all stakeholders."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan -

The project--with active participation of local\n            communities--will assist the Government of Kazakhstan to:\n            (i) develop sustainable land use systems; (ii) provide\n            initial service support to producer groups; (iii) improve\n            national capacity to quantify carbon sequestration; and (iv)\n            undertake a broad public awareness campaign and develop a\n            strategy so that project interventions could be replicated\n            in similar areas of Kazakhstan and other Central Asian\n            countries. By promoting sustainable land use practices, the\n            project emphasizes an integrated ecosystem management\n            approach to achieving ecological, economic and social goals\n            that are expected to yield benefits at a local, regional and\n            global level."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan -

This environmental management plan outlines\n            expected negative environmental impacts and proposes the\n            mitigation measures. Among them are the following: To\n            increase biodiversity and carbon storage, and reduce\n            invasive weeds/pests, the project will formulate a binding\n            agreement with farmers and MNREP not to plough reclaimed\n            pastures, provide increased market opportunities for animal\n            products, reclaim watering points, and provide training in\n            land management. It will also undertake soil monitoring of\n            selected areas to establish the effect of better farming\n            systems on soil quality and conduct farmer training to avoid\n            decreased soil quality. Other impacts include increasing\n            carbon sequestration and biodiversity by reclaiming ploughed\n            areas with local grasses and legumes-ensuring that species\n            choice is appropriate for land and climate, improving\n            management of all rangelands, and installing systems to\n            measure and monitor carbon accumulation. To avoid waste\n            collection, storage, and disposal problems from increasing\n            numbers of livestock (cattle)that may lead to waste seepage\n            into groundwater and well water supply, demonstrate proper\n            housing facilities for cattle that include waste management\n            and the use of organic fertilizers on pastures/kitchen\n            gardens, etc., take measures to prevent methane venting, and\n            study the economics of waste use."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan -
