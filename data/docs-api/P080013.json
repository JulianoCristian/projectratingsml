Some lessons learned included: the Bank\n            should also sharpen and strengthen its political economy\n            skills and assessment in response to complex programs with\n            tough reforms. Therefore, preparation of the country owned\n            strategies or statements should not be misread as readiness\n            for politically difficult reforms. Consensus by key\n            stakeholders across the political arena is essential and not\n            only by technocrats and a few decision makers. Therefore,\n            continuous local ownership by both political representatives\n            and other stakeholders is a key during implementation. In\n            this regard, the Bank should be prepared to spend more time\n            in building local ownership and coalition for specific\n            reforms through broader dialogue and improve its ability to\n            react faster when signs of reluctance appear. The Bank\n            should move fast and develop a toolkit or guidelines on\n            'stakeholder analysis' how to identify and analyze\n            vested groups as some are not as obvious as others due to\n            cultural divergence within a country. It is important to\n            build adequate incentives to ensure completion of actions to\n            complete reforms. Therefore, sequencing of activities within\n            a sector and a tranche is critical for achieving and\n            sustaining reforms, and disbursements should be released\n            only upon full completion of a tranche condition or explicit\n            waivers for only partly met commitments. The balancing act\n            between making tough decisions and being flexible to\n            encourage tough reforms is difficult. Therefore, the Bank\n            needs to learn to take tough decisions on a difficult reform\n            by taking remedies like cancellation or refusal to extend\n            closing dates and let the project close to minimize losses\n            and negative exposure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Private Sector Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Private

Private Sector Adjustment Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Private Sector Adjustment Credit\n            (PSAC) aims to support the Government of Senegal in the\n            implementing subsector reforms to improve the investment\n            climate and accelerate private sector growth and employment.\n            Specifically, it  (i) supports the implementation of a\n            private enterprise tax regime that stimulates investments\n            through leveling the playing field and lowering taxes, and\n            allocates user fees for private sector promotion purposes\n            (ii) restructures the edible oil sector by improving the\n            competitive environment in which it operates, that is,\n            through eliminating or reducing policy distortions\n            associated with non-tariff barriers and other domestic\n            protection mechanisms, and public interventions; (iii)\n            reforming postal services by introducing greater\n            competition, restructuring the postal enterprise so as to\n            enhance its sustainability, and creating an autonomous\n            financial subsidiary that would provide savings, and payment\n            and transfer services; and (iv) changing the pension system\n            to make it financially sustainable and improving its\n            corporate governance. The last two reforms entail\n            substantial financial restructuring, involving clearance of\n            arrears, that would need to be financed by the public\n            budget. In the same vein, the proposed tax reforms may\n            entail revenue shortfalls in the short term. The Credit aims\n            to provide budget resources through counterpart funds\n            generated by balance of payment support it provides, and\n            thus help ensure that social and poverty alleviation\n            programs are not disrupted.  The first tranche of the\n            proposed four-tranche operation would help initiate these\n            reforms. The other three floating tranches would support\n            specific reforms in each of the above areas, except in the\n            edible oil sector, which will be fully covered by the first\n            tranche.  A possible risk includes  imperfect implementation\n            of the reforms, which would undermine their sustainability.\n            Political risk due to opposing vested interests has been\n            offset in a number ways-undertaking diagnostics studies to\n            strengthen the analytical basis of the reforms, following a\n            broad participatory process to ensure stakeholder buy-in;\n            focusing on outcomes through project design simplicity, .The\n            second risk is institutional in nature. To avoid the risk of\n            imperfect implementation due to lack of capacity,\n            insufficient analysis and absence of consensus, the parallel\n            Private Investment Promotion Project (PIPP) assists in\n            designing and  implementing the reforms. The third category\n            of risk is specific to the four areas of reform within the\n            program. One such risk concerns the privatization of the\n            groundnut operator, which is very advanced and is not\n            expected to materialize. Other risks are considered\n            manageable and are mitigated through a combination of\n            upfront actions being taken, implementation support provided\n            by IDA and consensus building in favor of the reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Private Sector Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Private Sector\n
