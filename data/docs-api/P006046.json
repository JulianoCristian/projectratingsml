Some lessons learned included: clearly\n            distinguish between means versus ends in the definition of\n            project objectives. Lack of clarity regarding the project\n            objectives versus the tool to achieve those objectives had\n            ramifications for project design. Indeed, with the objective\n            of achieving enhanced efficiency and improved service\n            quality and sustainability, a wider definition of\n            eligibility criteria for sub-loans/grants might have\n            generated greater demand for sub-projects and in turn more\n            successful achievement of these objectives. As a corollary,\n            one should always actively question any policy tool to make\n            sure that adopting it does not restrict potentially positive\n            outcomes. Evaluate the actual demand for sewerage\n            connections (or other new service) and anticipated cost and\n            affordability to consumers. This project highlights the\n            importance of assessing beneficiary demand and likelihood of\n            connections to new services. The existence of a partially\n            viable substitute for the new service offered (septic tank\n            disposal) and high connection costs led to much lower than\n            expected rates of connection to newly expanded sewerage\n            networks in at least two of the three subprojects. As a\n            result, realized benefits are also much lower than expected.\n            Using socio-economic assessment tools such as stakeholder\n            consultations and surveys, combined with refined assumptions\n            in the ex-ante economic analysis can help address this\n            issue. The project supports the reform of the water and\n            sanitation sector in Argentina through the promotion of\n            efficiency in the operation and financing of water utilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Water Sector Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Water Sector Reform

medium-size cities through the\n            introduction of private sector participation in the\n            operation and management of water utilities, adoption of\n            appropriate regulatory frameworks, and institutionalization\n            of tariff policies and tested investment alternatives to\n            better reach poor consumers. The project consists of three\n            components: 1) Investment component will finance\n            rehabilitation and replacement of pipes, revamping and\n            improvement of water treatment plants and intake facilities,\n            upgrading substandard connections, supply and installation\n            of water meters, repair and replacement of pumping and\n            control equipment, supply of emergency and maintenance\n            equipment, improvement and extension of water and sewerage\n            services to the poor. 2) Institutional component will\n            finance the costs of project management, training of\n            regulators, technical assistance to continue advancing the\n            reform of the sector, establishment of a sectoral\n            information system, and development and implementation of\n            environmental regulations. 3) Environmental component will\n            finance updating of key environmental standards and\n            emergency actions to mitigate negative environmental impacts\n            related to water infrastructure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Water Sector Reform
