Some lessons learned included: a\n            national coordinating committee can help in setting overall\n            policy directives and getting cross-sectoral buy-in, but it\n            is challenging to get Ministries to internalize new ideas\n            even if they are well represented in such a committee.\n            However, when the National Committee for Community-Driven\n            Development (CNDCC) took a position, this did not\n            necessarily get immediately internalized in ministry\n            operations. The use of focal points created a permanent\n            responsibility in the sectoral ministries and integration\n            was further strengthened with involvement of the technical\n            department heads. CDD can produce superior results compared\n            to other modalities, but only if training of communities\n            produces a critical mass of capacity to execute projects.\n            The cornerstone of making the CDD approach effective in the\n            PNDCC was the grassroots management training program. The\n            PNDCC used a well-seasoned method of training with specific\n            modules that had been developed and tested elsewhere in\n            Africa. An ex-post evaluation of the community training\n            under PNDCC showed a significant gain in knowledge of how to\n            implement development sub-projects among people attending\n            grassroots management training. Any CDD program should\n            invest in building this basic knowledge base as an essential\n            part of creating sufficient capacity in communities to\n            manage project resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - National Community-Driven\n            Development Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - National Community-Driven\n

The global\n            economic and financial crisis has contributed to a\n            significant economic slowdown in Benin, and a widening of\n            the fiscal and current account deficits. Despite progress in\n            improving access to basic services, achieving the Millennium\n            Development Goals (MDGs) remains a significant challenge.\n            Benin is on track to meet the MDGs for access to potable\n            water in rural areas, eradicating hunger, and reduced\n            HIV/AIDS prevalence. The International Development\n            Association (IDA) Country Assistance Strategies have\n            supported Benin\u2019s efforts to implement core priorities\n            established in its poverty reduction strategies. In June\n            2010, the IMF approved a three-year Extended Credit Facility\n            (ECF) arrangement for Benin, and called for urgent action to\n            reduce the fiscal deficit, restore macroeconomic stability,\n            and make progress on economic reforms. Benin is one of the\n            heavily indebted countries that have graduated from the\n            Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, receiving 100\n            percent cancellation of eligible debt under the Multilateral\n            Debt Relief Initiative. Under the ongoing Country Assistance\n            Strategy (CAS), the Bank has relied on a combination of\n            development policy and investment operations in order to\n            encourage a coherent approach to supporting structural\n            reforms. The government\u2019s Growth Strategy for Poverty\n            Reduction (2011-2015), is to make Benin an emerging economy\n            by 2025."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Stepping up growth and economic diversification"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin -

The closing date for\n            the project will be extended from September 30, 2011 until\n            April 30, 2012. The extension is required since\n            implementation has been slowed by several factors: 1) new\n            procedures applied late last year by the Caisse Autonome\n            d'Amortissement have significantly lengthened the\n            turn-around time for replenishing the special account, which\n            in turn constrained financing of sub-projects; 2) several\n            procurements for consultants (including the impact\n            evaluation and technical audits) needed to be re-launched\n            internationally because the processes did not yield\n            applicants of sufficient capacity; and 3) the preparation of\n            boites a outils in some ministries. The project has\n            submitted a new work plan covering the period from June 2011\n            to April 2012 that presents a credible program for finishing\n            all activities by the revised closing date.
