Regardless of success, lessons\n            address several issues. Although the project was designed to\n            maintain the momentum of privatization, yet, the only\n            component which could effectively accomplish this, was the\n            quick-disbursing component - disbursed during the first year\n            of implementation, in a project implemented over an eleven\n            year period. At best, Poland did maintain the overall\n            direction of the privatization process, though partly due to\n            other Bank projects, such as the Enterprise and Financial\n            Sector Adjustment Loan Project. Furthermore, institutional\n            assessments are an essential part of complex projects with\n            multiple implementing agencies; as such, failure to work the\n            underlying institutional model in the implementation of the\n            program, meant the Bank did not anticipate potential delays.\n            Hence, while Poland might not have adopted an alternative\n            model for coordination under the project, the Bank should\n            have worked the implications of the current model, and\n            recommend best practices for effective coordination. Further\n            lessons reinforce the need for strong, and participatory\n            interagency, and donor coordination, particularly as it\n            involves funding, which could have helped the Bank avoid the\n            project's over-scaling. And, the value of preparing an\n            Implementation Completion Report eleven years after Board\n            presentation is questionable, for inevitably, recollections\n            are biased; rather, a review of the overall Bank program of\n            support to privatization would have been useful."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland -
