The lessons learned from the report are: 1)\n            PRSCs are useful instruments to help the borrower assume\n            increased responsibility in managing its public resources in\n            an efficient manner, notably by providing more flexibility\n            and predictability; however, there is a risk of complacency\n            and of dependence on continued foreign budget support; 2)\n            issues of attribution are inevitable when the reform\n            programs are supported by several donors; 3) since outcomes\n            are to be assessed after several years, the quality of the\n            relevant statistical data is critical; if insufficient,\n            preparation should include remedial actions, including the\n            selection and definition of baseline data; 4) since reforms\n            are of medium-to long-term nature, early identification of\n            institutional weaknesses and capacity constraints is of\n            paramount importance; and 5) to assess outcome of a\n            medium-term program, it is essential that the different\n            documents of a PRSC series be consistent in content and\n            format,

satisfactory\n            project outcome, likely sustainability, substantial\n            institutional development impacts, and satisfactory\n            performances by the Bank and Borrower. Lessons highlight\n            that the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series\n            greatly reinforced the importance of the budget, and the\n            country's own capacity for the success of government\n            policies, steadily strengthening the focus on the budget as\n            the main instrument for PRSP implementation. PRSCs also\n            successfully supported a number of cross-cutting reforms.\n            These reforms included the application of de-concentration\n            policies in budget and personnel management, which are part\n            of the policies to improve social service delivery. In the\n            cotton sector, the opening of two zones for private\n            investors, involved the establishment of the new regulatory\n            framework, and the definition of roles of the new and old\n            stakeholders. However, despite achievements, a number of\n            challenges remain for the PRSCs. Burkina Faso faces\n            difficulties in attracting private investment as a result of\n            low skill levels, and high costs of production factors. The\n            growth agenda of the PRSP should therefore be an additional\n            important area for support under future PRSCs, as well as\n            for the Country Assistance Strategy. Other lessons outline\n            improving the PRSC-related sectoral dialogue; aligning\n            budget support with the budget cycle; reinforcing\n            capacities; improving the link between policy actions and\n            the monitoring and evaluation framework; and, improving\n            inter-ministerial coordination."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso -

Consistent with the four\n            strategic pillars of the PRSP this project supports the\n            implementation of key reforms to improve the management of\n            public resources, strengthen basic service delivery in the\n            social sectors, and raise rural incomes.

Burkina Faso provides an analysis of\n            the potential environmental and social impacts. The\n            government's objective is to maintain a sound\n            macroeconomic environment, and accelerate growth by\n            providing external resources for the execution of the\n            government's 2003 budget. There will be anticipated\n            impacts, and mitigating measures. The potential\n            environmental and social impacts are those resulting from\n            its sectoral coverage. The potential environmental and\n            social impacts can only be descried in generic terms. The\n            rural development operations envisaged fall under two\n            categories. The first category concerns the development of\n            actions susceptible to encourage agricultural\n            diversification. The second category of activities includes\n            those associated with the liberalization of the cotton\n            sub-sector. Diversification may improve soil fertility\n            management and reduce the need for insecticide use. The\n            activities supported under the basic health sector\n            development evolve around strategic policy reforms aimed at\n            more effective targeting of the poor for the delivery of\n            basic services, institutional strengthening and\n            decentralization of service provision, and human resource\n            strengthening. The potential environmental aspects\n            associated with the intensification of agricultural\n            production will promote conservation practices that will\n            help maintain the productive capacity of the resource base.\n            Control of pesticide related pollution, and hazards. The\n            government will support the promotion of alternative and\n            complementary ways of pest management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burnika Faso - Third Poverty Reduction\n
