Some lessons learned\n            included: in a situation where the government does not\n            assume the responsibility of ensuring the provision of basic\n            social infrastructure in remote and poor communities, the\n            project demonstrated that community-managed development is\n            feasible even in today\u2019s context and has highly desirable\n            characteristics such as creating assets that are of high\n            priority to the community, engendering community ownership\n            and full use of the assets. The low capacity environment of\n            the country meant that it will have been beneficial for the\n            implementing agency as much as its partner institutions to\n            receive more technical support for the works, specifically\n            regarding engineering and planning. While the project\n            contributed somewhat to improving the capacity of local\n            partner institutions, more could have been done to directly\n            enhance the growing capacity of the various bureaus. The\n            unique character of the implementing agency with its\n            capacity for semiautonomous operation despite strong\n            government support and a multisectoral board, including\n            representatives of the beneficiary communities, is worthy of\n            emulation, especially in difficult economic and political\n            circumstances. An implementing agency experienced in\n            handling Emergency Projects is a good resource in a disaster\n            prone country to deal with all potential/future shocks. The\n            development of such an agency is also one of the\n            recommendations of the Bank\u2019s social protection and labor strategy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Comoros - Emergency Crises Response Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Comoros -
