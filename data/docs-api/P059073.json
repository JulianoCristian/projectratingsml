CWS' performance was disappointing and it\n            encountered serious financial difficulties early. Within two\n            years, the contract collapsed with the dramatic expulsion of\n            its expatriate managers from the country. Two international\n            arbitration tribunals ensued. The case raises compelling\n            questions about the preparation of the public-private\n            partnership (PPP), the selection process, the allocation of\n            risks in the contract, expectations regarding financial\n            viability and service improvements, the effectiveness of the\n            public-public partnership that has existed since the private\n            operator departed, and how to structure institutional\n            relationships to ensure accountability. It also provides an\n            opportunity to evaluate how customers, especially the poor,\n            were affected. The objective of the present study is to\n            review the evolution of the institutional framework for\n            water supply and sewerage services in Dar es Salaam from the\n            late 1990s to 2010, assess the performance of the key\n            actors, and extract lessons that might be useful to\n            Government of the United Republic of Tanzania (GOT), DAWASA,\n            the World Bank, other international lenders and sector\n            practitioners. Frequent reference is made to the Dar es\n            Salaam Water Supply and Sanitation Project (DWSSP) which\n            supported the institutional reforms and investments in the\n            services from 2003-2010."},"docna":{"cdata!":"A case study of public-private and\n            public-public partnerships in water supply and sewerage\n            services in Dar es

Some lessons learned included: examine a\n            wider range of factors affecting success. During project\n            preparation and implementation there is a natural tendency\n            to focus on the factors that are most visible. Take the\n            concerns of a range of qualified potential bidders into\n            account.

the Dar es Salaam Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Project for Tanzania is to provide a\n            reliable, affordable and sustainable water supply service\n            and improve the sewerage and sanitation in the 'service\n            area' of the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority\n            (DAWASA) that includes Dar es Salaam and part of the coast\n            region to help improve public health and well-being in a\n            city prone to cholera outbreaks or other water-borne\n            diseases and support productive activities of the\n            country's main economic center. The completion of this\n            contract will increase the likelihood of sustainability by\n            allowing for the: (i) replacement of aged high lift pumps;\n            and (ii) the procurement of necessary spares deemed\n            essential to the continued functioning of the Upper Ruvu and\n            Lower Ruvu plants. Both have been experiencing frequent\n            breakdowns that have disrupted service delivery to Dar es\n            Salaam. Efforts to procure the pumps begin in June 2009,\n            however, there have been significant delays. The borrower\n            first requested the association's approval to proceed\n            with the purchase of the pumps on July 6, 2009. However, the\n            first attempt to procure the pumps failed as quotations from\n            shortlisted suppliers were considered expensive and the\n            proposed delivery period extended beyond the initial project\n            closing date of December 31, 2009. Processing of a second\n            request for bids was therefore suspended until an extension\n            of the project was granted up to June 30, 2010."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Dar es Salaam Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Project : restructuring (Vol. 2) :\n            Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/06/12567881/tanzania-dar-es-salaam-water-supply-sanitation-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"TZ-Dar Es Salaam Water Supply And Sanitation\n            Project -- P059073","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water and Industry,Housing & Human Habitats,Urban Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions","teratopic":"Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Tanzania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20100721012451"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Water supply,Sub-national government administration,Sewerage,Sanitation","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Habitats, Indigenous Peoples, International\n            Waters, public health, Resettlement, Safety, Sanitation,\n            Sewerage, Sewerage Authority, sustainable water, sustainable\n            water supply, sustainable water supply service, Water Supply"}},"owner":"Urban Dev. & Services Prac 1 (AFTU1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020954-UNDP-WORLD BANK WATER &\n            SANITATION PROGRAM","repnb":"55397"},"6609931":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2006/02/6609931/tanzania-dar-es-salaam-water-supply-sanitation-project-proposed-amendments-legal-agreements","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2006/02/6609931/tanzania-dar-es-salaam-water-supply-sanitation-project-proposed-amendments-legal-agreements","new_url":"2006/02/6609931/tanzania-dar-es-salaam-water-supply-sanitation-project-proposed-amendments-legal-agreements","disclosure_date":"2007-01-31T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/02/21/000090341_20060221103939/Rendered/INDEX/35322.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/02/21/000090341_20060221103939/Rendered/PDF/35322.pdf","credit_no":"Q134;3771","datestored":"2006-02-21T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2006-02-17T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Dar Es Salaam Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project - proposed amendments to legal agreements"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objective of the Dar es Salaam Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Project for Tanzania is to provide\n            reliable, affordable, and sustainable water supply and\n            sanitation services in Dar es Salaam and parts of the\n            Coastal Region of the United Republic of Tanzania through:\n            (a) rehabilitation of facilities for production,\n            transmission, storage and distribution of drinking water,\n            and waste water collection and treatment; (b) extension of\n            piped water supplies and sewerage services; and (c)\n            reorganization of the United Republic of Tanzania's\n            water utility company, the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage\n            Authority's (DAWASA) operations to achieve effective\n            service delivery and financial sustainability.

the Dar es Salaam Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Project for Tanzania is to provide a\n            reliable, affordable and sustainable water supply service\n            and improve the sewerage and sanitation in the 'service\n            area' of the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority\n            (DAWASA) that includes Dar es Salaam and part of the coast\n            region to help improve public health and well-being in a\n            city prone to cholera outbreaks or other water-borne\n            diseases and support productive activities of the\n            country's main economic center. The completion of this\n            contract will increase the likelihood of sustainability by\n            allowing for the: (i) replacement of aged high lift pumps;\n            and (ii) the procurement of necessary spares deemed\n            essential to the continued functioning of the Upper Ruvu and\n            Lower Ruvu plants. Both have been experiencing frequent\n            breakdowns that have disrupted service delivery to Dar es\n            Salaam. Efforts to procure the pumps begin in June 2009,\n            however, there have been significant delays. The borrower\n            first requested the association's approval to proceed\n            with the purchase of the pumps on July 6, 2009. However, the\n            first attempt to procure the pumps failed as quotations from\n            shortlisted suppliers were considered expensive and the\n            proposed delivery period extended beyond the initial project\n            closing date of December 31, 2009. Processing of a second\n            request for bids was therefore suspended until an extension\n            of the project was granted up to June 30, 2010."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Dar es Salaam Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/05/12567880/tanzania-dar-es-salaam-water-supply-sanitation-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"TZ-Dar Es Salaam Water Supply And Sanitation\n            Project -- P059073","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water and Industry,Debt Markets,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Water Conservation","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Tanzania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20100721011737"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Water supply,Sub-national government administration,Sewerage,Sanitation","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Balance due, bids, borrower, CD,\n            certification, Currency, disbursement, disbursement\n            arrangements, disbursements, equipment, International\n            Development, issuance, Loan, negotiations, Payment Terms,\n            procurement, Pumps, service delivery, Sewerage Authority,\n            Water Pumps, WATER SUPPLY"}},"owner":"Urban Dev. & Services Prac 1 (AFTU1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020954-UNDP-WORLD BANK WATER &\n            SANITATION PROGRAM","repnb":"55397"},"2301336":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/04/2301336/tanzania-dar-es-salaam-water-supply-sanitation-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/04/2301336/tanzania-dar-es-salaam-water-supply-sanitation-project","new_url":"2003/04/2301336/tanzania-dar-es-salaam-water-supply-sanitation-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/05/08/000090341_20030508103932/Rendered/INDEX/25249.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/05/08/000090341_20030508103932/Rendered/PDF/25249.pdf","credit_no":"Q134","datestored":"2003-05-08T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2003-04-10T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Dar es Salaam Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The development objective of the project\n            is to provide a reliable, affordable and sustainable water\n            supply service and improve the sewerage and sanitation in\n            the \"service area\" of the Dar es Salaam Water and\n            Sewerage Authority (DAWASA) that includes Dar es Salaam and\n            part o f the Coast region.
