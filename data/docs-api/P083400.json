more complex economic, and social environment\n            arising from the onset of the petroleum era, and the nascent\n            market economy. The project will further strengthen the\n            required human capacity within the civil service. The\n            project consists of three components: 1) petroleum sector\n            component, will continue the critical technical assistance,\n            and capacity building in this nascent sector.

This\n            will entail strengthening of the National Petroleum Agency\n            in the development of institutional structures, human\n            resources, and necessary equipment, while providing training\n            programs.
