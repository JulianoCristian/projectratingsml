Some lessons learned included: bank\n            efforts at institutional development must be responsive to\n            market demand, even when the market consists of public\n            sector institutions and relevant price signals are\n            political. One of the main reasons Municipal Strengthening\n            Program (FORTAMUN) failed is that it could not find a market\n            for sub-loans. As long as softer money was available,\n            FORTAMUN lending program was irrelevant to its market.\n            Projects that deal directly with sub-national governments\n            need to be designed with long implementation periods. This\n            is to allow for the unpredictable but frequent problems that\n            are outside the project's control, such as changing\n            political climates, and changing relations between levels of\n            government. The extreme and mixed results of the project\n            give further evidence that Bank assistance can only be\n            effective when the government is committed and devotes the\n            necessary administrative resources. If the project shows\n            signs of lack of commitment at start up, as FORTAMUN did\n            under its original objectives, the project should be\n            restructured or canceled. If, on the other hand, the\n            government is committed, as it was to the Guadalajara\n            Emergency Reconstruction Program (GERP), a project can show\n            very good results quickly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
