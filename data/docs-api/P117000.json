Economic and Social Development\n            Policy Loan/Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Economic and Social\n            Development Policy Loan/Credit Project for Grenada were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            a programmatic approach, which supports a multi-stage\n            program with a longer term horizon, is superior to a\n            stand-alone one year program. At the Regional Operations\n            Committee meeting of this Development Policy Loan (DPL)/DPL\n            held in December 2009, both peer reviewers of this operation\n            as well as comments by other participants strongly supported\n            a programmatic approach. Eventually, a stand-alone operation\n            was favored because of the high uncertainty and debt risk of\n            Grenada at that point in time. With hindsight, a\n            programmatic operation could have had stronger development\n            impact and, by presenting a schedule of possible future\n            financial support. In small states, policy based programs\n            need to be relatively simple and straightforward. Since\n            generally only one policy based operation is prepared in a\n            multi-year period, both the Government and the Bank tend to\n            include many activities in the program. However,\n            implementation capacity is usually not strong in these\n            countries. Thus, in order to increase the likelihood that\n            programs are fully implemented, it would be useful to design\n            highly selective and relatively simple programs. In\n            addition, following up with intensive technical assistance\n            and country dialogue that builds local capacity would help\n            during implementation and also enhance sustainability of the\n            reform program in the medium term. The Program Policy Matrix\n            needs to be concise, with few measures and outcome\n            indicators that are clearly defined, critical for the\n            performance of the Program, and that are within control of\n            the government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Grenada - Economic and Social Development\n            Policy Loan/Credit

the Economic and\n            Social Development Policy Loan and Credit Program for\n            Grenada are to: a) improve public sector governance and\n            economic management, by supporting reforms to increase the\n            efficiency of tax collection, improve public service\n            delivery, enhance debt management, reduce waste in the\n            provision of public services, and help cope with the adverse\n            consequences of the global economic downturn; and b) improve\n            the effectiveness and efficiency of social safety nets, by\n            supporting efforts to develop objective beneficiary\n            selection criteria and transparent targeting mechanisms and\n            prioritize social spending to vulnerable groups. Economic\n            and Social Development Policy Loan and Development Policy\n            Credit (ES DPL/DPC) will provide timely financial support to\n            the Government of Grenada for: (i) managing the impact of\n            the global economic crisis; and (ii) maintaining and\n            reinforcing the implementation of the government's\n            long-term structural reform agenda. The Grenadian Government\n            developed a well articulated economic program in 2006 and\n            has been implementing this program since then with necessary\n            extensions and modifications as required by the changing\n            economic environment. The macroeconomic performance remained\n            strong up to the global economic crisis when the\n            macroeconomic environment deteriorated sharply. Given the\n            high level of debt and limited fiscal space, Grenada is\n            significantly constrained in adopting countercyclical\n            policies to mitigate the impact of the global economic\n            crisis and needs financial support while it adjusts to the\n            deteriorated global environment and sustains the\n            implementation of the longer term reform agenda. The ES\n            DPL/DPC will help the government in maintaining\n            macroeconomic stability and protecting the poor while\n            enhancing economic and institutional foundations for faster\n            development. To this end, the ES DPL/DPC supports specific\n            actions to: (1) improve public sector governance, economic\n            management, and debt management; (2) strengthen social\n            safety nets; and (3) improve the business environment and\n            financial sector stability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Grenada - Economic and Social Development\n            Policy Loan and Credit
