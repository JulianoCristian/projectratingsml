The outcome of Siauliai is rated as\n            moderately satisfactory. Relevance of both projects was high\n            given the need to clean up the Baltic Sea, Lithuania's\n            drive for EU accession and harmonization with EU\n            environmental standards, and dwindling public resources to\n            subsidize inefficient utilities. The efficiency of both\n            projects is rated modest. The financial rate of return is\n            borderline for both projects (under 9 percent for Klaipeda\n            and under 7 percent for Siauliai). However, the economic\n            rate of return is likely to be higher if the environmental\n            and tourism benefits could be monetized and included. OED\n            rates sustainability as likely for both projects because of\n            high stakeholder ownership linked to EU accession - but\n            politicization of water tariffs means that financial\n            sustainability at Siauliai will be difficult to achieve in\n            the short term. Bank and borrower performance are rated\n            satisfactory. There are three lessons from this experience:\n            1) Regionally sponsored environmental initiatives in\n            response to inter-governmental action plans provide good\n            opportunities for the Bank to exercise its comparative\n            advantage in leveraging institutional reform through\n            targeted lending. When linked with grant funding from\n            bilateral development partners it provides a powerful and\n            influential lobby for reform. 2) When extending loans for\n            water supply and wastewater treatment to new client\n            countries or sectors, the Bank could usefully start with\n            minimal or emergency investments linked to an institutional\n            development package that could be the start for a phased\n            investment program. The more recently introduced Adaptable\n            Program Loan would have been an ideal initial lending\n            instrument in this case as it would have allowed time to\n            develop refined criteria and arguments to facilitate\n            Government agreement to more appropriate infrastructure\n            designs and investments. 3) In water supply projects a\n            combination of master meters and in-house meters is more\n            effective at enabling revenue collection than in-house\n            meters alone."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lithuania -

Overall World Bank\n            performance was satisfactory: supervision was very closely\n            coordinated with the co-financiers, who were enabled to\n            solve emerging problems and at the same time, remain firm on\n            critical issues. Overall Borrower performance was marginally\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included the following:\n            Cooperatively planned and implemented projects based on\n            mutual trust between the Bank and the borrower can change\n            the way the cooperating parties think about environment and\n            development issues. The stronger the commitment at various\n            levels within the Borrower country, the Bank, and the\n            donors/co-financiers, the better the result. This project\n            reconfirmed the findings of earlier completed projects that\n            it is important to ensure continuity of the task\n            managers/task team leaders and the composition of the task\n            teams. The project also reconfirmed that transforming an\n            existing water and wastewater utility developed in a\n            centrally planned economy into an efficiently managed\n            self-sustaining entity, and introducing modern corporate\n            management ideas are much more challenging tasks than\n            physical implementation of the project.

The project's objectives\n            are the following: 1) reduction of various pollutant loads\n            from the Siauliai area into the Upper Lielupe River Basin,\n            thus decreasing the transboundary pollution into the river\n            and the Gulf of Riga; 2) improvement of the quality,\n            reliability and cost efficiency of water supply and\n            wastewater services in Siauliai; 3) assist in establishing\n            financially sustainable provision of municipal services; and\n            4) improvement of the regional and local environmental\n            quality monitoring and enforcement system in the Upper\n            Lielupe River Basin. The project consists of two\n            complementary components: 1) water and wastewater\n            improvement component, which includes support for\n            rehabilitation, upgrading, and expansion of the water and\n            wastewater system, and which comprises three key activities:\n            a) water supply and distribution; b) wastewater collection\n            and treatment; and c) technical assistance and training; and\n            2) environmental management component consisting of the\n            following four activities: a) direct support for the\n            Lithuanian side of the Lielupe River Basin Commission; b)\n            regional environmental monitoring and water quality\n            laboratory system; c) small point source pollution control;\n

The project's objectives\n            are the following: 1) reduction of various pollutant loads\n            from the Siauliai area into the Upper Lielupe River Basin,\n            thus decreasing the transboundary pollution into the river\n            and the Gulf of Riga; 2) improvement of the quality,\n            reliability and cost efficiency of water supply and\n            wastewater services in Siauliai; 3) assist in establishing\n            financially sustainable provision of municipal services; and\n            4) improvement of the regional and local environmental\n            quality monitoring and enforcement system in the Upper\n            Lielupe River Basin. The project consists of two\n            complementary components: 1) water and wastewater\n            improvement component, which includes support for\n            rehabilitation, upgrading, and expansion of the water and\n            wastewater system, and which comprises three key activities:\n            a) water supply and distribution; b) wastewater collection\n            and treatment; and c) technical assistance and training; and\n            2) environmental management component consisting of the\n            following four activities: a) direct support for the\n            Lithuanian side of the Lielupe River Basin Commission; b)\n            regional environmental monitoring and water quality\n            laboratory system; c) small point source pollution control;\n
