It is\n            also designed to improve availability and production of\n            household energy supplies by pilot activities in more\n            efficient commercial charcoal and charcoal stove production.\n            Technical assistance will be provided for project\n            implementation, financial operations, engineering, and\n            training programs in all areas of TANESCO's operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Power Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Power Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1986/04/742089/tanzania-power-rehabilitation-project","projn":"TZ-Power Rehab./Energy -- P002762","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Energy and Environment,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Tanzania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960925235543"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Assessment Program,charcoal,coal\n            production,coal resources,commercial\n            energy,Construction,Demand Forecast,demand growth,domestic\n            energy,domestic natural gas,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic\n            conditions,electric capacity,electric\n            power,Electricity,Electricity Consumption,Electricity\n            Supply,Energy Components,energy conservation,energy\n            consumption,Energy Department,Energy Development,energy\n            enterprises,Energy Management,energy needs,energy\n            planning,Energy Prices,energy resource,Energy\n            Resources,Energy Sector,energy supplies,Energy\n            Supply,Engineering,excavation,exploitation,falling,forestry,Fuel,fuel\n            supply,fuelwood,gas exploration,gas reserves,grid,grid\n            extension,growth in demand,Hydro\n            Power,hydrocarbons,Imports,Income,Inflation,Insurance,kerosene,liquid\n            fuels,market prices,national energy planning,natural\n            forests,Natural Gas,natural gas reserves,Natural\n            Resources,oil,oil companies,oil equivalent,oil\n            imports,opportunity costs,peak demand,Petroleum,Petroleum\n            Exploration,petroleum prices,Petroleum\n            products,pipeline,population growth,Power,power\n            consumption,power distribution,power generation,power\n            markets,power outages,power stations,Power Supply,power\n            system,proven reserves,refined products,renewable\n            energy,Rural Electrification,signs,structural\n            adjustment,structures,tools,transport,urban centers,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"Assessment Program,charcoal,coal\n            production,coal resources,commercial\n            energy,Construction,Demand Forecast,demand growth,domestic\n            energy,domestic natural gas,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic\n            conditions,electric capacity,electric\n            power,Electricity,Electricity Consumption,Electricity\n            Supply,Energy Components,energy conservation,energy\n            consumption,Energy Department,Energy Development,energy\n            enterprises,Energy Management,energy needs,energy\n            planning,Energy Prices,energy resource,Energy\n            Resources,Energy Sector,energy supplies,Energy\n            Supply,Engineering,excavation,exploitation,falling,forestry,Fuel,fuel\n            supply,fuelwood,gas exploration,gas reserves,grid,grid\n            extension,growth in demand,Hydro\n            Power,hydrocarbons,Imports,Income,Inflation,Insurance,kerosene,liquid\n            fuels,market prices,national energy planning,natural\n            forests,Natural Gas,natural gas reserves,Natural\n            Resources,oil,oil companies,oil equivalent,oil\n            imports,opportunity costs,peak demand,Petroleum,Petroleum\n            Exploration,petroleum prices,Petroleum\n            products,pipeline,population growth,Power,power\n            consumption,power distribution,power generation,power\n            markets,power outages,power stations,Power Supply,power\n            system,proven reserves,refined products,renewable\n            energy,Rural Electrification,signs,structural\n            adjustment,structures,tools,transport,urban centers,Water Supply"}},"owner":"WB Off:DaresSalaam-Eastern AFR 1 (AFCE1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"6026"},"facets":{}}}
