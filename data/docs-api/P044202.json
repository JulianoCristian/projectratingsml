World Bank\n            performance is assessed as unsatisfactory, despite the sheer\n            difficulty of successfully implementing projects in\n            Tajikistan. Also depsite the genuine commitment that the\n            supervision team made to ensure that the project was\n            implemented according to World Bank guidelines and with\n            maximum community participation, there was a failure to\n            resolve sufficiently quickly the extremely tense\n            relationship between the World Bank and the Government,\n            especially in year 2000. Borrower performance is rated\n            unsatisfactory for two reasons: 1) the persistent problem of\n            inadequate counterpart funding, and 2) the Government's\n            failure to follow an appropriate selection procedure for the\n            new Executive Director of the Social Investment Fund in Year\n            2000, the appointment of an Executive Director without the\n            Bank's approval, and the refusal of the Government for\n            several months to correct the situation through an\n            acceptable selection process. Some of the lessons learned\n            were: High-level and sustained borrower commitment is of\n            utmost importance. Continuing fiscal continuity facing the\n            country inevitably cause difficulties for the Government in\n            making available sufficient counterpart funds for\n            IDA-supported funds in Tajikistan. Political interference\n            has to be avoided especially when appointing key TASIF\n            staff. The TASIF needs strong management and leadership, and\n            training is critically important."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tajikistan - Pilot Poverty Alleviation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tajikistan - Pilot Poverty\n            Alleviation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/06/1943363/tajikistan-pilot-poverty-alleviation-project","projn":"TJ-Pilot Poverty Alleviation Project -- P044202","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Banks & Banking Reform,Poverty Assessment,Health Economics & Finance,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Tajikistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02071204031915"},"subsc":"Housing construction,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Micro- and SME finance,Other social services,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Social Protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural sector,Bank\n            supervision,beneficiaries,CAS,civil conflict,civil\n            society,community members,community\n            participation,corruption,Currency Unit,development\n            indicators,development programs,donor community,economic\n            activity,economic analysis,economic context,economic\n            decline,Exchange Rate,families,Female-Headed\n            Households,financial management,financial services,FISCAL\n            YEAR,flexibility,group discussions,health\n            services,housing,Human Development,Human Development Sector\n            Unit,ICR,IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT,income,income\n            generation,Institutional Development,Learning,living\n            conditions,local governments,local level,management\n            capacity,managers,NGO,non- governmental\n            organizations,non-governmental organizations,overhead\n            costs,participatory approaches,poor communities,poor\n            households,Poverty Alleviation,Poverty Alleviation\n            Programs,poverty reduction,poverty reduction\n            strategy,productivity,programs,project objectives,public\n            resources,Refugees,safety,Savings,schools,service\n            providers,social assessment,social exclusion,social\n            infrastructure,Social Protection,social\n            services,targeting,Technical Assistance,vulnerable\n            groups,waste,worKing conditions"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural sector,Bank\n            supervision,beneficiaries,CAS,civil conflict,civil\n            society,community members,community\n            participation,corruption,Currency Unit,development\n            indicators,development programs,donor community,economic\n            activity,economic analysis,economic context,economic\n            decline,Exchange Rate,families,Female-Headed\n            Households,financial management,financial services,FISCAL\n            YEAR,flexibility,group discussions,health\n            services,housing,Human Development,Human Development Sector\n            Unit,ICR,IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT,income,income\n            generation,Institutional Development,Learning,living\n            conditions,local governments,local level,management\n            capacity,managers,NGO,non- governmental\n            organizations,non-governmental organizations,overhead\n            costs,participatory approaches,poor communities,poor\n            households,Poverty Alleviation,Poverty Alleviation\n            Programs,poverty reduction,poverty reduction\n            strategy,productivity,programs,project objectives,public\n            resources,Refugees,safety,Savings,schools,service\n            providers,social assessment,social exclusion,social\n            infrastructure,Social Protection,social\n            services,targeting,Technical Assistance,vulnerable\n            groups,waste,worKing conditions"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Unit (ECSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"1":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"2":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"3":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"4":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"}},"trustfund":"TF034260-TAJIKISTAN - PILOT POVERTY\n            ALLEVIATION PROJECT,TF020579-USAID-TAJIKISTAN PILOT POVERTY\n            ALLEVIATION PROJECT,TF025681-PHRD-SECOND POVERTY PROJ.

The Project\n            objectives are to: (1) have a modest though quick impact on\n            the incomes of some of the poor; and (2) develop capacity at\n            the national and local level to implement participatory\n            approaches to poverty alleviation.  The Project's two\n            components are: scaling-up of on-going nongovernmental\n            organization poverty alleviation programs; and developing\n            the Tajikistan Social Investment Fund (TASIF). The first\n            component further consists of: (1) assisting returned\n            families in the self-help reconstruction of their homes ;\n            (2) expanding existing services and extending activities of\n            the micro-credit program to other districts; (3)\n            strengthening the capacity of social services to support\n            female-headed households with access to and ownership of\n            agricultural assets, and with grants for day-are centers and\n            schools; (4) expanding the agricultural reform program; and\n            increasing staple food crop production; and (5) continued\n            sponsoring of these activities, if they or similar programs\n            modeled after them are successful.  The development of the\n            Social Investment Fund has two sub-components.  In the\n            first, TASIF will be developed by providing equipment,\n            vehicles, salaries, operating costs, training, technical\n            assistance, and financing for monitoring
