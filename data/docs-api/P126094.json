(1) Multi-sector\n            multi-donor DPLs are an effective instrument to consolidate\n            the policy dialogue, which is especially valuable in a\n            transition environment. (2) The Bank's bold and\n            strategic decision to focus its program in the immediate\n            aftermath of the revolution has helped accomplish\n            significant results in Tunisia in a very short time. (3)\n            That said, the reforms program supported by the GO DPL was\n            perhaps overly ambitious, given institutional capacity\n            constraints. (4) Single-tranche DPL operations are not well\n            suited for ambitious institutional reforms. (5) An efficient\n            government coordination mechanism with strong leadership and\n            clear responsibility is critical to monitor and sustain the\n            implementation of an ambitious reforms program. (6)\n            Technical assistance is critical, especially in new policy\n            areas where the government does not have\n            expertise/experience and where an innovative approach is\n            required to change administrative practices. (7) A quality\n            M&E framework is needed to effectively assess the\n            progress and outcomes of reforms. (8) The location of the\n            TTL and most of the team in the field, particularly for a\n            complex operation involving other co-financiers based in the\n            field, is essential to efficiently and continuously interact\n            with the authorities and donors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Governance and Opportunity\n            Development Policy Loan

In January 2011 Tunisia\n            experienced an unprecedented and spontaneous wave of\n            protests, fueled by persistent lack of social and political\n            inclusion, anger over governance and corruption problems,\n            and mounting frustration over unemployment and food\n            inflation.
