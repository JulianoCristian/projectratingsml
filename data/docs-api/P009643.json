Both projects were\n            completed in 1978 and audited by Operations Evaluation\n            Department (OED) in 1979. These projects were the first\n            Bank-supported seed projects and are the first to be the\n            subject of an impact evaluation. The main objective in both\n            projects was to stimulate food grain production by improving\n            seed availability of the new high yielding varieties (HYV).\n            The Impact Study finds that, on balance, both projects have\n            been successful in achieving their broad objectives,\n            although adequate data are not available to confirm or\n            reject the rate of return estimates of the appraisals and\n            the Project Performance Appraisal Repot (PCRs). Important\n            lessons learned from these projects are as follows: (i)\n            Initial demand for certified seed depends primarily on a\n            source of new already proven high yielding germ plasm. In\n            these projects, the plant breeding research of International\n            Center for Maize and Wheat Improvement (CIMMYT) on wheat and\n            International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) on rice, and\n            their continued cooperation with national institutions, was\n            a key element in justifying the expansion of processing\n            capacity for the seed industry. However, the lack of\n            outstanding new HYV in recent years has constrained the\n            demand for certified seed. (ii) Surges in seed demand may\n            occur from time to time as the result of a build-up of\n            damaging insects or disease organisms such as occurred in\n            Indonesia with Brown Plant Hopper (BPH) and the virus\n            diseases for which it is the vector. Over time, a series of\n            varieties with improved genetic resistance have been bred\n            and released to seed producers, and these have provided a\n            series of demand surges for processed seed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India and Indonesia -
