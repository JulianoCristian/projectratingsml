Both World\n            Bank and Borrower performances are rated satisfactory.\n            Project experience also suggests several lessons. First,\n            strong monitoring and evaluation programs--clear and\n            measurable indicators that are systematicaly collected over\n            time--are essential to assess program impact and to improve\n            the effectiveness of future interventions. Second, the\n            socio-political environment has a strong influence on the\n            effectiveness of national HIV/STI prevention programs. The\n            Bank and partners can contribute /to strengthened political\n            commitment by promoting dialogue with and among political\n            leaders and other stakeholders, but this tends to be a\n            long-term process. Third, decentralizing project activities\n            to district level can improve local implementation, but\n            needs to be accompanied by capacity building and\n            institutional reforms to give districts greater autonomy\n            over planning and budgeting. Finally projects planning to\n            finance nongovernmental organizations/community activities\n            need to develop clear modalities for doing so, and develop\n            strategies to ensure that high-risk groups are targeted and\n            that mechanisms are in place for monitoring, evaluation, and\n            sharing lessons."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Sexually Transmitted

substantial. Lessons highlight the need for clear\n            project objectives at appraisal, when the development\n            objectives depend on implementation of a broad program,\n            enhanced by an appropriate design which should include both\n            a project, and program monitoring criteria, including the\n            joint review arrangements of the program by the cooperating\n            partners. Such monitoring, and evaluation requires\n            measurable, verifiable indicators for a fair assessment of\n            project performance. Moreover, on addressing sexually\n            transmitted diseases (STD), and HIV/AIDS epidemic, a shift\n            from the narrow biomedical paradigm to a development one is\n            required. Underlying the biological transmission of HIV, and\n            STDs is a huge issue of social vulnerability, thus a\n            programmatic approach is better suited to consolidate\n            efforts, aimed at reducing, and mitigating the impact of the\n            epidemic, focused on the underlying vulnerability issues.\n            Greater efforts are also needed to involve both the private\n            sector in the provision of services, and public-private\n            partnerships collaborative efforts in sharing costs,\n            emphasizing the promotion of an enabling sociopolitical\n            environment. In addition, decentralized project\n            implementation requires strong political commitment, and the\n            decentralization of fiscal responsibility should be matched\n            with authority, carefully supported by institutional\n            capacity building. Finally, financial management should\n            develop mechanisms for financing nongovernmental\n            organizations, and, financial accounts, and reporting\n            requirement systems should be recorded in a uniformed manner."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Sexually Transmitted Infections Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Sexually Transmitted\n            Infections
