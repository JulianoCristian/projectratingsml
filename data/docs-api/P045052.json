Some lessons learned included: field surveys\n            should always be used to complement computerized modeling of\n            engineering designs of roads in a mountainous terrain.\n            Engineering designs of new roads in RMDP relied exclusively\n            on computerized modeling and were not accompanied by field\n            surveys. As a result, they had many flaws and were\n            inappropriate for local conditions. The revision of designs\n            and tender documents of respective civil works triggered\n            substantial cost and time overruns in individual contracts.\n            Autonomy of a Roads Board is important to ensure stable and\n            adequate funding of road maintenance. Experience in the\n            South Asia region suggests that creation of a Roads Board is\n            not in itself sufficient for efficient and effective\n            mobilization and management of maintenance funds. The\n            structure of the Board must be such that it can work\n            effectively taking into account the prevailing political\n            context. Involvement of technical staff in reporting is\n            essential for effective financial management. RMDP\n            experience suggests that a close collaboration between\n            technical and financial management staff creates linkages\n            between physical progress and financial progress and thus is\n            important to ensure satisfactory financial management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Road Maintenance and Development
