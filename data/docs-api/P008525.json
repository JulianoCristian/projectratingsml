The\n            objectives of the Loan were to: (i) assist the Government in\n            the design and implementation of the stabilization and\n            structural reform program outlined in the Memorandum of\n            Economic Reform Policies (MERP); and (ii) help reduce\n            further sharp declines in economic activity in key sectors\n            during the initial phase of transition. Overall Bank\n            performance during implementation is considered to be\n            satisfactory. The Borrower's performance was fully\n            satisfactory in implementing this Loan. The key lessons\n            learned from this project were as follows: (i) policy\n            targets for achieving specific stabilization and structural\n            reforms need to be realistic to require less need for\n            adjustment during Loan implementation; (ii) in designing\n            future loans for similar purposes for countries in\n            transition, Bank management may wish to consider whether\n            more flexible procurement procedures could be employed; (iv)\n            the appointment of well qualified procurement and\n            disbursement advisors to provide overall project management\n            support and training of local counterparts in a project\n            implementation unit is very important for the success\n            of' an
