Some lessons learned included:\n            delays in meeting the new procurement legislation target\n            resulted in part from the fact that this sub-component of\n            the project piggy-bagged on a reform being prepared under a\n            project by another donor, over which the Bank had no\n            control. The Bank has to ensure that procurement and\n            financial management training is provided to the Project\n            Coordinating Unit (PCU) as needed. The scope of Bank\n            programs in small states deserves further discussion. On the\n            one hand, since only one project is prepared in a multi-year\n            period, both the Government and the Bank tend to include\n            many activities in the program. On the other hand, these\n            countries have usually tight capacity constraints, which\n            call for relatively simple and highly selective programs.\n            Leveraging donor funds can benefit the client by increasing\n            substantially the size of the project. However, the added\n            coordination efforts impose costs on all sides. Thus, it is\n            important to make sure that all are in the same wave length\n            throughout implementation, to ensure that the program is\n            properly monitored and coordination costs minimized. With\n            hindsight, it seems that having the PCU working in close\n            collaboration with the Ministry of Finance improved its\n            access to other implementing agencies and facilitated\n            execution of the program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominica - Growth and Social Protection\n            Technical Assistance Credit

The project has five components that will\n            make this possible. The first is making the public sector\n            more efficient and effective and this will be done by\n            strengthening the reform management unit; strengthening\n            customs; modernization of registry; and strengthening of the\n            fiduciary capacity. The second component is improving the\n            investment climate. This will be achieved by the development\n            and implementation of both a national investment strategy\n            and national action plan. The third component consists of\n            reforming the regulatory framework for the energy sector.\n            This involves the establishment of a national regulatory\n            commission and the drafting of alternative energy\n            legislation.

The final component is project\n            management which involves financing the operation of the\n            small project coordinating unit integrated within the\n            establishment,
