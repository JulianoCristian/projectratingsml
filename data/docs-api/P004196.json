Government's signing on, without\n            adequate analysis, to supply driven development programs\n            contributed significantly to the unsatisfactory achievements\n            of the project. Highly centralized decision-making and a\n            confused and changing policy framework contributed to the\n            unsatisfactory project outcome. The main lessons learned\n            from this project include: 1) In designing a large sectoral\n            project with multi-donor funding, it is essential that the\n            institutional, administrative, and financial arrangements\n            are uniform, and set realistic targets for the project\n            period and linkages among project components or\n            sub-programs. 2) It is vital that Government policy\n            framework and institutional arrangements be adequately\n            analyzed during project design, to fully understand the\n            implications of proposed model development and ensure\n            willingness to modify policy in light of pilot experience.\n            3) Village-based forest management benefits not only rural\n            communities, but also the Government, through more efficient\n            collection of royalties and taxes, improved forest\n            protection and sustainable management, and enhanced rural\n            development. 4) In piloting the Integrated Conservation and\n            Development (ICAD) process, less attention should be paid to\n            the academic and philosophic intricacies of ICAD conceptual\n            models and more attention to winning the confidence of the\n            community and local government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Laos - Forest Management and Conservation

As the first of several\n            sequential operations that IDA may support in Lao PDR over\n            the next 10-15 years, the project will focus at this stage\n            on completing forestry sector reforms, developing the\n            Department of Forestry's operational capacity, and\n            implementing programs in forest inventory and planning,\n            sustainable forest management and protection, and\n            establishment of protected forest areas for biodiversity\n            conservation. Specifically, the five-year project will\n            support: (a) implementation of an appropriate institutional\n            framework and formulation of the necessary regulatory\n            framework for the forestry sector; (b) implementation of\n            national programs in forest resource inventory and planning,\n            sustainable forest management and protection, and\n            establishment and management of protected forest areas; (c)\n            human resource development; and (d) technical assistance.\n            The Global Environmental Trust Fund will finance the\n            protected areas activities, including technical assistance\n            and human resource development.
