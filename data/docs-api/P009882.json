Furthermore, the project was\n            instrumental in promoting vegetative methods of soil, and\n            water conservation. Several key lessons are conveyed by the\n            project, namely, that addressing the communities'\n            priorities proved successful, for, following the Mid-term\n            Review, special attention was given to water supply\n            provision for rural communities, in direct response to the\n            villagers request. And, while considerations for natural\n            breeding centers were geographically correct, the response\n            from villagers proved the contrary, for bulls were lightly\n            used in the area. A degree of flexibility in project design\n            is needed, particularly for participatory projects, for this\n            flexibility, enabled the project to be broadened according\n            to the communities' needs, consequently, achieving a\n            greater community commitment.

The main project objective is to slow and reverse\n            degradation of the natural environment through soil and\n            moisture conservation technology.  This will improve\n            production and income from grain crops, horticulture,\n            fodder, fiber, fuelwood and livestock.  It will also reduce\n            flooding caused by degradation.
