The\n            financial sector was in shambles, and people had little\n            confidence in the banking system. Many state-owned companies\n            were heavily indebted and lacked adequate corporate\n            governance. These problems were combined with hyperinflation\n            and high unemployment. The World Bank has helped Serbia\n            restructure the banking sector and privatize enterprises to\n            foster private sector growth and job creation. Because of\n            the interconnectedness of the two sectors, these challenges\n            had to be tackled simultaneously.

The\n            overall performance of both the World Bank and the Borrower\n            are rated satisfactory. These were some of the lessons\n            learned:  Drawing the lessons from Bank's past\n            experience is essential. The task team made a particular\n            effort to study and apply the right lessons from past\n            experience with bank restructuring and enterprise sector\n            reform in transition economies, while at the same time\n            adjusting it to the special conditions of the borrower with\n            the help of the borrower's team. In particular, the\n            recognition of the need for a clean and transparent\n            privatization process and for tailoring the reform design to\n            the specific features and economic culture of the country\n            has produced a hard-hitting and results-focused yet\n            realistic reform program. The program's sustainability\n            derives as much from its technical soundness as from the\n            accommodation of societal expectations, and its\n            effectiveness is less likely to be marred by the perverse\n            distributional and corruption impacts that tainted so many\n            of the earlier interventions in some transition economies.\n            Transition experience has shown that an integrated approach\n            is needed to reform the  enterprise and financial sectors.\n            Under the project program, financial sector reforms aim to\n            boost financial intermediation, and encourage domestic\n            savings, generating the much needed working capital and\n            investment finance needed for the real sector to expand. At\n            the same time, the privatization of socially-owned\n            enterprises and a more vibrant small and medium enterprise\n            sector supported by the improved business-enabling\n            environment, are expected to lay the basis for sustainable\n            growth. Very importantly, the reforms need to be sequenced\n            with the government's efforts, to provide adequate\n            social protection for those displaced by restructuring and\n            privatization. Another key lesson is the need for careful\n            sequencing of the more immediate structural reforms in the\n            enterprise and financial sector with the long-term efforts\n            aimed at creating a modern regulatory and institutional\n            framework for sustainable economic growth.  Reform\n            implementation is heavily dependent on effective champions.\n            It is equally important that reform champions be well\n            advised in the actions they do take. The willingness of the\n            key actors at the National Bank of Yugoslavia and Ministry\n            of Finance and Economy to take dramatic action and close a\n            large number of banks enabled key steps forward in the\n            restructuring of the banking sector. Similarly, effective\n            management of the privatization program facilitated the\n            rapid progress in the reform of socially-owned sector. While\n            there can be no guarantees of tenure of political\n            appointments such as ministers, it is important to have as\n            clear a picture as possible of any potential problems.\n            Placing qualified and experienced advisers to assist reform\n            champions, and providing assistance to educate and\n            coordinate across a government may contribute significantly\n            to the success of reform efforts. Other lessons point to the\n            ability to provide extensive technical assistance on a\n            timely basis has been enormously important in enabling the\n            PFSAC to achieve its objectives, the benefit of good\n            Economic and Sector reporting . (The Country Economic\n            Memorandum, \"Breaking with the Past,\" helped the\n            government to focus on key reforms, and enabled government\n            and the Bank to work together on defining priority reforms\n            to be included in this project); and the need to ensure\n            sufficient attention is paid to ensuring that the Borrower\n            fully understands the fiduciary provisions. Regarding the\n            latter, the Bank should provide adequate training and\n            support to the borrower during project preparation and\n            maintain an active dialogue on fiduciary requirements to\n            make certain the credit proceeds are handled properly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Serbia and Montenegro (Formerly Yugoslavia)\n            - Private and Financial

Adjustment Credit (PFSAC) will support the governments of\n            the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) and its largest\n            constituent republic, the Republic of Serbia, in\n            implementing financial and enterprise sector reforms seeking\n            to significantly accelerate private sector-led-growth\n            through: 1) strengthening the financial system by\n            liquidating troubled banks and improving the environment\n            under which banks operate; 2) privatizing and restructuring\n            socially-owned enterprises that crowd out private sector\n            growth, hamper banking sector recovery, and incur\n            significant fiscal and quasi-fiscal costs; and 3) improving\n            the investment climate and business enabling environment.\n            Implementation of continued structural reforms will enhance\n            Serbia's prospects for growth, and will reinforce the\n            sustainability of its macroeconomic stabilization. The main\n            benefit of the Credit will be faster private sector growth\n            and job creation, supported by a healthier and more\n            developed financial system. A significant risk to the PFSAC\n            is the global economic downturn that could deter the\n            potential private capital inflows to Serbia, affecting the\n            success of the tender and auction privatization. Additional\n            risks could arise from what is perceived by prospective\n            investors as continued political instability in the Balkan region."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Federal Republic of
