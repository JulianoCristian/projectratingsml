Ratings for the Second\n            Health Sector Reform Project are as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was negligible\n            low; and the performance of the Bank and the Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned from the projects included: 1)\n            the political economy of health sector reform inevitably\n            creates both winners and losers. Early and comprehensive\n            anticipation of stakeholder interests, institutional\n            analysis to facilitate understanding of those interests, and\n            the generation of a coherent plan to build support for\n            reform and to persuade and/or co-opt potential opponents is\n            essential; 2) the Bank should not, however, underestimate\n            the potential leverage wielded by its financing and\n            expertise; 3) one effective mechanism for countering\n            political resistance to reform is strong and consistent\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), where analytic results\n            can be generated and disseminated rapidly and effectively,\n            building support for project activities in a politically\n            contentious environment; 4) another important tool for\n            overcoming political resistance to reform is the engagement\n            with civil society organizations that give health\n            professionals and users of the health care system a voice in\n            the decision process and a clear sense of affiliation and\n            identity; and 5) tradeoffs between efficiency,\n            equity/access, and quality of care will not be addressed in\n            the absence of explicit and consistent attention to the\n            balance between them and interventions to correct imbalances."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Health Sector Reform;\n            Second Health Sector Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kyrgyz Republic

impacts substantial, while both\n            the Bank, and Borrower performances are rated highly\n            satisfactory. The success of the project lies mostly, on\n            that the health reforms, however complex, addressed both the\n            imminent financing, and delivery of health services, which\n            simplistic solutions alone, only addressing one element of\n            the health sector could not have accomplished. Lessons\n            contributing to the success of the project feature a strong\n            government commitment, institutional capacity and high\n            technical skills (namely, a strong technical committee able\n            to negotiate with key players in the health system), and, a\n            well coordinated technical assistance, supported by timely\n            Bank interventions, with attention to institutional\n            development in the context of health reforms. However,\n            regardless of success, lessons address weaknesses and\n            challenges. Health outcomes were poorly defined, unclear for\n            planning a baseline, and follow-up survey, including limited\n            data to cross-validate findings, conducive to an ill-defined\n            project evaluation which would have allowed determining\n            impacts in terms of intermediate health indicators, and\n            outcomes. Nonetheless, identification of this issue during\n            implementation, allowed for stronger monitoring and\n            evaluation criteria in the follow-up operation. In addition,\n            allocation of counterpart funds was affected due to the\n            economic crisis in Russia, and budget management problems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Health Sector Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kyrgyz Republic -
