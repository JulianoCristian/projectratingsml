These lessons should help in preparing\n            future similar projects: Instability in the macro-economic\n            environment has a substantial impact on financial\n            intermediary lending. Where such instability arises after\n            project implementation commences, there is a self-correcting\n            mechanism built into the line of credit since demand for\n            credit slows down due to higher interest rates and lower\n            demand for products. However, where there is frequent\n            volatility in the macro environment, the Bank needs to work\n            with the Borrower in assessing the impact on the private\n            sector and, if appropriate, finding a mutually agreed method\n            of scaling down or terminating the line of credit. Second,\n            project appraisal needs to address design issues at the\n            component level, and in the case of multi-component\n            projects, linkages across components. Specific assessments\n            should be undertaken of the Borrower's institutional\n            capacity. Project covenants should be based on these\n            appraisals of Borrower capacity. Further, project\n            administration, and financial management and procurement\n            procedures need to be explicitly documented in a Project\n            Implementation Plan. Finally, in the case financial\n            intermediation operations, monitoring indicators should\n            include the financial viability not only of sub-projects,\n            but also of institutions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Financial Sector and Enterprise\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malawi - Financial Sector and\n            Enterprise
