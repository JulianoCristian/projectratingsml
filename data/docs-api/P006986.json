This, however, will imply an unlikely decline in hotel\n            operating efficiency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic - Second Puerto Plata\n            Tourism Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Dominican Republic - Second\n            Puerto Plata Tourism Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1979/04/726598/dominican-republic-second-puerto-plata-tourism-project","projn":"DO-Tourism Ii-270318 -- P006986","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Tourism and Ecotourism,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,International Terrorism & Counterterrorism,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Conflict and Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","count":"Dominican Republic","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_9810191244328"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other urban development","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Conflict and Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accommodation\n            facilities,accommodations,agriculture,balance of\n            payments,Bank of Canada,beaches,capital city,Central\n            Bank,contractual arrangements,credit risk,cruise,cruise\n            arrivals,cruise ships,cruise visitors,Cultural\n            Heritage,debt,destinations,Director of\n            Tourism,dividends,Economic Analysis,economic growth,economic\n            impact,employment,equity capital,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,exports,FISCAL YEAR,foreign banks,foreign\n            capital,foreign exchange,foreign investors,foreign\n            visitors,growth of tourism,hotels,import duty\n            exemptions,imports,income,income taxes,inflation,inflation\n            rates,interest rate,interest rates,land\n            development,legislation,leisure,lending rates,loan\n            financing,local authorities,luxury hotels,mines,mortgage\n            banks,new hotels,passengers,pensions,portfolio,Price\n            increases,private commercial banks,profitability,promotional\n            campaign,resorts,savings,Sewage,subsidiary,technical\n            assistance,tenders,Tourism,tourism asset,tourism\n            assets,Tourism Development,tourism facilities,tourism\n            infrastructure,Tourism investors,tourism policies,tourism\n            potential,TOURISM SECTOR,tourism trade,tourist,tourist\n            accommodations,tourist information,tourist\n            services,tourists,transport,vacation,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accommodation\n            facilities,accommodations,agriculture,balance of\n            payments,Bank of Canada,beaches,capital city,Central\n            Bank,contractual arrangements,credit risk,cruise,cruise\n            arrivals,cruise ships,cruise visitors,Cultural\n            Heritage,debt,destinations,Director of\n            Tourism,dividends,Economic Analysis,economic growth,economic\n            impact,employment,equity capital,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,exports,FISCAL YEAR,foreign banks,foreign\n            capital,foreign exchange,foreign investors,foreign\n            visitors,growth of tourism,hotels,import duty\n            exemptions,imports,income,income taxes,inflation,inflation\n            rates,interest rate,interest rates,land\n            development,legislation,leisure,lending rates,loan\n            financing,local authorities,luxury hotels,mines,mortgage\n            banks,new hotels,passengers,pensions,portfolio,Price\n            increases,private commercial banks,profitability,promotional\n            campaign,resorts,savings,Sewage,subsidiary,technical\n            assistance,tenders,Tourism,tourism asset,tourism\n            assets,Tourism Development,tourism facilities,tourism\n            infrastructure,Tourism investors,tourism policies,tourism\n            potential,TOURISM SECTOR,tourism trade,tourist,tourist\n            accommodations,tourist information,tourist\n            services,tourists,transport,vacation,working capital"}},"owner":"Caribbean Countries CMU (LCC3C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"}},"repnb":"2419"},"facets":{}}}
