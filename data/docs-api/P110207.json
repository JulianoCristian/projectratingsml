Some lessons\n            learned included: for civil works contracts under execution,\n            it is important for the Borrower's contract managers to\n            supervise the contractor regularly (such as weekly) to\n            establish the capacity/readiness of the contractor. The\n            frequency of visits can be increased or reduced depending\n            upon the contractor's strengths or other measures taken\n            for noted poor performance. Adequately engaging key\n            parliamentarians about the project's broad scope and\n            the varied and persistent nature of the threats addressed\n            under the project could have potentially facilitated an\n            expedited and favorable consideration of the project in\n            Parliament.

Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection and other zoo\n            noses and to prepare for, control, and respond effectively\n            to future Avian and Human Influenza (AHI) pandemics and\n            other infectious disease emergencies in livestock and\n            humans. Negative impacts includes: vegetation\n            clearance/removal; noise and vibrations from construction\n            works; dust; soil erosion; exhaust fumes from construction\n            equipment and vehicles; generation of health care waste that\n            may be infectious; and poor handling of health care waste.\n            Mitigation measures includes: 1) limit vegetation clearance\n            only to the construction site; 2) all construction\n            activities should follow national construction guidelines\n            and regulations; 3) sprinkle construction site with water\n            particularly during hot, dry and windy conditions; 4)\n            fertile topsoil should be removed, stored in an isolated\n            place and covered with plastic to prevent runoff/erosion; 5)\n            use appropriate methods of handling suspected cases; 6) use\n            appropriate methods for healthcare waste collection,\n            storage,
