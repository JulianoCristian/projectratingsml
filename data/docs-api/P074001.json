Some lessons learned\n            included: the projects with limited and targeted objectives,\n            which are firmly embedded in the Borrower's reform\n            priorities and offer both judicial training and\n            infrastructure enhancement can, provide both the physical\n            and human capacity foundations necessary for substantially\n            new court systems. The projects must offer flexibility while\n            not being overly-ambitious. Careful attention must be given\n            to what is relevant and attainable in the context of a\n            country's legal reform efforts. Full achievement of\n            project outcomes often can only be accurately measured well\n            after the closing of an individual intervention, raising\n            potential problems with using the Learn Investment Loan\n            (LIL) as the best investment vehicle for such projects.\n            Projects offering grants can provide assistance in\n            supporting priority research topics, increasing access to\n            legal databases and reforming legal training curricula. The\n            project team might have injected more of a sense of urgency\n            in the early stages of the implementation of the legal\n            curriculum reform activities which were late in getting\n            underway. The Bank, using its well recognized comparative\n            advantage as an effective convener, especially in leading\n            donor coordination, and having access to global knowledge,\n            might have accelerated the start of the curriculum reform\n            activities by organizing an international conference on the\n            subject. The lack of a robust monitoring and evaluation\n            system and its dependent baseline data deprive otherwise\n            good projects of the possibility of being systematically\n            reviewed and its performance judged. Staffing of Bank\n            supervision missions should include those with specialized\n            skills. Additional technical skills, beyond those currently\n            found among the Bank staff will strengthen such supervision\n            and could provide valuable benefits to the Borrower's\n            own legal and training advisory groups. Bank supervision\n            budgets may have to be augmented in order to add appropriate\n            consultants to critical supervision missions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mongolia - Justice Sector Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mongolia -
