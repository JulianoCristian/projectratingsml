There were\n            eight lessons learned: 1) Direct investment support was\n            provided to farmers through a systematic small grants\n            program, coupled with facilitation and training built\n            entrepreneurial capacity through a learning-by-doing\n            approach. 2) Participatory planning along with village and\n            household budget limits was an effective mechanism for\n            villagers to prioritize and assess risks of various options,\n            as well as allocate resources. 3) A multi-stakeholder\n            approach to project implementation was worthwhile even in\n            the Tajik context where limited prior experience and local\n            conditions made management challenging. 4) Right of Use of\n            Land Certificates is key for sustainability, especially for\n            land-related subprojects. 5) Although it was not in the\n            Project objectives to address broader policy and legal\n            issues related to pastures and rangelands, sustainable\n            rangeland management will require policy and legal support\n            informed by practical, field-based examples and experiences\n            such as those implemented in the Community Agriculture and\n            Watershed Management Project. 6) Research and demonstration\n            of appropriate technologies can be integrated differently at\n            Project design. 7) The Project would have benefitted from\n            greater marketing expertise (e.g., value chain development,\n            association formation). 8) Female participation can be\n            strengthened through additional processes during planning."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tajikistan - Community Agriculture and\n
