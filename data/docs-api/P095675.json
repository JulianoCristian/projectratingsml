Lessons learned from\n            the project are: 1) deep legal and institutional reforms may\n            require sector specific operations rather than development\n            policy loans (DPLs) with large number of reform areas. This\n            DPL series, as is the case with many other DPLs, covered too\n            many reform areas: four sectors (logistics, business\n            environment, financial sector and innovation) with 15\n            components and each of them with a number of outputs and\n            outcomes; 2) the quality of the technical analysis\n            underpinning a policy based operation is crucial to engage\n            the borrower's commitment to the reform agenda.\n            Extensive analytical work done by the Bank provided the\n            diagnosis and policy recommendations that were incorporated\n            into the Government's growth program.; and 3) selection\n            of outcome indicators for a series of programmatic loans\n            should include medium-term results as well as long term\n            results, to allow for an assessment of the results if fewer\n            loans materialize than initially envisaged. A number of\n            outcome indicators for the two growth DPLs were designed\n            with the expectation that there was going to be three\n            consecutive operations, and that the expected outcomes would\n            be met at the end of the third one."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - First and Second Programmatic Loan\n            for Sustainable and Equitable Growth
