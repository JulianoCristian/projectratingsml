The PDO of maintaining or\n            improving SMEs' access to medium term finance was kept\n            simple and realistic. Onerous safeguard and fiduciary\n            requirements slow down project implementation. Reevaluating\n            safeguard and fiduciary requirements in the context of\n            credit lines and designing information requirements to\n            minimize compliance costs, while serving the safeguard\n            objectives, will help ensure successful implementation. A\n            solid monitoring and evaluation framework helps demonstrate\n            the sustainability and long-term impact of credit lines.\n            Flexibility during project design and implementation is\n            critical to successful outcomes. As noted, the flexibility\n            of changing some procurement procedures made a difference in\n            speeding up project implementation. Significant capacity\n            building of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and\n            Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) to comply with\n            the project's requirements is essential before the\n            project begins and early in its implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Access to Finance for Small and\n            Medium Enterprises
