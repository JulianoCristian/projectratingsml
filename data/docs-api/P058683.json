Lessons\n            learned from the project: There is a need to be flexible and\n            responsive with respect to sub-project selection and\n            procurement arrangements-simplifying procedures and\n            decentralizing responsibility to the extent possible. The\n            issue related to lack of local contribution for water\n            connections in Bidya underlines the importance of obtaining\n            firm commitments from local partners prior to implementing\n            components that depend on their inputs. Significant capacity\n            building can be achieved even during crisis and, in fact,\n            partly because of crisis. The experience with the accounting\n            systems reform over two projects (MIDP-1 and 2) demonstrates\n            that significant learning can take place. Significant\n            progress can be made even in a very difficult environment if\n            adequate local leadership exists. Building good Monitoring\n            and Evaluation System including relevant set of indicators\n            that enables proper monitoring, regular updating and\n            capabilities of
