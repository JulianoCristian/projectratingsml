The project achieved\n            its technical objectives, its impact has been significant,\n            sustainability is likely, and both the Bank and Borrower\n            performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, the CEB (Ceylon Electricity Board)\n            should assess the feasibility of installing radiator cooling\n            in anticipation of restricted access to unpolluted and\n            sufficient sources of natural cooling water. Second, the\n            timely amendment of the performance bond clause of the\n            contract would have avoided the accrual of the large amount\n            of retention monies and allowed the remaining funds in the\n            loan account to be largely disbursed. Third, running the\n            diesels sparingly has reduced the possibility of overcoming\n            teething problems before the plant is required to run at a\n            high load factor and has limited training opportunities,\n            which will increase the risk factor in future operation at\n            high load. Fourth, reporting on project execution and\n            accounting was inadequate and needs to be improved. Fifth,\n            the possibility of future problems stemming from the use of\n            potable water for cooling should have been anticipated and\n            alternatives explored. Lastly, the CEB should implement a\n            program to recruit and retain experienced staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Eighth (Diesel) Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - Eighth (Diesel) Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1988/04/738938/sri-lanka-eighth-diesel-power-project","projn":"LK-Power VIII (Diesel) -- P010176","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Energy Technology & Transmission,Environmental Economics & Policies,Business in Development,Banks & Banking Reform,Business Environment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Sri Lanka","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960925134300"},"subsc":"(Historic)Thermal","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,Accounting\n            Systems,Accounts,Accounts Receivable,Accumulated\n            Depreciation,audited accounts,audits,autonomy,Balance\n            Sheet,balance sheets,bid\n            documents,billing,budgeting,capitalization,contractors,cost\n            savings,Current Assets,Debt,depreciation,economic\n            activity,economic growth,Electricity,electricity\n            demand,Electricity Generation,employment,energy\n            consumption,financial management,FINANCIAL\n            PERFORMANCE,financial reporting,Fiscal Year,Fixed\n            Asset,foreign exchange,income statements,INSTITUTIONAL\n            DEVELOPMENT,internal audit,inventory,legal provisions,local\n            authorities,LRMC,marginal cost,operating costs,Operating\n            Expenses,operating income,Operating Ratio,overhead,overhead\n            costs,pollution,Power,Power\n            Projects,procurement,reorganization,reporting,reporting\n            procedures,resource mobilization,Retained\n            Earnings,Revaluation Surplus,sales,voltage,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,Accounting\n            Systems,Accounts,Accounts Receivable,Accumulated\n            Depreciation,audited accounts,audits,autonomy,Balance\n            Sheet,balance sheets,bid\n            documents,billing,budgeting,capitalization,contractors,cost\n            savings,Current Assets,Debt,depreciation,economic\n            activity,economic growth,Electricity,electricity\n            demand,Electricity Generation,employment,energy\n            consumption,financial management,FINANCIAL\n            PERFORMANCE,financial reporting,Fiscal Year,Fixed\n            Asset,foreign exchange,income statements,INSTITUTIONAL\n            DEVELOPMENT,internal audit,inventory,legal provisions,local\n            authorities,LRMC,marginal cost,operating costs,Operating\n            Expenses,operating income,Operating Ratio,overhead,overhead\n            costs,pollution,Power,Power\n            Projects,procurement,reorganization,reporting,reporting\n            procedures,resource mobilization,Retained\n            Earnings,Revaluation Surplus,sales,voltage,water supply"}},"owner":"SAS","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"7181"},"723109":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1982/06/723109/sri-lanka-eighth-diesel-power-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1982/06/723109/sri-lanka-eighth-diesel-power-project","new_url":"1982/06/723109/sri-lanka-eighth-diesel-power-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/06/08/000178830_98101902401624/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/06/08/000178830_98101902401624/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2187","datestored":"2000-06-08T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1982-06-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Eighth (Diesel) Power Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project aims at constructing an 80\n            MW diesel station as a least cost solution to help CEB meet\n            both the short-term power shortage through mid-1984 and the\n            long-term need for thermal generation through 1990.
