Some lessons learned included: 1) to sustain\n            outcomes in a situation where new concepts and processes are\n            introduced, the focus on institutional development needs to\n            be maintained during the project and beyond. The risk to dam\n            safety in this project remains moderate or\n            substantial/considerable due to relatively lower attention\n            to institutional development vis-a-vis physical activities\n            during implementation and inadequate follow-up thereafter;\n            2) new regulatory institutions require technical expertise\n            and adequate operating budgets to function in a capable and\n            independent manner. In this project, shortage of\n            experienced/qualified staff and inadequate operating budgets\n            contributed to under-performance of the dam safety\n            regulatory unit; 3) building dam safety institutions can be\n            a long process when it requires major changes in\n            organizational attitudes, establishing new work methods, and\n            upgrading technical expertise. In such cases, the Bank\n            should consider an extended commitment through a sequence of\n            projects or through adaptable program lending (APL); and 4)\n            new techniques and equipment should be tailored to the\n            existing level of capacity; facilities and funds for ongoing\n            maintenance; and site security.

As in the\n            case of India, the introduction of dam safety institutions\n            creates requirements for unfamiliar technical specialist\n            skills, a need for both a technical and regulatory\n            management focus and coordination between the national level\n            and the now functionally-independent provinces. Although\n            many institutional teething problems were encountered and\n            substantial legal and performance upgrading is still\n            required, a strong start has been made in the institutional\n            area.  Lessons of general and technical significance of this\n            project are:   1) There is a need for realistic project\n            preparation and design. 2) The project design should have\n            given more emphasis to initial effective capacity-building\n            before commencing the Basic Dam Safety Facility (BDSF) and\n            Remedial Works components. 3) The determination of\n            hydrological criteria for Probably Maximum Precipitation\n            (PMPs) in different climates takes time and requires special\n            study.  4) Engineering of dams is a specialized subject.\n            Appropriate quality assurance arrangements need to be in\n            place through an improvement of implementing agency\n            management or the use of proper technical assistance with\n            adequate powers and authority (task concept) to manage the\n            design and construction phase. Frequent rotation of\n            engineers and technicians involved in dams should be\n            avoided. Those staff must have adequate training and\n            experience. Training in dam safety should be\n            institutionalized so that all engineers working with dams\n            undergo specific personnel capacity-building training. 5) It\n            is important to establish priorities for remedial works\n            investments, and appropriate risk analysis needs to be used,\n            based on public hazard and dam safety condition criteria. 6)\n            The preparation team should have been instructed not to\n            accept the MPW Inspectorate General as the source for\n            technical audit, as this unit is a financial auditor and\n            incapable of undertaking technical audits, even with\n            technical assistance. 7) A model Operation and Maintenance\n            Manual incorporating dam safety considerations needs to be\n            prepared early in the project for guidance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Dam Safety Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Dam Safety Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/11/3052521/indonesia-dam-safety-project","projn":"ID-Dam Safety Project -- P004010","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Water Resources Law,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Engineering,Dams and Reservoirs,Water Law","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20040324165340"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"audits,civil works,community\n            participation,construction,Dam,dam engineering,dam\n            experience,dam failures,dam maintenance,dam management,Dam\n            Monitoring,dam owners,Dam Safety,dam safety engineering,dam\n            safety management,dam safety\n            program,Dams,DATES,dikes,drainage,Electricity,engineering,engineering,engineers,Environmental\n            Impact,Environmental Impact\n            Assessment,Groundwater,hazards,hydroelectric\n            dams,Irrigation,jurisdiction,large dam,long-term\n            sustainability,management,mitigation measures,Natural\n            Resources,program management,programs,Public Works,Quality\n            Assurance,reasonableness,River Basin,river basins,safeguard\n            policies,safety engineering,safety\n            management,signs,structures,Water Resources,Water Resources\n            Development,Water Resources Management,Watershed"},"1":{"cdata!":"audits,civil works,community\n            participation,construction,Dam,dam engineering,dam\n            experience,dam failures,dam maintenance,dam management,Dam\n            Monitoring,dam owners,Dam Safety,dam safety engineering,dam\n            safety management,dam safety\n            program,Dams,DATES,dikes,drainage,Electricity,engineering,engineering,engineers,Environmental\n            Impact,Environmental Impact\n            Assessment,Groundwater,hazards,hydroelectric\n            dams,Irrigation,jurisdiction,large dam,long-term\n            sustainability,management,mitigation measures,Natural\n            Resources,program management,programs,Public Works,Quality\n            Assurance,reasonableness,River Basin,river basins,safeguard\n            policies,safety engineering,safety\n            management,signs,structures,Water Resources,Water Resources\n            Development,Water Resources Management,Watershed"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF035465-INDONESIA - DAM SAFETY PROJECT,TF037276-INDONESIA - DAM SAFETY,TF039329-INDONESIA - DAM SAFETY GRD\n            WATER DEV; SFC PROJECTS,TF039641-INDONESIA - DAM SAFETY PROJECT\n            AND GROUND WATER DEV.
