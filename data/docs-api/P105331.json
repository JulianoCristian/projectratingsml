People's Democratic Republic -\n            Greater Mekong Subregion Power Trade Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Greater Mekong Subregion\n            Power Trade Project for Mexico were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was modest, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            regional energy projects involve multiple countries and\n            multiple agencies, all of which have different operating\n            conditions and environments. To mitigate risks and\n            challenges in such a complex situation, strong commitment\n            and ownership of participating governments is crucial.\n            Moreover, a strong political consensus for power\n            interconnection, a road map for implementation, and\n            alignment of investments to the road map are necessary for\n            such regional projects. Adequate institutional capacity is\n            needed to prepare a project implementation plan including\n            analysis of power transmission technology and load\n            dispatching technology alternatives. With technology\n            development, power system planning changes quickly and the\n            planned activities become obsolete, which require regular\n            reviews and updating of implementation plans. While\n            long-term cross-border transactions have taken place in the\n            GMS despite the absence of a regional power exchange market,\n            the bilateral transaction-by-transaction approach may be\n            feasible only when there are limited cross-border\n            interconnections within the region. As regional\n            interconnections grow and system-system transactions\n            increase, it becomes increasingly difficult and inefficient\n            to pursue large cross-border transactions without an\n            established a region-wide framework of technical rules and\n            transmission pricing agreements. A regional power exchange\n            market is the logical vehicle for developing these rules and\n            agreements that increase certainty and reduce transaction costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lao People's Democratic Republic -\n            Greater Mekong Subregion Power Trade Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lao People's Democratic\n
