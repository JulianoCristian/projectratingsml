      Building Project's principal goal is to support the\n            ongoing implementation of the Government's public\n            sector reform strategy, by ensuring that the requisite\n            institutional infrastructure is in place and functioning. It\n            also seeks to support an important set of cross-cutting\n            reforms, in areas ranging from policy coordination, to\n            improved financial and human resource practices. It will be\n            deemed successful if capacity is strengthened within the\n            Prime Minister's office, so that performance\n            monitoring, administrative reform, and policy coordination\n            functions are established and functioning well by project\n            completion. The project components call for: 1) Improving\n            policymaking, management of the reform process, and\n            strategic communications. Capacity will be strengthened at\n            the Cabinet Secretariat, to improve its strategic focus, and\n            reduce routine business flows. The component will also\n            strengthen capacity within the Prime Ministry to improve\n            provision of strategic guidance, and oversight regarding the\n            Public Sector Reform Program, and in addition, will\n            strengthen communications. 2) Performance management and\n            service delivery. This component will ensure the publication\n            and monitoring - at the ministerial and institutional levels\n            - of performance standards regarding service delivery to\n            citizens, through training and capacity building to improve\n            its quality, and cost-effectiveness. 3) Institutional\n            streamlining. Through the establishment of simplified,\n            effective structures, the component will focus on the\n            Government's core functions, progressively reviewing\n            its mandate, status, organization, functions, and\n            administrative efficiency. Increased accountability for\n            policy and operations will be supported to improve\n            administrative efficiency. 4) Improving human resource and\n            financial management practices and procedures. Institutional\n            framework and legal arrangements will be established for the\n            provision of an effective human resource policy development,\n            operational management, and independent oversight. Moreover,\n            Budget practices will be improved to reflect policy\n            priorities, and encourage effective expenditure management\n            through reforms, including strengthened capacity for\n            macro-fiscal analysis, institutional reform, restructuring\n            of budget preparation and execution."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Public Sector Reform Capacity\n            Building Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jordan - Public Sector Reform\n            Capacity Building Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/02/5640664/jordan-public-sector-reform-capacity-building-project","projn":"JO-Public Sector Reform Capacity Building\n            Loan -- P091787","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,National Governance,Poverty Assessment,Enterprise Development & Reform,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Jordan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050304131709"},"subsc":"General public administration sector","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, adaptability, administrative\n            culture, Bank management, best practice, budget process,\n            budgeting, civil service, corruption, decentralization,\n            Decision Making, economic growth, employment, exercises,\n            expenditures, Financial Management, Human Resource\n            Management, information dissemination, Innovation,\n            institutionalization, laws, leadership, legal framework,\n            Lessons learned, Management Information, management\n            policies, motivation,  Partnership, Performance Improvement,\n            Performance Indicators, Performance Management, performance\n            monitoring, private sector, Procurement, program\n            implementation, program management, project implementation,\n            Project Management, Project Preparation, provisions, public\n            debt, public expenditure, public expenditure management,\n            PUBLIC SECTOR, public sector employment, PUBLIC SECTOR\n            REFORM, public service, public service delivery,\n            rationalization, reform policy, reform process, reforms,\n            resource allocation, screening, Service Delivery, service\n            standards, Supervision, Telecommunications, transparency,\n            treasury, workers"}},"owner":"Poverty Reduct & Econ.
