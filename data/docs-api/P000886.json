The overall out come of the project was\n            satisfactory; the Bank's performance in preparing and\n            supervising this broad based project was good; and the\n            performance of the borrowers was satisfactory. The aim of\n            the project was to sustain and help consolidate the momentum\n            of Ghana economic recovery by: (a) removing physical\n            bottlenecks to the expansion of exports, farm production and\n            labor mobility through better maintenance and further\n            rehabilitation of the transport infrastructure; (b) raising\n            the efficiency of the transport sector through (i) promotion\n            of market-oriented policies, (ii) increasing involvement of\n            the private sector, (iii) strengthening transport\n            institutions, and (iv) improving productivity; (c)\n            facilitating rural transport by promoting appropriate\n            low-cost technology; and (d) reducing transportation costs\n            for both goods and passengers. Lessons learned from this\n            project are as follows: the project was successful because\n            it was well prepared, met the needs of the sector, included\n            provision for adequate design and supervision of the various\n            components, and the Borrower mobilized the requisite\n            implementation resources. Lack of co-financing, and the slow\n            provision of counterpart funds for road works and the\n            railways caused delays. The project formed part of an\n            overall rehabilitation program of the transport sector which\n            is being continued under a follow-up projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Transport Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Transport Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/06/733478/ghana-transport-rehabilitation-project","projn":"GH-Transp.
