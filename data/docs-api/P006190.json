The lessons\n            learned include: 1) The engagement of sectoral experts to\n            prepare institutional development programs, and priority\n            investment projects for financing under the municipal\n            infrastructure investment component resulted in a robust\n            pipeline of well-prepared sub-projects prior to approval of\n            the project by International Development Association's\n            Executive Directors. 2) The administrative and financial\n            systems, technical assistance, and training provided under\n            the municipal strengthening component of the project were\n            successfully implemented, which can be attributed to the\n            built-in pilot programs. 3) Project implementation benefited\n            from a strong government commitment to the project's\n            overall objectives of promoting efficient municipal\n            management. 4) It is important that project components to be\n            included only after Borrower has confirmed its willingness\n            to include the component in the project. 5) A good set of\n            performance indicators plays an important role in assisting\n            borrowers in monitoring a project's progress during\n            implementation and assessing the project's potential\n            benefits during operation. The original performance\n            indicators were inadequate to cover all the specific\n            components of the project. 6) High staff turnover could be\n            partly attributed to the systemic problem of the project. 7)\n            Severance payments play an important role in the\n            implementation of institutional reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Municipal Sector
