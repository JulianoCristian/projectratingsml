Some lessons learned included: despite\n            some notable progress, China Investment Bank (CIB) continues\n            to experience problems rooted in issues besetting the macro\n            economy and the overall financial sector. Recognition of\n            this, coupled with the opportunities presented by\n            China's recently more receptive environment for banking\n            system reform signaled by passage of a banking law and a\n            central bank law, led to a shift in bank strategy. Reform of\n            the banking system's overall policy and regulatory\n            environment is now central to the financial sector strategy.\n            While direct assistance to some key players in China's\n            banking system continues, policy and institutional change at\n            both the banking sector and individual bank levels dominates\n            the attention. A 'twinning' arrangement between a\n            local bank and a respected international commercial bank has\n            been found to be a more acceptable means of transferring\n            commercial banking skills to banks in command economies.\n            When foreign technical experts must be used, it is crucial\n            to gain the borrower's total understanding and\n            acceptance of such assistance prior to project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Fifth Industrial Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Fifth Industrial Credit
