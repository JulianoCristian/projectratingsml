This\n            report provides the findings of an administrative inquiry by\n            the World Bank Group (WBG) Integrity Vice Presidency (INT)\n            into allegations that Company A may have engaged in\n            misconduct in connection with the project in the Republic of\n            Albania. The purpose of the investigation was to allow the\n            WBG to determine if the WBG\u2019s framework regarding\n            anti-corruption has been violated. Company A submitted its\n            bid for the contract. The bid contained several\n            manufacturer\u2019s authorization forms (MAFs), including one\n            that purportedly was issued by Company B. Evidence suggests\n            that Company B informed the project implementing unit (PIU)\n            that it had not issued the MAF to Company A. Upon the PIU\u2019s\n            request to extend the bid validity for the third time,\n            Company A replied that it will not proceed with the third\n            extension of the bid validity and respective bid security\n            validity. Thus, Company A\u2019s bid was not considered for\n            further evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Social Service Delivery Project :\n            INT redacted report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Social Service Delivery\n            Project : INT redacted report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2016/02/25886375/albania-social-service-delivery-project-redacted-report","count":"Albania","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Board Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"limited, integrity, goods, equipment,\n            security, corrupt, policies, criminal, legal entity, bank,\n            investigation, government, bid, law, services,\n            anti-corruption, contract, association, agreement,\n            international development, bids, sanction, loan, competitive\n            bidding, loan agreement, service delivery, reserves,\n            manufacturer, corruption, company, service, international\n            bank, bidding"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Social protection and risk management,Social dev/gender/inclusion","projn":"AL-Social Services Delivery Project -- P055383","topic":"Social Analysis m1326036 744,Services Delivery m1326657 922,Social Accountability m1326920 733,Social Assistance m1327201 1466","subtopic":"Corporate Law,Microfinance,Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Small Scale Enterprises,Debt Markets","docty":"Board Report","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Law and Development,Public Sector Development","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08415c1f6_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Eastern Europe and Balkans!$!517208"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Eastern Europe and Balkans!$!517208"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Other social services,Central government administration,General public administration sector,Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance,Sub-national government administration","theme":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring,Participation and civic engagement,Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship,Other social protection and risk management,Other social development","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Law and Development,Public Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Social Analysis m1326036 744,Services Delivery m1326657 922,Social Accountability m1326920 733,Social Assistance m1327201 1466","owner":"Social Protect &  Labor - GP (GSPDR)","trustfund":"TF039640-ALBANIA - SOCIAL SERVICE\n            DELIVERY PROJECT - VULNERABILITY AND NEEDS ASS,TF040380-WORLD - RESEARCH ON THE\n            INSPECTION PANEL EXPERIENCE,TF040374-ALBANIA - SECTOR WORK - SOCIAL\n            SERVICE DELIVERY PROJECT,TFM23784-ALBANIA SOCIAL SERVICES\n            DELIVERY PROJECT,TFM50181-ALBANIA SOCIAL SERVICES\n            DELIVERY PROJECT,TFS50181-ALBANIA SOCIAL SERVICES\n            DELIVERY PROJECT,TFS23784-ALBANIA SOCIAL SERVICES\n            DELIVERY PROJECT,TF050200-ALBANIA LIVING STANDARDS\n            MEASUREMENT SURVEY TRUST FUND,TF050199-ALBANIA LIVING STANDARDS\n            MEASUREMENT SURVEY TRUST FUND,TF023784-ALBANIA SOCIAL SERVICES\n            DELIVERY PROJECT,TF050181-ALBANIA SOCIAL SERVICES\n            DELIVERY PROJECT,TF050183-ALBANIA LIVING STANDARDS\n            MEASUREMENT SURVEY TRUST FUND,TF025792-PHRD-SOCIAL SERVICE DELIVERY PROJECT","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Eastern Europe and Balkans"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Eastern Europe and Balkans"}},"repnb":"103175"},"18451469":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/09/18451469/albania-social-services-delivery-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/09/18451469/albania-social-services-delivery-project","new_url":"2013/09/18451469/albania-social-services-delivery-project","disclosure_date":"2013-10-29T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2013-10-29T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2013-10-29T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2013/10/29/000356161_20131029161128/Rendered/INDEX/ICR28270ICR0Al000PUBLIC00Box379859B.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2013/10/29/000356161_20131029161128/Rendered/PDF/ICR28270ICR0Al000PUBLIC00Box379859B.pdf","loan_no":"7690","credit_no":"3513","datestored":"2013-10-29T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2013-09-27T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Albania - Social Services Delivery Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Social Services Delivery\n            Project for Albania were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: Political economy may dictate that\n            project design has multiple layers and complexities even\n            when institutional capacities are not at par. When entering\n            a sector where the Borrower has little experience and\n            knowledge, it is helpful to provide support for policy\n            development and use it as a platform to jumpstart an\n            in-country policy dialogue and build consensus around a\n            legal framework. Institutional change takes a long time yet\n            with ample implementation support and time, it yields\n            long-lasting results. Monitoring indicators and a system for\n            data collection and evaluation need to be clearly\n            established at the beginning of the project to evaluate\n            project implementation and the achievement of project\n            objectives. Building local procurement and financial\n            management capacity right at the beginning of the project is\n            crucial for smooth implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Social
