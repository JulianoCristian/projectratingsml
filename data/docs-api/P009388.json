Therefore, the project incorporates clearly\n            defined criteria for project selection and supervision,\n            tasks involved in promotion and extension, and technical\n            assistance in aspects requiring improvement."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Second Small-scale Industry Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Second Small-scale\n            Industry Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/05/726994/bangladesh-second-small-scale-industry-project","projn":"BD-Small Industry II -- P009388","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,International Terrorism & Counterterrorism,Financial Intermediation","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Conflict and Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912324266"},"subsc":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Conflict and Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            practices,agriculture,Asset Value,assets,autonomy,bank\n            lending,banking system,book value,capacity\n            utilization,capital goods,capital loans,capital\n            requirements,Central Bank,Commercial Banks,comparative\n            advantages,Decentralization,deposits,Economic\n            Efficiency,economic growth,ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION,economic\n            size,effective demand,Employment,Export\n            growth,Exports,FISCAL YEAR,fish,Fixed Asset,fixed\n            assets,foreign exchange,foreign private\n            investment,GDP,growth\n            potential,housing,imports,income,inflation,Interest\n            Rates,labor costs,labor force,labor\n            productivity,liquidity,livestock\n            products,moneylenders,natural\n            resources,oil,onlending,overhead costs,pricing\n            policies,producers,productivity,profitability,public\n            agencies,public enterprises,real rate of interest,resource\n            mobilization,subsidiary,Technical Assistance,term\n            finance,total costs,value added,wings,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            practices,agriculture,Asset Value,assets,autonomy,bank\n            lending,banking system,book value,capacity\n            utilization,capital goods,capital loans,capital\n            requirements,Central Bank,Commercial Banks,comparative\n            advantages,Decentralization,deposits,Economic\n            Efficiency,economic growth,ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION,economic\n            size,effective demand,Employment,Export\n            growth,Exports,FISCAL YEAR,fish,Fixed Asset,fixed\n            assets,foreign exchange,foreign private\n            investment,GDP,growth\n            potential,housing,imports,income,inflation,Interest\n            Rates,labor costs,labor force,labor\n            productivity,liquidity,livestock\n            products,moneylenders,natural\n            resources,oil,onlending,overhead costs,pricing\n            policies,producers,productivity,profitability,public\n            agencies,public enterprises,real rate of interest,resource\n            mobilization,subsidiary,Technical Assistance,term\n            finance,total costs,value added,wings,working capital"}},"owner":"Finance & PSD Unit (SASFP)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"1802"},"facets":{}}}
