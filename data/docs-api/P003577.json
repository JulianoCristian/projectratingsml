Some lessons learned included: this\n            is to reduce the likelihood of two risks that often\n            undermine the subprojects' eventual viability. The\n            first risk relates to the subborrower missing the market\n            opportunity for which it was designed and being forced to\n            subsequently compete in a market environment very different\n            to the one expected at the project's conception. The\n            second risk relates to the increased risk of cost overruns\n            in long-gestation projects. The practical implications are\n            that the subprojects investment plans should allow for rapid\n            implementation, and be sufficiently flexible to quickly draw\n            in additional resources, if needed and justified, with\n            limited delay. If the Bank is to be involved in State-Owned\n            Enterprise (SOE) reform at the individual enterprise level,\n            the sponsored activities need to go well beyond upgrading\n            the physical equipment and technology. In this case, the\n            three cement plants have been forced to compete in a market\n            dominated by inexpensive low-grade cement, where little\n            price distinction is made for cement quality due to the lack\n            of government regulation enforcing the use of high-grade\n            cement and discouraging polluting cement plants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Regional Cement Industry Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Regional Cement Industry Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/06/732059/china-regional-cement-industry-project","projn":"CN-Cement -- P003577","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Construction Industry,Environmental Economics & Policies,Roads & Highways,Water and Industry,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980901092922"},"subsc":"Other industry","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Building Materials,Building Materials\n            Industry,capital markets,Cement,Cement Industry,cement\n            manufacturing,cement plants,cement\n            production,coal,Construction,debt,emissions,energy\n            efficiency,equipment,framework,grade,imports,industrial\n            operations,industrial sector,inflation,interest rates,labor\n            costs,limestone,loading,market prices,marketing,policy\n            environment,pollution,pollution control,Private\n            Sector,producers,production costs,project management,Rate of\n            Return,safety,structures,transport,transportation,viable technology"},"1":{"cdata!":"Building Materials,Building Materials\n            Industry,capital markets,Cement,Cement Industry,cement\n            manufacturing,cement plants,cement\n            production,coal,Construction,debt,emissions,energy\n            efficiency,equipment,framework,grade,imports,industrial\n            operations,industrial sector,inflation,interest rates,labor\n            costs,limestone,loading,market prices,marketing,policy\n            environment,pollution,pollution control,Private\n            Sector,producers,production costs,project management,Rate of\n            Return,safety,structures,transport,transportation,viable technology"}},"owner":"Financial & Private Sector Dept.

The project consists of three\n            components: (a) Tongling cement production and distribution;\n            (b) Zhongguo cement plant rehabilitation; and (c) technical\n            assistance. The Tongling component will implement a regional\n            cement production and distribution scheme, which involves\n            installation of a cement plant at Tongling, and construction\n            of a clinker grinding at Ningbo to process clinkers to be\n            shipped from Tongling. This component will be supported by a\n            river and coastal bulk transport system which includes a\n            loading terminal at Tongling, bulk carriers, a clinker\n            receiving terminal at Ningbo, and bulk cement receiving\n            terminals at Nantong and Wenzhou. The Zhongguo component\n            involves replacing wet-process cement production units by a\n            dry-process cement unit in order to improve efficiency and\n            product quality and to expand production capacity of an\n            existing medium-scale cement plant. The technical assistance\n            component provides financial and technical support to\n            strengthen four cement industry research and design\n            institutes and a study to improve the efficiency and\n            emissions of small-scale cement plants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Regional Cement Industry Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Regional Cement Industry Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/02/736294/china-regional-cement-industry-project","projn":"CN-Cement -- P003577","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Construction Industry,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Water and Industry,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960928142858"},"subsc":"Other industry","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability,accounting,allocative\n            efficiency,autonomy,Bank lending,banking\n            system,bankruptcy,bricks,Building Materials,Building\n            Materials Industry,capital goods,Cement,Cement\n            Industry,cement manufacturing,cement plants,cement\n            production,central bank,central\n            banking,ceramic,coal,Construction,consumers,contractual\n            arrangements,controlled\n            prices,debt,decentralization,Deposits,Development\n            Strategy,devolution,dividends,economic analysis,economic\n            inefficiency,Economic Rate of Return,economies of\n            scale,edible oils,emissions,energy resources,Enterprise\n            Ownership,Environmental Impact Assessment,Environmental\n            Protection,Exports,Feasibility Studies,Financial\n            Covenants,Financial Data,Financial institutions,Financial\n            Management,financial markets,Financial Performance,financial\n            sector,financial services,FISCAL YEAR,Fog,foreign\n            exchange,free market prices,future studies,GDP,glass,Gross\n            Domestic Product,gross national product,gross value,growth\n            rate,Imports,industrial sector,inflation,Insurance,interest\n            rate,interest rates,ITC,labor force,"},"1":{"cdata!":"accountability,accounting,allocative\n            efficiency,autonomy,Bank lending,banking\n            system,bankruptcy,bricks,Building Materials,Building\n            Materials Industry,capital goods,Cement,Cement\n            Industry,cement manufacturing,cement plants,cement\n            production,central bank,central\n            banking,ceramic,coal,Construction,consumers,contractual\n            arrangements,controlled\n            prices,debt,decentralization,Deposits,Development\n            Strategy,devolution,dividends,economic analysis,economic\n            inefficiency,Economic Rate of Return,economies of\n            scale,edible oils,emissions,energy resources,Enterprise\n            Ownership,Environmental Impact Assessment,Environmental\n            Protection,Exports,Feasibility Studies,Financial\n            Covenants,Financial Data,Financial institutions,Financial\n            Management,financial markets,Financial Performance,financial\n            sector,financial services,FISCAL YEAR,Fog,foreign\n            exchange,free market prices,future studies,GDP,glass,Gross\n            Domestic Product,gross national product,gross value,growth\n            rate,Imports,industrial sector,inflation,Insurance,interest\n            rate,interest rates,ITC,labor force,"}},"owner":"Financial & Private Sector Dept.
