Some lessons\n            learned included: there is a need for developing a robust\n            Sector Information System to facilitate the monitoring and\n            evaluation (M&E) of not only access to water and\n            sanitation, but the quality of the services provided and the\n            financial sustainability of the decentralized and\n            community-managed systems. There is the need to review the\n            design for small town water systems to give more\n            consideration to the category of small towns to ensure lower\n            and uniform unit cost. It was realized that the population\n            of a number of the beneficiary communities was less than\n            5,000 inhabitants, which meant that they were medium small\n            towns as defined by the CWSA ( i.e. population between 1,200\n            and 5,000) but benefitted from systems intended for larger\n            sized small town (i.e. population of over 5,000). This\n            contributed to higher unit costs. High turnover of\n            membership of the WSDBs, mostly due to political\n            interference, meant that members who had been trained during\n            project implementation had to be replaced by new people who\n            never had the benefit of any training. As political\n            decisions are invariably unpredictable, it would be\n            necessary to involve more of the private sector to\n            complement the management of the WSDBs in subsequent\n            projects. WSDBs, even though they contributed to the\n            management of the project at the community level, in a\n            number of cases resisted the participation of the private\n            sector in the management of the installed water supply facility."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Small Towns Water and Sanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Small Towns Water

East, Upper\n            West, Central and Western regions) in four years, by\n            providing 500,000 people with water supply facilities, and\n            50,000 people with sanitary

The additional credit will support the\n            completion of original project activities in view of\n            unanticipated cost overruns arising from higher unit costs.\n            These increased costs reflect the fact that the\n            demand-driven selection of beneficiary communities during\n            the first two years of implementation has resulted in a\n            larger share of towns with small population sizes, compared\n            to appraisal estimates, thereby leading to higher per capita\n            investment costs for the smaller piped water schemes. The\n            proposed additional financing would thus enable the Borrower\n            to achieve the original key outcome indicator of serving\n            500,000 people with safe and sustainable water supply\n            services.
