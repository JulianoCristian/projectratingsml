When the facilities are fully operational in\n            1995, they would provide improvements to the quality of\n            training directly benefitting about 253,000 trainees\n            annually, and capacity for additional enrollments of 230,000\n            annually.  Project benefits would accrue to a wide range of\n            participants in the labor force, from industrial technicians\n            trained in advanced technologies to commercial and\n            agricultural skilled workers. Estimates of the poverty\n            impact of the project suggest that between 35 and 55 percent\n            of total project costs would benefit poor individuals."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Skills Formation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Skills Formation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1987/04/742057/brazil-skills-formation-project","projn":"BR-Skills Formation -- P006431","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Teaching and Learning,Primary Education,Tertiary Education,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Education","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926045907"},"subsc":"Vocational training","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"achievement,addition,basic\n            education,career,career planning,community\n            development,Comparative Education,Competitive\n            Bidding,curricula,curriculum\n            development,decentralization,Education Indicators,education\n            sector,educational opportunities,Educational\n            Reform,Employment,Enrollment,Expenditures,formal\n            education,further education,Human Resources,information\n            systems,inservice teacher training,instructional\n            materials,instructors,labor\n            force,manuals,mathematics,mathematics\n            education,Medicine,non-formal education,Non-formal\n            training,papers,public agencies,purchasing power,purchasing\n            power parity,redundancy,schools,science curriculum,science\n            curriculum development,science teaching,secondary\n            education,skills training,staff development,teacher,teacher\n            training,teaching,teaching methods,Technical\n            Assistance,technical education,technicians,technological\n            change,technological innovations,trainees,training\n            activities,training centers,training costs,training\n            materials,training methods,training modules,training\n            needs,training opportunities,Training\n            Programs,translation,universities,vocational\n            education,vocational skills,Vocational Training,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"achievement,addition,basic\n            education,career,career planning,community\n            development,Comparative Education,Competitive\n            Bidding,curricula,curriculum\n            development,decentralization,Education Indicators,education\n            sector,educational opportunities,Educational\n            Reform,Employment,Enrollment,Expenditures,formal\n            education,further education,Human Resources,information\n            systems,inservice teacher training,instructional\n            materials,instructors,labor\n            force,manuals,mathematics,mathematics\n            education,Medicine,non-formal education,Non-formal\n            training,papers,public agencies,purchasing power,purchasing\n            power parity,redundancy,schools,science curriculum,science\n            curriculum development,science teaching,secondary\n            education,skills training,staff development,teacher,teacher\n            training,teaching,teaching methods,Technical\n            Assistance,technical education,technicians,technological\n            change,technological innovations,trainees,training\n            activities,training centers,training costs,training\n            materials,training methods,training modules,training\n            needs,training opportunities,Training\n            Programs,translation,universities,vocational\n            education,vocational skills,Vocational Training,workers"}},"owner":"WB Office: Brasilia, Brazil CMU (LCC5C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"6564"},"facets":{}}}
