Secondly,\n            the project will provide support to GOB in strengthening key\n            agencies responsible for implementation of investment\n            projects. Thirdly, the project would contribute to the\n            attainment of a sound investment program through financing\n            of training and the undertaking of related technical\n            assistance activities identified by GOB.
