Some lessons learned\n            included: a distinction needs to be made between emergency\n            operations caused by natural disasters and those in a\n            post-conflict context. In the first case, institutional\n            capacity and policy tend not be major issues. In the second\n            case, because of the destruction caused by conflicts, the\n            process starts off with much lower levels of capacity and\n            knowledge. This argues for the need to include institutional\n            reforms, capacity building and sector strategy formulation\n            as was done in this project in order to start laying the\n            foundations for the future. Strong commitment from\n            management in terms of resources and continuity within the\n            task team is a key determination of successful\n            implementation. The use of Non-governmental organizations\n            proved to be an effective and efficient way of\n            implementation the social activities at the grass root\n            level. This should serve as a lesson and good precedent.\n            Even in emergency situations, an effort should be made to\n            address sustainability issues at the project or program\n            design stage. If not done, the investments made could be\n            jeopardized over the long term. If this is not discussed\n            during project preparation and appraisal, it should be\n            included as part of early implementation activities as it\n            was done in the project

As a result, the expected outcome of the\n            proposed second Additional Financing is that: (i) the\n            original development objectives of the electricity sector\n            component continue to be achieved, namely to rehabilitate\n            and reconstruct the electricity supply networks serving\n            major cities, and (ii) that overall execution and\n            supervision of the Project continues smoothly until Project completion."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo, Democratic Republic of - Emergency\n            Multisector Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project :\n            second additional financing"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Congo, Democratic Republic of -\n            Emergency Multisector Rehabilitation and Reconstruction\n            Project : second additional financing"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/11/8805832/congo-democratic-republic-emergency-multisector-rehabilitation-reconstruction-project-second-additional-financing","projn":"ZR-Emergency Multisector Rehabilitation And\n            Reconstruction Project -- P057296,ZR-Emergency Ms Rehabilitation &\n            Recovery Erl Second Additional Fi -- P108905","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"m,Access to Finance,Housing & Human Habitats,E-Business,Energy Production and Transportation","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Energy,Communities and Human Settlements,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Congo, Democratic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020439_20071130133222"},"theme":"Urban services and housing for the poor,Nutrition and food security,Health system performance,Infrastructure services for private sector development,Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","subsc":"Power,Other social services,Health,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General transportation sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Energy,Communities and Human Settlements,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to electricity, action plan, action\n            plans, ADDITIONAL FINANCING, Additional Financings,\n            approach, audits, balance, Bank management, beneficiaries,\n            Borrower, businesses, commercial bank, community\n            development, consulting firms, contingencies, contribution,\n            customs, demand for electricity, demand for power, deposits,\n            depreciation, Description, distribution facilities,\n            distribution grid, distribution network, distribution\n            system, economic activities, economic activity, economic\n            growth, economic progress, electric power, Electricity,\n            electricity distribution, electricity supply,\n            electrification, employment, end-user, energy\n            infrastructure, equipment, exchange rates, expenditures,\n            export markets, finances, FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, FINANCIAL\n            TERMS, foreign exchange, Generation, GPS, grid extension,\n            Gross Domestic Product, Household access, households,\n            hydropower, installation, institutional capacities,\n            intervention, interventions, IP, kerosene, kerosene\n            lighting, living conditions, Loan, macroeconomic stability,\n            monies, operating costs, physical progress, Power, power\n            plants, private sector, private sector investment,\n            PROCUREMENT, procurement process, project management,\n            reliability, reliable access, result, Results, retail\n            customers, rural areas, service contracts, sites, social\n            protection, social services, sub-Saharan Africa,\n            supervision, supply networks, transaction, transaction\n            costs, transmission, transmission infrastructure,\n            transmission line, Transmission lines, Union, urban areas,\n            voltage, withdrawal"}},"owner":"Transport Practice Group (AFTTR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF030443-SWITZERLAND CTF - FY04 (WATER,\n            SANITATION & FLOOD PROTECTION, ALL REGIO,TF030628-SWITZERLAND CTF - FY05 (WATER,\n            SANITATION & FLOOD PROTECTION, ALL REGIO,TF041065-CONGO, DEMOC.

The report anticipates\n            negative environmental impacts and discusses measures to\n            mitigate them. Among the risks and proposed mitigations it\n            discusses are the following: Reduce noise. During\n            construction, protect against the emanation of toxic gases\n            and the risks of inhaling particulate matter. When\n            transporting materials, systematically spray material or use\n            tarpaulin on trucks, spray land routes, and limit vehicle\n            speed. Locate concrete and coal works far from human\n            habitations. Regulate vehicle emissions, control traffic,\n            and require motorist to install muffler equipment. All open\n            air burning must be preauthorized, and the project manager\n            must approve incineration of ordinary garbage and industrial\n            waste. Protect against soil degradation due to erosion,\n            vegetative loss, and interference with protected species by\n            removing, storing, and replacing topsoil; replanting areas\n            after use; and bio-regenerating soil polluted by accidental\n            dumping. Alleviate adverse effects to the quality of surface\n            and underground water by avoiding dumping and controlling\n            waste disposal, controlling vehicles traversing the\n            watercourses, avoiding excavation during the rainy season,\n            avoiding the storage of hazardous materials near\n            watercourses, installing filtration barriers, regularly\n            maintaining equipment and machinery, avoiding oil spills,\n            and managing water use. Put in place a compensation system\n            according to agreed upon standards for the destruction of\n            fruit trees and crops, buildings, and real and personal\n            property. Set up a forest management program, and control\n            hunting and launch a preventative information campaign to\n            reduce interference and destruction of animals. Protect\n            workers and the general population from infectious diseases\n            and pollution by treating water and reducing, separating,\n            recycling, storing and disposing of waste according to\n            agreement, and providing information on disease prevention;\n            from accidents by securing buildings; and from fire hazards\n            by acquiring equipment.
