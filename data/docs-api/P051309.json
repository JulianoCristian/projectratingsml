Ratings for\n            the Second Community Works Project for Albania were as\n            follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: a\n            demand-driven approach may not guarantee that the highest\n            community priorities are met unless steps are taken to\n            ensure a robust and inclusive participatory process and to\n            prevent demand distortion that can result from, for example,\n            requests for goods and services that are perceived to be\n            easiest to obtain (e.g., roads in this case) rather than\n            those that may be most wanted. Capacity building cannot be\n            treated as a by-product; explicit mechanisms will generally\n            be needed to build appropriate and lasting capacity. In\n            projects with multiple objectives requiring different staff\n            skills-mixes for their implementation, up-front clarity\n            about the relative emphasis to be placed on the various\n            objectives is critical, especially in capacity-constrained\n            contexts. Trade-offs among objectives need to be watched\n            closely, and addressed. Building capacity in local\n            governments and communities is time- and human\n            resource-intensive, making disbursements potentially slower\n            and less predictable than when infrastructure delivery is\n            the primary focus. The performance incentives, staffing, and\n            skills-mix of the project implementation unit will need to\n            match the project's primary focus. In the case of\n            Albania, Albanian Development Fund (ADF) maintained an\n            engineering orientation in its staffing and processes,\n            building infrastructure much more successfully than building\n            capacity. In projects with multiple objectives, each of\n            which requires a different staff skill mix for its\n            implementation, up-front clarity about the relative emphasis\n            to be placed on the various objectives is critical. The\n            roles and responsibilities of the various institutions that\n            the project will relate to need to be clarified in project\n            design it, and project design also needs to envision and\n            factor in the longer-term role of any autonomous project\n            implementation unit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania -

Community Works Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The overall rating of the project\n            outcome is satisfactory, and project sustainability is\n            likely. world Bank and Borrower performances are rated\n            satisfactory. This report identifies the factors for the\n            project's success as: 1) strong country ownership; 2)\n            the professional and personal commitment of staff at both\n            the Bank and the Albanian Development Fund (ADF); and 3) the\n            commitment of the donor community at large to continue\n            supporting ADF activities in future operations. The\n            highlighted difficulties concern the infrasructure works,\n            local government and community capacity building, social\n            services delivery, governance, donor coordination, and\n            project management. For instance, rursl roads, water supply,\n            and sewerage sub-projects have created noticeable benefits,\n            but in many cases, sub-projects cannot serve the whole\n            community due to over-design or because this would result in\n            exceeding the permitted financial limits. Both issues could\n            be resolved by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis for each\n            sub-project and by formally requesting to exceed the\n            ceiling. Alternatively, the financial limits of the\n            sub-projects could be revised. Another possibility would be\n            to leave financial limits as they are, but sub-projects\n            could be smaller in scope. Although significant progress has\n            been made by the ADF in dealing with local governments,\n            there is still a disconnect between the ADF Charter and\n            reality on the ground. The institutional and Managerial\n            Review suggests revising ADF's Charter. A much stronger\n            poverty targeting, both geographically and by typology of\n            infrastructure, should be sought in the follow-on project.\n            The current criteria \"one commune, one project\"\n            could no longer be justified in light of the GPRS process\n            and a better poverty impact analysis of individual\n            sub-projects should be carried out. Regarding social\n            services delivery, the experience of ADF has been mixed and\n            generally there is room for improvement. The recent\n            \"Institutional and Managerial Review\" suggests\n            that ADF should probably drop the Social Services and\n            concentrate first on excellence in infrastructure projects.\n            ADF could even become an implementing agent or subcontractor\n            agent for the infrastructure component of other projects,\n            including social programs. In regard to governance, ADF\n            should be better protected from political presssures, and\n            there is a need to bring the Board closer to the local\n            level; room needs to be made for representatives of\n            communes/municipalities and the twelve Qarks, as well as for\n            local communities. conflicting procedures have caused\n            confusion among ADF staff, bidders, and beneficiaries;\n            efforts to strengthen donor coordination should ideally\n            include both procurement and contracting issues. With\n            respect to project management, issues that still need to be\n            tackled include updating the terms of reference and job\n            description of ADF staff, particularly the social\n            inspectors; devising a staff training program; and\n            formalizing the yearly staff evaluation process"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania -
