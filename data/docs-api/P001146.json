First,\n            project scope and content should be coherent and support an\n            agreed sector strategy and program that is based on a\n            consensus and agreed upon by the different Government\n            departments. Second, at the project's start, agreement\n            should be reached on performance indicators. They should be\n            reviewed through project launch workshops, annual\n            programming exercises, and a mid-term assessment. Third,\n            project management arrangements should be agreed upon,\n            including staffing commitments and the roles of key\n            technical units. Fourth, Bank missions should be more\n            frequent, with a skill mix tailored to the technical and\n            management requirements of the project. Finally, the Bank\n            may want to consider a shorter timeframe for future\n            projects, with phased implementation based on an agreed work\n            program with the Government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - Health and Demographic Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cote d'Ivoire - Health and\n            Demographic Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/06/733705/cote-divoire-health-demographic-project","projn":"CI-Health I -- P001146","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Business in Development,Teaching and Learning,Business Environment","teratopic":"Education","count":"Cote d'Ivoire","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961030000729"},"subsc":"(Historic)Basic health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Account,accounting,accounting\n            practices,accounting\n            systems,accounts,Achievements,auditing,auditing\n            principles,auditors,Audits,bills,budgeting,cost\n            containment,cost estimates,cost overruns,cost\n            recovery,crops,curriculum,curriculum\n            development,Equipment,exercises,expenditure,expenditures,extension,Family\n            Planning,financial management,health care,health\n            indicators,health\n            services,hospitals,housing,immunization,integration,managers,midwifery,migration,NGOs,nursing,nursing\n            students,Pharmacy,private sector,procurement,Public\n            Health,public sector,recurrent cost,recurrent\n            costs,schools,student housing,teaching,teaching staff,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"Account,accounting,accounting\n            practices,accounting\n            systems,accounts,Achievements,auditing,auditing\n            principles,auditors,Audits,bills,budgeting,cost\n            containment,cost estimates,cost overruns,cost\n            recovery,crops,curriculum,curriculum\n            development,Equipment,exercises,expenditure,expenditures,extension,Family\n            Planning,financial management,health care,health\n            indicators,health\n            services,hospitals,housing,immunization,integration,managers,midwifery,migration,NGOs,nursing,nursing\n            students,Pharmacy,private sector,procurement,Public\n            Health,public sector,recurrent cost,recurrent\n            costs,schools,student housing,teaching,teaching staff,workers"}},"owner":"WB Office: Abidjan (AFMCI)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"15032"},"739967":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/08/739967/ivory-coast-health-demographic-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/08/739967/ivory-coast-health-demographic-project","new_url":"1985/08/739967/ivory-coast-health-demographic-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/08/01/000009265_3970625095225/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/08/01/000009265_3970625095225/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","loan_no":"2619","datestored":"2001-05-01T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1985-08-31T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Ivory Coast - Health and Demographic Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Health and Demographic Project, the\n            Bank's first in the health sector, will assist the\n            Ministry of Public Health & Population (MOPHP) to\n            strengthen health manpower development through expansion of\n            nurse training capacity to address current shortages,\n            through implementation of a revised curriculum, including\n            family planning & field training, that is more\n            responsive to the health needs of the country, & through\n            development of health manpower planning capacity;
