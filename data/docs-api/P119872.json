Statistical Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Statistical Development Project for\n            Nigeria received a satisfactory outcome with moderate risk\n            to development outcome. The Bank received a satisfactory\n            rating while the Borrower was rated moderately satisfactory.\n            There were no significant changes that took place during\n            this project including components and restructuring. There\n            are a number of lessons reported from this project. Lesson\n            learned include: (1) The complexity of the Nigerian\n            Statistical System must be taken into account in the design\n            of any new statistics operation, (2) In case of multi-agency\n            project, a strong governance arrangement needs to be\n            established and funded during project preparation. Diversity\n            of local needs in various states in Nigeria calls for the\n            introduction of flexible project design for various states.\n            (3) Linkages between the PDO, planned project activities,\n            their sequencing, and alignment with the results indicators\n            need to be strong at project design phase. (4) The\n            governance structure of a project needs to be clearly\n            defined, established and functional prior to project\n            effectiveness. (5) Effective implementation requires\n            consistency in project arrangements, and in addition, there\n            should be a \u0093succession plan\u0094 envisaged. (6) Importance of\n            project governance, monitoring and reporting arrangements.\n            (7) The project should consider operating separate\n            designated accounts for each participant. (8) The presence\n            of an in-country donor statistician was a strong asset in\n            building trust among the different participants, in solving\n            implementation problems and acting as a liaison between the\n            government and the Bank. (9) Partner support can be helpful\n            in providing critical technical assistance and fill in some\n            gaps in financing. (10) CMU should be onboard. Its\n            interventions could be used at critical points of project\n            implementation. (11) Capacity building can be strengthened\n            if accompanied by broader policy dialogue and reform. (12)\n            Regular training and retraining in statistics related\n            matters should be an important component of any statistical\n            development project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Statistical Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Statistical Development
