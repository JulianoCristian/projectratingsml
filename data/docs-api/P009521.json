The overall objectives of the Project were to\n            assist GOB's efforts to promote exports by: (a)\n            providing a line of pre-shipment foreign exchange credit to\n            private sector exporters, particularly to new nontraditional\n            exporters; (b) strengthening the export financing and\n            guarantee elements of the credit delivery system; and (c)\n            addressing policy and procedural issues which constrain the\n            active development of Bangladesh's export potential.\n            Overall, the project achieved its objectives substantially.\n            Given that the probability of maintaining and even\n            surpassing the achievements of the Project objectives is\n            quite high, it is quite likely that the Project will be\n            sustained in the near future. The key finding of the project\n            implementation experience is that credit lines like the one\n            under this Project should be guided by market conditions and\n            should have sufficient flexibility to change and adapt to\n            the changes in the market. Although this Project appears to\n            be sustainable at the moment, the benefits are available to\n            only a small segment of the potential beneficiaries in the\n            export sector. The benefits could be opened up to all\n            exporters if GOB lifted all the existing restrictions on\n            foreign currency pre-shipment financing, allowed banks to\n            fully determine the interest rates on export financing under\n            EDF, and eliminated minimum value added requirements. The\n            implementation experience under this Project has provided\n            some important lessons about design and implementation.\n            These lessons may be grouped into three categories: (a)\n            design issues; (b) coordination issues; and (c) quality issues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Export Development
