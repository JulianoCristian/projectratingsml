And, an interesting\n            compromise between economic and financial returns, is worth\n            noting: financial costs were not fully covered, yet, the\n            amortization schedule was customized to better reflect\n            revenues, tolls were applied, and, local exemptions were\n            granted (agricultural vehicles exempted from toll)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

The 273km extension of the highway is intended to\n            aid in strengthening the capacity for the exchange of goods\n            and in promoting further economic development in the region.\n            The project has impacts of varying degrees on many aspects\n            of the physical, ecological and social environments within\n            the region, as well as on the standard of living of the\n            resident population.  Identified as having the worst\n            potential impact on the environment as a result of the\n            construction is the increased level of noise.  The\n            functionality of farmland irrigation systems, cultivation of\n            crops, and productivity of husbandry follow in expected\n            severity of consequences suffered.  In addition, inhabitants\n            of the region will have to be resettled.
