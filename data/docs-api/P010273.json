The project achieved\n            most of its specific objectives, institutional development\n            was partially successful, sustainability is uncertain, and\n            both the Bank and Borrower performed satisfactorily. A few\n            key lessons that can be learned from this project are: 1)\n            project success is dependent on management's\n            commitment, leadership, vision, technical expertise,\n            managerial, and organizational skills; 2) in the future, an\n            improved extension program should only be expanded at the\n            rate at which suitably trained staff become available to\n            implement it efficiently; 3) within the extension system,\n            there should be more incentives and merit-based promotional\n            opportunities for front-line extension workers; 4) adaptive\n            research should be concentrated on farmers' fields\n            rather than on stations, not duplicate research done by\n            research institutes, be demand-driven, and be designed to\n            permit valid economic comparisons of new technologies with\n            current farmer practices; 5) farmer education programs\n            should be expanded, including special programs for women\n            farmers; and 6) the importance of M & E, especially the\n            use of appropriate evaluation procedures, to ensure\n            efficient, effective, and relevant extension services has\n            been reinforced."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -
