These consultants have also\n            prepared an emergency program of expansion, with which the\n            Government is in accord, to meet power requirements through\n            1970. The Estreito and Xavantes developments, which together\n            will provide additional generating capacity of almost 1\n            million kilowatts, are of high priority within this program.\n            The Xavantes project has been under construction for several\n            years. The projects would provide power to the South-Central\n            region of the country (including the heavily populated\n            cities of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte),\n            which is the industrial heart of Brazil. A consortium of\n            consultants known as CANAMBRA, working under a United\n            Nations Special Fund grant for which the Bank acts as\n            Executing Agency, have studied the market for power in the\n            region. These consultants have also prepared an emergency\n            program of expansion, with which the Government is in\n            accord, to meet power requirements through 1970. The\n            Estreito and Xavantes developments, which together will\n            provide additional generating capacity of almost 1 million\n            kilowatts, are of high priority within this program. The\n            Xavantes project has been under construction for several years."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Hydroelectric Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Hydroelectric Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1965/02/1556847/brazil-hydroelectric-projects","projn":"BR-Estreito Hydroelectr -- P006227,BR-Xavantes Hydroelectr -- P006228","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Small Scale Enterprise,Microfinance,Economic Adjustment and Lending,Private Participation in Infrastructure,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Infrastructure Economics and Finance","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101902482587"},"subsc":"(Historic)Hydro","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Infrastructure Economics and Finance","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Bank\n            lending,Company,contractors,corporation,debt,Disbursement,disbursements,eco,expansion,firms,Guarantee\n            Agreements,Guarantor,legislation,LOAN,Loan Agreement,Loan\n            Agreements,manufacturers,rate of exchange,return on\n            investment,Special Fund,subsidiaries,suppliers"},"1":{"cdata!":"Bank\n            lending,Company,contractors,corporation,debt,Disbursement,disbursements,eco,expansion,firms,Guarantee\n            Agreements,Guarantor,legislation,LOAN,Loan Agreement,Loan\n            Agreements,manufacturers,rate of exchange,return on\n            investment,Special Fund,subsidiaries,suppliers"}},"owner":"WB Office: Brasilia, Brazil CMU (LCC5C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"P421","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Estreito Hydroelectric Project*Xavantes\n            Hydroelectric Project"}}},"facets":{}}}
