Lessons\n            learned from the project are as follows: financial\n            institutions development project's (FIDP) ability to\n            fulfill its development objectives was greatly impacted by\n            external macroeconomic risks. Frequent changes in Government\n            personnel led to constant delays in project implementation\n            which was affected by lengthy bureaucratic processes. The\n            complementarities of the FIDP and enterprise support project\n            provided positive synergies. One of the major features of\n            the Project was the use of twining arrangements with\n            European banks for capacity building in the Russian banks.\n            Project performance depends to a large degree on the\n            flexibility of Project design and responsiveness of Project\n            stakeholders. The project success is also influenced to a\n            large extent by the quality of governance in the banking\n            sector, which was quite weak in Russia."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation - Financial Institutions\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Russian Federation - Financial\n            Institutions Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/06/6944462/russian-federation-financial-institutions-development-project","projn":"RU-Financial Institutions Project -- P008828","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,Corporate Law,Financial Intermediation,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Law and Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Russian Federation","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20060724155330"},"subsc":"Banking,Law and justice,Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Law and Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, Accounting, accounting\n            practices, Adjustment, asset classification, auditing,\n            audits, bank accounting, bank deposits, bank holding\n            companies, bank lending, bank licensing, bank restructuring,\n            Bank supervision, banking industry, banking legislation,\n            banking reform, banking regulation, banking sector, banking\n            services, banking stability, banking supervision, banking\n            system, bankruptcy, Banque de France, Borrower, capital\n            adequacy, Central Bank, charter, Commercial Bank, Commercial\n            Banks, commitment, consolidated supervision, consolidation,\n            consolidation of accounts, Cooperatives, corporate\n            governance, credit policies, Currency Pool Loan, Deposit\n            Insurance, deposits, disbursement, disclosure requirements,\n            due diligence, early warning system, economic policies,\n            economic reform, economic reforms, external auditors,\n            externalities, financial crisis, Financial Institution,\n            Financial Institutions, financial intermediation, financial\n            management, financial reporting, financial reports,\n            financial resources, financial sector development, financial\n            sector reform, financial structures, foreign banks,\n            Government reform, grace period, Grant financing,\n            insolvency, Institutional Development, institutional\n            infrastructure, interest rates, International Accounting\n            Standards, international banking, laws, legal framework,\n            legislation, legislative framework, lenders, limited,\n            liquidation, LOAN, Loan Agreements, Loan amount, loan\n            disbursements, loan finance, loan portfolio management, loan\n            portfolios, macroeconomic policy, macroeconomic stability,\n            managers, market discipline, market risk, monopolies,\n            operating costs, operating expenses, ownership structures,\n            portfolio management, portfolios, private commercial banks,\n            private ownership, privatization, problem banks, Project\n            financing, regional banks, regulatory framework, regulatory\n            infrastructure, risk management, Single Currency Loan,\n            stakeholders, state banks, state enterprises, Subsidiary,\n            Subsidiary Loan, Subsidiary Loan Agreement, supervisory\n            framework, Technical Assistance, trading, transparency, Union"}},"owner":"Private/Financial Sectors Devt (ECSPF)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"4":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF020250-FRENCH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF020290-IRISH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF022150-PHRD 2-PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM\n            I/CFS CONL'T,TF022620-CANADIAN CTF FOR E. & C.\n            EUROPE & THE CIS,TF023072-PHRD-FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEV.,TF023330-SIDA CTF FOR EASTERN EUROPE,TF025149-PHRD-FINANCIAL INST.
