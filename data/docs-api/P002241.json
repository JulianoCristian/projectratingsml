Among the lessons learned, the adequacy\n            of the project's lending instrument, highlights the\n            high degree of flexibility allowed in adjusting existing\n            projects, to a post-conflict environment, key to achieving\n            the project's objectives. However, lessons also outline\n            the need for strong Bank supervision, and pro-active\n            monitoring of the implementation progress, to include as\n            well a project design with a precise selection, and\n            coordination of components. Under the circumstances,\n            although the project did include legal, and regulatory\n            reforms, these were not implemented due to the limited\n            Government capacity. It is important to take into account\n            that post-conflict countries' ability to sustain\n            commitments, and ownership will hinder a reform agenda, and\n            thus the full success of project objectives. Therefore,\n            special attention should be paid to implementation\n            arrangements, particularly upon project re-design, by\n            providing support to the implementing agency,

The project comprises two main components: (a)\n            strengthening of the institutional regulatory and policy\n            environment; and (b) rehabilitation of key infrastructure in\n            the power subsector. The first component will include: (i)\n            restructuring the Rwandese Utility Company to permit\n            contracting out its operations to a private operator; (ii)\n            consulting services to prepare new statutes and organization\n            chart for the utility and bidding documents for the\n            selection of the private operator, and to assist in\n            implementing its contracting under a lease type contract and\n            in establishing two companies; (iii) implementation of a\n            series of make-ready measures in order to attract qualified\n            private operators; (iv) introduction of incentives to\n            rationalize and improve the efficiency of the charcoal\n            subsector; (v) implementation of environmental and technical\n            guidelines for future development of Lake Kivu's\n            methane gas by private investors; (vi) studies to design and\n            implement a strategy for development of solar home systems\n            as a cost-efficient alternative for electricity in rural\n            areas; and (vii) technical assistance and training to\n            strengthen the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and\n            Handicrafts's capacity to deal with petroleum products\n            issues. The power subsector component includes: (i)\n            rehabilitation and improvements of key power infrastructure\n            for five cities; (ii) improvement in the medium voltage\n            sections; (iii) overhauls of power station and hydraulic\n            structures; (iv) feasibility studies for hydroplants; (v)\n            constitution of a strategic stock of spare parts for plants\n            and substations; and (vi) capacity building and training\n            through scholarships and strengthening of the investment\n            planning and monitoring capacity of the utility staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Projet de Rehabilitation du Secteur\n            de l'Energie"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda \u2013 Projet de r\u00e9habilitation\n            du secteur de l\u2019\u00e9nergie : Rwanda\u00a0- Projet de r\u00e9habilitation\n            du secteur de l\u2019\u00e9nergie"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/08/12187249/rwanda-energy-sector-rehabilitation-project-rwanda-projet-de-rehabilitation-du-secteur-de-lenergie","projn":"RW-Rwanda Energy Sector Rehabilitation And\n            Urban Waste Management -- P002241","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Environmental Economics & Policies,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion,Energy and Environment","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Environment,Science and Technology Development,Energy","count":"Rwanda","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20100504003604"},"subsc":"Mining and other extractive,Power,Renewable energy,Oil and gas,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Environment,Science and Technology Development,Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Institution building; Power distribution;\n            Energy policy; Methane; Power plants; Petroleum; Solar\n            energy; Charcoal; Energy efficiency,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Institution building; Power distribution;\n            Energy policy; Methane; Power plants; Petroleum; Solar\n            energy; Charcoal; Energy efficiency,,"}},"owner":"Energy Practice 1 (AFTG1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF028065-CANADIAN CONSLT.

The project comprises two main components: (a)\n            strengthening of the institutional regulatory and policy\n            environment; and (b) rehabilitation of key infrastructure in\n            the power subsector. The first component will include: (i)\n            restructuring the Rwandese Utility Company to permit\n            contracting out its operations to a private operator; (ii)\n            consulting services to prepare new statutes and organization\n            chart for the utility and bidding documents for the\n            selection of the private operator, and to assist in\n            implementing its contracting under a lease type contract and\n            in establishing two companies; (iii) implementation of a\n            series of make-ready measures in order to attract qualified\n            private operators; (iv) introduction of incentives to\n            rationalize and improve the efficiency of the charcoal\n            subsector; (v) implementation of environmental and technical\n            guidelines for future development of Lake Kivu's\n            methane gas by private investors; (vi) studies to design and\n            implement a strategy for development of solar home systems\n            as a cost-efficient alternative for electricity in rural\n            areas; and (vii) technical assistance and training to\n            strengthen the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and\n            Handicrafts's capacity to deal with petroleum products\n            issues. The power subsector component includes: (i)\n            rehabilitation and improvements of key power infrastructure\n            for five cities; (ii) improvement in the medium voltage\n            sections; (iii) overhauls of power station and hydraulic\n            structures; (iv) feasibility studies for hydroplants; (v)\n            constitution of a strategic stock of spare parts for plants\n            and substations; and (vi) capacity building and training\n            through scholarships and strengthening of the investment\n            planning and monitoring capacity of the utility staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Energy Sector Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda - Energy Sector\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/01/734818/rwanda-energy-sector-rehabilitation-project","projn":"RW-Rwanda Energy Sector Rehabilitation And\n            Urban Waste Management -- P002241","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Environmental Economics & Policies,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion,Energy and Environment","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Rwanda","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961003092738"},"subsc":"Mining and other extractive,Power,Renewable energy,Oil and gas,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to\n            electricity,atmosphere,Charcoal,crude\n            oil,debt,electricity,energy balance,energy demand,energy\n            needs,Energy Operations,energy policy,energy\n            resources,Energy Sector,expenditures,Exploitation,financial\n            resources,Forestry,fuel,fuelwood,GNP,grid,hydro\n            power,hydroelectric power,imports,income,industrial\n            activities,inflation,Marginal Cost,Methane,methane\n            gas,Oil,Oil Equivalent,peak demand,Peat,per capita\n            income,Petroleum,Petroleum Products,Power Company,power\n            stations,Power System,production of electricity,Public\n            Works,reservoirs,Solar Energy,Structural\n            Adjustment,Tools,total consumption,Transport,urban centers,utilities"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to\n            electricity,atmosphere,Charcoal,crude\n            oil,debt,electricity,energy balance,energy demand,energy\n            needs,Energy Operations,energy policy,energy\n            resources,Energy Sector,expenditures,Exploitation,financial\n            resources,Forestry,fuel,fuelwood,GNP,grid,hydro\n            power,hydroelectric power,imports,income,industrial\n            activities,inflation,Marginal Cost,Methane,methane\n            gas,Oil,Oil Equivalent,peak demand,Peat,per capita\n            income,Petroleum,Petroleum Products,Power Company,power\n            stations,Power System,production of electricity,Public\n            Works,reservoirs,Solar Energy,Structural\n            Adjustment,Tools,total consumption,Transport,urban centers,utilities"}},"owner":"Energy Practice 1 (AFTG1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF028065-CANADIAN CONSLT.
