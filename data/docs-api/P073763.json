While some of the\n            project development objective indicators and intermediate\n            outcome indicators were achieved fully, five were partially\n            achieved, while two were not achieved. There were no\n            baselines and targets for many of the project outcome and\n            output indicators, and so limitations were faced in terms of\n            capturing project performance with respect to the original\n            intent. The original project scope was significantly reduced\n            relative to project design, with this restructuring\n            happening at a late stage. Significant lessons learned\n            during the implementation of the project were: 1)\n            performance based contract could be a good model for\n            improving operational efficiency of a water supply utility;\n            2) project design should be simple and realistic; 3) a\n            modest start and testing innovations before scaling up are\n            preferable; 4) a thorough assessment of institutional\n            readiness of implementing agencies is necessary; 5)\n            effective techniques to handle risks should be implemented;\n            6) properly designed and functional monitoring and\n            evaluation should be ensured; and 7) a follow through on\n            good practices or innovations initiated by the project\n            should be ensured."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Urban Water Supply Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Urban Water Supply\n            Development

Project\n            implementation has improved during the last twelve months.\n            All contracts have been awarded with physical progress of\n            all works combined reaching 70 percent as of May 30, 2012\n            with an overall International Development Association (IDA)\n            disbursement rate of more than 55 percent. It is expected\n            that by June 30, 2012 the project will be substantially\n            completed, with eighty seven percent (87 percent) of the IDA\n            funds (US$ 98.0 million) committed and an expected\n            cancellation of the uncommitted IDA funds (US$ 14.6\n            million). The project currently has an overall rating of\n            moderately satisfactory. Notwithstanding recent improvement,\n            the project has met with implementation difficulties during\n            the previous seven years which have led to the project\n            restructuring. The changes are: (i) partial cancellation of\n            the credit amount; (ii) first time extension of the credit\n            closing date for selected provinces and project components\n            to June 30, 2013; (iii) a reduction in the number of\n            provinces anticipated to participate in component A; (iv) a\n            change in the design/build/operate contracting process in\n            component A to design/build only with operations assumed by\n            the water utilities directly; (v) inclusion of an additional\n            province in component B; (vi) a name change of the\n            implementing institution for component C; (vii) a revision\n            of first schedule, withdrawal of the proceeds of the credit\n            to reflect the actual costs and disbursements; (viii) a\n            revision of second schedule, description of the project, to\n            specify the name of project participating provinces and of\n            the content of component D; and (ix) a revision of key\n            performance indicators of the project to reflect the changes\n            in components A and B.
