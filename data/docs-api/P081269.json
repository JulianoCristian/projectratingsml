- Second Education Sector\n            Development Project (Phase Two)"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Second Education Sector\n            Development Project for Lesotho are as follows: outcomes of\n            the project were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: use of\n            implementation arrangements outside of the public service\n            structures created difficulties of sustainability. Despite\n            the intentions at appraisal, the Project Support and\n            Coordination Unit (PSCU) became the de facto implementing\n            agency for the project and for other Ministry of Education\n            and Training (MoET) functions. Once established, it was\n            allowed to grow rapidly. While effective in implementing the\n            core tasks, the PSCU did little to build capacity within the\n            ministry. In fact, any failures in the ministry were seen as\n            strengthening the case for continuation of the PSCU. The\n            reluctance to address this issue on time, and to develop a\n            realistic transition strategy, has resulted in a much more\n            abrupt transition than would otherwise have been the case,\n            with consequent disruption to the work of the MoET. Building\n            capacity within the MoET remains a challenge. Provision of\n            training courses has had some impact, but the benefits were\n            eroded by staff turnover and by organizational structures\n            which prevented optimal use of the skilled personnel.\n            Building better organizational structures is likely to take\n            some time, and some external assistance may be required to\n            ensure efficient operation of the MoET. However, future\n            external assistance should be carefully managed to ensure\n            that it supports capacity building aims and cannot become a\n            separate arm of the ministry."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Second Education Sector\n            Development Project (Phase Two)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lesotho - Second Education Sector\n

the\n            proposed Second Education Sector Development Project (Phase\n            02) is to further improve the access, equity, and quality of\n            primary and secondary education, promote lifelong learning\n            through building capacity in early childhood, technical and\n            vocational, higher and non-formal education, and\n            strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of\n            Education and Training. The following are components to the\n            project. Primary Education: 1) This component will finance\n            252 primary classrooms with related facilities including\n            administrative block, kitchen, latrines, and standard\n            classroom furniture. 2) This component will annually finance\n            up to 15,000 bursaries to orphans and other disadvantaged\n            children in upper primary and lower secondary grades. 3)\n            this component will support the additional core primary\n            textbooks needed to cater for new primary enrolment. 3) This\n            component will finance the development of a secondary core\n            textbook rental scheme and revolving fund, and the purchase\n            of the initial start-up stock for the rental scheme. 4).\n            This component will finance (a) a refresher course for\n            primary teachers in core subjects once every two years and\n            (b) annual training of primary inspectors and advisors. 5)\n            This component will finance the continuous training of\n            school management (principals and their deputies, and\n            primary management committees). 6) Distance Teacher\n            Education Program. As of 2001, about 25% of Lesotho's\n            8225 primary teachers are still not qualified, meaning they\n            have a below diploma level education. 7) This component will\n            finance the continued development of an Integrated\n            Curriculum and Examination Framework, localization of the\n            Cambridge Overseas School Certificate Exam and\n            implementation of the National Standardized Tests in basic\n            literacy and numeracy. Components for Secondary Education:\n            1) This component will finance the construction of at least\n            3 secondary schools with related facilities, furniture, and\n            equipment. 2) This component will annually finance up to\n            15000 bursaries to orphans and other disadvantaged children\n            in upper primary and secondary grades. 3) This component\n            will finance the development of a secondary core textbook\n            rental scheme and revolving fund and the purchase of the\n            initial start-up stock for the rental scheme. 4) This\n            component will finance (a) a refresher course for secondary\n            teachers of Math, English, Science, and Sesotho once every\n            two years and (b) annual training of secondary inspectors\n            and advisors. 5) This component will finance the continuous\n            training of secondary school."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Second
