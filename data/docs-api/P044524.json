The key lessons learned are: 1)\n            Emergency projects should use a simple design as well as\n            simplified procurement procedures. 2) Sector work should be\n            undertaken and policy issues addressed during projects\n            supervision using grant financing and through coordination\n            with other donors. 3) Emergency projects should be designed\n            in a modular nature, allowing for flexibility in\n            re-allocating resources during implementation. 4) Qualified\n            borrower personnel should be appointed full time to an\n            implementation unit during the project preparation period\n            and be given autonomy in the execution of the project. 5)\n            Continuous technical assistance for implementation should be\n            built into emergency projects from preparation through the\n            first year of implementation. 6) The borrower's project\n            unit should enjoy autonomy in its day-to-day operations. 7)\n            Appointment of experienced Bank staff to field offices is\n            the best way to ensure timely client service necessary for\n            early project start-up, clearance of bidding documents, etc.\n            8) Streamlined procurement guidelines are important\n            ingredients for accelerated implementation of emergency\n            projects. 9) Donor confidence in autonomous project\n            management units should be strengthened through special\n            procurement reviews as well as technical and financial\n            audits. 10) Close communication and coordination among\n            donors and nongovernmental organizations is important."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Emergency Education\n

Bosnia and\n            Herzegovina's efforts to restore the delivery of\n            primary education of acceptable quality during the 1996-97\n            school year. A second objective is to help build capacity\n            for planning and implementation of education programs at the\n            state, entity, canton, and municipality level. To achieve\n            these objectives under the prevailing constraints, the\n            project focuses on meeting immediate educational needs in\n            primary schooling which can, for the most part, be put in\n            place prior to the start of the next school year in\n            September, 1996. The components of the project are the\n            following: 1) primary school reconstruction; 2) books and\n            educational materials; 3) project implementation and\n            capacity building; and 4) project preparation and pilot\n            implementation in the Republica Srpska. They include civil\n            works, provision of furniture and equipment and technical\n            assistance and training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Emergency Education\n            Reconstruction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -\n            Emergency Education Reconstruction Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/04/696603/bosnia-herzegovina-emergency-education-reconstruction-project","projn":"BA-Emg Ed Rec -- P044524","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","docty":"Technical Annex","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961019214818"},"subsc":"Primary education,Sub-national government administration,Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1996","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"academic year,addition,adult\n            education,Advertising,asbestos,basic learning,classroom\n            size,classroom teaching,classrooms,construction\n            costs,curriculum,curriculum development,curriculum\n            structure,education enrollments,Education\n            governance,education programs,education reform,Education\n            Sector,Education Statistics,Education System,education\n            systems,educational functions,Educational\n            Materials,educational needs,educational\n            responsibilities,educational standards,effective\n            teaching,engineering,ethnic groups,financial\n            resources,foreign students,general secondary\n            education,geography,housing,instruction,languages,learning,learning\n            materials,level of education,levels of\n            education,libraries,literature,migration,Ministries of\n            Education,natural sciences,parents,policy\n            development,primary classrooms,primary education,Primary\n            School,primary schooling,primary schools,printing,qualified\n            teachers,quality control,reading,reading materials,school\n            buildings,school construction,school furniture,school\n            infrastructure,School libraries,school\n            rehabilitation,schooling,secondary education,secondary\n            level,secondary schools,Sports,teacher,Teacher\n            Salaries,teacher training,teachers,teaching,teaching\n            aids,teaching methods,Teaching Staff,textbook\n            production,textbooks,universities,untrained\n            teachers,violence,vocational education,vocational education\n            programs,well-developed education system"},"1":{"cdata!":"academic year,addition,adult\n            education,Advertising,asbestos,basic learning,classroom\n            size,classroom teaching,classrooms,construction\n            costs,curriculum,curriculum development,curriculum\n            structure,education enrollments,Education\n            governance,education programs,education reform,Education\n            Sector,Education Statistics,Education System,education\n            systems,educational functions,Educational\n            Materials,educational needs,educational\n            responsibilities,educational standards,effective\n            teaching,engineering,ethnic groups,financial\n            resources,foreign students,general secondary\n            education,geography,housing,instruction,languages,learning,learning\n            materials,level of education,levels of\n            education,libraries,literature,migration,Ministries of\n            Education,natural sciences,parents,policy\n            development,primary classrooms,primary education,Primary\n            School,primary schooling,primary schools,printing,qualified\n            teachers,quality control,reading,reading materials,school\n            buildings,school construction,school furniture,school\n            infrastructure,School libraries,school\n            rehabilitation,schooling,secondary education,secondary\n            level,secondary schools,Sports,teacher,Teacher\n            Salaries,teacher training,teachers,teaching,teaching\n            aids,teaching methods,Teaching Staff,textbook\n            production,textbooks,universities,untrained\n            teachers,violence,vocational education,vocational education\n            programs,well-developed education system"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Unit (ECSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF024040-TFBH-EMERGENCY EDUCATION\n            RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT","repnb":"T6856"},"facets":{}}}
