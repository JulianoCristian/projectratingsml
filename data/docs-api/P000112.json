A number of important lessons\n            have emerged: Although the main focus of the project was on\n            capacity building and project design was as simple as\n            possible, expectations were overly optimistic. The\n            disbursement was low, which is a typical problem for\n            capacity building projects. This will need to be factored\n            into future project preparation. The Staff Appraisal Report,\n            while defining the objectives and the project structure,\n            provides little detail on exactly what would be done and\n            what results might be expected. While this complicates\n            somewhat the process of ex-post evaluation, it has given the\n            implementing agency tremendous flexibility in developing its\n            work program. Such flexibility can be used to maximize the\n            project's response to local needs, unexpected\n            opportunities, and changing circumstances. However, this\n            strategy also carries a significant risk should project\n            staff not be able to meet the challenge. The autonomy of the\n            national environmental agency, which is based on separate\n            budget allocations and specific contractual arrangements for\n            the staff (not the civil service) was particularly important\n            for ensuring compliance with the requirements of the\n            environmental impact assessment. This autonomy was important\n            in safeguarding the project against untimely political interference."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Environmental Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - Environmental Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/06/1953624/benin-environmental-management-project","projn":"BJ-Env.
