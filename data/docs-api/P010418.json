Both\n            World Bank and Borrower performances are rated satisfactory\n            overall: Despite weaknesses in project management, the\n            project largely achieved both its physical targets and\n            development objectives. Key lessons learned include the\n            following: Ownership of the project design at the political,\n            bureaucratic, and operational levels is a pre-requisite for\n            project success. A conducive policy environment and\n            willingmess to learn by doing are equally vital for success.\n            Project design should respond to village aspirations for\n            high service standards. The state level institutions should\n            have the appropriate mandate and functional autonomy to play\n            an effective facilitating role. The excessive turnover of\n            key project staff has been a serious problem. Changing\n            mandates and mindsets of state agencies, capacity building\n            of all stakeholders by providing resources, and quality time\n            need to be at the core of project design. Capacity building\n            should address motivation, team building, and managerial\n            issues for project staff. Implementation arrangements and\n            procurement procedures should be aligned with community\n            empowerment principles in participatory projects.\n            Women's active participation improve local ownership\n            and quality of implementation. Imaginative approaches have\n            to be vigorously implemented to draw women into project activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Karnataka Rural Water Supply and\n            Environmental

non-government organizations.\n            With the onset of the international drinking water and\n            sanitation decade, new initiatives have been taken in\n            several states for the implementation of Integrated Rural\n            Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Projects (IRWS and\n            ESP). A unique opportunity existed in Karnataka state to\n            make a comparative study of externally assisted IRWS and ESP\n            and government involvement in the sector. The interest in\n            the study arose because of certain innovative policies,\n            strategies, and approaches in project implementation and\n            management. The study was conducted in two parts. The first\n            part was\u00b7 related to village level studies which were\n            carried out in selected villages of the three externally\n            assisted projects and the project under the government. The\n            second part of the study was addressed to technical and\n            management aspects including financial aspects and project\n            implementation.

It raises the standard of living in rural areas by\n            improving health and productivity . This is accomplished by\n            expanding access to potable rural water supply systems and\n            environmental sanitation facilities. Beneficiary communities\n            are assuming full responsibility for operation and\n            maintenance including cost recovery. These communities are\n            also responsible for capital cost sharing for environment\n            sanitation works. This project comprises the following\n            components: (a) construction of new and rehabilitation of\n            existing water supply schemes in 1,200 villages including\n            leakage repair works, assistance for Public Health\n            Engineering Department's borewell program, a water\n            quality monitoring program and measures for groundwater\n            recharge; (b) construction of environmental sanitation\n            facilities including sullage drainage and, on a demand\n            basis, pit latrines, washing platforms, cattle troughs,\n            bathing cubicles, street bins and biogas plants; (c) health\n            communication for creation of greater community awareness\n            and demand for improved hygiene and environmental\n            sanitation; and (d) institutional strengthening through\n            community development programs (creation of village water\n            supply and sanitation committees) and comprehensive training\n            programs.

and includes 1200\n            villages. It raises the standard of living in rural areas by\n            improving health and productivity . This is accomplished by\n            expanding access to potable rural water supply systems and\n            environmental sanitation facilities. Beneficiary communities\n            are assuming full responsibility for operation and\n            maintenance including cost recovery. These communities are\n            also responsible for capital cost sharing for environment\n            sanitation works. This project comprises the following\n            components: (a) construction of new and rehabilitation of\n            existing water supply schemes in 1,200 villages including\n            leakage repair works, assistance for Public Health\n            Engineering Department's borewell program, a water\n            quality monitoring program and measures for groundwater\n            recharge; (b) construction of environmental sanitation\n            facilities including sullage drainage and, on a demand\n            basis, pit latrines, washing platforms, cattle troughs,\n            bathing cubicles, street bins and biogas plants; (c) health\n            communication for creation of greater community awareness\n            and demand for improved hygiene and environmental\n            sanitation; and (d) institutional strengthening through\n            community development programs (creation of village water\n            supply and sanitation committees) and comprehensive training\n            programs.
