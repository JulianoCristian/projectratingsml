Some lessons learned included: Information and\n            Communication Technology (ICT) buses are an innovative\n            solution to reach to people in rural areas. The ICT buses\n            have 20 laptop computer stations with an internet\n            connection. In addition, the bus has a large monitor and DVD\n            player, a projector and projector screen, and its own power\n            generator. The ICT buses allowed youth and rural people, who\n            do not have household electricity, an opportunity to become\n            familiar with ICT by touching computers and using the\n            internet. It provided opportunities to teach basic IT skills\n            and promoted ICT awareness at the grass-root level. The ICR\n            team concurred that ICT buses have a high potential to\n            positively affect social development in Rwanda. In fact,\n            this project aimed at mitigating gender digital divide by\n            mandating at least 30 percent female participation in all\n            training sessions in ICT buses. The eRwanda project took a\n            unique approach to building local monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) capacity. Under component 4 (Program Management),\n            the project supported M&E courses at Kigali Institute of\n            Science and Technology (KIST) in order to build local\n            M&E capacity. Thanks to the participation of KIST\n            students, the eRwanda team was able to conduct two\n            large-scale user surveys (in 2008 and in 2010) with a\n            limited budget. Equally important, the KIST students\n            obtained first-hand survey experience. This collaboration\n            created a win-win situation for both parties, and is a\n            scenario to be replicated in other Bank projects. PROCYS\n            (Procurement Cycle Tracking System) launched in Rwanda in\n            November 2008 together with other pilot countries for the\n            first phase in the Africa Region. e-Rwanda was among the\n            first projects to use the system. The first request was sent\n            through PROCSYS by eRwanda team in January 2009, 3 month\n            after the system launch. The system was found very useful in\n            terms of monitoring and tracking the procurement process,\n            because all documents are saved in the same place in the\n            system automatically. There is no need for the client to\n            send hard copies to the Bank, since Task Team Leader (TTL)\n            and other team members including Procurement Staff can\n            access the system directly from anywhere. Also the system\n            allows users to generate periodical monitoring reports. It\n            contributed tremendously to reduce the time required for\n            review and response on sides (Bank and Client) as well as\n            procurement monitoring and management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - eRwanda Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda - eRwanda

      communication infrastructure (NICI) plan with potentially\n            the greatest impact on good governance and improved\n            conditions for the country's citizens, particularly\n            those most vulnerable, least economically advantaged and\n            vast majority of citizens who live in the rural areas\n            including women, farmers, and traders. The goal is to\n            modernize the Rwandan economy and society into a knowledge\n            based economy using information and communication technology\n            (ICT) as the engine for accelerated development, economic\n            growth, national prosperity, and global competitiveness.\n            This final study (phase out survey) is a follow up to the\n            2008 project baseline survey that was carried out to\n            establish the starting point of the project. The main\n            purpose of this study is to enable the project to establish\n            how much it has impacted its stakeholders in relation to the\n            outcomes it is trying to achieve that is, the status of the\n            project's key performance indicators at the point of\n            closure of the project. Data collection was done through\n            face-to-face interview forms, self-administered\n            questionnaires, electronic forms, and focus group\n            discussions. Observation and probing were also used to\n            obtain some of the required information and for verification\n            purposes. This end term evaluation study was conducted among\n            at least 3,394 respondents with the specific objectives to\n            establish the existing ICT infrastructure and applications\n            usage and distribution in government institutions, the\n            public service delivery performance at government\n            institutions, the awareness levels and exploitation of\n            e-Governace among Rwandan citizens, and to establish the\n            level of citizen's access to information and public\n            services. After this assessment opinions were obtained from\n            respondents on what services and on how best they think\n            service delivery and information can be improved in the\n            societies.
