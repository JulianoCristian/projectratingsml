potential adverse impacts of project\n            activities associated with the Second National Solidarity\n            Project for Afghanistan. Good engineering design will, in\n            most cases, have a positive impact on the environmental\n            conditions in the project area. Construction and operation\n            stage impacts will be addressed through a simplified\n            Environmental Management Plan. The environmental management\n            plan will suggest measures such as those identified in this\n            environmental and social management framework. This report\n            instructs that the following guidelines be included in\n            contractual agreements:  Install the work site in areas far\n            enough from water points, houses and sensitive areas.\n            Provide sanitary equipment and installations if needed\n            appropriate. Establish site regulations for site management.\n            Adhere strictly to laws, rules and other permits. Follow\n            hygiene and set security on work sites. Protect neighboring\n            properties. Prevent traffic congestion and ease access of\n            nearby population during the work shift. Protect staff\n            working on work sites. Avoid any wastewater discharge, oil\n            spills, and discharge of any type of pollutants on soils, on\n            surface waters or ground waters, in sewers, drainage\n            ditches. Protect the environment (air quality) against\n            exhaust fuels and oils. Protect the environment against dust\n            and other solid residues. Install containers to collect\n            wastes generated next to the areas of activity. Inform and\n            raise the awareness of the populations before any activity\n            causing degradation of natural vegetation and resources.\n            Compensate beneficiaries before any work that would cause\n            demolition of private properties. Use a quarry for materials\n            according to the mining code requirements. Plant trees in\n            case of deforestation or tree felling. Ban waste slashing\n            and burning on site. Set speed limits for work site engines\n            and cars. Allow the access of public and emergency services.\n            Organize the storage of materials on the public highway.\n            Control parking and displacements of machines. Provide\n            footbridges and access of neighbors. Provide signaling of\n            works. Respect cultural sites. Dispose of asbestos safely.\n            Consider impacts such as noise, dust, and safety concerns on\n            the surrounding population and schedule construction\n            activities accordingly. Protect soil surfaces during\n            construction and revegetate or physically stabilize eligible\n            surfaces. Prevent standing water in open construction pits,\n            quarries or fill areas to avoid potential contamination of\n            the water table and the development of a habitat for\n            disease-carrying vectors and insects. Select sustainable\n            construction materials, particularly wood. Control and clean\n            the construction site daily. During construction, control\n            dust by using water or through other means. Provide adequate\n            waste disposal and sanitation services at the construction\n            site. Dispose of solid waste materials appropriately.\n            Preserve natural habitats along streams, steep slopes, and\n            ecologically sensitive areas; Develop maintenance and\n            reclamation plans and restore vegetation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan -
