Regardless of success,\n            lessons convey the need for deepening the reform in such\n            areas as: greater emphasis on high standards for all\n            students, particularly those under-performing; greater\n            support to schools to address deficiencies; and, improvement\n            in the implementation process, with emphasis on performance\n            indicators, and greater accountability. Most importantly,\n            since the project was designed almost a decade ago, the\n            focus was to provide the necessary inputs, and strengthen\n            management capacity. However, this supply-driven model,\n            needs to be complemented by a demand-driven approach, in\n            order for the reform to take root at the school level.\n            Regarding the social policy analysis (SPA), lessons\n            stipulate that building analytic capacity is a slow, and\n            incremental process, which requires careful diagnosis, for\n            activities to reach the required cumulative effect. The\n            success of SPA lies in that it reached the broad network of\n            people involved in generating data, analyzing it, and\n            developing policy, and, because analysts had access to data\n            for training, and research purposes. However, with respect\n            to training indications suggest that demand is likely to be\n            high; that participants should be relatively homogeneous in\n            terms of mathematical background, computer literacy, and\n            access to computer facilities; and, that participants should\n            be encouraged to enroll program-wide, rather than individual\n            courses, to enhance curriculum skills."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica -

The project comprises three main\n            components:  (1) secondary reform support which includes:\n            (a) the introduction of a common curriculum; (b) related\n            pre-service and in-service training; (c) textbooks; (d)\n            educational support materials; (e) physical infrastructure\n            for schools; and (f) studies and pilot programs for\n            secondary education.  (2) Evaluation and management\n            strengthening which includes:  (a) rationalizing the\n            examination system; (b) establishing a secondary reform\n            management team to ensure that the reform is adequately\n            supported; (c) conducting a public awareness campaign to\n            inform key stakeholders about the benefits of the reform;\n            (d) developing an evaluation system to monitor the impact of\n            the new curriculum; and (e) preparing the second five-year\n            phase of the reform.  (3) Social policy analysis which will\n            improve the capacity of the government to undertake\n            sophisticated social policy analysis and formulate more\n            effective and targeted social sector programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Reform of Secondary Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jamaica - Reform of Secondary\n            Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/03/734730/jamaica-reform-secondary-education-project","projn":"JM-Reform Of Secondary -- P007479","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Curriculum & Instruction,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Jamaica","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961003225113"},"subsc":"Secondary education,Central government administration,Tertiary education","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ACADEMIC YEAR,Achievement tests,addition,age\n            group,age groups,Arts,basic education,churches,classroom\n            instruction,classrooms,clinics,Common\n            Curriculum,complexity,composition,comprehension,curricula,curriculum,decentralization,Development\n            Program,disasters,Drop-out rates,education,education\n            activities,education budget,education levels,Education\n            Materials,education sector,educational\n            achievement,educational inputs,Educational\n            Management,educational\n            provision,Employment,enrollment,enrollment\n            rate,families,female\n            participation,girls,health,hospitals,housing,income\n            levels,instructional materials,labor force,labor\n            market,learning,levels of\n            education,libraries,literacy,Living\n            Conditions,mathematics,Monitoring System,net\n            enrollment,numeracy,nutrition,parents,participation\n            rates,policy analysis,posters,primary education,primary\n            enrollment,primary enrollment rates,primary health\n            care,primary students,Private Sector,public awareness,public\n            education system,public health,Public Sector,pupils,quality\n            of education,reading,redundancy,Repetition,Repetition\n            Rates,schooling,schools,Secondary Education,secondary\n            level,secondary school teachers,secondary schools,Social\n            Policy,Social Research,social services,student\n            achievement,student enrollment,Teacher,Teacher\n            Education,Teacher qualifications,teacher\n            supply,Teachers,teaching,textbooks,tuition fees,tutoring"},"1":{"cdata!":"ACADEMIC YEAR,Achievement tests,addition,age\n            group,age groups,Arts,basic education,churches,classroom\n            instruction,classrooms,clinics,Common\n            Curriculum,complexity,composition,comprehension,curricula,curriculum,decentralization,Development\n            Program,disasters,Drop-out rates,education,education\n            activities,education budget,education levels,Education\n            Materials,education sector,educational\n            achievement,educational inputs,Educational\n            Management,educational\n            provision,Employment,enrollment,enrollment\n            rate,families,female\n            participation,girls,health,hospitals,housing,income\n            levels,instructional materials,labor force,labor\n            market,learning,levels of\n            education,libraries,literacy,Living\n            Conditions,mathematics,Monitoring System,net\n            enrollment,numeracy,nutrition,parents,participation\n            rates,policy analysis,posters,primary education,primary\n            enrollment,primary enrollment rates,primary health\n            care,primary students,Private Sector,public awareness,public\n            education system,public health,Public Sector,pupils,quality\n            of education,reading,redundancy,Repetition,Repetition\n            Rates,schooling,schools,Secondary Education,secondary\n            level,secondary school teachers,secondary schools,Social\n            Policy,Social Research,social services,student\n            achievement,student enrollment,Teacher,Teacher\n            Education,Teacher qualifications,teacher\n            supply,Teachers,teaching,textbooks,tuition fees,tutoring"}},"owner":"Education Sector (LCSHE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"}},"trustfund":"TF028065-CANADIAN CONSLT.
