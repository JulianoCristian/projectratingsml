It was\n            among the forerunners of decentralization. It established a\n            legal framework that clearly separates service provision\n            from policy making, thus allowing private sector\n            participation. The key to success in the Colombian water\n            sector reform has been the development of homegrown\n            solutions, and at times, skillfully adapting models used\n            elsewhere to the particular circumstances and culture of\n            Colombia. As a result, Colombia has made substantial\n            progress in the expansion of water supply and sanitation\n            (WSS) services. By 2002, urban water supply access was 99\n            percent, rural water supply coverage 71 percent. Sanitation\n            access has also been upgraded with urban coverage of 96\n            percent and rural coverage of 54 percent. Over the years,\n            the World Bank has supported Colombia through advisory work,\n            capacity building and lending. Since 1988, the World Bank\n            has provided a series of loans with a total value of over\n            US$ 700 million to the Colombian WSS sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Local solutions improve water supply and\n            sanitation services in Colombia"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Local solutions improve water\n            supply and sanitation services in Colombia"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/03/9969257/local-solutions-improve-water-supply-sanitation-services-colombia","projn":"CO-Water And Sanitation Sector Support\n            Project 1st Apl -- P082973,CO-Ws & Waste Sctr -- P006836,CO-Cartagena Wtr Supply & Sewerage Env.\n            -- P044140,CO-Water Sector Reform Assistance Project -- P065937","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water and Industry,Urban Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Colombia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20081026235441"},"subsc":"(Historic)Urban water supply,Central government administration,Water supply,Sub-national government administration,Sewerage,Sanitation,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","colti":"Water feature stories ; issue no. 8","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to sewerage, access to water, access\n            to water supply, capacity building, central government,\n            connections, Customer relations, Environmental Management,\n            expansion of water supply, Hours of service, investment\n            program, investment subsidies, large cities, local\n            entrepreneurs, local private shareholders, metering, MIXED\n            OWNERSHIP, municipalities, private operator, provision of\n            water, provision of water supply, public utilities, PUBLIC\n            UTILITY, rural water, rural water supply, Sanitation,\n            Sanitation access, sanitation coverage, sanitation\n            investments, Sanitation Sector, Sanitation Services, Sea,\n            service provision, service quality, sewerage, Sewerage\n            Company, Sewerage Sector, SMALLER TOWNS, TOWNS,\n            transparency, urban areas, urban water, urban water supply,\n            utilities, wastewater, wastewater treatment, water\n            consumers, water networks, water sector, water sector\n            reform, water supplies, Water Supply, water supply situation"}},"owner":"Urban Development Sector Unit (EASUR),Knowledge and Information Servs. (IMTKI),Urban (LCSUW)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"},"2":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF029605-PHRD-CARTAGENA WATER SUPPLY,\n            SEWERAGE AND,TF035447-LAC REGION - WASTE WATER\n            MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (ST.

Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: 1) reform of utility collateral must be undertaken by\n            bringing to an end the pledging of Government transfers as a\n            collateral for revenue earning projects, but instead\n            pledging utility revenues from user charges. This should be\n            embedded in the collateral legislation and apply to all\n            sector pledging, not just for loans rediscounted by Regional\n            Development Finance Corporation (FINDETER); 2) resources of\n            the national co-financing grant system, which originate from\n            Congress appropriations, have introduced distortions to\n            project objectives as a result of being allocated on the\n            basis of political criteria, without being subject to the\n            same conditions as those attached to the Bank loan proceeds.\n            This in turn has introduced a disincentive for\n            business-oriented performance on the part of the sector\n            companies and resulted in distorting one of the loan's\n            most important objective, namely that of promoting the\n            creation and strengthening of self-sufficient municipal\n            service companies; and 3) FINDETER's management,\n            staffing and project appraisal and supervision capability\n            have deteriorated sharply with growing political\n            considerations entering into decision making because of its\n            new role in handling large co-financing grants.
