Some lessons learned included:\n            long-term financial and political sustainability of the\n            created institutions need to be focused early on and\n            transition arrangements should be elaborated far in advance\n            of project closing. By delaying the reform of the\n            institutional framework for Invest in Guatemala (INVEST) and\n            National Competitiveness Program (PRONACOM), the government\n            missed an important opportunity to make the two institutions\n            financially sustainable by turning them into true\n            public-private partnerships funded by both government and\n            private sector funds. Additionally, while the Comite\n            Ampliado served as a supervisory board, it lacked the\n            mandate to set the agenda, and could not provide continuity\n            in the institutional framework and strategy of the two\n            institutions during political changes. Moving ahead,\n            PRONACOM might want to focus more strongly on setting\n            priorities and harmonizing and mainstreaming existing\n            initiatives. There are many reform initiatives ongoing in\n            the country by the government, stakeholders and donors,\n            leading to a duplication of efforts and a scattering of\n            resources. PRONACOM, through its supervisory board, could\n            provide an active forum to bring donors, stakeholders and\n            the government together to help reduce reform segmentation,\n            and scale individual reform initiatives up. Finally, a\n            common lesson from projects, monitoring and evaluation\n            frameworks need to be more carefully designed and\n            implemented. Providing a multitude of indicators, which are\n            not readily available and hinge on third parties, makes\n            monitoring time consuming, cumbersome and as a consequence\n            unlikely. Furthermore, target rates need to be realistic and\n            reflect the country's actual capacity to change given\n            cultural and political factors in the country. Finally, key\n            performance indicators should be formally adjusted when it\n            becomes apparent that reforms will not be implemented as\n            foreseen, or indicators are clearly too ambitious.\n            Clarifying and reducing the indicators to core indicators\n            facilitates not only the monitoring through the\n            implementation agency, but also provides clarity and focus\n            in the discussions on expected outcomes with the government\n            and stakeholders."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala - Competitiveness

President of the Republic, is to\n            advance the nation's international competitive standing\n            and accelerate its economic growth. The Competitiveness\n            Project aims to advance the Program's objective as well\n            as those of the nation's Peace Accords by helping\n            primarily small and micro businesses to generate higher\n            incomes and reduce high rates of poverty in Guatemala. There\n            are five main project components. The first increases\n            domestic market competition by adopting laws and\n            regulations, establishing the functional capacity of the\n            Competition Commission, acquiring public support for\n            competition policy, and completing an investigation of\n            competitiveness. The second component accelerates foreign\n            investment by providing full investor services. The third\n            component expands in-firm skills training and information\n            markets. The fourth component upgrades firm product and\n            process quality by establishing a training system, and\n            setting up government agencies with accredited labs or\n            certification programs. The fifth component increases firm\n            investments in learning and innovation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala - Competitiveness Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guatemala -
