The\n            project did not achieve its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was negligible, sustainability is\n            uncertain, and the performance of the Bank was satisfactory\n            while the Borrower's was deficient. Several lessons can\n            be learned from this project. First, policy related studies\n            should be completed during project preparation and policy\n            reforms should be undertaken before significant financial\n            commitments are made. Second, technical assistance should be\n            credit-financed to ensure quality and timely availability.\n            Third, non-salary inputs need to be fully budgeted in the\n            provincial recurrent budgets. Fourth, demand side\n            initiatives should be given much more attention, as should\n            the involvement of communities in the management, operation,\n            and maintenance of schools. Fifth, monitoring and evaluation\n            deficiencies are major constraints to sectoral planning and\n            reform. Sixth, the frequent transfer of key management\n            personnel is inimical to capacity building. Finally, for\n            future projects, IDA and authorities need to review the\n            basis on which IDA finances contracts that are procured at\n            the local level by untrained administrators working with\n            small contractors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Third Primary Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Third Primary\n            Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/06/731830/pakistan-third-primary-education-project","projn":"PK-Primary Educ.

The main objective of the project is to\n            support the core program of the Punjab's Five-Year\n            primary education investment program.  The specific\n            objectives include:  (a) improving institutional capacity to\n            plan, manage and implement the investment program; (b)\n            supporting policy reform; and (c) supporting innovations in\n            the delivery of primary education.  To that end, the project\n            entails (i) management improvement; (ii) curriculum\n            development and materials supply; (iii) teacher training;\n            (iv) communications/demand generation; and (v) finally,\n            school construction.
