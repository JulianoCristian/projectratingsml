Some lessons learned included: the\n            common assumption, that the weakest participating country is\n            the main limitation for the success of a regional project,\n            has proven to be invalid; this is especially true when a\n            strong regional institution is in place, which has the full\n            endorsement and confidence of the different riparian\n            countries of a shared river Basin. Global Environment\n            Facility (GEF) grant funding can play a critical role in\n            leveraging an inclusive reorganization of a regional\n            institution. GEF was catalytic in building a more inclusive\n            institutional structure for river Basin management\n            regionally and nationally. An important achievement was\n            increasing Guinean representation in Senegal River Basin\n            Authority (OMVS) at all levels, and more participatory\n            management and planning structures for river Basin\n            management. The Trans-boundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA)/\n            Strategic Action Plan (SAP) process played an important role\n            for mainstreaming environment at all levels and should\n            continue to play an important role for GEF projects\n            targeting trans-boundary water bodies or river Basins. Joint\n            co-implementation of a project through two GEF\n            implementation agencies (i.e. World Bank and United Nations\n            Development Program (UNDP)) on the basis of comparative\n            advantages identified only pays off when roles and\n            responsibilities of the two agencies are clearly planned and\n            laid out in advance with key reporting and supervision\n            processes harmonized to the extend possible."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa Region - Senegal River Basin Water\n            and Environmental Management

the Senegal River Basin\n            Water and Environmental Management Project, is to provide a\n            participatory, strategic environmental framework for the\n            environmentally sustainable development of the Senegal River\n            Basin, and to launch a basin-wide cooperative program for\n            trans-boundary land-water management. The first component\n            will build a core group of specialists with trans-boundary\n            environmental management expertise in the national\n            institutions associated with the OMVS - Senegal River Basin\n            Authority - and Guinea. Specifically, it will establish a\n            dialogue with Guinea on its environmental management and\n            legislation, through workshops, training, and information\n            exchange, and strengthen the national and regional\n            institutional and legislative capacity to enable the\n            riparian countries to address priority trans-boundary water\n            and environmental issues. Project management will support,\n            and facilitate experiences' exchange of other GEF\n            international waters projects, as well as technical capacity\n            building, through regional efforts to assess invasive\n            species (water weeds) management, and other issues.\n            Activities under the second component will assess the status\n            of OMVS country data, and, offer Guinea equitable\n            opportunity to develop the technical tools needed for land,\n            and water resources management, while promoting\n            collaboration on basin-level information. Specifically, this\n            will be achieved through studies, data assessment,\n            monitoring, and knowledge baseline in the four riparian\n            countries. A cartographic assessment of the Basin will be\n            developed, and a baseline rainfall/flow model for the upper\n            Basin prepared. Moreover, technical capacity will be\n            strengthened through training, workshops, and equipment\n            upgrade. Regional collaboration will be enhanced, to further\n            establish a cooperative basin-related data management\n            protocol for information exchange on the Basin resource\n            management. A Trans-boundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA),\n            under the third component, will examine existing conditions,\n            and management, and identify/analyze the Basin's\n            trans-boundary issues, to propose options for addressing\n            these issues, and any related socio-economic, and land-use issues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa Region - Senegal River Basin

This\n            environmental management Framework (EMF) identifies the\n            process to implement micro-grant-funded activities, within\n            the framework of national environmental policies, and\n            provides mechanisms to assess impacts at the national level.\n            It is recommended to identify regional priority actions, and\n            prepare national micro-grant action plans, where each\n            riparian country would prioritize issues, and areas to\n            provide a strategic framework for resource allocation, that\n            includes spatial, and thematic priorities for\n            implementation.

To this end, soil erosion control measures will\n            be established, namely by reforestation practices, improved\n            farm management practices, and pastoral land management.\n            Furthermore, stream banks will be restored by controlling\n            water weeds, and invasive species, and, by improving the\n            flow from irrigation ditches, to enhance water quality;\n            local wetland habitats will be restored through the\n            establishment of community wetland protection and\n            surveillance groups, to also protect community nature\n            reserves, and implement small-scale research on wildlife and habitats."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa Region -
