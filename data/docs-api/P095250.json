Health Services and Social\n            Assistance Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Health Services and Social\n            Assistance Project for Moldova received a moderately\n            satisfactory outcome rating with moderate risk to\n            development outcome. Both the Bank and the Borrower received\n            moderately satisfactory performance ratings. The project was\n            restricted twice. Due to a lack of progress on\n            implementation the following changes were made to the\n            project: (a) revision of the RF to provide more effective\n            monitoring; and (b) extension of the credit closing date. A\n            component was also added to the project as part of the\n            additional financing grant. Component 4: Protecting health\n            and nutritional status, provided financing to cover expenses\n            related to (a) procurement of commodities (food and\n            nutritional supplements) for pregnant or lactating women and\n            children under 3 years of age; and (b) cash transfers to\n            specialized institutions, which provided food to children,\n            handicapped people, the homeless, orphans, the elderly, and\n            victims of domestic violence, and other vulnerable groups to\n            compensate for food price increases. The following lessons\n            were learned from this project: (1) Health and social sector\n            reforms are costly, but long lasting. (2) Strong government\n            ownership is important, mainly with reform-oriented\n            projects. Reforms in health and social sectors are not\n            purely about technical issues, but depend profoundly on\n            ownership, institutional capacity, and the political\n            process. (3) Elections and changes in the cabinet of\n            ministries influenced the government\u0092s decisions and\n            attitudes toward the ongoing reforms. (4) Reaching agreement\n            among stakeholders is crucial. This applies not only during\n            preparation but also during implementation, as it can affect\n            the success and sustainability of any reform. (5) It is\n            difficult to institute a results-centered attitude."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova - Health Services and Social\n            Assistance
