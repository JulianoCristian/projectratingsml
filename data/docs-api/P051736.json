Lessons learned from the project:\n            Conducting extensive studies to ensure sound investment\n            decisions is very important for developing cost-effective\n            transmission systems. At the inception of the project, the\n            Bank indicated that the system required more investments\n            than envisaged under the project. The 500 kV river crossing\n            suspension tower bid package was technically complex in\n            nature and should have received greater attention during the\n            review and evaluation of the qualification of supplier and\n            its subcontractor. Having recognized the special nature of\n            the river crossing towers in the PAD, the Bank should have\n            insisted on prequalification of the prospective bidders\n            prior to the issuance of the bidding documents to the\n            qualified bidders. Qualification requirements should be\n            specified better and particular attention should be paid to\n            coordinating between commercial and technical aspects in\n            similar projects. The project confirmed the need to avoid\n            rigid and Bank mandated reform programs. It showed that\n            flexibility is paramount to adapt the agreed program to\n            institutional changes and revised reform objectives in the country."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - East China Jiangsu Power\n            Transmission Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - East China Jiangsu Power\n            Transmission Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/09/7285979/china-east-china-jiangsu-power-transmission-project","projn":"CN-E.

The East China (Jiangsu)\n            Transmission Line Project includes the addition of more than\n            993 km of transmission line, the construction of nine\n            additional substations, and the expansion of two existing\n            substations. The project has a rural component as well as an\n            urban component. Environmental impacts to water resources as\n            a result of substation construction along both rural and\n            urban components are expected to be both temporary and\n            minimal, since the planned substations are not located in\n            close proximity to water bodies. The project will require\n            the removal of more than 800,000 trees, comprised of fruit\n            trees and other planted varieties. Though trees in general\n            provide habitat for birds and other wildlife, the trees lost\n            for transmission line construction are domesticated\n            varieties in rural agricultural areas that have been\n            sufficiently fragmented to prevent their use as important\n            wildlife habitat, and similar habitat will be developed in\n            the new resettlement areas. Farmers will be compensated for\n            loss in agricultural production as a result of land acquired\n            for the project. Chinese law has strict regulations\n            protecting all persons being resettled. No significant\n            adverse impacts to wetlands are anticipated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - East China (Jiangsu) 500kV\n            Transmission Project - environment assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - East China (Jiangsu)\n            500kV Transmission Project - environment assessment (Vol. 2)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/07/2026458/china-east-china-jiangsu-500kv-transmission-project-environment-assessment-vol-2","projn":"CN-E.

construct the East\n            China/Jiangsu 500 kV power transmission project to increase\n            transmission capacity between the northern and southern\n            regions of Jiangsu province. The East China (Jiangsu)\n            Transmission Line Project includes the addition of more than\n            993 km of transmission line, the construction of nine\n            additional substations, and the expansion of two existing\n            substations. The project has a rural component as well as an\n            urban component. Environmental impacts to water resources as\n            a result of substation construction along both rural and\n            urban components are expected to be both temporary and\n            minimal, since the planned substations are not located in\n            close proximity to water bodies. The project will require\n            the removal of more than 800,000 trees, comprised of fruit\n            trees and other planted varieties. Though trees in general\n            provide habitat for birds and other wildlife, the trees lost\n            for transmission line construction are domesticated\n            varieties in rural agricultural areas that have been\n            sufficiently fragmented to prevent their use as important\n            wildlife habitat, and similar habitat will be developed in\n            the new resettlement areas. Farmers will be compensated for\n            loss in agricultural production as a result of land acquired\n            for the project. Chinese law has strict regulations\n            protecting all persons being resettled. No significant\n            adverse impacts to wetlands are anticipated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - East China (Jiangsu) 500kV\n            Transmission Project - environment assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - East China (Jiangsu)\n            500kV Transmission Project - environment assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/05/442009/china-east-china-jiangsu-500kv-transmission-project-environment-assessment","projn":"CN-E.
