More\n            than 70 percent of the country was susceptible to malaria,\n            and tuberculosis was the major cause of hospital-registered\n            death. In 1996, the Social Rehabilitation and Development\n            Fund Project was created to help remote communities address\n            these tragedies, backed by a commitment from the World Bank\n            to finance half of the project's 240 million dollars\n            total cost. Since then, the project has enabled 600,000\n            children, 49 percent of them girls, to attend school.

to poor,\n            mainly rural communities the assets and services needed to\n            improve their economic and social standards. ESRDF will\n            provide financial and technical support to communities and\n            community groups to construct or rehabilitate, and maintain\n            basic economic and social infrastructure and services that\n            they have prioritized and in which they are willing to\n            invest. In addition, ESRDF will support community actions\n            aimed at environmental conservation and rehabilitation.\n            ESRDF's efforts will be focused on poor communities,\n            and especially, poor women. To achieve these goals, ESRDF\n            will strengthen community capacity in project\n            identification, implementation, and maintenance. The project\n            will also support the establishment of a Welfare Monitoring\n            System to strengthen capacity to collect and analyze\n            information related to causes, patterns, and incidence of\n            poverty; and improve the basis for developing poverty\n            reduction strategies, assessing the impact on the poor of\n            economic policy reform, and evaluating the benefits of other\n            poverty reductions interventions. The components of this\n            project will be as follows: 1) construction and\n            rehabilitation of social and economic infrastructure and\n            improvement of related services including basic health and\n            education, small-scale irrigation, urban sanitation and\n            rural water supply; 2) welfare monitoring system; and 3)\n            capacity building,
