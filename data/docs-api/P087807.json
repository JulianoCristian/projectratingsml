Work is currently on-going on these sites and the\n            additional time is required to ensure a fully safe\n            completion. The remaining work at the Vermesti site is a\n            drainage and flood protection channel which was agreed with\n            the Requestors in the context of a partial inspection panel\n            investigation.  The work was initially delayed due to lack\n            of financing from the budget in earlier years, and more\n            recently because of complex implementation issues, in\n            particular the need to coordinate the work schedule with the\n            National Railroad Company under whose tracks the drainage\n            and flood protection channel will pass. There are no overdue\n            audits and previous audit reports have been found\n            satisfactory to the Bank.  Overall financial management is\n            rated satisfactory."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Mine Closure,\n            Environment and Socio-Economic Regeneration Project :\n            restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/05/16289170/romania-mine-closure-environment-socio-economic-regeneration-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"RO-Mine Closure, Environment &\n            Socio-Economic Regeneration Project -- P087807","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Mining & Extractive Industry (Non-Energy),Housing & Human Habitats,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Industry,Public Sector Development","count":"Romania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20120530000146"},"theme":"Gender,Social safety nets,Pollution management and environmental health,Improving labor markets","subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Mining and other extractive","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Industry,Public Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Commerce, communities, economic\n            regeneration, Financing Plan, ID, Implementing Agency, MINE\n            CLOSURE, mines, mining communities, mining enterprises,\n            mining regions, mining sector, mining sector reform, PMU,\n            Project Management, Project Management Unit, Safeguard Policies"}},"owner":"Social Development (ECSSO)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"majtheme":"Social protection and risk management,Environment and natural resource management,Social dev/gender/inclusion","repnb":"68936"},"15650142":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/01/15650142/romania-mine-closure-environment-p087807-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-15","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/01/15650142/romania-mine-closure-environment-p087807-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-15","new_url":"2012/01/15650142/romania-mine-closure-environment-p087807-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-15","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-01-22T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-01-22T00:00:00Z","docm_id":"090224b0811e789e","chronical_docm_id":"090224b0811e789e","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/ECA/2012/01/22/6ABD7A643ED1826E8525798D005280A7/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/P0878070ISR0Di022201201327244468660.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/ECA/2012/01/22/6ABD7A643ED1826E8525798D005280A7/1_0/Rendered/PDF/P0878070ISR0Di022201201327244468660.pdf","loan_no":"IBRD47590","datestored":"2012-01-22T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2012-01-22T00:00:00Z","volnb":"1","docna":{"cdata!":"Romania -
