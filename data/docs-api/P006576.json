The responsibility and flexibility given to\n            governments by these types of performance based agreements\n            allow them to adapt operations to the specific context of\n            their countries, as well as to combine policy-level actions\n            and specific investments in the various industrial sectors.\n            An auction system can reduce project costs and\n            administrative expenses, because the program in Chile only\n            disbursed after implementation, less administrative work was\n            required during the projects. The phase out achieved through\n            investment sub-projects would not have been sustainable if\n            the Government of Chile (GOC) had not put in place\n            regulation to control and phase out ODS imports and\n            manufacturing using ODS. The Chile Montreal Protocol (MP)\n            operation is indicative of the importance of the Bank being\n            the implementation agency that provides institutional\n            support to a government. Through this project, the Bank\n            effectively contributed to the institutional strengthening\n            of National Commission for the Environment (CONAMA)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - Ozone Depleting Substances Phase-out\n            Project (Montreal Protocol)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chile -
