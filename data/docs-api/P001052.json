The project achieved\n            most of its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development has been substantial, sustainability is likely,\n            and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, a broad sector-wide investment operation, in\n            this case a transport sector project covering roads, ports,\n            airports, and overall sector planning and coordination, is\n            an effective instrument for improving the efficiency of\n            transport services and increasing their supply throughout\n            the country. Second, the country team should help ensure\n            that generic country issues, such as counterpart funding,\n            are dealt with in a uniform fashion across the board. Third,\n            addressing sector specific issues through projects is\n            impossible without real political will. Finally, project\n            content should be designed to match actual project\n            management competencies, and the management tools\n            implemented by foreign technical assistance should be fully\n            internalized by users within the existing and sustainable\n            institutional framework."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Transport Sector

To this end, the project finances (a) the\n            rehabilitation of some 360 km of existing paved roads; (b)\n            the construction of a container berth, a fuel jetty and a\n            siltation prevention dike in Conakry port, and dredging of\n            the port area and access channel; and (c) essential\n            navigational aids and infrastructure rehabilitation at\n            Conakry International Airport and at selected domestic\n            airfields.  Additionally, the project finances technical\n            assistance to establish a regulatory framework for\n            privatized transport sector operations, and to strengthen\n            and improve Government planning and investment selection,\n            pricing policies, manpower development and training\n            sectorwide.  The main benefits of the project are the\n            opening up of areas that now are isolated for several months\n            each year; the protection of the paved highway network from\n            further deterioration and even higher reconstruction costs;\n            and a substantial reduction in road transport costs with\n            direct benefits to both urban and rural populations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Transport Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea - Transport Sector Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1987/05/739641/guinea-transport-sector-project","projn":"GN-Trans Sect -- P001052","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Urban Transport,Banks & Banking Reform,Airports and Air Services,Roads & Highways,Transport Security","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Guinea","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926082938"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other transportation,Ports, waterways and shipping","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Air Navigation,Air safety,air\n            transport,airfields,airport\n            operations,airports,autonomy,aviation component,Bac,balance\n            sheet,Bauxite,bottlenecks,Capitals,cargo,cargo\n            handling,certification,civil aviation,civil aviation\n            agency,Civil Works,congestion,construction,container\n            terminal,dredging,employment,export,financial\n            management,FISCAL YEAR,framework,fuel,fuel prices,fuel\n            taxes,Gravel,Gravel Roads,highway,highways,international\n            airport,national carrier,Navigation,paved roads,port\n            area,Port Authority,ports,privatization,railways,rate of\n            return,regulatory framework,road maintenance,road\n            network,road rehabilitation,road system,road\n            transport,roads,safety,sand,Secondary\n            Roads,square,structural\n            adjustment,subsidiary,taxation,technical\n            assistance,traffic,Transport,transport investment,transport\n            planning,Transport Sector,transport\n            system,transportation,trunk\n            road,underpinning,Vegetation,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"Air Navigation,Air safety,air\n            transport,airfields,airport\n            operations,airports,autonomy,aviation component,Bac,balance\n            sheet,Bauxite,bottlenecks,Capitals,cargo,cargo\n            handling,certification,civil aviation,civil aviation\n            agency,Civil Works,congestion,construction,container\n            terminal,dredging,employment,export,financial\n            management,FISCAL YEAR,framework,fuel,fuel prices,fuel\n            taxes,Gravel,Gravel Roads,highway,highways,international\n            airport,national carrier,Navigation,paved roads,port\n            area,Port Authority,ports,privatization,railways,rate of\n            return,regulatory framework,road maintenance,road\n            network,road rehabilitation,road system,road\n            transport,roads,safety,sand,Secondary\n            Roads,square,structural\n            adjustment,subsidiary,taxation,technical\n            assistance,traffic,Transport,transport investment,transport\n            planning,Transport Sector,transport\n            system,transportation,trunk\n            road,underpinning,Vegetation,Water Supply"}},"owner":"Country Director Groups","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"P4568"},"740446":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1987/05/740446/guinea-transport-sector-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1987/05/740446/guinea-transport-sector-project","new_url":"1987/05/740446/guinea-transport-sector-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1987/05/18/000009265_3960926082853/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1987/05/18/000009265_3960926082853/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"1815","docdt":"1987-05-18T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1987-05-18T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Transport Sector Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Transport Sector Project aims at\n            providing the policy framework required to ensure efficiency\n            and effectiveness throughout the sector.
