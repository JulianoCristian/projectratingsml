Some lessons learned included: there were\n            advantages gained from keeping the design of the operation\n            simple and well focused on the Government priorities, e.g.,\n            customs duties reduction on rice and facilitation of\n            agricultural goods trade with well identified outcome\n            indicators. This helped ensure adequate Government's\n            response to the crisis given its limited capacities.\n            However, the longer-term sustainability of the\n            Government's food price crisis program and overall\n            economic reform efforts was weakened by the military coup of\n            late 2008, which undermine the ability of the Government to\n            address future food price shocks effectively. While the risk\n            of a worsening social and political instability was\n            identified given the country's fragile situation, the\n            death of President Conte precipitated a military coup which\n            in turn triggered the subsequent application of the\n            Bank's operational policy on dealing with de facto\n            governments. Given the (anticipated and unanticipated) risks\n            to this operation in the country's fragile context,\n            close coordination with other development partners has been\n            indispensable to mitigate risks, realize synergies, and\n            improve the leverage in the policy dialogue. Collaboration\n            with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also been\n            important. It can be challenging to ensure the establishment\n            of an effective monitoring and evaluation system in the\n            context of a crisis response operation. In the context of\n            Guinea, the Government monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            system worked reasonably well during the crisis but its\n            efforts weakened after the emergency period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Food Crisis Response Development\n            Policy Grant Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea - Food Crisis Response\n

Food\n            Crisis Response Program (GEFCRP) is intended to support the\n            government's poverty reduction strategy by providing\n            the authorities with needed fiscal space to compensate for\n            the lost of revenues resulting from the temporary customs\n            duties reduction on rice imports. The program consists of a\n            Food Crisis Response Development Policy Grant, additional\n            financing to the Third Urban Development Project, and an\n            Emergency Agriculture Productivity Support Project. The\n            grants are being undertaken under the Global Food Crisis\n            Response Program (GFRP), which was endorsed by the Board on\n            May 29, 2008, and will be financed out of the Food Price\n            Crisis Response (FPCR) Trust Fund (TF). The objectives of\n            the GFRP are to: (i) reduce the negative impact of high and\n            volatile food prices on the lives of the poor in a timely\n            way; (ii) support governments in the design of sustainable\n            policies that mitigate the adverse impacts of high and more\n            volatile food prices on poverty while minimizing the\n            creation of long-term market distortions; and (iii) support\n            broad-based growth in productivity and market participation\n            in agriculture to ensure an adequate and sustainable food\n            supply response. This document is composed of three\n            sections: (i) an overview document describing the GEFCRP\n            program including background, context, rationale and a\n            description of the Government and the Bank's response;\n            (ii) the program document for the proposed Food Crisis\n            Response Development Policy Grant; and (iii) the emergency\n            project
