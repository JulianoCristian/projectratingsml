Several lessons were gleaned from this\n            project: 1) Addressing irrigation development from a river\n            basin, multi-stakeholder perspective enables you to firmly\n            place on the agenda the impact of irrigation abstractions on\n            up- and downstream water use, establish mechanisms for\n            resolving inter- and intra-sectoral water allocation\n            conflicts, and provide incentives for increasing irrigation\n            efficiency and productivity. 2) This project put into\n            practice the Bank's 1993 Water Resources Management\n            Policy, which called for a more comprehensive approach to\n            WRM, incorporating cross-sectoral perspectives,\n            environmental concerns, and stakeholder participation. 3)\n            Policy and institutional reforms, and the transformation of\n            Basin Water Organizations into accountable, transparent,\n            financially autonomous and independent organizations are\n            slow and difficult, but necessary for instituting changes.\n            4) The project has demonstrated that limited but targeted\n            investments in irrigation and drainage infrastructure\n            improvement can encourage farmers to reduce water wastage\n            and to consider the water demands of other users. 5)  The\n            project's participatory approach, involving farmers at\n            all stages, is a slow but essential part of the process of\n            ensuring improved scheme performance and sustainability, and\n            a demand-driven spirit among beneficiaries. 6) Scheme\n            Improvement Assessment Reports (SIAR) provided a good basis\n            for smallholder scheme developments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - River Basin Management and\n            Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - River Basin

River Basin Management and Smallholder Irrigation\n            Improvement Project anticipates negative environmental\n            impacts and proposes measures to mitigate them. Some of the\n            measures recommended include: Arrest catchments degradation\n            by promoting agro forestry agricultural practices,\n            afforestation or reforestation, strengthening regulatory\n            enforcement, promoting environmental consciousness, and\n            strengthening measures for controlled acquisition and\n            land-use practices. Avoid reduced water quantity, increased\n            incidences of waterborne diseases, and poor water quality by\n            setting mechanism for resolving water conflicts, promoting\n            irrigation agriculture, preparing and implementing a\n            participatory land use plan, promoting awareness of\n            waterborne diseases as well as HIV/AIDS, and improving\n            availability of health, water, and sanitation services.\n            Minimize sand at intake structure by promoting upstream soil\n            and water conservation and environmental protection.\n            Maintain water availability for irrigation by establishing\n            effective water management system. Avoid effects on soil and\n            water quality by educating users on appropriate irrigation\n            practices. Reduce fertilizer and pesticide use by employing\n            integrated pest management system and soil fertility\n            management. Improve drainage including disposal of water to\n            evaporation ponds if water quality is adversely affected by\n            drainage water. Monitor water salinity. After construction\n            phase is completed, build bridge crossings for livestock,\n            refill borrow pits, provide water troughs to downstream\n            users, supply proper drainage to avoid backwater flooding,\n            construct proper dykes to reduce flooding, and introduce\n            adequate field service roads and crossings for easy access\n            of
