Some\n            lessons learned included: with strong ownership of\n            assessment by the Government through the integration of\n            staff into the revenue budget, the true institutionalization\n            will require moving towards a semi- or autonomous body so\n            that the credibility of NEAS is fully established\n            technically, financially, and administratively. The\n            discrepancy between the planned samples and the actually\n            achieved samples in the four rounds of assessment points to\n            the need to improve the administration of the tests to allow\n            a more representative sample of schools and students. In\n            this regard, NEAS should ensure that, during the regular\n            round of national assessment, the sampled public schools are\n            all interviewed so that they can have a valid representation\n            of Government schools in Pakistan. As one of the main\n            objectives of NEAS is to identify correlates of student\n            achievement, future dissemination activities of the NEAS\n            network should present findings from analyzing the rich\n            assessment database and produce targeted reports for various\n            stakeholder groups to get feedbacks that could, in turn,\n            feed into the assessment system. In light of the weaknesses\n            in financial management observed during the project cycle,\n            accounts officers should not be involved in administrative\n            work as this leads to weak controls and also delay in\n            submission of financial reports. Furthermore, since there\n            was only one designated account established under the\n            International Development Association (IDA) credit, the fund\n            flow to the provinces was problematic. To overcome the fund\n            flow problem, each implementation agency should have its\n            separate designated account."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - National Education Assessment\n

There are three components to the\n            project: 1) Capacity building would be the main component,\n            where the execution of an assessment is unusually technical\n            in nature. Any one of a number of small mistakes can cause\n            serious delays in implementation and, in the worst case,\n            lead to meaningless findings. Therefore, a high-level\n            technical assistance, including the services o f a senior\n            Technical Advisor, would be required to monitor and assist\n            in all aspects of both central and provincial operations. 2)\n            Pilot experiments will be required to determine what will\n            produce the desired, valid results, and what process is most\n            implemented. 3) Information dissemination. Through this\n            component, the project will facilitate information\n            dissemination about assessment to stakeholders in advance of\n            the actual assessment to explain its purpose and to provide\n            insight and reassurance about its intended uses."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - National Education Assessment\n            System Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - National Education\n            Assessment System Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/05/2332476/pakistan-national-education-assessment-system-project","projn":"PK-National Education Assessment System -- P077288","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20030514141756"},"subsc":"Primary education","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"achievement scores,achievement\n            tests,addition,Arts,Assessment Centers,assessment\n            design,assessment instruments,assessment process,assessment\n            reports,Basic Competencies,basic education,basic\n            literacy,call,community\n            schools,complexity,curricula,Curriculum,curriculum\n            design,curriculum objectives,Curriculum Research,Development\n            Program,drawing,economic development,economic\n            growth,education policies,Education Sector,education\n            services,education system,Educational Assessment,Educational\n            Development,Educational Planning,effective means,elementary\n            education,ETS,formal Education,gender equity,girls,Human\n            Development,information\n            dissemination,instruction,internships,interventions,leadership,Learning,Learning\n            Achievement,learning acquisition,learning\n            outcomes,literacy,literature,managers,marketing,Mathematics,media,National\n            Education,Non-formal Education,numeracy,parents,performance\n            indicators,Primary Education,Provincial\n            Education,Psychology,quality control,quality of\n            education,rural areas,Schooling,schools,Secondary\n            Education,student achievement,student performance,subject\n            areas,Teacher,Teacher Education,teachers,teaching,training\n            abroad,training courses,training programs,universal primary\n            education,universities,university students,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"achievement scores,achievement\n            tests,addition,Arts,Assessment Centers,assessment\n            design,assessment instruments,assessment process,assessment\n            reports,Basic Competencies,basic education,basic\n            literacy,call,community\n            schools,complexity,curricula,Curriculum,curriculum\n            design,curriculum objectives,Curriculum Research,Development\n            Program,drawing,economic development,economic\n            growth,education policies,Education Sector,education\n            services,education system,Educational Assessment,Educational\n            Development,Educational Planning,effective means,elementary\n            education,ETS,formal Education,gender equity,girls,Human\n            Development,information\n            dissemination,instruction,internships,interventions,leadership,Learning,Learning\n            Achievement,learning acquisition,learning\n            outcomes,literacy,literature,managers,marketing,Mathematics,media,National\n            Education,Non-formal Education,numeracy,parents,performance\n            indicators,Primary Education,Provincial\n            Education,Psychology,quality control,quality of\n            education,rural areas,Schooling,schools,Secondary\n            Education,student achievement,student performance,subject\n            areas,Teacher,Teacher Education,teachers,teaching,training\n            abroad,training courses,training programs,universal primary\n            education,universities,university students,workers"}},"owner":"Office of the VP & Chief Inf Off (IMTVP),S.A.
