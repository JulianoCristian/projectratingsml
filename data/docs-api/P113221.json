Some of the lessons learned include: (1) intense\n            implementation support for emergency operations prepared\n            under OP 8.0 will often be needed immediately following\n            effectiveness to rapidly close any readiness gaps and ensure\n            successful outcomes; (2) while OP 8.0 does provide increased\n            flexibility in preparing emergency operations, for small\n            operations of this nature, Bank procedures may still be too\n            onerous; (3) outsourcing implementation to non-governmental\n            partners can be an effective strategy in fragile states; (4)\n            weak institutional capacity within key ministries hinders\n            development impact from Bank investments, but cannot be\n            adequately addressed through emergency operations; (5) The\n            GFRP Trust Fund facilitated the Bank\u0092s reengagement in\n            agriculture in CAR; (6) non-traditional partners can\n            introduce new and innovative ways of doing things."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central African Republic - Food Crisis\n            Response Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Central African

The negative\n            effects on the human environment are: risks associated with\n            the use of pesticides by farmers themselves; conflicts\n            relating to law and land use (cohabitation between various\n            rights, claims in each village); potential conflicts between\n            agriculture and livestock and the development of waterborne\n            disease (an increased prevalence of malaria, increased cases\n            of dysentery, an increase of schistosomiasis, ...), the risk\n            of diversion objectives of the project (changes to other\n            beneficiaries than originally envisaged because of\n            difficulties in development); risks to health and safety in\n            pesticide management (contamination by livestock watering;\n            poisoning in cases of misuse; residues on products, poor\n            management of packaging, etc..), the depletion and\n            degradation of water sources; the conflicts over land use or\n            water and possible cumulative effects of a breakdown, the\n            inequitable access rights to land or water (particularly\n            women), difficulties regarding the integration of women in\n            agricultural activities. On the biophysical environment, the\n            major potential negative impacts include: loss of vegetation\n            and reduction of biodiversity in deforestation and clearing\n            of plots; degradation due to soil salinization, soil\n            acidification, the drop in fertility due to cultivation\n            practices, soil erosion, loss or reduction of land for\n            pasture degradation of water quality (pollution of streams\n            and lakes)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Plan de gestion des pestes et des pesticides"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Plan de gestion des pestes et des\n            pesticides (Vol. 2)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/12/11959708/central-african-republic-emergency-food-response-project-environmental-assessment-vol-2-plan-de-gestion-des-pestes-des-pesticides","projn":"CF-Car Food Response Project -- P113221","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Access to Finance,Housing & Human Habitats,Food & Beverage Industry,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Industry,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Central African Republic","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20100317141353"},"theme":"Global food crisis response","subsc":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade,Other social services,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Crops,Animal production","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Industry,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"Special Financing","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Health and other social services,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adverse impacts, agricultural production,\n            Agricultural Research, agriculture, Borrower, cereals,\n            communities, corn, Description, Disclosure Requirements,\n            Emergency Recovery, Environmental, farmer, farmers, fishing,\n            food access, food basket, food security, forestry, forestry\n            sector, Habitats, ID, Indigenous Peoples, institutional\n            capacity, interventions, Loan, meal, Nutrition, oil,\n            pesticide, planting material, porridge, post-harvest\n            infrastructure, post-harvest losses, producer organizations,\n            productivity, pulses, receipt, Resettlement, rural\n            development, rural producers, Rural services, safeguard\n            analysis, Safeguard Policies, Safeguard Policy, SAFEGUARDS,\n            Safety, Social Development, soil erosion, Special Financing,\n            sugar, water pollution, WFP, World Food Programme"}},"owner":"Agric., RD & Irrigt'n Prac 1 (AFTA1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"majtheme":"Rural development","repnb":"E2397","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Republique Centrafricaine - Projet de\n            response la crise alimentaire"}}},"facets":{}}}
