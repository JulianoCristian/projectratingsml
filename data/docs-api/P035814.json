This line of reforms is actively\n            supported by the World Bank, with its most important\n            projects aimed at building up the private sector in Ukraine.\n            In 1996 and 1998, the enterprise development adjustment\n            loans (EDAL) I and II were implemented in two stages. In\n            2002, the World Bank approved granting a loan to Ukraine for\n            the private sector development project. This project is a\n            systemic (adjustment) type, being oriented not only to the\n            extensive development of private enterprises, but also to\n            increasing the efficiency and profitability of production,\n            and the manufacture of competitive products. The project\n            objective is also to ensure that privatized enterprises\n            themselves, after acquiring know-how and work experience\n            under the conditions of new economic realities, become\n            experts and leaders of enterprise restructuring, supporters,\n            and implementers of market ideas in the regions.\n            Introduction of the latest models of information and\n            communication technologies (ICT) can considerably increase\n            the efficiency and expeditiousness of decisions approval,\n            stimulate the development of the private sector, and\n            strengthen civil society in Ukraine. In order to attain\n            these goals, a credit agreement on financing the project\n            Ukraine: e-development was signed in 2003 between the World\n            Bank and the Ukrainian Government. The activities envisaged\n            by the project have positive prospects for consolidating\n            administrative reform."},"docna":{"cdata!":"World Bank projects in private sector development"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"World Bank projects in private\n            sector development"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2004/04/23955301/world-bank-projects-private-sector-development","count":"Ukraine","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Finance,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Information and communications","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"administrative reform, bankruptcy,\n            bankruptcy procedures, business enterprises, capital market,\n            capital market regulation, civil society, communication\n            technologies, competitive products, E-Development, economic\n            policies, electronic business, Electronic government,\n            electronic procurement, Enterprise Development, enterprise\n            restructuring, entrepreneurial activity, entrepreneurship,\n            ICT, labor productivity, legal basis, Loan, mass\n            privatization, mass privatization program, private business,\n            private enterprises, private entrepreneurs, Private Sector,\n            Private Sector Development, private sectors, productivity,\n            public administration, regulatory environment, state level,\n            state power, technical assistance, transparency"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Adjustment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance,Trade and integration,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Financial and private sector development,Rule of law","topic":"Private Sector Training m1326141 1575,Enterprise and Corporate Law m1326084 847,Loan-based Programs m1326696 1667,Private Sector Development m1326060 1921,Private Sector Development for PPP\n            m1326063 2260","projn":"UA-Private Sector Development Project (Apl\n            #1) -- P054966,UA-E-Development Project -- P074885,UA-Enterprise Development Adjustment Loan 2\n            (Edal 2) -- P049502,UA-Enterprise Development Adjustment Loan\n            (Edal) -- P035814","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Privatization,Microfinance,Housing & Human Habitats,E-Business,E-Government","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Private Sector Development","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150204150529"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"General industry and trade sector,Sub-national government administration,Animal production,Agro-industry,Payments, settlements, and remittance systems,Central government administration,Capital markets,Agro-industry, marketing, and trade,General public administration sector,General information and communications sector","theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Other accountability/anti-corruption,Participation and civic engagement,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Regulation and competition policy,International financial standards and systems,State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization,Tax policy and administration,Export development and competitiveness,Technology diffusion,Legal institutions for a market economy,Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Private Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Private Sector Training m1326141 1575,Enterprise and Corporate Law m1326084 847,Loan-based Programs m1326696 1667,Private Sector Development m1326060 1921,Private Sector Development for PPP\n            m1326063 2260","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["C","B"],"trustfund":"TF022710-INDUSTRY SUBSECTOR RESTRUCTURING,TF027030-INDUSTRIAL SUB-SECTOR RESTRUCTURING,TF029139-PHRD-FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DEVELOPMENT,TF029342-PHRD -ENTERPRISE DEV.\n            ADJUSTMENT LOAN,TF033296-UKRAINE -

Managing independence and\n            balancing national identity with the relationship with\n            Russia and other competing issues made it difficult for the\n            Government to focus entirely on the implementation. The\n            experience of the EDAL showed that in transition economies\n            the results from policy reforms are far enhanced if they are\n            accompanied by technical assistance (TA). The TA is\n            instrumental in training key players in how to operate in\n            the new environment. The TA component also allowed for low\n            cost experimentation, particularly with sensitive issues\n            like enterprise bankruptcy. In the TA component the\n            Government official who had championed the first and second\n            EDAL loans was removed from his position as head of the\n            State Property Fund. This created a situation in which there\n            was no accountability for the program. The Government\n            recommended that future projects involve a detailed action\n            plan agreed between the Bank and the relevant implementing\n            state agencies on the steps to be taken for the actual\n            implementation of the agreed reforms. Far greater\n            involvement from the Bank's Resident Office would have\n            been most helpful particularly in the early stages of the\n            project. The Government noted it was important to develop a\n            joint strategy for reform and building consensus with all\n            key players."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - Enterprise

   government's trade and price liberalization,\n            privatization, capital markets development and\n            post-privatization restructuring programs. Other objectives\n            are to: 1) provide foreign exchange for the purchase of\n            critical imports; and 2) support the development of the\n            foreign exchange markets. The components of the project will\n            be: 1) balance of payments support for policy reforms; and\n            2) technical assistance for post-privatization\n            restructuring. The policy reforms will include: 1)\n            elimination of trade barriers and price restrictions on\n            imports and exports; 2) elimination of domestic price\n            controls; 3) implementation of mass privatization of 5,000\n            medium and large scale enterprises; 4) completion of the\n            small scale privatization program; 5) resolution of several\n            important methodological obstacles to rapid implementation\n            of the privatization program; 6) extension of the\n            privatization program to include additional large\n            enterprises for case-by-case privatization; 7) creation of a\n            Securities and Stock Markets Commission to oversee and\n            regulate capital markets; 8) creation of self-regulatory\n            organizations for intermediaries in the capital markets; and\n            9) legislation governing stock exchanges and\n            over-the-counter markets, dealers and brokers, independent\n            registrars and depositories, self-regulatory organizations\n            of market participants, and rules governing investor protection."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine -
