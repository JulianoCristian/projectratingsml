It is a useful\n            reminder that flexibility to adapt to the inevitably\n            changing conditions is essential in a post-conflict\n            environment. Here again, keeping funds unallocated at\n            project or country level may allow response to unanticipated\n            needs. The use of the Project Management Firm (PMF)\n            confirmed that day-to-day attention is required however\n            regular supervision because it is unlikely to tackle the\n            small yet blocking issues that arise, in particular at\n            project start. Focusing on infrastructure rehabilitation is\n            natural when looking at the immense needs of a country like\n            Afghanistan. Sustainability of this investment rests in the\n            capacity to manage, operate and maintain the infrastructure\n            and is as much governance as a financing and capacity matter."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Emergency Power Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Afghanistan - Emergency Power\n            Rehabilitation
