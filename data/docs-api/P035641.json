When pressures to maintain a Client\n            current on the service of its external debt, have a major\n            impact on lending decisions, it is incumbent upon Management\n            to discuss these pressures, and any impact they had on the\n            timing, content, and size of a proposed operation with the\n            Board at the time of loan presentation. \"Stroke of the\n            pen\" measures are an unreliable indicator of Borrower\n            commitment to undertaking deeper structural reform. Uneven\n            macroeconomic performance sharply reduces the expected\n            long-term benefits of structural reform, and cripples the\n            prospects for private sector-led growth.

rated as\n            likely. Both World Bank and Borrower performances were rated\n            overall satisfactory. However, viewed in the context of the\n            entire reform program of the 1990's, the costly delays\n            in privatizing the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM)\n            make Borrower rating unsatisfactory. Lessons learned include\n            the following: Dealing with deep-seated problems of weak\n            technical and managerial capacity and governance such as\n            those faced by Zambia requires operations that combine\n            sectoral focus and technical assistance/institution building\n            features, longer time horizons and quick disbursements.\n            Timing and strategy of privatization should be geared to\n            country circumstances; the implicit privatization strategy\n            followed here was to pursue the smaller, less controverisal\n            privatizations first, leaving the technically and\n            politically difficult, but more meaningful privatizations\n            earlier. Policy advice and conditionality involving trade\n            reform should consider the regional context. Because its\n            main regional trading partners lagged in their trade reform,\n            the benefits of Zambia's own trade reforms were\n            limited, relative to the high fiscal costs. Given existing\n            weaknesses of budgetary procedures and processes, specifying\n            budget allocations for social sector ministries and programs\n            will not ensure that
