The project's lack of\n            success reflects the Bank's overall lack of\n            preparedness to engage in post conflict settings. On the\n            positive side, a small operation of this nature,\n            specifically designed to deal with threats to stability, can\n            make a difference in moving a post-conflict country away\n            from the conflict-trap. In this regard, the\n            Government's strong commitment to the peace process and\n            to the project was an important factor. Following are more\n            detailed considerations: The Bank 1) should more thoroughly\n            consider the consequences of packaging together more\n            traditional approaches to macro-economic stability,\n            financial management and social services with post-conflict\n            measures that more directly help stability and buy political\n            time; 2) review its internal policies and procedures to\n            determine their suitability for post-conflict interventions,\n            and define their comparative advantage as a partner in such\n            interventions; 3) coordinate with national and international\n            partners to ensure synergy; 4) achieve the appropriate skill\n            mix in the team, including the necessary political and\n            technical expertise in post-conflict peace building and\n            recovery; 5) closely link demobilization and reintegration\n            of ex-combatants to an organized collection of weapons,\n            particularly relevant in a situation where no UN or regional\n            peacekeeping force is deployed; 6) where similar programs\n            have preceded a project and targeted the same beneficiary\n            group, establish coordination as well as operational links\n            between databases to avoid double-dipping and inconsistency\n            of approaches, that may create tension between the different\n            groups of beneficiaries; 7) focus on social issues, such as\n            reintegrating ex-combatants into communities as well as on\n            the gender aspects of demobilization and use indicators that\n            would trace the impact of the program on women and young\n            males; 8) streamlining the processing of applications by\n            ex-combatants by decentralizing to avoid bureaucratic delays\n            in delivering benefits (which could lead to loss of\n            confidence and abandoned micro-projects); 9) requiring\n            several layers of screening to verify ex-combatants'\n            status including using non-falsifiable ID cards to protect\n            against possible abuse; and 10) closing monitoring\n            withdrawal applications by and disbursements to the borrower\n            to ensure a steady flow of funding to a potentially volatile\n            beneficiary population. Post-conflict interventions, while\n            short-term in nature, require sustained follow-up to deal\n            with ex-combatants who remain armed while unemployed and\n            thus potentially mobilized for political or military\n            purposes, along with social tensions between the winners and\n            losers of the war remaining a source of concern and many\n            governance issues, including corruption and natural\n            resources management, Therefore, continued commitment on the\n            part of the Government and its partners to address potential\n            threats to stability and growth are essential. Finally, in\n            the context of revising OP 8.50, the Bank should also see\n            whether additional guidelines can be developed for the\n            specific context and requirements of post-conflict lending operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic of Congo - Emergency Demobilization\n            and Reintegration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Republic of Congo -

rehabilitate physical and social\n            infrastructure; and c) support macroeconomic stability. The\n            Bank's involvement will address the immediate\n            post-conflict needs of the country; and provide the\n            development leadership needed for reengagement of the\n            international community in a country in the delicate and\n            troubled Central Africa region. Building on ongoing\n            Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR)\n            activities in the country, this project will also help\n            formulate a comprehensive Demobilization and Reintegration\n            Program (DDR) in Congo by setting up necessary framework to\n            build on donors' support for the DDR program. The\n            project will contribute to ongoing efforts to consolidate\n            peace and strengthen security in the Republic of Congo,\n            while offering sound reintegration options to ex-combatants\n            who joined the ranks of the unemployed after the signing of\n            the cease-fire agreement. The credit will complement support\n            provided by other donors and the Bank's ongoing\n            Post-conflict Grant for the Reintegration of Women and Youth."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic of Congo - Emergency Demobilization\n            and Reintegration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Republic of Congo - Emergency\n            Demobilization and Reintegration Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/07/1490186/republic-congo-emergency-demobilization-reintegration-project","projn":"CG-Emergency Demobilization And\n            Reintegration Project -- P074639","docty":"Technical Annex","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Banks & Banking Reform,Business in Development,National Governance,Business Environment","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Congo, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01072104010597"},"subsc":"Other social services,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,Accountability,Accounting,accounts,administrative\n            capacity,anti-corruption,anti-corruption\n            actions,auditing,audits,banking sector,budget\n            management,budgeting,bureaucracy,clinics,Comfort\n            letters,commercial banks,competitive\n            bidding,consolidation,constitution,debt,decree,democracy,deposits,districts,employment,expenditure\n            management,expenditures,Financial Management,financial\n            support,FISCAL,FISCAL YEAR,Funds Flow,Governance Capacity\n            Building,Government Ownership,Governmental\n            Organization,health care,health services,human capital,human\n            rights,Immunodeficiency,insolvent,Institutional\n            Arrangements,Institutional Development,internal\n            controls,iron,key performance indicators,legislative\n            elections,macroeconomic stability,malnutrition,management\n            information systems,Migration,Ministries of Defense,Ministry\n            of Finance,Nations,Operating costs,poor\n            governance,presidential elections,private\n            sector,Procurement,Public Expenditure,public finance,public\n            funds,public institutions,public services,quality\n            control,Rehabilitation,reporting,representatives,Risk\n            Management,safety,schools,social capital,social\n            infrastructure,social services,sovereignty,state\n            apparatus,technical assistance,trade unions,transparency,unemployment,violence"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,Accountability,Accounting,accounts,administrative\n            capacity,anti-corruption,anti-corruption\n            actions,auditing,audits,banking sector,budget\n            management,budgeting,bureaucracy,clinics,Comfort\n            letters,commercial banks,competitive\n            bidding,consolidation,constitution,debt,decree,democracy,deposits,districts,employment,expenditure\n            management,expenditures,Financial Management,financial\n            support,FISCAL,FISCAL YEAR,Funds Flow,Governance Capacity\n            Building,Government Ownership,Governmental\n            Organization,health care,health services,human capital,human\n            rights,Immunodeficiency,insolvent,Institutional\n            Arrangements,Institutional Development,internal\n            controls,iron,key performance indicators,legislative\n            elections,macroeconomic stability,malnutrition,management\n            information systems,Migration,Ministries of Defense,Ministry\n            of Finance,Nations,Operating costs,poor\n            governance,presidential elections,private\n            sector,Procurement,Public Expenditure,public finance,public\n            funds,public institutions,public services,quality\n            control,Rehabilitation,reporting,representatives,Risk\n            Management,safety,schools,social capital,social\n            infrastructure,social services,sovereignty,state\n            apparatus,technical assistance,trade unions,transparency,unemployment,violence"}},"owner":"AFT: PREM 3 (AFTP3)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"T7468"},"facets":{}}}
