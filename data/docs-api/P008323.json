The lessons learned during\n            the project were that successful institutional capacity\n            building takes many years and requires a comprehensive array\n            of investments, including infrastructure , development of\n            management skills and team building, expert skills training,\n            basic skill training and, strategic and business planning.\n            Project design needs to be developed with the involvement\n            and commitment of client, country stakeholders, all donors\n            and, subject matter experts. New roles were assigned to the\n            National Social Security Institute. Investment in building\n            institutional capacity should be the first step when working\n            with a country to develop new policies so that the\n            institutions are prepared to help develop and then implement\n            new policies. Projects that build institutional capacity\n            need to be structured and financed to provide ongoing expert\n            advice. Projects require strong and active Bank\n            participation at supervision and support, along with strong\n            commitment by the client management. It is very important\n            that all officials responsible for project components, not\n            just the project coordination unit, acquire strategic and\n            project planning skills for successful project management\n            and capacity building."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Social Insurance Administration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bulgaria - Social

- Social Insurance Administration Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Social Insurance Administration\n            Project aims to support the government's current reform\n            program goals of eliminating the social insurance budgetary\n            subsidy through fiscal balance achievement and laying the\n            groundwork for future reforms aimed at a fundamental\n            restructuring of Bulgaria's system for guaranteeing\n            income security. Therefore, the project will: a) strengthen\n            efforts to increase the National Social Security\n            Insitute's (NSSI) overall operational efficiency in the\n            emerging market economy, focusing on reversing the reduced\n            tax compliance trend which is undermining the financial\n            stability of the public Pay-As-You-Go social insurance\n            program; and b) strengthening the NSSI to perform key policy\n            formulation and evaluation functions and better manage\n            available resources. The first component is increasing\n            compliance and operational efficiency. This will institute\n            effective operational procedures for inter alia: a) control\n            and monitoring of fund flow into and out of the social\n            insurance system; b) improved revenue/ expenditure\n            projection and benefit calculation on an actual contribution\n            basis; and c) improved services to clients, including\n            efficient payment of pensions and short term benefits. The\n            second major component is strengthening Institutional\n            capacity by: a) policy analysis; b) actuarial forecasting;\n            c) public information/ education concerning the social\n            insurance program and d) personnel management including\n            improvements in staff selection, incentives, training and\n            career development. The project will be implemented over a\n            period of four years."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Social Insurance Administration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bulgaria - Social
