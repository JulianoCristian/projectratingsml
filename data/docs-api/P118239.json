      Emergency Development Policy Grant (DPG) for the Republic of\n            Haiti. This is the fourth DPG supporting the Republic of\n            Haiti, after its successful reengagement with the donor\n            community in 2005. The grant is a single-tranche operation\n            supporting the FY2009-10 budget, with an additional\n            co-financing of US$25 million by the Haiti Reconstruction\n            Fund (HRF), of which the Bank is the partner agency. The\n            operation supports maintaining sound economic governance in\n            the post-earthquake period and strengthening the reforms\n            started before the earthquake. First, the operation supports\n            the implementation of the Government Action Plan for\n            National Recovery and Development of Haiti presented to the\n            international community in March 2010, aimed at rebuilding\n            the country. The Government Action Plan puts emphasis on\n            decentralization presents economic and social reforms as\n            well as the institutional strengthening strategy of the\n            authorities in the aftermath of the earthquake that\n            devastated Haiti on January 12, 2010. Second, it supports\n            the government's program for enhancing transparency and\n            accountability mechanisms, especially in view of the massive\n            pledges made by donors to support the reconstruction\n            process. The Government Action Plan and governance program\n            are in line with the strategy contained in the\n            country's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS/DSNCRP) for\n            the period 2008-2010, of which one pillar aims at\n            strengthening state capacity and management of public resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Emergency Development Policy\n            Operation

      Emergency Development Policy Grant (DPG) for the Republic of\n            Haiti. This is the fourth DPG supporting the Republic of\n            Haiti, after its successful reengagement with the donor\n            community in 2005. The grant is a single-tranche operation\n            supporting the FY2009-10 budget, with an additional\n            co-financing of US$25 million by the Haiti Reconstruction\n            Fund (HRF), of which the Bank is the partner agency. The\n            operation supports maintaining sound economic governance in\n            the post-earthquake period and strengthening the reforms\n            started before the earthquake. First, the operation supports\n            the implementation of the Government Action Plan for\n            National Recovery and Development of Haiti presented to the\n            international community in March 2010, aimed at rebuilding\n            the country. The Government Action Plan puts emphasis on\n            decentralization presents economic and social reforms as\n            well as the institutional strengthening strategy of the\n            authorities in the aftermath of the earthquake that\n            devastated Haiti on January 12, 2010. Second, it supports\n            the government's program for enhancing transparency and\n            accountability mechanisms, especially in view of the massive\n            pledges made by donors to support the reconstruction\n            process. The Government Action Plan and governance program\n            are in line with the strategy contained in the\n            country's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS/DSNCRP) for\n            the period 2008-2010, of which one pillar aims at\n            strengthening state capacity and management of public resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Descriptif de Programme Operation\n
