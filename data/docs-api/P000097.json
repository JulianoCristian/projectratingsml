The project was particularly successful in meeting\n            its physical, private sector development, environmental,\n            poverty alleviation and policy development objectives. Bank\n            performance is rated highly satisfactory. The performance of\n            the executing agencies, AGETUR and SERHAU-SEM and was highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the continuity\n            of members of the Borrower's follow-up committee and of\n            project supervision was critical to the efficacy of project\n            implementation. Project implementation was based on\n            sustained consultation between the executing agencies, the\n            Government (composed of several ministries) and the urban\n            jurisdictions. This was ensured by the interministerial\n            follow-up committee (comprising all ministries involved in\n            urban development issues). Participation of the local people\n            in all phases of project activities (from identification,\n            implementation, monitoring and evaluation) must be actively\n            sought and intensified. Appropriate institutional and\n            regulatory mechanisms must be put in place to facilitate\n            coordinated land development and management operations.\n            Necessary first steps include active involvement of the\n            private sector and civil society (associations, land\n            development operators, and the like) and the total\n            disengagement of the public sector (local and central\n            government) from land development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Urban Rehabilitation and Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin
