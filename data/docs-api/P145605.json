Some lessons learned\n            included: this operation is a good illustration of the\n            Bank\u2019s ability to produce a cross-sectoral response to a\n            Borrower\u2019s cross-sectoral demand. The Bank fully capitalized\n            on a unique window of opportunity that opened as a result of\n            the high priority being given to equity by Colombian\n            authorities and the passage of critical reforms focusing on\n            various dimensions of equity. The Bank made an important\n            contribution to the dialogue on equity and poverty in\n            Colombia with the robust analytical work produced under the\n            PSIA and the high-policy level discussions during the\n            Colombia Equity Day. This, in turn, has allowed the Bank to\n            continue to play an active role in key poverty and equity\n            related forums beyond the operation\u2019s lifetime, such as the\n            executive committee on multi-dimensional poverty. Sound\n            governance, including clear assignment of responsibilities\n            across government agencies, is critical for effective and\n            sustainable M&E of poverty and equity dimensions. In the\n            case of this DPL, this is positively illustrated by the\n            successful implementation of enhanced governance mechanisms\n            to ensure the soundness, transparency and replicability of\n            poverty measures. Conversely, the lack of an\n            institutionalized M&E mechanism to measure the\n            distributive impact of the fiscal reform hampered its measurement."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Enhancing Fiscal Capacity to\n            Promote Shared Prosperity Development Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia -

The\n            current strategic framework to address teenage pregnancy in\n            Colombia is outlined in the CONPES 147, effective from\n            February 2012 until March 2014. The CONPES 147 establishes a\n            multi-sectoral framework that aims to address the\n            determining factors of teenage pregnancy within Colombia\n            (Box 1).  The national strategy outlined in the CONPES 147\n            was piloted in 192 municipalities for youth ages 10 through\n            19.  Building on this strategy, the Commission for the\n            Guarantee of Sexual and Reproductive Rights is developing a\n            new framework to guide the government\u2019s policy and\n            activities to address this important policy issue in the\n            coming years.  Parallel to its work on teenage pregnancy,\n            the GoC released a national strategic framework to generate\n            opportunities for Colombian youth in July 2014. The note\n            includes an overview of the WDR 2012 gender equality\n            framework and World Bank regional study on teenage\n            pregnancy; outlines the Colombian country
