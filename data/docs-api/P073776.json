Some lessons\n            learned included: non-completion of land acquisition and\n            resettlement operations before the start of civil works was\n            a major issue in the implementation of the ABP. Land\n            required for the project should have been substantially\n            acquired before the commencement of civil works to ensure\n            that contractors are not impeded by insufficient land to\n            progress the work. A well prepared detailed project report\n            (DPR) is essential for proper implementation of a project.\n            In the ABP, shortcomings in the DPR led to changes in the\n            alignment of the carriageway and consequent revisions to the\n            resettlement and rehabilitation plan. A well prepared DPR\n            with more accurate information on the amount and ownership\n            of the land required will have reduced the delays in land\n            acquisition and resettlement. Measures that are to be\n            implemented in a project should be clearly defined and be\n            ready for execution upon the launching of the project. The\n            corridor management component of the ABP suffered from a\n            lack of clarity of the locations where the actions were\n            supposed to be taken and also lack of specificity of the\n            actions to be taken. More attention should be given to\n            post-completion arrangements for the management and\n            operation of an asset once the construction phase has\n            finished. A clear plan should be in place for the handover\n            of newly developed assets to the client. Use of the assets\n            while some work is still in progress exposes the contractor\n            and the client to litigation should accidents and damages\n            occur. The use of fly ash in embankment construction has\n            been proven to be technically viable and cost effective."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Allahabad Bypass

This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)\n            assesses the negative social impacts of the project, and\n            suggests socioeconomic rehabilitation measures, in order to\n            improve, or at least restore, the living conditions of\n            project affected people (PAP). Based on socioeconomic, and\n            census surveys, and in consultation with stakeholders, the\n            RAP determines the following measures to minimize adverse\n            social impacts resulting from project implementation. The\n            project will seek to redesign intersections as possible, to\n            avoid unnecessary loss of land, and structures, while\n            service roads will be constructed to provide easy access,\n            but under strict enforcement of parking, and traffic safety\n            measures to discipline the traffic flow. Compensation will\n            be provided at replacement values for loss of land, and\n            physical structures, which includes the provision of\n            drainage facilities; loss of crops, trees, and orchards,\n            will be compensated based on estimated market values, while\n            irrigation units will be replaced by the project; a\n            double-story shopping complex should be built on nearby\n            Government land, to accommodate demolished shops and\n            businesses, and alternative income restoration will be\n            considered; training will be provided to promote self\n            employment opportunities, in line with the Government's\n            poverty alleviation schemes; vulnerable groups will be given\n            special consideration for their resettlement/rehabilitation\n            needs, on priority bases; and, public awareness campaigns,\n            monitoring, and grievance mechanisms will be established to\n            ensure the adequate resettlement process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Allahabad Bypass Project :\n            resttlement action plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Allahabad Bypass Project\n            : resttlement action plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/07/2306080/india-allahabad-bypass-project-resttlement-action-plan","projn":"IN-Allahabad Bypass Project -- P073776","docty":"Resettlement Plan","subtopic":"Wetlands,Environmental Economics & Policies,Urban Governance and Management,Regional Governance,Public Sector Management and Reform","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"India","authors":{"authr":"MDP Consultants"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_03050904081346"},"subsc":"Roads and highways","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,Capacity Building,Common\n            Property,Data Collection,Income,Land Use,Local Level,Poverty\n            Line,Private Property,Restoration,Restoration Measures,Settlements"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,Capacity Building,Common\n            Property,Data Collection,Income,Land Use,Local Level,Poverty\n            Line,Private Property,Restoration,Restoration Measures,Settlements"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"RP148"},"2542627":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/07/2542627/india-allahabad-bypass-project-environmental-assessment-vol-3-7-environmental-assessment-process-summary-allahabad-bypass-nh-2","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/07/2542627/india-allahabad-bypass-project-environmental-assessment-vol-3-7-environmental-assessment-process-summary-allahabad-bypass-nh-2","new_url":"2003/07/2542627/india-allahabad-bypass-project-environmental-assessment-vol-3-7-environmental-assessment-process-summary-allahabad-bypass-nh-2","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/10/25/000094946_03101004072823/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/10/25/000094946_03101004072823/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","loan_no":"4719","docdt":"2003-07-31T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2003-10-25T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"7","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"3","repnme":{"cdata!":"India - Allahabad Bypass Project :\n            Environmental Assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Allahabad Bypass Project in India\n            will improve highway transportation as part of the national\n            policy to globalize its economy.
