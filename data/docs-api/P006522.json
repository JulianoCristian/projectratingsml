- Espirito Santo Water and Coastal\n            Pollution Management Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Project ratings are as follows: Outcome\n            is satisfactory, sustainability is likely, institutional\n            development impact is negligible, Bank performances is\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance is unsatisfactory.\n            Some of the lessons learned related to project design\n            included: In states with an uneven track record of\n            creditworthiness and commitment, political and financial\n            risks can be mitigated by planning project implementation in\n            self-contained phases, for instance, for sanitation\n            investments, by sub-basin systems, and by requiring the\n            prior deposit of the necessary counterpart funds for each\n            phase into an escrow account. If co-financing is critical to\n            the project, it is important that it should be secured by\n            loan signing, or by effectiveness, and that no procurement\n            should take place on a large scale until then. Strong\n            environmental institutions are necessary to ensure\n            environmental sustainability of sanitation projects. When a\n            strengthening program is necessary, it will be effective\n            only if the institution already has a sufficient staff of\n            permanent civil servants and budget, in addition to a clear\n            vision of its objectives and appropriate strategy to achieve\n            them. Furthermore, the coordination and management of that\n            program should be independent, and in any case not under the\n            responsibility of a project unit located within a regulated\n            entity. Lessons regarding project implementation and\n            management included: Local Governments should be\n            substantially involved in the preparation and implementation\n            of projects in their municipality. The procurement plan\n            should be adapted to the capacity and experience of the\n            implementing agency. The responsibility for project\n            planning, contracting, implementation, and flow of funds\n            should be concentrated within a single project management\n            unit with all necessary powers and controls. Projects should\n            be restructured early, as soon as critical issues emerge,\n            such as, in this project, counterpart funding and political\n            commitment. In these cases, the mid-term review should be\n            advanced if necessary. Lessons concerning corporate autonomy\n            and private sector participation included:  Contract plan\n            strategies to ensure financial and managerial autonomy of\n            public companies are not efficient and very fragile\n            instruments when there is no local culture for it, and when\n            they can be easily canceled or overlooked by subsequent\n            administrations. Private concession are difficult as long as\n            legal competence issues remain between different levels of\n            government (state and municipalities in metropolitan areas).\n            The establishment of an adequate regulatory framework and\n            regulatory agency enhances prospects for efficient system\n            operation by the private sector.  Conflicts of interest in\n            the privatization process undermined CESAN's\n            privatization. It might have been more successful if the\n            proposed privatization model had been structured to secure\n            maximum investment and coverage at reasonable tariffs\n            instead of maximizing proceeds to the state government.\n            Other lessons involved clearly specifying in the bidding\n            documents the obligations to met environmental requirements;\n            and   the need for active participation of social\n            specialists in all phases of project preparation and implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Espirito
