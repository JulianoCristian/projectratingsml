Some lessons\n            learned included: budget support has been catalytic in\n            harmonizing aid to Cape Verde and budget support continues\n            to be highly relevant to the Cape Verdean context. The use\n            of budgetary support enabled the Government to finance key\n            parts of the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper\n            (GPRSP) that will be difficult to finance through an\n            investment loan or single sector development policy\n            operation. An additional advantage is the ability to embed\n            sector policy within crosscutting issues such as civil\n            service reform, improved expenditure management, and\n            decentralization to increase the sustainability and impact\n            on service delivery. Budgetary support proved to be a\n            powerful instrument to unify donor assistance and dialogue\n            around a core set of policy actions specifically, the\n            provision of harmonized budget support through the Budget\n            Support Group (BSG) clearly reduced transaction costs for\n            the Government through a reduction in the number of visiting\n            missions and country-specific reporting requirements. This\n            is particularly important for a small country like Cape\n            Verde where the public sector can be easily overwhelmed by\n            aid and requests from donors. Budget support is a\n            sophisticated instrument which requires governmental\n            capacity to design and implement reforms and to monitor\n            their impact. The reliance on national systems also raises\n            capacity issues at all stages of the budget cycle, which\n            were compounded in the Cape Verdean context by the limited\n            number of technical staff and the high turnover of senior\n            staff in several core ministries. Offsetting these\n            constraints requires a combination of capacity building and\n            technical support."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cape Verde - Fourth Poverty Reduction\n

      Credit (PRSC-4) supports the implementation of Cape\n            Verde's first Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy\n            (GPRSP-I). This one-tranche operation is a transitory one\n            between the first and the second PRSC series, which will be\n            based on the GPRSP-II finalized by the Government at end of\n            May 2008. The policy dialogue and the results-based\n            framework under PRSC-4 focus on the following pillars of the\n            GPRSP-I: (i) promote good governance; (ii) develop human\n            capital; and (iii) improve the effectiveness and\n            sustainability of the social protection system.\n            Specifically, PRSC-4 supports selected measures that aim to:\n            (a) improve public expenditure management, reform and\n            modernize the public administration, strengthen\n            decentralization and municipal management capacity, and\n            strengthen monitoring and evaluation systems; (b) improve\n            quality and efficiency of basic health; and (c) modernize\n            and rationalize social protection services, with a focus on\n            improving the normative and operational framework for social\n            protection services at the municipal level. The main risks\n            associated with PRSC-4 are: (i) limited capacity in some\n            ministries to pursue the reform agenda; (ii) decline in\n            external concessional support at a faster pace than\n            expected; (iii) fiscal risks (including accumulation of\n            contingent liabilities and non-discretionary expenditure\n            programs that could cause fiscal slippages and stall\n            implementation of the more sensitive policy reforms); and\n            (iv) continued increase in fuel and food prices could delay\n            further poverty reduction, especially in rural areas, given\n            that most of the food and all oil has to be imported."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cape Verde - Fourth Poverty Reduction\n            Support
