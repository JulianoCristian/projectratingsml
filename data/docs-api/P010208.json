The project\n            achieved most of its objectives, its institutional capacity\n            has been strengthened, sustainability is likely, and both\n            the Bank and Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, as manpower\n            projections are a tenuous basis for justifying investments\n            in higher education without a supportive macroeconomic\n            environment, a modular approach that allows for adjustments\n            in response to changing circumstances would minimize risk.\n            Second, a project that does not address the institutional\n            problems of the main project institution responsible for\n            meeting project objectives runs a high risk of failure.\n            Third, sustainable institutional development entails the\n            responsibility on the part of the institution to prove its\n            relevance and effectiveness by improving and broadening its\n            teaching, research, and service functions and to ensure that\n            its graduates are relevant to local needs. Fourth,\n            Bank-Borrower goodwill and patience, Borrower determination,\n            effective leadership, and good staff teamwork can turn\n            failure to relative success. Fifth, careful monitoring will\n            help alert project management to potential or actual\n            problems in time to allow for remedial action. Lastly, it is\n            essential to mandate a systematic approach to project\n            monitoring and evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Agricultural Manpower Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Agricultural Manpower\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/06/733854/nepal-agricultural-manpower-development-project","projn":"NP-Agric.
