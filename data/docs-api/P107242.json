Some lessons\n            learned included: complementarity between policy and\n            institutional dialogue through PRSO and existing investment\n            and technical assistance projects is critical for the\n            success of reforms. In order to assist in effective\n            implementation of the policy reforms, complementary\n            technical assistance have been provided through projects and\n            coordinated technical support by other development partners.\n            Opening the dialogue and flexibly adapting to the political\n            economy for reforms will be critical for success. These\n            include local governments such as provinces and the national\n            assembly economic and budget committee. Supporting a\n            reasonably well defined reform agenda of a senior champion\n            in Government is equally important for success. In areas\n            where sector working groups are active, it is important that\n            PRSO engage in and maintain direct communications with\n            existing sector working groups to ensure a constructive and\n            consistency to the existing reform dialogue. It is equally\n            important that PRSO coordinates closely and maintain contact\n            with other development partners who do not participate in\n            the PRSO modality but are involved in areas relevant to PRSO dialogue."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lao People's Democratic Republic -\n            Fourth, Fifth,Sixth, and Seventh Poverty Reduction Support\n            Operations

(PRSO4) focuses on two broad policy areas\n            consistent with the goals and strategies identified by\n            Government in its poverty reduction strategy, and reflected\n            in International Development Association (IDA's)\n            Country Assistance Strategy: (i) sustaining growth though\n            improvement of the investment climate, facilitating trade\n            and management of natural resources; and (ii) improving\n            social outcomes through improving public financial\n            management system and service delivery. The second series of\n            PRSO4-7 and related policy dialogue, policy matrix and\n            performance assessment framework, builds on the achievements\n            of the previous series, deepens structural reforms on public\n            financial management, and expands supporting the delivery of\n            further benefits in two broad categories: (i) investment\n            climate, competitiveness, and business development; and (ii)\n            public finance management and improving service delivery.\n            Progress in these policy areas in turn will support a\n            continuation of the good macroeconomic situation and\n            sustainable export and private sector driven growth, and\n            continued progress with poverty reduction, including through\n            reform of the public finance management system (as well as\n            better management of natural resource revenues including\n            those of Second Nam Theun (hydroelectric project) (NT2)). As\n            programmatic budget support, the PRSO series is aimed at\n            increased predictability of funding and the associated\n            dialogue between Government and donors,
