Some lessons learned included: the use of a\n            project executing unit not fully integrated to the Ministry\n            of Health's core organizational configuration may\n            undermine its active involvement in project implementation\n            activities. Based on the experience gained during the first\n            phase, project design made an attempt to move the\n            implementation unit closer to the ministry's mainstream\n            activities. This lukewarm effort did not yield meaningful\n            results. On the contrary, most senior staff from the\n            Ministry resented the existence of this special unit with\n            higher salaries and easy access to the Minister. Performance\n            Agreements became a very useful tool to consolidate a\n            results-oriented culture. This was a powerful tool\n            introduced by the Health Reform Program that has had a\n            positive impact for managing decentralized health programs.\n            One key feature was the use of a limited number of clearly\n            defined indicators with realistic targets that helped to\n            keep programs well-focused. Close monitoring using a\n            consistent methodology enabled corrective actions to be\n            taken in a timely manner. The use of revolving funds to\n            manage the transfer of financial resources also proved a\n            very useful tool. It is crucial to address cultural barriers\n            created by ethnic diversity to further improve health\n            indicators in Bolivia. Cultural diversity remains the\n            greatest challenge for improved maternal and child health of\n            the poor in Bolivia. The program began to bridge the\n            cultural barrier with the use of specially tailored\n            activities, but they need to be developed in greater depth\n            to accommodate cultural factors. Coverage of prenatal\n            controls and births attended by trained health personnel\n            stagnated during the project period and cultural barriers\n            has been mentioned as one of the critical factors to making\n            further progress."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Second Phase of the Health Sector\n            Reform

The first increases coverage and\n            quality of health service networks, and empowers communities\n            by strengthening the basic health insurance program with the\n            financing of computers, training, supervision, and external\n            audits as well as issuing protocols for basic health\n            interventions and implementing a systen for supervising the\n            quality of basic health insurance activities; and providing\n            information, education, and communication activities for\n            indigenous peoples, pregnant women, and health advocates.\n            This component also supports national programs for mothers\n            and children by expanding immunization programs and quality\n            improvements in basic health insurance programs. The second\n            component strengthens local capacity to respond to health\n            needs by expanding the coverage of the basic health\n            insurance program and financing

results-driven approach to\n            investments in the reduction of infant mortality, to\n            increased coverage, and quality of health service networks,\n            particularly among the most disadvantaged communities, and,\n            to a strengthened local capacity responsive to health needs,\n            as a complement to interventions in education, rural\n            productivity, and water supply and sanitation. Thus, this\n            environmental assessment, looks at the potential\n            environmental adversity derived from other sector\n            interventions, which may impact health, and, looks at the\n            measures, and procedures to be taken to minimize adversity,\n            proposing the following. Mitigation measures focus on\n            accelerated drilling, and landfill works, to minimize air,\n            and water pollution, to be followed by water sprinklers to\n            control dust emissions. Appropriate drainage will control\n            effluents, with an emphasis on sanitary water treatment to\n            avoid contamination, though in the absence of sewage\n            treatment, septic tanks, or borrow pits will be installed.\n            Bacteriological analysis should be conducted periodically.\n            Following appropriate personnel training, medical, and\n            surgical hospital wastes will be collected, stored and\n            incinerated, to be finally disposed of at sanitary\n            landfills. Finally, reforestation practices, and vegetative\n            propagation will mitigate ecological adversity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Segundo Proyecto del Seguro Basico\n            de Salud : analisis ambiental"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia - Segundo Proyecto del\n            Seguro B\u00e1sico de Salud: Evaluaci\u00f3n ambiental"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/03/1551995/bolivia-segundo-proyecto-del-seguro-basico-de-salud-analisis-ambiental","projn":"BO-Health Sector Reform Apl II -- P074212","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Bolivia","authors":{"authr":"S.N."},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01080804095829"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Other social services,Health,Non-compulsory health finance,Sub-national government administration,Central government administration","lang":"Spanish","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Health insurance; Infant mortality; Health\n            service delivery; Sectoral environmental assessment;\n            Drilling & boring; Landfills; Air pollution; Water\n            discharge & flow; Sprinklers; Effluents; Sanitary\n            landfills; Water treatment; Septic tank effluents;\n            Bacteriological examination; Training programs; Medical\n            wastes; Surgical equipment; Waste treatment; Storage tanks;\n            Incinerators; Reforestation; Vegetative propagation"}},"owner":"Health Sector (LCSHH)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"E484"},"facets":{}}}
