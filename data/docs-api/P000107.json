The project achieved its major objectives, its\n            impact on institutional development was substantial,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of the Bank\n            was satisfactory while the Borrower's was highly\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, the right mix of financial sector policies\n            that encourage effective financial intermediation were vital\n            to the success of the project. Second, obtaining the\n            confidence of the rural population and the real transfer of\n            decision making authority to the local level are\n            prerequisites for the establishment of a sound savings and\n            loan rural cooperative network. Third, significant resources\n            should be allocated to institution building and training\n            functions in order to lay the foundation for a sustainable\n            savings and loan network. Fourth, savings mobilization\n            should be made a priority as a basis for future\n            sustainability. Fifth, the government should respect the\n            autonomy of the cooperatives and encourage self-reliance.\n            Sixth, interest rates should be deregulated so that real\n            positive interest rates can be charged for the loans.\n            Seventh, savings should be kept in the rural areas and not\n            be transferred to savings-deficit sectors. Finally, group\n            lending yields the best results and is facilitated through\n            such things as awareness campaigns."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Rural Savings and Loan\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin -
