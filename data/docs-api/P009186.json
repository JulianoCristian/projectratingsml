The Bank's performance in initiating the\n            action plan and reallocating funds from the social sector to\n            the individual sector was adequate. The Bank's impact\n            on institution building has been marginal. During\n            implementation of the loan the supervision of the\n            subprojects by the borrower was largely ineffective. Some of\n            the lessons learned included: a) Future projects, to the\n            extent possible, should allocate significant funds for\n            institution building to ensure adequate appraisal,\n            supervision and monitoring of investment plans; b)\n            Supervision tasks be exclusively designated to be carried\n            out by the borrower, with provision in the loan for\n            financing any incidental foreign exchange expenditures as on\n            vehicles and foreign consultant; c) The Bank should focus on\n            choosing a borrower that has the capacity to attract the\n            qualified staff and the managerial skills that are essential\n            for implementing the necessary reforms and maintaining a\n            fruitful dialogue with the Bank; and d) The Bank should give\n            adequate attention to training which is the key component\n            for institution building."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - Third Agricultural Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yugoslavia - Third Agricultural\n            Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1988/06/738833/yugoslavia-third-agricultural-credit-project","projn":"Ag.Credit III -- P009186","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","count":"World","entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960924224551"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Credit,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,arable land,Bank management,Bank\n            procedures,banking system,Banks,Borrower,borrowing,capital\n            markets,commercial credit,commitment,commitments,comparative\n            advantage,conditionality,contractors,Disbursement,Disbursements,Economic\n            Rate of Return,Economics,employment,Exchange Rate,Exchange\n            Rates,farms,feasibility studies,financial\n            intermediaries,Financial Performance,financial\n            restructuring,financing gap,foreign exchange,growth\n            potential,Guarantee Agreements,income,Inflation,Inflation\n            Rates,interest rate,Interest Rates,labor\n            force,laws,livestock products,LOAN,Loan Agreement,Loan\n            Amount,Loan Effectiveness,macroeconomic conditions,poverty\n            alleviation,product markets,production\n            output,productivity,project financing,resource\n            mobilization,structural\n            adjustment,subborrowers,subloans,technical assistance,total\n            costs,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Credit,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,arable land,Bank management,Bank\n            procedures,banking system,Banks,Borrower,borrowing,capital\n            markets,commercial credit,commitment,commitments,comparative\n            advantage,conditionality,contractors,Disbursement,Disbursements,Economic\n            Rate of Return,Economics,employment,Exchange Rate,Exchange\n            Rates,farms,feasibility studies,financial\n            intermediaries,Financial Performance,financial\n            restructuring,financing gap,foreign exchange,growth\n            potential,Guarantee Agreements,income,Inflation,Inflation\n            Rates,interest rate,Interest Rates,labor\n            force,laws,livestock products,LOAN,Loan Agreement,Loan\n            Amount,Loan Effectiveness,macroeconomic conditions,poverty\n            alleviation,product markets,production\n            output,productivity,project financing,resource\n            mobilization,structural\n            adjustment,subborrowers,subloans,technical assistance,total\n            costs,working capital"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","repnb":"7334"},"723750":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1980/02/723750/yugoslavia-third-agricultural-credit-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1980/02/723750/yugoslavia-third-agricultural-credit-project","new_url":"1980/02/723750/yugoslavia-third-agricultural-credit-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/09/06/000178830_9810190234234/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/09/06/000178830_9810190234234/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"1801","datestored":"2000-09-06T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1980-02-29T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - Third Agricultural Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The proposed project would consist of:\n            primary agricultural production in the individual sector.\n            Sub-loans would be made to about 18,800 individual farmers\n            through cooperatives for livestock development to produce\n            milk, beef, pork, chicken, lamb, and fruit and vegetable.
