The broad thrust\n            of the reform program is based on the following elements:\n            (a) maintaining macroeconomic stability; (b) promoting\n            economic integration with world markets, starting with\n            exploiting Jordan's proximity to Europe; (c) reforming\n            the public sector and creating a sound environment for\n            private sector development; and (d) improving the\n            functioning of the financial sector to promote more\n            efficient mobilization of savings and better investments.\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory. Borrower's\n            performance was highly satisfactory. The key lessons learned\n            were as follows: (i) The ERDL came at a time when the\n            government was underway with its reform program, but due to\n            exogenous factors, such as the redemption of Jordanian\n            Dinars (JD) held in West Bank and Gaza, needed breathing\n            space to ensure macroeconomic stability without sacrificing\n            the rapid pace of reform."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Economic Reform and Development Loan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jordan - Economic Reform and\n            Development

The project supports\n            trade and investment policy reforms to: 1) remove the\n            quota-based preferential treatment of goods originating in\n            or going to specific countries, or convert it into a\n            full-fledged free trade agreement that satisfies the World\n            Trade Organization rules; 2) remove import licensing\n            requirements; 3) reduce and restructure tariffs, including\n            the elimination of the various import fees and surcharges;\n            4) remove tariff exemptions; 5) establish a credible path to\n            achieving full long-term trade liberalization; 6) equalize\n            domestic taxes on imports and domestically produced goods;\n            7) establish a business-enabling investment environment and\n            strengthen investment incentives; 8) streamline and\n            rationalize customs administration; and 9) improve the\n            operations of export development
