Some\n            lessons learned included:  consultation with the\n            stakeholders was a recipe for success. Indeed, as explained\n            above, reforms have been undertaken after a process of close\n            and continuous consultation with all stakeholders. This\n            ensured a clear understanding of the multiple issues at\n            stake from all parties involved (including representatives\n            of civil society) and also an adherence to the overarching\n            goals of the Development Policy Loan, or DPL. Ultimately, it\n            helped mitigate skepticism or even opposition to certain\n            reforms. The reforms engaged in the financial sector through\n            this program would not have been achieved without support\n            from all stakeholders. Clear objectives and realistic\n            development indicators are also critical to success. The DPL\n            contained achievable policy actions that were very focused\n            and easy to measure. Also, choosing only actions critical\n            for achieving results as conditions for disbursement proved\n            to be pertinent. The policy actions were maintained at a\n            modest number but with sufficient critical mass, focusing on\n            those that are considered crucial in improving household and\n            Small and Medium Enterprise, or SME access, strengthening\n            financial stability arrangements and developing capital markets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Sustainable Access to Finance\n

This progress in financial development has\n            been the result of sound macroeconomic policies and\n            important financial sector reforms earlier in the decade,\n            which positioned Morocco to take advantage of favorable\n            conditions.

The fourth pillar,\n            capital market development, contributes both to access and\n            stability. It promotes competition to banks which will\n            encourage them to go down market, and will make new\n            information and instruments available therefore making\n            further

The total assets of\n            Moroccan financial institutions have grown significantly and\n            exceed 200 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), a ratio\n            that is well above the level predicted by Morocco's per\n            capita income. This progress in financial development has\n            been the result of sound macroeconomic policies and\n            important financial sector reforms earlier in the decade,\n            which positioned Morocco to take advantage of favorable\n            conditions. The Government has launched a new financial\n            reform program that addresses effectively the dual\n            objectives of access and stability. It includes four\n            mutually reinforcing pillars which build on major\n            improvements in the soundness and risk management capacity\n            of financial institutions. The first pillar contains\n            measures that promote access to households while the second\n            pillar comprises measures to enhance access to small and\n            medium enterprises. The launch of a credit bureau and\n            revised partial credit guarantee mechanisms will allow\n            further progress in access and improved risk management. The\n            third pillar strengthens the resiliency of the financial\n            system through further improvements in financial regulation\n            and supervision. It will allow an early identification of\n            risks and will avoid a repeat of the difficulties\n            experienced by the microcredit sector. The fourth pillar,\n            capital market development, contributes both to access and\n            stability. It promotes competition to banks which will\n            encourage them to go down market, and will make new\n            information and instruments available therefore making\n            further gains in long term financing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Sustainable Access to Finance\n            Development Policy Loan
