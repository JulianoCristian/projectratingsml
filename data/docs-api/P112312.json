Some lessons learned includes: financial\n            sector reforms are relatively easy to design but difficult\n            to implement. Successful implementation depends on two\n            crucial factors: the commitment of the authorities to the\n            reform program; and the effectiveness of project\n            supervision. The Egyptian authorities have shown a strong\n            commitment to the multi-year reform program that was\n            designed by the reformist government that was appointed in\n            2004. The reform program did not include the privatization\n            of the two largest commercial banks nor the large insurance\n            companies. However, many measures were taken to improve the\n            management of these institutions, which one commentator\n            resembled to an effective 'privatization of\n            management' rather than 'privatization of\n            ownership'. A dogmatic approach to the ownership\n            question would not be justified, especially after the public\n            rescue of so many leading private banks and insurance\n            companies in high-income countries during the 2008 global\n            financial crisis. Policy based operations may require strong\n            Bank technical assistance efforts as part of the process,\n            particularly in the financial sector. Multi-trenched\n            financial sector adjustment operations are effective\n            instruments to support major financial sector reforms.\n            Achievements under the operations three policy areas thus\n            contributed substantially to the overall development outcome\n            sought by the operation: strengthen the enabling legal and\n            institutional environment for financial intermediation and\n            risk management and to increase the role and participation\n            of the private sector in the provision of financial\n            services. The most relevant lesson of this project is\n            perhaps the importance of the ownership of the reform\n            program by the authorities and their strong commitment to\n            its success. This is underscored by the second component of\n            the operation concerning the restructuring of the ailing\n            specialized public financial institutions. The key lesson\n            from these two projects was the importance of the commitment\n            of the authorities to the reform program, which was most\n            evident prior to and during the project. Without this strong\n            and effective commitment, such significant results could not\n            have been achieved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt, Morocco and Guatemala - First and\n

Some\n            lessons learned include: the implementation challenges\n            relating to the fiscal reform component of the first and\n            second DPLs illustrate the difficulties of achieving program\n            objectives that depend on legislative approval, particularly\n            in the area of tax reform. Repeated attempts to increase\n            revenue collections through raising tax rates and expanding\n            the tax base have failed in the past, and continue to face\n            stiff opposition. Moreover, it is important to acknowledge\n            the intrinsic difficulty of implementing redistributive tax\n            reform in a highly unequal society and within a short time\n            horizon. The experience of the first and second DPLs implies\n            that the Bank could be more modest in its expectations, and\n            could foster support for reform by identifying and helping\n            build constituencies with shared interests or who stand to\n            gain from reform. Another related lesson that can be drawn\n            from the DPLs is that although the planned fiscal reforms\n            would have generated significant revenues, measures to\n            improve tax administration can also generate large revenue\n            gains, and are politically more palatable. In Guatemala,\n            introducing tax controls and modernizing tax systems not\n            only increased efficiency but had a big pay-off through\n            reducing evasion. Another lesson that can be derived from\n            the operation relates to the policy measures on increasing\n            the transparency of public trust funds. The stated objective\n            was to increase transparency in the hope that eventually\n            this would create pressure to increase oversight and efficiency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala

Particularly, improvements have been made in\n            consolidating peace and building democratic institutions.\n            The process of consolidating democratic institutions was\n            strengthened most recently with the peaceful transition to\n            the new government of Alvaro Colom of the Union Nacional de\n            la Esperanza (UNE) party in January 2008, following the\n            administration of Oscar Berger of the Gran Alianza Nacional\n            (GANA) party. While UNE won the largest number of\n            congressional seats (51 out of 158), the lack of a simple\n            majority has made the new administration's focus on\n            social cohesion and building strategic alliances\n            particularly relevant. Building a broad consensus is\n            important for the successful implementation of its ambitious\n            development plan in promoting inclusive growth and reducing\n            poverty and inequality. This Development Policy Loan (DPL)\n            is designed to assist the government in improving fiscal and\n            institutional policies. The government has initiated a\n            program to enhance transparent and efficient priority public\n            spending and investment for growth and poverty reduction,\n            including a targeted conditional cash transfer program. The\n            DPL will contribute to the government's main policy\n            objectives by: a) supporting enhanced governance,\n            transparency, and monitoring and evaluation of increased\n            public expenditure and investment; and b) supporting\n            macroeconomic stability and greater fiscal space for\n            priority
