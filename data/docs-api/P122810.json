Fourth National Program for\n            Community Empowerment in Rural Areas Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Fourth National Program for\n            Community Empowerment in Rural Areas Project for Indonesia\n            received a moderately satisfactory outcome rating with a\n            moderate risk to development outcome. The Bank received a\n            satisfactory rating for its performance while the Borrower\n            was rated moderately satisfactory. There were no\n            restructurings for this project. The only significant change\n            that occurred during this project was the delinking of\n            Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (National Community\n            Empowerment Program) or PNPM-Generasi and PNPM-Green. At\n            appraisal, it was envisaged that part of the proceeds of the\n            loan would be allocated to co-finance PNPM-Generasi. For\n            managerial purposes, the Bank decided to delink this pilot\n            project from PNPM-Rural III, and the project was not linked\n            to PNPM-Rural IV. PNPM-Green was not linked to either\n            project, and continued to be implemented on a stand-alone\n            basis. There are five lessons learned from this project and\n            are as follows: (1) A clear and robust results framework is\n            essential for a nationwide CDD program. An adequate results\n            framework will set clearly articulated targets for outcomes\n            that the project intends to achieve over time, and\n            periodically measure to what extent the targets have been\n            achieved. (2) A platform for support innovation. The\n            project\u0092s basic operating system and facilitation platform\n            has proven to be sufficiently robust to support the\n            incubation of pilot programs and to test new and innovative\n            ideas. (3) Facilitators require incentives to promote\n            innovation. To encourage innovation, facilitators need to be\n            given financial and organizational incentives to help\n            communities consider a broader range of subproject types.\n            (4) Investments in facilitator training should be based on\n            timely evaluations and accompanied by competitive salaries\n            as well as adequate resources for supervision. The quality\n            of facilitators is the main driver of success for\n            community-based project implementation. (5) Procurement of\n            Administrative Service Firms (ASFs) is cost-effective.\n            Through this procurement method, the implementing agency was\n            able to provide oversight to the program at a substantial\n            lower cost than through traditional oversight consultants\n            (mainly because overheads on specialist staff are no longer\n            included in the cost price)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Fourth National Program for\n            Community Empowerment in Rural Areas Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Fourth

two poverty\n            alleviation program. The work of the PNPM Support Facility\n            (PSF) goes beyond coordination. The PSF provides technical\n            assistance in the continuous effort to build capacities of\n            communities, governments at the local, provincial and\n            national level, and civil society. It assists the\n            development of a very robust monitoring and evaluation\n            framework which supports continuous improvements to the\n            program. It makes sure that donor funds are used\n            appropriately. The PSF also facilitates the implementation\n            of analytical work that forms the foundation for the\n            planning, management, and improvement of government\n            poverty-reduction programs. A key element of the PSF\n            approach is innovation: it provides space for explorations\n            and experimentation. PSF's pilot initiatives are highly\n            innovative and carry the potential for high rewards. The PSF\n            has various comparative advantages. By tapping into the\n            World Bank's global knowledge base, it can facilitate\n            access to international best practices across a range of\n            development areas. The success of the PSF has not gone\n            unnoticed. In recent years, PNPM has served as a model for\n            the development of similar community-driven development\n            programs, such as in Afghanistan. The PSF plays a direct\n            role in this. Knowledge sharing continues to expand between\n            the PSF and parties interested in emulating the success of PNPM."},"docna":{"cdata!":"2011 PSF progress
