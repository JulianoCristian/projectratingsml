The main lessons include: 1) In\n            the institutional context, it is not clear that the Bank\n            personnel were fully aware of the institutional environment\n            of higher education, and in particular of the dominant role\n            of university rectors. The failure to take this into account\n            during project design has meant that much supervision time\n            has been spent on garnering the support of rectors for\n            project implementation in those institutions under their\n            control. 2) During the project, there has been a high\n            turnover in management positions in some project\n            institutions under the Council for Higher Education. This\n            has been due partly to the lack of any distinct career\n            stream for TTC (Technician Training Center) managers within\n            the structure of higher education. Hence, there is no\n            guarantee that an appointee to TTC management will have a\n            related technical background, with a resulting disincentive\n            to effective management. The problem of managerial\n            discontinuity has manifested differently in the Ministry of\n            Tourism. This is more a function of government or\n            ministerial instability, since incoming ministers tend to\n            install their own appointees at senior administrative\n            levels, or at least to reshuffle the incumbents of senior\n            posts. In either case, this has resulted in lack of\n            commitment during the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Second Industrial Training Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Second Industrial\n            Training Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/03/728131/turkey-second-industrial-training-loan-project","projn":"TR-Ind.
