Some lessons learned\n            included: government's sustained commitment to human\n            resource development and to improving secondary education\n            was crucial for the project's achievements. The\n            commitment translated into formulation and implementation of\n            policies which aimed at increasing education quality inputs\n            and providing access-for-all to a nine-year basic education\n            including the first three years of the secondary school\n            program. It led to a more decentralized approach to\n            management of the secondary school system as an important\n            strategy to improve school quality. In addition, the\n            commitment was reflected in adequate and timely government\n            funding of the project. The objective of achieving better\n            education outcomes requires an integrated set of\n            interventions and building human resources and institutional\n            capacity. This is a process which, if it is to lead to\n            large-scale changes in school management and teaching\n            behavior, requires longer than the implementation period of\n            a typical project. In this case, the continued support over\n            ten years or so through the first and second phase projects\n            combined to provide a suitable time frame for investment in\n            staff development and to establish a critical mass of\n            qualified and experienced staff for sustainable\n            institutional development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Second
