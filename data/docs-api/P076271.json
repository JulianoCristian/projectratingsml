Some\n            lessons learned included: PPITA experience shows that\n            creating new institutions and empowering them is much more\n            difficult than anticipated in the project documents. Such\n            change requires a long gestation period and a willingness to\n            re-distribute power between the various institutions.\n            Borrowers have been willing to borrow at International Bank\n            for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) rates for program\n            lending and larger project loans; however, IBRD technical\n            assistance (TA) loans may not be competitive where an\n            abundance of grant funds exist as is the case in Indonesia\n            at present. This lesson is consistent with the experience of\n            many other countries where only grants or International\n            Development Association (IDA) money are accepted for TA and\n            non-income-earning projects. Public Private Partnership\n            (PPP) reform is enormously complex, involving many\n            governmental and non-governmental entities. Donors working\n            in an area such as this need to ensure that they coordinate\n            closely with Government of Indonesia (GoI) and harmonize\n            their agendas to avoid working across purposes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Private Provision of\n            Infrastructure Technical Assistance Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Private

Technical Assistance Project for\n            Indonesia is to assist the Government in developing and\n            implementing the policy and regulatory reforms and build the\n            institutional and social foundations needed to enable,\n            promote, and facilitate efficient and sustainable\n            large-scale private investment in infrastructure. There are\n            three main project components. The first component,\n            Cross-sectoral technical assistance and advisory services,\n            encompasses: Core support to the Secretariat for the\n            Committee on Policy for the Acceleration of Infrastructure\n            Development (KPPI Secretariat) and Planning and Investment\n            Sub-committee; supplementary support to the KPPI Secretariat\n            and Planning and Investment Sub-committee; and support for\n            the establishment and initial operation of a central\n            Public-Private Partnership (P3) unit. With the second\n            component, the largest part of the project resources will be\n            allocated to sector-specific activities aimed at\n            establishing conditions conducive to sustainable private\n            investment in infrastructure, and to developing specific\n            opportunities for such investment. The project will focus\n            primarily on the transport, telecommunications, and urban\n            infrastructure sectors, and support activities involving: 1)\n            legal and regulatory reform (drafting of sector laws and\n            implementing regulations);2)design and establishment of\n            regulatory institutions; 3) conduct of sector policy and\n            strategy studies with a strong PPI focus and impact\n            (including sector / sub-sector privatization strategy\n            studies); 4) establishment of key sectoral \"nodes\"\n            in the national P3 network; 5) preparation and tendering of\n            pilot PPI projects; and 6) conduct and dissemination of\n            \"lessons learned\" analyses for recent private\n            infrastructure projects and privatization initiatives. The\n            third component The project contributes to capacity building\n            and training in areas relating to private participation in infrastructure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Private Provision of\n            Infrastructure Technical Assistance Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia -

Given these\n            projects could produce environmental, and social adversity,\n            these safeguards and environmental screening procedures have\n            been developed, to be applied in all demonstration project\n            preparation, and integrated into the bidding and contract\n            documents for each selected scheme. During the initial\n            screening stage, the Government shall utilize existing data\n            available during project preparation, but in the absence of\n            such data, site visits, and information collection will be\n            undertaken by the Project Management Unit (PMU) to establish\n            the data needed for screening, and approval by the Bank for\n            the environmental assessment (EA) classification, as a\n            condition prior to the investors' invitation to the\n            bidding process. A second stage screening will require a\n            detailed assessment of project characteristics, considering\n            key environmental issues, e.g., scope of impacts, assessment\n            boundaries, nature, and biodiversity conservation, which\n            should include field studies on environmental impacts. The\n            Government should provide case-by-case partial financing to\n            investors for implementation of the second stage EA\n            screening, and prepare draft environmental documentation, to\n            determine the appropriate environmental category of a\n            project, consistent with the Government, and Bank\n            requirements.
