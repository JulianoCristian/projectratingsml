However, the experience of this\n            project indicates that a lot remains to be done to\n            rationalize the allocation of powers, and responsibilities,\n            between the Central and Local Governments, an issue to be\n            addressed in future operations; 2) while the Communal\n            Infrastructure Fund stands as a solid financial institution,\n            following its restructuring, there is still the need to\n            improve monitoring practices in post-evaluation of projects,\n            to prevent risking funds, and future operations as well. In\n            addition, environmental concerns were not fully integrated\n            into the evaluation process, and it will need to be\n            introduced in future routine operations; 3) although at\n            appraisal, extensive training was included for strengthening\n            the local governments' capacity, the component was\n            dropped due to a reluctant Government to pursue the program\n            as such.
