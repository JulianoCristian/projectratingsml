This\n            should have been replicated at the local level by having one\n            single Project Implementation Unit (PIU) coordinating with\n            all water sector stakeholders; an alternative that can be\n            explored to maximize Bank's assistance, noting that\n            this is not always possible as funding availability and\n            timing is a constraint, particularly in International\n            Development Association (IDA) countries, is a programmatic\n            and wider sector approach, combining technical assistance\n            (TA) and investment with clear links and objective\n            milestones in terms of performance to access the financing\n            under the program; given the lack of real linkages (in terms\n            of financing) between the two operations, the results\n            monitoring framework of the investment project could have\n            considered performance indicators only related to the\n            implementation of the investment project financed by the\n            loan and credits, i.e. within its control and influence; in\n            hindsight, considering that the Private Sector Participation\n            (PSP) eventually did not go through, the project as a\n            standalone project could have considered alternative routes\n            for the institutional strengthening of Water and Sewerage\n            Company Inc. (WASCO) vis-a-vis the sustainability of the\n            services and investments in its risk analysis and proposed\n            mitigation measures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"St. Lucia - Water Supply

Project Paper seeks the approval of\n            the Executive Directors to provide Additional Financing to\n            the Government of Saint Lucia, to be funded with equivalent\n            amounts of IDA credits and to be used for the Water Supply\n            Infrastructure Improvement Project. The reasons for the\n            request for additional financing are: the actual cost of the\n            bids received for the turnkey contract; contingencies\n            recommended by the technical consultants to the project; and\n            an increase in fuel and construction costs since the\n            original project appraisal estimates. The additional\n            financing request does not entail changes to the\n            Project's objectives. The overall scope of the project\n            to be financed with IBRD and IDA funds (including the\n            additional financing) remains the same as defined in the\n            PAD. The project supports the Government of Saint\n            Lucia's agenda for the water sector, which establishes\n            as a priority the provision of reliable service to meet\n            demand from population as well as to facilitate investment\n            from hoteliers and developers in the north region.

     Infrastructure Improvement Project will support a short term\n            investment program to carry out critical works, required to\n            achieve the following objectives: a) alleviate the water\n            shortage in the north of the country. The infrastructure\n            works proposed will allow the utility to supply the entire\n            north of the island with a more efficient, continuous and\n            reliable service; b) implement urgent investments that will\n            result in additional revenues, reduce the likelihood of\n            commercial users (important sources of cross-subsidy for\n            poor consumers) abandoning the system, and improve the\n            potential of a successful partnership between the government\n            and the private sector. The Infrastructure Improvement Works\n            component includes the upgrade the Roseau dam pumping\n            station; improvements to the raw water transmission between\n            Vanard and Sarot; upgrade of the Theobalds water treatment\n            plant; and, upgrade o f the Morne Bocage distribution\n            pipeline. Due to the urgent nature of the works, and the\n            close inter-relationship among the project components, it is\n            considered that a turnkey contract will be the most\n            efficient way to implement this type of project, and achieve\n            success.  The second component - Technical Assistance and\n            Project Management - includes the provision of technical\n            assistance required to support Project implementation, carry\n            out Project management activities, and strengthen the\n            capacity of the Project Implementation Unit (PlU) staff in\n            Project management, and priority technical areas, which may\n            include the provision of training. The areas of technical\n            assistance include: 1) oversight and monitoring of the\n            quality of works; 2) studies on the water resources of the\n            Roseau River, including analyses of a) the hydrological\n            capacity of the Roseau dam and reservoir system, and\n            possibly of other surface water sources, b) the potential\n            for increasing the capacity of the Roseau dam through\n            engineering improvements, and, c) safety and environmental\n            considerations related to such activities; and,\n            implementation of a groundwater resources study to determine\n            the quantity, quality and potential use of groundwater in\n            St. Lucia."},"docna":{"cdata!":"St. Lucia -
