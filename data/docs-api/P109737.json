Some lessons\n            learned included:  sustainable land management efforts\n            provide an important opportunity to engage women as active\n            agents of reversing land degradation rather than passive\n            recipients of adaptation support. Women are\n            disproportionately vulnerable to the impacts of land\n            degradation, and this reducing land degradation and adoption\n            of SLM often comes at a cost and tends to require medium to\n            longer term investment by land user. However, some market\n            failures such as lack of credit, technology or knowledge\n            could serve as barrier to such investment. Market based\n            incentives such as co-financing (matching grant) from\n            government have proven to be effective in helping land user\n            overcome initial investment constraints. There is a need to\n            balance between having maximum project impact and\n            overstating scope of what project can realistically achieve.\n            Unrealistic targets limit the scope of impact of project\n            upfront and places undue burden on project implementation\n            unit to deliver results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria -
