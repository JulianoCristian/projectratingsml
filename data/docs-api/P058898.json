Some lessons learned included:\n            the implementation of the RIRP Monitoring and Evaluation\n            (M&E) system provided incorrect data. As a result of\n            verification of these data after project closing, the\n            project was downgraded from satisfactory to moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Inadequate M&E critically affects the\n            ability of the World Bank to identify threats to project\n            outcomes and propose adequate corrective action, and hence\n            M&E results should be verified and properly documented\n            through prompt supervision follow-up. Project investments in\n            pumped irrigation schemes did not increase overall water\n            supply, mainly because of a lack of funds for Operation and\n            Maintenance (O&M). Poor O&M has a critical impact on\n            project outcomes, and any future investments for irrigation\n            and drainage rehabilitation projects in Tajikistan should be\n            based on an analysis of the economic and financial viability\n            of rehabilitated schemes and the resources available for\n            O&M. Mainly because management style and the capacity\n            and the commitment of the Project Management Unit (PMU) were\n            inadequate, the community-driven development approach for\n            the village water supply component was implemented\n            unsatisfactory and most water supply schemes did not reach\n            their objective. Accordingly it is important that future\n            investments in Tajikistan in Community Driven Development\n            (CDD) Project components are implemented through capable and\n            committed project partners with adequate understanding of\n            the CDD approach."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tajikistan - Rural Infrastructure\n            Rehabilitation

to be small, the\n            infrastructure rehabilitation works to increase water\n            efficiency in the main, and field canals on demonstration\n            farms, does not include investments in dams, nor\n            construction of new canals, to allow increased water\n            abstraction from main sources. Neither does it include\n            resettlement plans. Hence, several environmental issues have\n            been identified in the Environmental Management Plan (EMP),\n            namely, ineffective water resources management, and,\n            increasing areas affected by water-logging and soil\n            salination, due to inefficient irrigation water management,\n            and improper use of drainage systems. Furthermore, soil\n            erosion, and town waste water discharges into major rivers,\n            will increase water pollution. This EMP discusses measures\n            to mitigate adverse impacts on the environment, recommending\n            during construction, a) the dampening of surfaces to avoid\n            dust pollution, b) that works be adjusted to daytime\n            schedules to ease noise disturbances, and, c) that solid\n            wastes be disposed of in accordance with environmental\n            regulations. Vegetation degradation should be replaced\n            and/or replanted. Sludge drainage will be seasonally\n            controlled, according to operation and maintenance\n            practices, while affected crop lands will undergo periodic\n            water, and soil testing, by regional laboratories.
