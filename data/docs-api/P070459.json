Some lessons\n            learned included: simplified internal clearance procedures\n            for variation orders. The approval of the different has led\n            to long delays in finalizing contracts. A simplified yet\n            efficient internal clearance procedure in Inner Mongolia is\n            needed to streamline the approvals process between multiple\n            agencies and to avoid long delays. Reduced use of\n            International supervision for shorter, more specific\n            technical tasks. Construction supervision under local\n            engineering firms was supported by an international\n            consultant firm and four consulting staff was relocated to\n            the construction site. It was found that the international\n            consultant provided good project management and quality\n            control support but lacked sufficient knowledge of Chinese\n            standards and technical challenges. As construction quality\n            in China is generally high and implementation periods\n            satisfactory, it is recommended to use international\n            consultants only for shorter, more specific technical tasks\n            and to make more use of local consultants that are familiar\n            of the Chinese standards and technical practices. In the\n            planning of transport investments it is important that there\n            is good coordination between various modal agencies. During\n            the preparation stage more emphasis could have been given to\n            the linkages between road and rail movements with the\n            objective of improving integration in planning and\n            operations and greater inter-modal efficiencies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

The scope and criteria of this\n            environmental assessment covers both a social assessment,\n            and the ecological aspects potentially affected by the\n            project implementation. The following is a summary of the\n            environmental impacts, and mitigation measures. During\n            construction, trees in the right of way (ROW), and forestry\n            - particularly for soil conservation and protection of\n            irrigation systems - will be avoided as possible; spoil\n            sites with no impact on farmland, or natural vegetation will\n            be reduced, by lowering embankments, to be later\n            rehabilitated along with local agriculture development\n            activities; spraying of storage material, and asphalt mixing\n            sites should prevent air, and dust pollution; and,\n            wastewaters, and oil spills discharges will be prevented\n            from river flows, treated appropriately, aiming as well to\n            prevent soil erosion, and irrigation contamination. Drainage\n            ditches will be designed so as to prevent flooding, and\n            water losses, and contain soil erosion. Traffic safety\n            measures shall include adequate signs, and road\n            diversification as needed; while limited working days\n            activities should minimize noise
