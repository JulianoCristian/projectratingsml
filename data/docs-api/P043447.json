Lessons drawn from the project\n            suggest that lending through intermediaries should intensify\n            technical assistance at the early stages of project\n            implementation, particularly in transition economies, where\n            it is difficult to introduce policy changes, and build\n            ownership. Technical assistance should be coordinated, and\n            integrated into a long-term strategic plan for the\n            development of commercial banks, and thus achieve\n            sustainable institutional development impact. The\n            establishment of an independent agency, is essential in\n            attaining discipline by the Borrower, as well as a formal\n            Fiscal Agency Agreement is critical to compliance with the\n            Loan Agreement's financial, environmental, and other\n            applicable legal covenants. Furthermore, early ownership of\n            project design, and clear institutional arrangements,\n            facilitate capacity building. Such capacity could then focus\n            on the competitive aspects of a limited number of\n            financially strong banks, rather than aiming at including\n            all possible smaller banks, a choice inherent in meeting\n            objectives, but a trade-off that needs to be revised. It is\n            questionable whether the need to keep an independent agency\n            after project closure is valid, for provided the\n            participating financial institutions fulfill the\n            qualification criteria, discretionary credit could be used\n            as an untied source of financing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Private Sector Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Macedonia - Private Sector\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/06/729015/macedonia-private-sector-development-project","projn":"MK-Priv Sect Devt -- P043447","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Financial Intermediation,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00082305314184"},"subsc":"Micro- and SME finance,Crops,Animal production","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            practices,auditing,audits,balance of payments,balance\n            sheet,bank accounting,Bank management,Bank of Greece,Bank\n            Performance,Bank procedures,bank supervision,banking\n            law,banking sector,banking system,bankruptcy,banks,capital\n            adequacy,capital requirements,Central Bank,commercial\n            banks,credit markets,credit risk,credit risk\n            management,debt,economic conditions,economies in\n            transition,employment,environmental issues,Environmental\n            Regulations,Exchange Rate,feasibility studies,financial\n            covenants,financial crisis,Financial Institutions,financial\n            management,financial markets,financial reform,Financial\n            Sector Development,financial services,FISCAL YEAR,fish,food\n            industry,foreign banks,fraud,guidelines,hard budget\n            constraints,Institutional Development,interest\n            rates,intermediaries,isolation,laws,legislation,lending\n            rates,liquidation,liquidity,loan portfolio\n            quality,management information systems,marketing,policy\n            environment,portfolios,private banks,Private\n            Sector,privatization,productivity,profitability,prudential\n            regulations,recapitalization,regional banks,regulatory\n            framework,risk management,safety,screening,small\n            banks,structural adjustment,subsidiary,systemic\n            risk,Technical Assistance,term finance,Trust Fund,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            practices,auditing,audits,balance of payments,balance\n            sheet,bank accounting,Bank management,Bank of Greece,Bank\n            Performance,Bank procedures,bank supervision,banking\n            law,banking sector,banking system,bankruptcy,banks,capital\n            adequacy,capital requirements,Central Bank,commercial\n            banks,credit markets,credit risk,credit risk\n            management,debt,economic conditions,economies in\n            transition,employment,environmental issues,Environmental\n            Regulations,Exchange Rate,feasibility studies,financial\n            covenants,financial crisis,Financial Institutions,financial\n            management,financial markets,financial reform,Financial\n            Sector Development,financial services,FISCAL YEAR,fish,food\n            industry,foreign banks,fraud,guidelines,hard budget\n            constraints,Institutional Development,interest\n            rates,intermediaries,isolation,laws,legislation,lending\n            rates,liquidation,liquidity,loan portfolio\n            quality,management information systems,marketing,policy\n            environment,portfolios,private banks,Private\n            Sector,privatization,productivity,profitability,prudential\n            regulations,recapitalization,regional banks,regulatory\n            framework,risk management,safety,screening,small\n            banks,structural adjustment,subsidiary,systemic\n            risk,Technical Assistance,term finance,Trust Fund,working capital"}},"owner":"Private/Financial Sectors Devt (ECSPF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF031974-FYR - MACEDONIA - FINANCIAL SECTOR,TF031972-FYR MACEDONIA - FINANCIAL SECTOR,TF029305-PHRD-PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT II,TF029115-PHRD-POST PRIV.
