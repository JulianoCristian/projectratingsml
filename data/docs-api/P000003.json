The lessons learned indicate that the theme of\n            promoting development by providing information proved to be\n            a good way of bringing people together in a region. It is\n            possible to successfully introduce innovative development\n            topics in a region by widely involving every active\n            stakeholder from the very beginning. Information as a key to\n            improve environmental management requires an important\n            adaptation of mindset. A regional approach has the advantage\n            to enable economies of scale in creating and sharing\n            information and knowledge. The financing of the implementing\n            agency should be part of an agreement with donors.\n            Management of projects should put more emphasis on linking\n            financial management and monitoring & evaluation.\n            Technical experts recruited or appointed in project\n            implementing agencies should ensure an adequate transfer of\n            knowledge towards local executives. In future, the project\n            should ensure better links with the private sector, as this\n            sector is a key recipient of the information disseminated\n            and produced by the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa Region - Regional Environmental\n            Information Management Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Africa Region - Regional\n            Environmental Information Management Program Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/06/4957996/africa-region-regional-environmental-information-management-program-project","projn":"3A-Reimp(Cen.Env.Info) -- P000003","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,ICT Policy and Strategies,Knowledge Economy,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Environment,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Information and Communication Technologies,Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture","count":"Africa","entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040721100701"},"subsc":"General information and communications sector,Other social services,General public administration sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Information and Communication Technologies,Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Information and communications,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to information,Agents,Agricultural\n            Development,Agriculture,collaboration,competitive\n            bidding,computer,data,data collection,data sources,database\n            management,Decision-Making,deforestation,development\n            projects,discussion groups,economic factors,environmental\n            evaluation,Environmental Information,environmental\n            issues,Environmental Management,Environmental\n            policies,environmental regulations,equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,exploitation,families,feed,forest\n            management,forestry,hardware,information\n            infrastructure,Information Management,information\n            services,Information sharing,information\n            systems,integration,international\n            organizations,inventories,isolation,land\n            use,laws,learning,living\n            conditions,logging,managers,marketing,media,membership\n            fees,natural resources,natural resources\n            management,networks,NGOs,oil,private sector,public\n            health,public sector,rural development,rural\n            telephony,schools,services,social services,sustainable\n            management,technical\n            assistance,telecommunication,telecommunication\n            infrastructure,training workshops,universities"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to information,Agents,Agricultural\n            Development,Agriculture,collaboration,competitive\n            bidding,computer,data,data collection,data sources,database\n            management,Decision-Making,deforestation,development\n            projects,discussion groups,economic factors,environmental\n            evaluation,Environmental Information,environmental\n            issues,Environmental Management,Environmental\n            policies,environmental regulations,equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,exploitation,families,feed,forest\n            management,forestry,hardware,information\n            infrastructure,Information Management,information\n            services,Information sharing,information\n            systems,integration,international\n            organizations,inventories,isolation,land\n            use,laws,learning,living\n            conditions,logging,managers,marketing,media,membership\n            fees,natural resources,natural resources\n            management,networks,NGOs,oil,private sector,public\n            health,public sector,rural development,rural\n            telephony,schools,services,social services,sustainable\n            management,technical\n            assistance,telecommunication,telecommunication\n            infrastructure,training workshops,universities"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 3 (AFTS3)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF020552-REGIONAL FUND FOR LOCAL INITIATIVES,TF025145-PRGIE - BELGIAN TRUST FUND,TF027895-SOCIAL & ENV.
