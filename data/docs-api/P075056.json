Some lessons learned included: 1) when\n            starting a reform program in a difficult area such as\n            improvement in food and drug quality and safety, it is\n            prudent to be less ambitious in what can be achieved in the\n            first operation and to build capacity for implementing\n            reforms over the long term; 2) capacity building for complex\n            regulatory functions needs a well coordinated approach. To\n            achieve a significant increase in quality and quantity of\n            lab tests for example, it is not sufficient to build a new\n            lab, hire lab staff and procure equipment. At the same time,\n            the number of inspectors who collect samples in the field\n            also needs to be increased to provide the additional samples\n            and make use of the increased lab capacity; 3) prior to\n            launching the project, the administrative steps necessary\n            and time requirements for creating positions and recruiting\n            public servants could have been investigated and addressed\n            proactively on a high level in order to avoid the delays in\n            creating and filling positions encountered during\n            implementation; 4) procurement of simple office equipment\n            and standard lab equipment could be done better locally in\n            states, possibly under a framework contract that provides\n            favorable terms and prices; 5) delivery of new equipment,\n            installation, validation, and application training need to\n            be closely supervised by the procuring unit in order to\n            ensure the full functioning of specialized equipment; and 6)\n            the onus of obtaining utility connections (electricity and\n            water) for the facility could be built into the contract to\n            avoid delay in making the facility functional before the\n            defect liability period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Food and Drugs Capacity Building Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Food and Drugs Capacity\n            Building Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/04/10602625/india-food-drugs-capacity-building-project","projn":"IN-Food And Drugs Capacity Building Project\n            -- P075056","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Pharmaceuticals & Pharmacoeconomics,Housing & Human Habitats,Food & Beverage Industry,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Industry,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20090527040312"},"theme":"Child health,Health system performance","subsc":"Health","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Industry,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, Action Plan, Agriculture,\n            antibiotics, audits, automation, bakery products, batches,\n            botanical drugs, Business Environment, capabilities,\n            CAPACITY BUILDING, certificates, certification, cities,\n            communication strategy, communities, community groups,\n            competitive advantage, Competitive Bidding, computers,\n            consumer demand, consumer education, consumer groups,\n            corruption, cost effectiveness, counterfeit drugs, dairy,\n            dangers, Dates, decision making, digitalization, disclosure,\n            drug control, drug industry, drug testing, DRUGS,\n            electricity, end users, engineers, Environmental Health,\n            equipment, favoritism, Financial Management, Financial\n            Management System, financial reports, financial resources,\n            Food Adulteration, food and drug safety, food habits, Food\n            handlers, food hygiene, food industry, Food law, food\n            quality, Food Safety, Food Technology, food testing, foods,\n            fraud, Front-end, fruits, Gender, generic drugs, generic\n            pharmaceuticals, GMP, Good Laboratory Practices, Good\n            Manufacturing Practices, hardware, Hazard, health education,\n            health outcomes, households, human resource, Human\n            Resources, hygiene, ID, implementation period,\n            implementation stage, Implementing Agencies, Implementing\n            Agency, information flows, information system, inspection,\n            installation, institution, institutional capacity,\n            institutional framework, interfaces, International\n            Standards, International Trade, intervention, interventions,\n            inventory, inventory management, IP, Laboratories, laws,\n            leasing, license, licenses, maintenance costs, Manpower\n            Requirement, Manufacturing, marketing, mass media, meat,\n            medicines, Microbiology, Migration, morbidity, mortality,\n            nutrition, operating costs, operational efficiency,\n            performance criteria, Performance Indicators,\n            Pharmaceutical, pharmaceutical industry, Pharmaceutical\n            standards, pharmaceuticals, Pharmacopia, private\n            partnership, private partnerships, private sector, private\n            sectors, Procurement, procurement process, procurement\n            processes, project implementation, project management,\n            public education, public health, purchasing, quality\n            control, quality of services, Rational Use of Drugs,\n            regulatory authorities, regulatory framework, regulatory\n            system, result, RESULTS, retention, risk factors, rural\n            areas, safety issues, safety of food, sites, Social\n            Development, street foods, Supervision, technical\n            assistance, technical skill, technical skills, technical\n            staff, technical support, tendering, time frame, user,\n            users, vegetables, verification, victims, World Trade"}},"owner":"S.A.

To this end, this\n            Environmental Management Plan (EMP) enables review, and\n            mitigation of environmental risks as foreseen within the\n            project. Although the existing laws in India do establish\n            standards on occupational health, safety, waste management,\n            and environmental protection for manufacturing, they do not\n            specifically provide for environmental health, and safety in\n            food and drug quality testing laboratories; but while some\n            international standards may not be appropriate to conditions\n            in Indian laboratories, some manuals (in particular the\n            United States' Environmental Protection Agency and Food\n            and Drug Administration manuals) are directed to smaller\n            laboratories, and may be replicated in laboratories under\n            this program. The EMP process will be phased beginning with\n            an assessment of health, safety and environmental practices\n            in testing laboratories, followed by a national workshop to\n            discuss findings, draft guidelines for best practices, and\n            formulate detailed operating manuals for laboratories. Based\n            on this, training modules will be developed, with checklists\n            to monitor each laboratory practice. The report includes a\n            current chart of categories of biomedical wastes, and\n            treatment/disposal activities to mitigate impacts, which\n            include incineration, burial at selected landfill sites,\n            disinfection practices, drainage of treated discharges, or\n            municipal landfill disposal."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
