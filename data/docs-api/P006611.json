The project had three objectives: a) to\n            support the first phase of a plan to alleviate the sewage\n            disposal and reuse problems with a view to reducing the\n            incidence of typhoid fever and other enteric diseases; b) to\n            upgrade potable water quality and increase available water\n            quantity by improving operation and maintenance and reducing\n            water losses in the water distribution system; and c) to\n            strengthen the management and cost control system of the\n            Empresa Metropolitana de Obras Sanitarias (EMOS). Overall,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory. EMOS is considered one of\n            the more efficient water utilities in Latin America. Overall\n            its performance has been very satisfactory, especially after\n            overcoming initial delays. The relationship between the Bank\n            and the Borrower was generally cordial. The main lessons to\n            be learned from this project are: a) Significant\n            improvements in the performance of the sector and its\n            utilities require a well-functioning regulatory and\n            institutional framework; b) To avoid unnecessary delays in\n            project implementation, it is essential to have detailed\n            designs for a given percentage of the project subcomponents\n            before project effectiveness; c) In the case of an\n            experienced and efficient utility such as EMOS, a project\n            designed from the outset to finance a time slice of its\n            investment program versus a project approach would have\n            precluded the adjustments needed to accommodate the shift in\n            priority as it emerged during project implementation.\n            Overall, Bank performance was satisfactory. EMOS is\n            considered one of the more efficient water utilities in\n            Latin America. Overall its performance has been very\n            satisfactory, especially after overcoming initial delays.\n            The relationship between the Bank and the Borrower was\n            generally
