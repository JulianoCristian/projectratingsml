The total number of\n            households connected under the project would reach about 1\n            million covering a population of about 6 million. The\n            project includes: (a) construction of about 15,500 km of\n            primary lines, and about 16,600 km of secondary lines; (b)\n            installation of 10,750 distribution transformers, about 1.0\n            million kWh meters and 10,500 km of street lighting; (c)\n            supply of tools, implements, equipment and vehicles for\n            construction, installation and servicing; (d) feasibility,\n            detailed engineering and construction of two or more\n            mini-hydro pilot projects; and (e) consultancy services for\n            a study of mini-hydro schemes in Thailand and a study for\n            PEA's operations development. In addition to generating\n            revenues for the electricity sector, the project would\n            produce quantifiable indirect benefits due to fuel cost\n            savings, increased

involves the electrification of about 8,000 villages in 27\n            provinces, 16 provinces in the South, 5 in the North, 2 in\n            the East and 4 in the Central Region. The total number of\n            households connected under the project would reach about 1\n            million covering a population of about 6 million. The\n            project includes: (a) construction of about 15,500 km of\n            primary lines, and about 16,600 km of secondary lines; (b)\n            installation of 10,750 distribution transformers, about 1.0\n            million kWh meters and 10,500 km of street lighting; (c)\n            supply of tools, implements, equipment and vehicles for\n            construction, installation and servicing; (d) feasibility,\n            detailed engineering and construction of two or more\n            mini-hydro pilot projects; and (e) consultancy services for\n            a study of mini-hydro schemes in Thailand and a study for\n            PEA's operations development. In addition to generating\n            revenues for the electricity sector, the project would\n            produce quantifiable indirect benefits due to fuel cost\n            savings, increased productivity of cottage industries and\n            power tools, and savings in operating costs of other motive power."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Second Accelerated Rural\n            Electrification Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand - Second Accelerated\n            Rural Electrification Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/05/726344/thailand-second-accelerated-rural-electrification-project","projn":"TH-Are II -- P004712","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy and Poverty Alleviation,Energy Demand,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion,Energy and Environment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Thailand","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912491144"},"subsc":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Access to Electricity,bulk\n            supply,charcoal,Coal,cooking,covers,diesel engines,diesel\n            fuel,distribution of electricity,distribution\n            systems,electric energy,electric\n            power,ELECTRICITY,electricity consumption,Electricity\n            Generating Authority,electricity sector,electricity\n            supply,energy conservation,Energy Consumption,energy\n            generation,energy output,energy prices,Energy\n            Resources,Energy Sector,energy sector review,energy\n            sources,Engineering,Engineering\n            Consultants,falling,fire,flood protection,fuel,fuel oil,fuel\n            prices,gas fields,gas reserves,gas turbine,gas\n            turbines,gasohol,geothermal\n            energy,Income,Insurance,irrigation,kerosene,lighting,lignite,mini-hydro,Natural\n            Gas,Oil,oil consumption,oil equivalent,oil price,oil\n            prices,oil production,oil shale,peak\n            demand,Petroleum,petroleum product,petroleum product\n            prices,Petroleum products,pipeline,power distribution,power\n            generation,power plants,power purchase,POWER SECTOR,proven\n            reserves,Provision of power,pumps,residential\n            consumers,rivers,Rural Electrification,Rural Electrification\n            Program,state-owned utilities,structures,thermal\n            power,tools,total electricity consumption,Total energy\n            consumption,transmission grid,utilities,wood"},"1":{"cdata!":"Access to Electricity,bulk\n            supply,charcoal,Coal,cooking,covers,diesel engines,diesel\n            fuel,distribution of electricity,distribution\n            systems,electric energy,electric\n            power,ELECTRICITY,electricity consumption,Electricity\n            Generating Authority,electricity sector,electricity\n            supply,energy conservation,Energy Consumption,energy\n            generation,energy output,energy prices,Energy\n            Resources,Energy Sector,energy sector review,energy\n            sources,Engineering,Engineering\n            Consultants,falling,fire,flood protection,fuel,fuel oil,fuel\n            prices,gas fields,gas reserves,gas turbine,gas\n            turbines,gasohol,geothermal\n            energy,Income,Insurance,irrigation,kerosene,lighting,lignite,mini-hydro,Natural\n            Gas,Oil,oil consumption,oil equivalent,oil price,oil\n            prices,oil production,oil shale,peak\n            demand,Petroleum,petroleum product,petroleum product\n            prices,Petroleum products,pipeline,power distribution,power\n            generation,power plants,power purchase,POWER SECTOR,proven\n            reserves,Provision of power,pumps,residential\n            consumers,rivers,Rural Electrification,Rural Electrification\n            Program,state-owned utilities,structures,thermal\n            power,tools,total electricity consumption,Total energy\n            consumption,transmission grid,utilities,wood"}},"owner":"Southeast Asia Headquarters Unit (EACSQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"2875"},"facets":{}}}
