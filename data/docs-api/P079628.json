Of\n            the fourteen intermediate outcome indicators, seven were\n            achieved while the remaining indicators were partially\n            achieved. Significant lessons learned during the project\n            implementation include: 1) ownership of a project by the\n            government and the implementation teams across all levels of\n            regional and sub-regional government is crucial to the\n            success of a project; 2) the most common reasons for project\n            implementation delays were the procurement system and\n            financial management reporting processes; 3) the experience\n            from using performance based grants had both positive and\n            negative effects; and  4) as the Philippines has a highly\n            decentralized health system, implementing a project with one\n            lead agency was not easy as the authority and reporting back\n            mechanisms for the project

facilitate country-wide replication of lessons learned\n            within the framework of its health sector reform agenda.\n            This project paper seeks the approval of the Country\n
