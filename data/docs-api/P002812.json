On balance, the sustainability of various\n            components of the project is likely. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are assessed as satisfactory. There\n            were several lessons learned. Among them: The vital\n            precondition for successful mineral sector reform is a\n            comprehensive and sustained commitment from government\n            authorities. This should be imparted to the staff of\n            sectoral institutions, in order to implant in them a strong\n            commitment to the reform and a sense of ownership and\n            repsonsibility for the reform process. Their participation\n            in seminars, workshops, training programs, and exposure to\n            best practice and experience from mining countries with\n            successful reforms would be useful for this purpose. The\n            mineral sector reform should be approached in an integrated\n            manner, especially on the main components of initiatives for\n            the reform, such as cadastral systems, extension services\n            for small-scale miners, investment promotion activties, and\n            development of basic information for promotional purposes.\n            Formulation and implementation of mineral sector technical\n            assistance programs need to address associated social\n            dimensions, incorporating consistent social strategies and\n            elements. This should be initiated during project\n            preparation, built-in throughout project implementation, and\n            subsequently continued by sectoral and related government\n            institutions over the long term."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Mineral Sector Development\n            Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Mineral Sector\n

to\n            support Tanzania's private sector-oriented mining\n            development policy and to expand private investment in\n            mining. The secondary objective is to strengthen the\n            capacity of mining institutions to efficiently administer\n            and regulate the sector. The project also aims at improving\n            productivity and environmental and social viability of\n            artisanal and small-scale miners. The project has three main\n            components: The legal, regulatory, fiscal and environmental\n            component will help introduce appropriate mining laws and\n            regulations and fiscal and environmental framework to\n            promote and guide private investment in mining. The\n            institutional strengthening component will improve\n            organizational, manpower, and logistical capacity of the\n            Mineral Resource Department (MRD), help reactivate\n            MRD's environmental and mine safety inspection, and\n            strengthen MRD's geological services including\n            publication of geological map sheets and the improvements of\n            its mineral laboratory. The small-scale mining component\n            includes a baseline data survey, the dissemination of\n            information and demonstration of simple and\n            environmentally-sensitive technologies, and training and\n            capacity building support to small-scale miners through the\n            Regional Miners Associations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Mineral Sector
