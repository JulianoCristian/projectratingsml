Ratings for the Eight-Ninth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project for Uganda were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            Inadequate accounting of political economy factors in the\n            design of major reforms can adversely affect the design,\n            implementation and outcomes of DPOs. Lack of focus on\n            domestic revenue mobilization is a prime example. Pressures\n            to extend budget support within the broader, coordinated\n            donor support framework without hard conditionality to raise\n            domestic revenues can undermine incentives for domestic\n            revenue mobilization. This, in turn, can undercut\n            macroeconomic adjustment needed for sustainable fiscal\n            policy as well as the adequacy of funding for basic\n            services. Implementation and evaluation are frequently\n            undermined when objectives are not tightly linked to prior\n            actions and there is no measurable and relevant results\n            framework, when outcome indicators are ambiguous, and when\n            targets do not incorporate an explicit and convincing theory\n            of change. Achievement and sustainability of development\n            outcomes are facilitated by careful attention to political\n            economy dimensions, both at the design stage and when making\n            changes in a DPO series. For example, the failure to\n            increase revenue mobilization over a long period of time,\n            which was not addressed under the program, was directly\n            related to the political economy of political patronage and\n            large, entrenched tax exemptions and culture of\n            non-compliance. DPOs can show improvements in design and\n            outcomes when they actively use lessons from the past\n            operations as well as integrate important technical\n            knowledge products (such as CEMs and PERs). Such lessons can\n            also inform the Bank to take proactive, if difficult\n            measures such as the cancellation of an operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Fifth-Ninth Poverty

Some key lessons learned included:\n            the PRSCs are an excellent vehicle for dialogue, not only\n            between the Government and Development Partners, but also\n            between the Ministries. This is a well-known benefit of\n            PRSCs, but it bears repeating. The ministries reported\n            widely that the PRSC series created a valuable forum to\n            discuss cross-cutting issues such as issues related to\n            public service reform and decentralization. The ministries\n            also expressed that their cases could be better heard in\n            inter-ministerial, multi-donor settings. In the PRSC series,\n            most of the indicators missed some element of the specific,\n            measurable, attributable, and relevant or time bound (SMART)\n            criteria, all of which are critical for indicators to be\n            useful. For example, if an indicator is attributable, but\n            not time-bound, then it cannot be useful to measure results\n            of a program. Conversely, an indicator may be time bound,\n            but too general to be attributable to the activity whose\n            results are being measured. While the indicators for PRSC\n            5-7 were driven by the Government's results framework\n            and Bank's desire to foster ownership, the Bank should\n            have recognized that these were not suitable for the\n            Bank's goal of measuring results. Nonetheless, there is\n            frequently a concern that a policy operation that\n            \"takes its time\" and which needs to advance\n            incrementally may be viewed internally by the Bank as simply\n            repeating actions of the prior credit. One solution might be\n            that gradations should be better specified and nuanced, and\n            actions and targets better calibrated, so that it will be\n            clear that the policy agenda is moving forward while also\n            moving at a rate where there is sustained government\n            ownership and an actual ingraining of the policy reform. At\n            the same time, the Bank may also need to better temper its\n            ambitions about the pace and scope of reform that can\n            realistically be achieved each year, recognizing that many\n            reforms will be incremental, rather than substantial."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credit

included PRSC 5 and PRSC 6. This three operation\n            series was integral to the Bank's Uganda Joint\n            Assistance Strategy (UJAS) discussed by the Board on January\n            17, 2006. Unlike previous PRSCs in Uganda, which were annual\n            single tranche operations, PRSC 7 was designed as an\n            exceptional two tranche PRSC in order to provide time to\n            harmonize future PRSCs under a new joint budget support\n            framework with other donors. The second tranche was made\n            conditional upon: (i) the Government maintaining a stable\n            macroeconomic environment, (ii) the Government approving the\n            FY2008/09 budget consistent with the Poverty Eradication\n            Action Plan (PEAP) and its medium-term growth objectives,\n            and (iii) the Government submitting to cabinet draft\n            proposed amendments to the procurement law and regulations.\n            The overriding themes of the broader PRSC 5-7 series were to\n            support the Government in delivering better services and to\n            create a better policy environment for economic growth and\n            poverty reduction. A core focus of the program was therefore\n            on supporting actions under the fourth pillar of the PEAP3,\n            on 'good governance'. This included actions to\n            strengthen commercial courts, public financial management,\n            budget reporting, public procurement, public sector\n            management and
