Some lessons learned included: promoting\n            greater coordination is critical to second-generation\n            reforms that seek to develop systems. Though efforts to\n            bring different actors together, promote collaboration, and\n            develop the mechanisms to institutionalize coordination and\n            harmonization are extremely time consuming, they are\n            critical to the success of reforms that aim at building\n            national systems rather than improving individual programs.\n            The Bank's ability to bring actors together, and bridge\n            existing divides, is an important factor for success in the\n            implementation of ambitious reforms to national systems. For\n            institutional reforms, the difficulty mostly resides in the\n            reforms' implementation, rather than in their design or\n            adoption. When reforms aim at bringing institutions to\n            coordinate and articulate the provision of services, the\n            greatest hurdles typically lie in the actual implementation\n            of the reforms. Indeed, getting institutions to agree to a\n            model might be within easy reach, but ensuring they\n            effectively do implement it is much more complex, as\n            incentives typically need to be re-aligned. Strong\n            coordinating institution on the Government's side is\n            necessary when many agencies are involved in the operation.\n            While the Bank team worked with the three implementing\n            agencies, and while one of the institutions took the\n            leadership in the coordination of the project and the\n            reporting, the coordination revealed to be relatively difficult."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Technical Assistance Loan to\n            Support the Second Programmatic Labor Reform and Social\n            Structural Adjustment Loan
