The World Bank's lending and supervision\n            performance is rated highly satisfactory. The\n            Borrower's overall performance is rated satisfactory,\n            despite discontinuities in the Government. Notwithstanding\n            the overall success of the project, there were both positive\n            and negative lessons learned, some on details in design and\n            implementation, and some on a more general level: In-built\n            flexibility of design to deal with inevitable changes in\n            cirsumstances and environment is an important feature. For\n            example, the alignment of the interest spreads to market\n            rates should not only be made possible but be made more or\n            less automatic in this type of product. This would have\n            speeded up the implementation of such changes and thus\n            speeded up disbursements in regard to this project.\n            Flexibility by the Bank in admitting mistakes in the design\n            and excessive bureaucracy in regard to implementation are\n            also essential. Without comprehensively focused and\n            well-organized technical assistance for all components as\n            well as needed improvements in the legal anf regulatory\n            framework, the project would not have succeeded as well as\n            it did or might even have failed to reach its objectives.\n            Generally, the timing of an investment operation to assist\n            the enterprise and financial sectors is key. When\n            governments frequently change, the Bank needs to ensure that\n            reforms are realized up front."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lithuania - Enterprise and Financial Sector\n            Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lithuania -

The\n            project comprises a credit line and a technical assistance\n            component.

The technical assistance component\n            will aim at overcoming deficiencies in: 1) bank regulation\n            and supervision; 2) commercial banks' institutional\n            capacity and appraisal skills; 3) the Government's\n            capacity to reorganize/liquidate inviable state-owned\n            enterprises; and 4) enterprise strategic planning\n            capability.
