The loan was\n            closed at the end of 1988 after an extension of one year.\n            The project appears to have also had an important impact, as\n            a role model, on the Egyptian industrial sector in recent\n            years. After incorporation of Alexandria National Iron and\n            Steel Company El Dikheila (ANSDK), a number of other\n            entities were created under Law 43/74 and its successor Law\n            230/89, in which the Government or publicly owned\n            enterprises held the majority of shares, with a minority\n            foreign partner. But these laws were not the right vehicle\n            for the restructuring of the existing public sector\n            enterprises because the main objective of these legislations\n            was to attract foreign investment in to Egypt. With the\n            promulgation of Law 203/91 which provides a framework for\n            the reorganization of the public enterprise sector into\n            holding and affiliated companies, some 314 enterprises\n            valued at around LE 70 billion, with a total labor force of\n            about 1.1 million have been earmarked for restructuring and\n            privatization. The environmental impact has been well\n            managed. In the course of iron and steel making,\n            considerable quantities of dust, fumes, noxious gases and\n            waste water effluents are generated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - El-Dikheila Reinforcing Bar Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt -

By means of the project,\n            new technology and associated managerial/operational\n            know-how will be introduced into the sector, and through a\n            sector program the Government will formulate and execute\n            necessary policies to promote the continued efficient\n            development of the steel industry in Egypt.
