1. 
Country and Sector Background 
Afghanistan’s economy has performed strongly in the past two and half years with non-drug 
GDP reaching US$4.6 billion in 2003/04 (corresponding to a GDP per capita of about US$200 
per year), an increase of almost 50%, albeit from a very low base.  This is mainly attributable to 
the recovery of agriculture from the drought, revival of economic activities after major conflict 
ended, and the commencement of reconstruction efforts.  This solid performance has been 
supported by the Government’s sound macroeconomic polices -- a highly successful currency 
reform in late 2002, a prudent no overdraft policy prohibiting domestic financing of the budget 
deficit, conservative monetary policy and good management of the exchange rate.  
 
The above achievements not withstanding, the challenges remain enormous in improving 
security throughout the country, re-establishing national unity, developing institutions with a 
capacity to formulate and implement policies, reaching out to provinces to collect revenues and 
deliver services, and implementing the Government’s long-term vision for the future of 
Afghanistan. 
 
The Government’s overall development strategy, as reflected in the National Development 
Framework and the report 
Securing Afghanistan’s Future:  Accomplishments and the Strategic 
Path Forward, 
has as a core principle, the continued development of a well functioning state that 
is accountable to its citizens and able to ensure the delivery of services in an equitable, efficient 
and effective manner.  More specifically the Government has a vision of: 
 
·
an effective public administration that is small and focused on core functions, more 
decentralized, better skilled, equipped and managed, more accountable and more 
representative in terms of gender and ethnicity; and 
Page  2
·
a
budget that is affordable and sustainable on a multi-year basis and enables delegation of 
authority based on strong accountability mechanisms. 
 
To achieve these objectives and build up a modern, transparent and effective public 
administration at central, provincial and district levels, the Government needs to address three 
inter-related issues:  (a) redefining the roles and mandates of line ministries and aligning staffing 
to the new roles; (b) reforming the public sector pay scales to recruit and retain qualified 
professionals and build the core public administration capacity; and (c) effectively utilizing 
technical assistance to support implementation of public administration reforms including 
increasing Government’s absorptive capacity and regulatory power.  
 
While at an early stage, the Government’s Public Administration Reform and Economic 
Management (PAREM) Program is laying down the basis for addressing these issues (Box 1).  It 
is also setting the framework for Government to transition from “buying-in” core public 
administration capacity -- to utilizing technical assistance to kick-start and sustain key functions 
within Government.  These efforts should result in an expansion of absorptive capacity, 
consistent with the experience in other post-conflict countries which has shown that the capacity 
to absorb development assistance increases dramatically after about three years. 
 
Box 1.  PAREM Initiatives to Build a Modern Public Administration and Strengthen Core Functions 
·
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has initiated several measures to consolidate its functions and 
strengthen its capacity.   
·
Systems for preparation of the ordinary and development budgets have been progressively improved 
and updated.   
·
Improvements have been made in budget execution and treasury functions -- including in facilitating 
improvements to payroll processes throughout the country -- with parallel improvements in the DAB 
payment systems.   
·
Efforts at administrative reform are being spearheaded through the 
Priority Reform and Restructuring 
(PRR)
 process whereby staff in departments who undertake administrative reforms receive interim 
additional allowances.   
·
These efforts will help lay the basis for a broad-based program to streamline and rationalize ministries. 
·
A
Lateral Entry program has been established to inject fresh capacity into line ministries -- so as to 
accelerate the reform effort.  
·
A
full pay and grading review is underway with the aim of providing an appropriate pay and incentive 
framework to attract and retain quality staff in Government.
 
·
Technical assistance is being designed with a greater focus on capacity building including developing 
the legal and regulatory frameworks, defining systems based on clearly identified needs, and 
strengthening human resource capacity to operate these systems over time.
 
2. Objectives 
Page  3
The overall objective of the project is to assist the authorities to develop the capacity to 
effectively manage public expenditures in order to achieve satisfactory and sustainable 
development outcomes in Afghanistan.  The project will have a particular focus on enhancing the 
performance of public sector procurement, financial management and accountability systems.   
 
Success in meeting the project’s objective will be measured not only by the delivery of goods, 
services and works, or the provision of accurate accounting, reporting and auditing of budget and 
donor funds, but also by the degree to which government staff in central, line and 
provincial/district ministries are managing core financial management, procurement and audit 
systems themselves.  
 
3. 
Rationale for Bank Involvement 
The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (IRoA) has requested that IDA prepare a repeater project in 
order to provide follow on assistance to the program of support for public administration under 
the First and Second Emergency Public Administration Projects (EPAP I and II).  EPAP I and II 
were core elements of IDA’s first and second Transitional Strategies in Afghanistan.  They 
provided the underpinning fiduciary arrangements for the whole IDA portfolio through putting in 
place emergency capacity in financial management, procurement and audit.  This enabled IDA to 
reactivate operations with Afghanistan very quickly in the post conflict period.  In addition, 
IDA’s early support in these core fiduciary areas has allowed the Government to quickly build 
credibility with donors as to their ability to manage donor and own resources in an effective 
manner.  This is reflected in the increasing numbers of donors prepared to channel funds either 
directly through the Treasury or via ARTF.   
 
In order to maintain and expand upon the progress already made under EPAP I and II, the IRoA 
has requested IDA to prepare a repeater project as quickly as possible.  The 
Third Public 
Administration Capacity Building Project (PACBP3) 
would continue to provide technical 
assistance for operational support in procurement, financial management and audit.  However, 
the Government has requested that IDA’s engagement in the next phase be broadened and 
deepened with an increased focus on: 
 
(i) 
developing the regulatory and institutional framework in these core fiduciary 
management areas;  
(ii) 
further systems development that is based on a full understanding of medium-term 
requirements and the country’s implementation capacity; and 
(iii) 
capacity building and training in the central agencies, but also in line ministries and 
the provinces so that staff can maintain and operate systems independently and 
effectively. 
 
IDA’s continued engagement in this area is essential to the Government’s overall objectives of 
building transparent, efficient and effective governance arrangements.  The experience under 
EPAP I and II positions IDA to embark on the next phase of assistance with a broader 
perspective and understanding of the existing government capacity in these core functions and 
with a realistic appreciation of the possible pace of expansion and development.

A
repeater operation is judged to be the best instrument for building upon the experiences gained 
so far and to allow for a transition to a program of medium-term capacity building within 
Government.  The project will continue to support the core areas covered under EPAP I and II 
but will extend capacity building efforts in a more systematic way throughout Government, 
including to line ministries and provinces, and within an institutional framework that lays the 
basis for long term sustainability.

6. Implementation 
The project will be implemented by the Ministry of Finance, the Afghanistan Research and 
Development Services and the Control and Audit Office. 
 
7. Sustainability 
The project is aiming to build capacity within Government in key procurement and fiduciary 
areas so that government staff can progressively take over key functions to adequate standards.  
It will do this by combining continued operational support in key areas with focused attention on 
(i) the establishment and implementation of sound regulatory and control frameworks for budget 
execution and fiscal reporting, and public sector procurement; (ii) further development of core 
Page  6
systems for budget execution, government accounting, and internal and external audits; (iii) 
development of human resources to effectively operate the systems; and (iv) operational 
performance (technical efficiency) of the fiduciary management functions.  This multi-pronged 
strategy is designed to promote sustainability of the support provided. 
 
8.  Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector 
IDA provided funding for a first and second Emergency Public Administration Project (EPAP 1 
and II) in April 2002 and June 2003, respectively.  EPAP I put in place emergency capacity in 
procurement, financial management and audit in order to facilitate the use of donor and own 
resources for urgent reconstruction and development efforts.  EPAP II provided supplementary 
support for the financial management and procurement contracts funded under EPAP I as well as 
financing for technical assistance to support the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil 
Service Commission with implementation of the Government’s Public Administration Reform 
program.   
 
A
mid-term review was conducted of the fiduciary components (procurement, financial 
management and audit) of EPAP I and EPAP II in early 2004.  The review concluded that the 
projects had made significant progress in achieving their objectives (Box 2), particularly in the 
context of Afghanistan’s extremely limited capacity and engagement with the international 
community over the last twenty years. 
 
Box 2.  Key Achievements under EPAP I and II 
 
·
As of early September 2004, the Procurement Unit has processed 196 contracts with a value of US$382m 
with a further 80 contracts in progress worth US$337m.  A draft procurement law has been prepared and 
between 110 and 150 procurement staff from line ministries have received training in basic and specific 
procurement rules.   
 
·
In the Treasury, a functioning computerized general ledger and payments system is in place with some 
networking of components; significant improvements have been made in cash management, grant 
management, bank reconciliations, revenue recording and the recording of budget appropriations and 
allotments. 
 
·
The Auditor General has completed the audits of the financial statements of ARTF, the state budget and an 
increasing number of IDA and ARTF funded projects. 
 
The review also concluded that continued operational assistance would be necessary to maintain 
standards of fiduciary control.  At the same time, the Government considers it crucial to 
progressively transition from “buying-in” capacity to developing it within Government.  In 
response to this, IDA and the Government have had extensive dialogue during the last six 
months on a coherent medium-term public expenditure management reform and capacity 
building strategy that addresses legislative, regulatory and institutional reforms and development 
of management control systems and human resources.  The Government has requested IDA 
assistance in the implementation of such a strategy.  The proposed project is prepared in this 
context.
