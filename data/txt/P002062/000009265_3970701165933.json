    Report (ICR) of the First Multi-State Agricultural\n            Development Project (MSADP 1). The objectives of the project\n            were to (a) increase food production and incomes of small\n            farmers; (b) apply flexible, phased approaches to\n            development with initial emphasis on implementing\n            well-proven components geared to agricultural potential and\n            within the financing and managerial capacity of the states,\n            while embarking on an intensified program of adaptive\n            on-farm agricultural research; (c) assist the states in\n            rationalizing current activities through a move to\n            reorganize and commercialize input distribution and develop\n            a smaller but more effective extension service; and (d)\n            prepare for the transfer of a greater share of the\n            responsibility for future project appraisal and supervision\n            to Nigerian institutions. Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (a) management\n            stability and the proper support of the Agricultural\n            Development Project Executive Committee (ADPECs) are\n            critical for smooth project implementation; (b) counterpart\n            funding need to be consistent and timely to avoid cost\n            escalation and allow full use of loan funds; (c) farmers and\n            communities are willing to take ownership and be trained for\n            the proper operation and maintenance of essential support\n            facilities and services as was done, in some instances, in\n            infrastructure investments, especially village water\n            supplies; (d) effective and sustainable institutional\n            development is a gradual process and cannot be hastened; and\n            (e) managing pooled loan funds in multi-state projects\n            require strict control over commitments by competing\n            implementing agencies."}, "docdt": "1996-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
