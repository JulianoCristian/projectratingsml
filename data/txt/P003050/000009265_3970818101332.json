the administration\n            and training capabilities of Office des Routes (OR), the\n            public agency in charge of the main road network. To this\n            end, the project would support key components of OR's\n            1986-88 comprehensive highway program and would iclude: (i)\n            routine and periodic maintenance of the main roads\n            (including ferry operations) through the provision of\n            equipment, spare parts, materials and supplies; (ii) bridge\n            repair and maintenance; (iii) construction of access ramps\n            for ferries; (iv) strengthening OR's management through\n            technical assistance, consulting services and office\n            equipment; and (v) training."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
