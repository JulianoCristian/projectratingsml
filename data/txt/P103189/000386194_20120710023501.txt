           AFRICA — AFRICA STOCKPILES PROGRAMME – PROJECT 1
                            REPUBLIC OF MALI
                        P103189 - GEF TF057678 MLI

                              Second Restructuring Paper

1. The Closing Date for Mali GEF grant (TF057678), which is part of the second phase
   of a regional APL (Africa Stockpiles Programme – Project 1 (ASP-P1) P103189),
   will be extended from June 30, 2012 until December 31, 2012. This will be the third
   and last extension of the project for a cumulative total of 28 months.

2. Delays occurred during the first extension of 22 months mainly because: (i) an
   abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan was required and its preparation took time and
   delayed the disposal activities of obsolete pesticides; and (ii) the procurement of a
   disposal company for the cleanup of obsolete pesticides took longer than expected
   including the finalization of the bid evaluation report, as well as the approval and
   signing of the contract which had to be done at the Minister level given the size of the
   contract. Then, the Project was interrupted following the military coup of March 22,
   2012 and the suspension of operations in accordance with OP/BP 7.30 (Dealing with
   de facto Government) which is still in effect. As a result, no withdrawal application
   has been processed since March 22, 2012 and project implementation has been
   interrupted, until further notice. Furthermore, the six month extension would align the
   closing dates of Mali GEF Trust Fund with the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (see
   paragraph 4 below).

3. The key activities progressed well until the military coup and the project had
   achieved measurable impacts to date.

       a. Regarding the disposal component, a nation-wide inventory of obsolete
          pesticides has been conducted and compilation of a database established;
          Country Environmental and Social Assessment and an Environmental
          Management Plan has been prepared and disclosed; soil remediation and clean
          up activities in highly polluted sites have been conducted; the procurement of
          a disposal contractor has been finalized and the contract for the disposal of
          600 tons signed in October 2011; the disposal equipment was shipped and the
          launch of disposal activities, initially planned on March 26, 2012, was
          postponed until further notice after the military coup and suspension of
          operations.

       b. Regarding the prevention component, a national prevention plan has been
          developed and a focus group established to supervise the implementation of
          the plan; a legal review of Mali’s legislative and regulatory framework for
          pesticide management has been undertaken; and stakeholders have received
          extensive capacity building in pesticide management. With the support of
          participating ASP international Non Government Organizations (NGOs)
          (World Wildlife Fund, Pesticides Action Network-UK and Pesticides Action
          Network-Africa) and the national NGO network, awareness campaigns and
                                            5
           outreach programs targeted at relevant stakeholders have been undertaken to
           ensure awareness of the danger of improper pesticide’s management. There
           has been significant improvement of civil society capacity to actively promote
           sustainable pest management and engage in pesticide issues, including
           monitoring health and environmental impacts, advocacy and promotion of
           relevant international conventions.

4. The Project is a US$ 2.55 million GEF grant, part of a horizontal APL (which
   includes also Morocco and Tunisia); the disbursement stands at 91 % percent and is
   expected to reach, if the resumption of operations takes place early enough, 100
   percent by the end of the project following the completion of the safeguarding and
   disposal contract and other outstanding activities. The project is also co-financed by
   the ASP Multi-Donor Trust Fund for an amount of US$ 3.98 million for which the
   closing date is already December 31, 2012, The MDTF is used to co-finance the
   disposal contract and is also expected to be fully disbursed by closing. Co-financing
   is also provided by the Government of Mali, the Food and Agriculture Organization
   (FAO), the Netherlands, and the French Fund for Global Environment (FFEM) which
   will be entirely used by closing.

5. The Task Team confirms that the requirements of OP/BP13.30 (Closing Dates) have
   been met, specifically: (i) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (ii) the
   performance of the Borrower has been satisfactory despite difficult circumstances
   related to the triggering of OP 7.30; (iii) the team has received an action plan from
   government/provided an updated procurement plan to complete the project within the
   revised closing date; and (iv) there are no outstanding audits, or IFRs for the
   Loan/credit/grant.

6. Project performance is currently rated Satisfactory for IP and Moderately Satisfactory
   for DO for the Mali GEF grant.

7. The proposed extension of closing date is necessary to allow time for the possible
   resumption of operations depending on the conclusions and recommendations of the
   OP 7.30 assessment mission scheduled in June 2012, and the finalization of all
   planned priority project activities interrupted in March 2012.

8. EA category A is being maintained and the project is compliant with all safeguard
   requirements. The project has no outstanding audit reports.
