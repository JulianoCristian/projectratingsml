To date, this program\n            is the only international and inter-agency initiative that\n            has as its major function the cleaning and disposal of\n            obsolete pesticides in an entire region. The project may\n            cause many negative impacts including: a) The possible\n            evacuation of affected populations; b) The emanation of\n            odors and toxic fumes; c) The emission of dust; d)\n            Respiratory damage to inhabitants; e) Contamination of soil,\n            vegetation, air and water resources in case of large leaks;\n            f) The risk of explosion, fire, burns and poisoning, and; g)\n            Nuisance to local residents (smoke, odors, dust). During the\n            implementation of the measures recommended complaints may\n            arise and delay the process. Also, to address these\n            situations, several procedures for resolving disputes and\n            arbitration misunderstanding exist including: a) use\n            amicable discussions with well-known individuals; b)\n            recourse through arbitration at the municipality level; and\n            3) the courts."}, "docdt": "2010-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
