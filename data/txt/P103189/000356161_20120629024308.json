management of personnel involved and a plan of information\n            and communication (on the site and with other parties).\n            Negative impacts come as a result of injuries and

operations, good\n            planning of operations, wearing protective equipment and\n            daily checks at the end of operations, are measures whose\n            implementation will ensure
