                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.     This Restructuring Paper responds to the request of the Government of the United
Republic of Tanzania (URT) and introduces the following changes in the Africa
Stockpiles Program – Project 1 in Tanzania (ASP; P103189, Grant TF056693):

              Reallocation of proceeds to increase the budget for disposal activities,
               which is critical to meet two of the three Project Development Objective
               (PDO)-level indicators; and
              Extension from December 31, 2012 to May 31, 2013 of the project closing
               date to continue the disposal of the obsolete pesticides (OP) and associated
               waste which is being carried out by VEOLIA ES Limited of the United
               Kingdom under a contract in the amount US$3,402,144.28.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      The project has made important progress, with US$3,358,085.45 (approximately
49 percent) of project funds disbursed as of November 27, 2012 and the vast majority of
the remaining funds committed to a single contract for hazardous waste disposal, an
activity which is now well-underway. Important achievements have been made on all
core activities, including disposal and prevention. In order to ensure PDO indicators are
met, remaining activities were reviewed during the June 2012 Implementation Support
Mission to focus only on those tasks directly linked with the PDO. The current project
closing date is December 31, 2012.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

There are two proposed changes:

   Reallocation

3.      Based on the last supervision mission, the Government of the URT has decided to
request a reallocation to increase the budget for disposal of OP. It is proposed to re-
allocate US$170,000, US$285,000 and US$90,000 from categories 3 (Consultant
Services), 5 (Training and Workshops) and 6 (Operating Costs) respectively to category 4
(Disposal Services) in the amount of US$460,000, and category 1 (Goods) in the amount
of US$85,000. Please see specific details on reallocation in Annex 1.




                                            1
   Closing Date

4.      The proposed extension will extend the closing date of the project from December
31, 2012 to May 31, 2013 which will be the third extension of the project. The first
extension was granted on July 1, 2010 and extended the project closing date by 18
months from June 30, 2010 to December 31, 2011. The second extension was granted on
August 9, 2011 and extended the project closing date by 12 months from December 31,
2011 to December 31, 2012. With the inclusion of the proposed extension, the cumulative
extension period will be 35 months. Please see specific details on extension of closing
date in Annex 2.

2.       The project has made important progress, with US$3,358,085.45 (approximately
49 percent) of project funds disbursed as of November 27, 2012 and the vast majority of
the remaining funds now committed. Important achievements have been made on core
activities, particularly regarding the signing of the disposal contract – the completion of
which is critical for achieving two of the three PDO-level indicators. In order to ensure
PDO-level indicators are met, remaining activities have been reviewed during the last
Implementation Support Mission in June 2012 to focus only on those tasks directly linked
with the PDO. The current project closing date is December 31, 2012 and it is proposed
to extend it to May 31, 2013 (see Annex 2).


3.     The proposed reallocation is necessary to optimize project operations for the
remaining project implementation period. Based on the last supervision mission, the
Government of Tanzania has decided to request a reallocation to increase the budget for
disposal of pesticides, which is critical to meet two of three PDO-levels indicators
(Quantity of inventoried publicly-held obsolete pesticides and associated waste disposed
of and/or safeguarded; and Quantity of inventoried heavily contaminated soil disposed of
and/or safeguarded). Most importantly, it is proposed to re-allocate US$170,000,
US$285,000 and US$90,000 from categories 3 (Consultant Services), 5 (Training and
Workshops) and 6 (Operating Costs) respectively to category 4 (Disposal Services) in the
amount of US$460,000, and category 1 (Goods) in the amount of US$85,000.

                               Extension of Closing Date

      AFRICA STOCKPILES PROGRAMME – PROJECT 1 IN TANZANIA
                            P103189

1.      Based on a request from the Government of the URT, it is proposed that the
project’s closing date be extended from December 31, 2012 to May 31, 2013 to allow for
the completion of a single contract. This contract, in the amount of US$3,402,144.28 with
Veolia ES (UK) Limited, is for the disposal of OP and associated waste. An extension of
the project will allow for the contractor to complete the shipping and disposal of all
stocks, and receive certificates of disposal from the incineration plants in the UK and
Poland. This will also ensure that the Project meets at least two out of three PDO-level
indicators. Without such an extension, the project would close with at least 80 percent of
the target waste in transit, or awaiting final disposal in the incineration plants in the UK
and Poland. This extension will be the third extension of the project’s closing date for a
cumulative period of 35 months.
