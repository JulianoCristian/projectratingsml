The Closing Date for Mali\n            Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant, which is part of\n            the second phase of a regional project, will be extended\n            from June 30, 2012 until December 31, 2012. This will be the\n            third and last extension of the project for a cumulative\n            total of 28 months. Delays occurred during the first\n            extension of 22 months mainly because: (i) an abbreviated\n            resettlement action plan was required and its preparation\n            took time and delayed the disposal activities of obsolete\n            pesticides; and (ii) the procurement of a disposal company\n            for the cleanup of obsolete pesticides took longer than\n            expected including the finalization of the bid evaluation\n            report, as well as the approval and signing of the contract\n            which had to be done at the minister level given the size of\n            the contract. Then, the project was interrupted following\n            the military coup of March 22, 2012 and the suspension of\n            operations in accordance with which is still in effect. As a\n            result, no withdrawal application has been processed since\n            March 22, 2012 and project implementation has been\n            interrupted, until further notice. The extension of closing\n            date is necessary to allow time for the possible resumption\n            of operations depending on the conclusions and\n            recommendations of the Operational Procedures (OP) 7.30\n            assessment mission scheduled in June 2012, and the\n            finalization of all planned priority project activities\n            interrupted in March 2012."}, "docdt": "2012-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
