                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Previously, ASP-Tanzania specific implementation status had been reported in the ISRs under the overall ASP project code (i.e., P075776), which was closed in June 2012.

                         ASP-Tanzania is expected to close on May 31. It is expected to achieve its PDO targets. Specifically, as of May 3, 2013:

                         - ASP-Tanzania has shipped and/or safeguarded its inventoried obsolete pesticides and associated waste, and contaminated soils, and the waste disposal contractor (Veolia) is
                         confident that all disposal certificates for those wastes will be issued by the Closing Date. Given efforts to reallocate funds to maximize waste disposal, the project will result in a total
                         amount of disposed waste that is higher than originally planned.

                         - Regarding prevention activities, ASP-Tanzania has also met its target by developing a comprehensive strategy for dealing with future stocks of obsolete pesticides and associated
                         wastes. These activities include draft legislation for a Plant Protection Act and Pesticide Management Act (version for both Mainland and Zanzibar), which has recently been
                         approved by the Cabinet on both sides of the Union.
                         - Action Plans for container management, Integrated Pest Management and pesticide management have been finalized and approved by the project Steering Committee.

                         This is the last ISR for this project. An ICR is being prepared for the overall ASP which will draw lessons from activities implemented in each country. The PDO and overall design of
                         the ASP-Tanzania was considered ambitious and the project was restructured in June 2011 which revised the PDO and indicators. Although the current PDO and indicators are
                         expected to be achieved by the end of the project, there were numerous implementation challenges resulting in delays which required extending the project closing date multiple
                         times with a cumulative extension of 35 months. Detailed analysis of design relevance, implementation performances, efficiency and lessons will be presented in the ICR.
