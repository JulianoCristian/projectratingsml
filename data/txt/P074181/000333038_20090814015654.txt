large program of privatization of state owned enterprises (SOEs), (c) set the foundations
for overhauling labor market regulations in the future, (d) increase access to investment
capital, and (e) promote the generation of knowledge and innovation, the adoption of new
technologies, and upgrading the skills of the labor force.

            1. PROGRAM CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background. Employment growth and long-term macroeconomic
stability are key policy challenges for Turkey. After suffering a major macroeconomic
crisis in 2001, the Turkish economy grew at an average of 6.8 % in the period 2002-2007.
Output increased more than a third in this period--the strongest growth performance
among OECD members. Growth also reduced poverty significantly. The reversal in
economic performance was largely the result of five factors: first, broad political stability
that helped assure policy continuity during that period; second, a macroeconomic policy
framework centered on fiscal discipline and an independent monetary policy, which led
to reduced public sector deficits, lower public debt levels, and helped anchor inflationary
expectations; third, an improved investment climate associated with the implementation
of a number key structural reforms (social security reform, financial sector reform,
energy sector reforms, and an ambitious privatization program); fourth, a global
economic environment of high liquidity benefiting emerging markets; and fifth, Turkey
signaled commitment to improved policies by pursuing EU membership. On the latter,
the government's reforms geared towards raising competitiveness, improving financial
intermediation, and expanding employment opportunities, which are being supported by
the Bank, are fully consistent with the Lisbon Agenda.

After the recovery from the 2001 crisis, the country started addressing second and third
generation policy issues. Against a background of low employment generation, declining
employment ratios, high informality, and comparatively high unemployment, the
authorities were determined to sustain rapid growth and to improve the quality of life of
its citizens. In 2007, the overall employment rate for ages between 15 and 64 in Turkey
was 45.8 percent, significantly lower than the 65.4 percent average in EU-27 countries
and far from the Lisbon target of 70 percent by 2010. Unemployment and informality
rates were comparatively high as well at around 10 and 47 %, respectively. Employment
generation did not occur hand in hand with the growing economy partly due to the
massive structural change the country is undergoing, with agriculture shedding large
quantities of labor, and partly because of the lack of flexibility in the labor market. In
response, the authorities adopted--and are implementing--a comprehensive long term
program to modernize the economy: the 9th Development Plan (NDP). The NDP's broad
policy vision is "a Turkey which grows in stability, shares her income more equitably, is
competitive at a global scale, transforms into an information society and has completed
the stage of legal harmonization for EU membership." In order to achieve this vision, the
NDP comprises five "development axes" or strategic areas of action, namely: (a)
Increasing Competitiveness, (b) Increasing Employment, (c) Strengthening Human
Development and Social Solidarity, (c) Ensuring Regional Development and (d)
Increasing Quality and Efficiency in Public Services.

Rationale for Bank Assistance. In line with the major challenges stated in the NDP, the
Competitiveness and Employment Development Policy Loan (CEDPL) was designed to
assist the Government in sustaining growth, increasing competitiveness and generating



                                             1

more jobs. The CEDPL program was fully aligned with the NDP (Table 1). The CEDPL
was also expected to contribute to the achievements of the outcomes outlined in the 2003
CAS and the 2005 CAS Progress Report (CAS PR), including: (a) making the economy
more resilient to crises that disproportionately affect the most vulnerable; (b) making the
business environment more attractive with increased emphasis in the knowledge
economy, (c) contributing to sustainable economic growth that is critical to pull many of
the poor out of poverty; and (d) promoting human development to create opportunities
for the poor, including more and better jobs.

Reflecting the complexity and nature of reform processes, while designed as a free-
standing operation, the CEDPL was embedded in a programmatic framework. More
specifically, while the original intention was to prepare this operation as the first in a
programmatic series, due to the political uncertainty at that time (to be discussed below),
the Government and the World Bank agreed to proceed with it as a stand-alone operation
in order to preserve the policy dialogue with the authorities while still acknowledging
possible emerging risks to the sustainability of the reform effort and the achievement of
the development objectives.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators.

Based on the Program Matrix embedded in the CEDPL program document (See Annex
2), the following objectives and indicators were identified for the CEDPL:

Objectives

      Maintaining an enabling macroeconomic framework.
      Improving further the investment climate.
      Setting the foundations for overhauling labor market regulations as a way to
          increase employment
      Increasing access to capital and credit
      Promoting the generation of knowledge and innovation, the adoption of new
          technologies, and upgrading of labor force skills

     Key indicators

     Success in reaching the objectives mentioned above was expected to be gauged by the
     behavior of the following indicators:1

           Macroeconomic stability:

               o Inflation (CPI)

               o Current account deficit

               o Public debt ratios

           Investment climate:


               o FDI flows (in US$)

               o FDI flows (% of GDP)




1Because some of the indicators were defined in a vague manner, the team retrofitted the results framework. However,
this does not preclude a proper assessment of whether outcomes were achieved.

1.3 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

In line with the objectives ­and indicators--mentioned before, the CEDPL supported the
authorities' program in five policy areas:

     The maintenance of an adequate macroeconomic framework, such as the
        framework that had underpinned the rapid economic growth that had begun in
        2002.

     Improving the investment climate to foster the investment and productivity
        increases required to maintain rapid growth and generate sufficient formal sector
        jobs to absorb the large supply of labor resulting from the country's demographic
        dynamics and structural transformation.

     Laying the foundations for changing labor market regulations--including a
        diagnosis of labor markets and the discussion of policy options for such delicate
        reforms.

     Consolidating the soundness of the financial sector and increasing access to
        investment credit and other forms of investment capital.


                                             4

    Increasing the capacity of the private sector to innovate, adopt new
       technologies and quality standards as well as a diagnosis of the policies needed
       for endowing the labor force with better skills, with a view of augmenting
       competitiveness over the medium and long.


            2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 Program Performance

To support measures in the previously mentioned areas, CEDPL included the following
prior, core policy actions:

    The government maintained a satisfactory macroeconomic framework. Bank
       staff found the existing macroeconomic framework to be satisfactory. IMF Article
       IV consultations and the sixth review of the Stand-by arrangement had been
       completed successfully in May 2007.

    The Borrower had privatized state owned companies and sold state-owned
       assets with total privatization revenues amounting to the equivalent of US$17.7
       billion during 2005 and the first six months of 2006 (compared to $6 billion in the
       five years prior), under transparent competitive process acceptable to the Bank
       and with due regard to applicable environmental regulations. These efforts
       were aimed at minimizing state involvement in economic activities, relieving the
       financial burden on the national budget, increasing competition, and developing
       domestic capital markets.

    The maximum corporate income tax (CIT) bracket had been reduced from
       about 30 to 20 percent of taxable profits and CIT allowances have been
       eliminated. CIT rates had been high and complex. Previous CIT investment
       allowances distorted relative prices of capital and labor in ways which provided
       artificial incentives to adopt capital intensive and labor saving technologies. The
       comparatively high CIT rates increased incentives for informality, decreased
       incentives to hire workers, and, everything else the same, affected FDI negatively.

    The authorities had completed successfully a functional restructuring of the
       tax administration framework including: (a) reform of the local tax offices; (b)
       establishment of a revenue administration responsible for tax collection and with
       direct authority over provincial and local collection offices; and (c) reforms to the
       Large Tax Payer Unit aimed at improving collection efficiency while reducing
       compliance costs for the firms targeted had been completed.

    In order to bring better access to investment capital in an environment of financial
       sector stability by reducing state ownership in the banking sector, the authorities
       had completed an Initial Public Offering (IPO) for about 25 percent of the
       outstanding shares of Halk Bank.


                                             5

     A new law on residential real estate mortgaging had been enacted. The law
        was drafted following international best practices with the aim of increasing
        access to housing, boosting investment in construction, and helping banks manage
        their risks in financing the sector.

     The Government had taken steps to improve protection of Intellectual Property
        Rights (IPRs) and facilitate patent application by enacting a law on adoption of
        the Agreement on Amendment to the European Patent Convention was
        enacted.

     TURKAK (Turkish Accreditation Agency) had been accepted as a signatory
        of European co-operation for Accreditation - Multilateral Agreement (EA-
        MU) in the areas of calibration, testing, quality system certification and inspection
        and as a signatory of the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation ­
        Mutual Agreement (ILAC-MRA) in the areas of testing and calibration. This
        measure was part of an effort to improve quality standards and thus increase
        productivity through simplification and rationalization of production and
        distribution processes.

There were other actions or elements included in the program which were not part of the
core prior actions but nevertheless played an important role in the outcome of the CEDPL.
Among them:

     IMF Stand-by supported program in place until May 2008.
     The top Personal Income Tax (PIT) rate reduced from 40 to 35 %. Taxation of
        wage and non-wage income unified. Number of tax brackets reduced from 5 to 4.
     A Review of existing business regulations and licensing requirements was
        undertaken.
     Curricula for five educational programs were reformed to reflect needed skills and
        competencies and have been implemented for all students in 9th and 10th grades in
        9th and 10th grades in 2006/07.
     To consolidate the soundness of the financial sector, the Banking Regulation and
        Supervision Agency (BRSA) published and implemented 24 regulations required
        for the effective implementation of the 2005 Banking Law.
     Credit history evaluation and performance disclosure mechanisms were put in
        place.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Government's commitment. Despite the difficult political environment when the CEDPL
was designed and negotiated (see below), the government successfully implemented all
prior actions, some of which were socially unpopular with selected organized groups (i.e.
privatization of state-owned companies). This testifies to the government's commitment
to its reform program. Moreover, the structural reforms completed and supported under
the operation were by their nature difficult to reverse (privatization, mortgage law, tax
administration), thus limiting the risk of backtracking reforms. Finally, the reforms


                                              6

supported by CEDPL were fully consistent with the Government's own priorities in the
areas of competitiveness and employment, thus reflecting a high degree of ownership on
the Government's part.

Political environment. The CEDPL was negotiated just before the Parliamentary and
Presidential elections of 2007 which had created a challenging environment for the
government to implement socially difficult reforms, such as measures to increase the
labor market flexibility. Labor market reforms were nevertheless implemented as part of
the CEDPL 2 operation.

Analytical work. The 1993-2004 Country Assistance Evaluation found that little formal
economic and sector analysis was carried out up to the late 1990s. Thereafter, the
economic and sector analysis have become a larger part of the Bank`s program. This
approach has increased the effectiveness of the Bank involvement. As a result, CEDPL,
and the specific measures supported by it, were informed by a large number of analytical
work that contributed--and continues to contribute--to nourish a permanent and stable
policy dialogue in the areas supported by the reform. Specifically, the Bank provided
analytical support to the government's program through extensive economic and sector
work on the program areas of the CEDPL, including through the: (a) Labor Market Study
(2006), which identified flexibility and effective social protection as key policy elements
for creating more and better jobs; (b) Country Economic Memorandum (2006), which

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization.

      Overall design. Given that this was a stand-alone operation, efforts were made to
         identify outcomes that could be measured shortly after program implementation.
         In this regard, the identified indicators were for the most part proxies for longer-
         term outcomes sought by the authorities. Moreover, the Bank team acknowledged
         that the attribution of overall development results to reforms supported by
         CEDPL needed to be fully assessed over time. A more meaningful measure of the
         program's success would therefore only be possible at the end of a prospective
         CEDPL 3, when the (CEDPL) program series is completed. Some indicators
         therefore can only fully assessed by then.2


2For example, indicators related to labor force skills (e.g., number of science and engineering graduates
and post-doctoral fellows) and innovation (number of ISO 9001 certified firms and number of accredited
testing and calibration laboratories) are linked to long-term horizon decisions by economic agents and thus
only adjust to policy changes after some time lag. Short term impacts are marginal at best.

     Other design issues. Indicators were properly identified but some of them lacked
        specific targets and baselines, and at times were loosely defined. This made the
        task of assessing success unnecessarily difficult. Specifically, the supervision
        team needed to retrofit some of the indicators to allow for a proper evaluation of
        outcomes. To a large degree, this issue has been addressed during the preparation
        of a follow-on operation.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

The Second Competitiveness and Employment Loan (CEDPL 2) was approved by
the Bank's Board in December 2008. CEDPL 2 builds on CEDPL and supports specific
advances in the implementation of the government's competitiveness and employment
agenda to a new stage. CEDPL 2 provides continuity to the CEDPL as evidenced by the
implementation of key measures aimed at improving the investment climate, deepening
capital markets and the enhancing employment opportunities:

     Enactment of the new research and development law, reform of customs
        administration, amendment to the Land Registry Law and satisfactory progress
        of the privatization program. These measures will improve the investment
        climate thus contributing to raising exports and FDI;

     Approval of the new Insurance Law and enactment of regulations to improve
        corporate governance in the capital markets to help mobilizing domestic and
        foreign savings; and

     Enactment of the first phase of the labor market reform and advances in defining
        competency-based occupation standards as part of the broader strategy to
        improve employment opportunities

                                3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives, design and implementation of the CEDPL remain highly relevant
with regard to Turkey's and the Bank's development objectives. While Turkey has
made significant progress in putting in place a policy environment conducive of higher
investment, productivity, employment and growth, the country still faces policy
challenges in areas that are key to improving its investment climate, specifically in
reducing the cost of starting a business, raising recovery rates from bankruptcy, reducing
skills mismatches, and making its labor market more flexible. In this connection, the five
policy pillars supported by the CEDPL have, if anything, gained importance in light of
the global crisis. Moreover, employment growth--particularly formal employment--is
likely to fall in the period to come, which would require a more determined effort to keep
medium-term labor market reforms on track, specifically regarding increasing labor
market flexibility and enhancing the protection of workers.

The CEDPL programmatic series is the corner stone of the Bank's support to the
overall structural reform program of Turkey. The policy actions supported under this


                                              8

program are directly linked to five of the development objectives spelled out in the CPS:
(i) maintaining macroeconomic stability and sustaining economic growth, (ii) improving
the investment climate and decreasing the informality of the economy, (iii) increasing
labor market flexibility and improving skills, (iv) maintaining soundness of the financial
system, and improving access to finance, and (v) enhancing technology adoption and
innovation; The outcomes pursued by the CEDPL series fit into the broader results
framework for the CPS.

CEDPL became the first in a series of operations designed to support the
Government's competitiveness and employment policy reform agenda embedded in
the NDP. The CEDPL 2 approved by the Bank's Board in December 2008 not only
builds on the reforms supported by CEDPL, but also envisages Bank support for the next
steps in the implementation of Turkey's competitiveness and employment agenda under a
possible CEDPL 3. In this connection, the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) discussed
by the Board of Executive Directors in February 2008 is fully integrated with--and maps
all planned Bank activities into--the Government's NDP. The CEDPL series therefore
will continue to be an important instrument of the CPS.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Through the measures supported by the CEDPL series, Turkey has made significant
progress in putting in place a policy environment conducive of higher investment,
productivity, employment and growth. Major achievements in reducing the role of the
state in economic activity (privatization) and reducing distortions (lower tax pressures)
have made the economy more attractive for investment, particularly FDI. In that context,
the overall results of the CEDPL as measured by the behavior of the identified indicators
are broadly positive. Nevertheless, economic performance since the approval of CEDPL
has been--and will continue to be--affected by global events beyond the authorities'
control, most prominently: (a) a surge in commodity prices that lasted until mid-2008;
and (b) the ramifications of the global credit crisis that started with the collapse of the
housing sector in the United States. The flexibility built in the design of the CEDPL
series as a programmatic series will nevertheless help shape the policies to be supported
by the Bank in the future in the areas of employment generation and raising
competitiveness.

A significant number of results indicators associated with the key objectives of CEDPL
were identified (see Table II). 13 out of 19 indicators achieved results in line with the
targets:

     Policies to sustain macroeconomic stability were anchored to the IMF Stand-
        by arrangement that expired in May 2008. The balance of payments current
        account deficit and the level of public debt declined in 2007, and most likely in
        2008 as well. Inflation, which fell to 8.4 % in 2007 (from 9.7 % in 2006),
        increased again in 2008, mostly as a result of the surge in oil and food prices that
        reached a peak in mid-2008.
     There was an improvement in the investment climate as measured by key
        related indicators. FDI flows continued at high levels, though declined slightly



                                            9

      in terms of GDP. The significant package of privatization operations had an
      immediate effect on microeconomic performance, with the proportion of GDP
      attributed to SOEs production falling from 1.9 % of GDP in 2006 to 1.5 % in
      2007. Perhaps more importantly, the amount of budgetary transfers to SOEs fell
      to a low of 0.34 % of GDP in 2007. Informal employment has declined in relative
      terms by about 4 percentage points from 2006 to 2007. Legal framework to start a
      business was improved to reduce the time needed to collect necessary documents
      and fulfill other requirements: the number of days to register a business was
      reduced from 9 to 6 days from 2006 to 20073. In terms of operating a business,
      incentives to reduce informality were introduced. The reduction in the CIT rate
      led to an increase in the share of CIT in overall tax revenues from 8.2 % to 9.2 %.
    Employment indicators point to only limited progress in labor market
      conditions. The unemployment rate remained unchanged in 2007 from 2006
      (about 10 %) and actually increased in 2008 to 12.3 percent as the economy began
      to suffer the effects of the global crisis. The challenge is formidable as the labor
      force in Turkey grows by about 4 % per year. A positive development was the
      approval by Parliament of a Labor Market Reform package in 2008. The Law
      included a 5 percentage point cut in employer's contributions for pensions,
      disability, and death insurance which now will be paid by Treasury. This reduces
      taxes on labor and, therefore, has a positive impact on employment. It also favors
      formal employment.
    Financial markets have deepened despite international conditions. Despite the
      international housing market collapse, the passage of the mortgage law had an
      immediate positive effect on housing finance, which went from less than 3
      percent of GDP in 2006 to about 4 percent of GDP in 2008. Nevertheless,
      mortgage finance is still below comparable countries (In Mexico, for example, it
      represents 16% of GDP). Also, banking prudential indicators continue to show the
      relative strength of the domestic financial market, with capital adequacy ratios
      exceeding regulatory requirements by a large margin. Asset quality deteriorated
      very marginally despite a significant expansion in credit. The recent slowdown in
      the economy, however, is bound to affect more the quality of loan portfolios in
      the near future.
    Promotion of knowledge and innovation is working. The Law on Adoption of
      the Agreement on Amendment to the European Patent Convention was enacted
      and the Turkish Accreditation Agency was accepted as a signatory of the
      European co-operation for Accreditation. These improvements in the regulatory
      framework led to an increase in number of patents of about 10 percent in 2007,
      with a somewhat smaller increase in 2008. Funding of research and development
      by the industrial sector, that is, by the private sector, also increased, reaching
      47 % of the total expenditures in research and development.

  3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

  Rating: Satisfactory

  The development objectives of the operation were and remain highly relevant for
  Turkey's and the Bank's development agenda. Progress has been achieved in most key
  indicators, though in some cases the impact of designed policies has been so far modest.
  In any case, given the nature of the operation, results should also be judged by the
  consolidation of the reforms supported by CEDPL since they are expected to have full
  impact after certain time, possibly at the end of CEDPL 3. It is by then that we should


                                              13

expect more definitive evidence on the success or not of the program as a whole. The
current global crisis is nevertheless already having a significant effect on employment
and economic welfare in general. The challenge for Turkey is to continue to pursue the
appropriate reforms in this difficult environment.


                  4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

Rating: Moderate

The Turkish Government's proven commitment to its reform program provides comfort
that the risks of a policy reversal or an interruption to the ongoing reforms are limited.
Nevertheless, some of the remaining risks to the operation's development outcomes
encompass: (i) external; and (ii) political risks.

Risks to the operation's outcomes encompass: (i) external; and (ii) political risks.

External Risks. High financing needs make Turkey vulnerable to a sudden reversal in
capital flows, particularly at a time when global appetite for risk is at a low level. The
main risk is worsening investor sentiment, whether due to domestic or external factors,
leading to an abrupt capital outflow and real depreciation. Were this to happen, stronger
fiscal accounts and strengthened financial sector should help Turkey avoid a systemic
crisis, but growth and employment in the private sector could suffer a downturn.

Political Risks. The single-party Government and its strong parliamentary majority favor
political stability and create a positive environment for reforms. Nonetheless, political
risks to the reform program remain. These include (i) geopolitical events in neighboring
regions; and (ii) slowdown in reforms if it is perceived that such course could ameliorate
the impact of international crisis. Specifically, the authorities' appetite for implementing
reforms in the area of increasing labor market flexibility might wane given the expected
adverse impact of the global crisis on the economy.


                5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory.

The operation made use of extensive existing analytical work in its design and policy
dialogue. This operation was also much in line with stated government development
objectives. The operation's identification and design were consistent with the 2003 CAS
and the 2005 CAS PR, and closely reflected lessons learned identified in the 1993-2004
Country Assistance Evaluation, particularly as regarded the expected use of a wide set of
existing analytical background work. Consistent with the CAS PR, the authorities and the
Bank agreed that CEDPL would support key components of the NDP.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Since this was a single-tranche operation with only prior actions but framed in a medium
term program, a continued policy dialogue with the authorities in the areas of reform was
a crucial element in the supervision effort. The supervision of this operation, therefore,
was a continuing process that went beyond the ISRs as a formal requirement5. This paved
the way for the approval of a follow-on operation (CEDPL 2). The Bank and the country
have monitored performance based on agreed upon measures as well as the results
framework included in the CEDPL Policy Matrix. However, the indicators and targets in
some cases lacked specificity, thus making the task of evaluating outcomes more
complicated.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

This rating is based on the following: (i) the broadly positive results of the operation and
the Bank's contribution to it; (ii) the quality of the operation's design, its strategic, long-
term view and its support of the NDP, reflecting the fact that the operation was produced
in full partnership with the Government; (iii) the extensive use of analytical material to
design the operation and facilitate the policy dialogue; (iv) the fact that this operation set
the basis for CEDPL 2; and (v) the continued policy dialogue and supervision helped
attain most of the objectives of the operation so far. The only shortcoming relates to the
inadequate quality of the monitoring and evaluation framework, which made supervision
somewhat more difficult.

The Government undertook a number of technically and political complex reforms in a
difficult political environment. The program shows continuity and seems to have broad
support. The technical preparations for the implementation of these reforms required a
tight coordination effort across a number of government institutions. These efforts also
reflected an effective and close collaboration between the Bank and the Treasury, and a
continuous technical and policy dialogue between Bank staff and the relevant
government agencies.

                                   6. LESSONS LEARNED

CEDPL offers the following key lessons:

Some political difficulties at the time of CEDPL inception and negotiations may
have called for a postponement of program negotiations, but looking in retrospect
the decision to go ahead was appropriate. It was well supported: a) policy actions--all
prior actions--constituted good public policy and were technically and politically
difficult reforms; b) these policies were (and still are) difficult to reverse; and c) clearly
the relationship with the Government would have been unnecessarily strained if a
postponement had taken place, particularly as the Bank had already publicly expressed
support for these reforms. The approval of a follow-on operation supporting additional
policy actions under the Government's NDP validates this conclusion.

Gathering lessons and taking advantage of the dearth of knowledge from
previous/ongoing analytical work, investment lending, and other DPLs has been
important. Long time relationship with the country provides a good deal of knowledge
and experience which has been taken into account when discussing with the authorities,
designing the operation and conducting its supervision.

Establishing targets for indicators as specific as possible is of first order to monitor
the program. The Program Matrix does provide a list of program outcomes and
monitoring indicators. Many indicators are amenable to practical monitoring only at the
end of the program. To the extent possible, targets should be stated more explicit in the
program document. For example, the target of the deepening of financial market could
have been more specific based on the experience of comparable countries.

       ANNEX 3. THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE IMPLEMENTATION
                     COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT TO CEDPL

Introduction

1.      The Competitiveness and Employment Development Policy Loan (CEDPL) is the
first in a series of programmatic loans in support of the Government's comprehensive
reform program aimed to promote growth while generating employment, ensuring social
inclusion and enhancing competitiveness. The CEDPL series constitute the essence of our
collaboration with the World Bank (the Bank) in the areas of (a) maintaining an enabling
macroeconomic framework; (b) improving investment climate, (c) reforming the labor
market, (d) maintaining the financial sector stability and increasing access to investment
capital and (e) generating knowledge and innovation, upgrading the skills of the labor
force and strengthening the quality of education.

2.      Our comments about the implementation of the structural reform program
supported by CEDPL are as follows:

Macroeconomic Framework

3.      A satisfactory macroeconomic framework has been maintained during the
CEDPL program. The Government has implemented a series of macroeconomic and
structural policies in order to increase the competitiveness of the economy and to achieve
a sustainable and equitable economic growth.

4.      These policies had a remarkable impact on Turkey's economic and social
development in the past years. The economic growth averaged about 7 percent and
poverty rate dropped by approximately 8.5 percentage points between 2002 and 2007.

5.      Moreover, a combination of sustained stabilization efforts and steadfast
implementation of structural reforms made it possible to keep the inflation under control,
to improve the outlook for debt sustainability and to reduce macroeconomic
vulnerabilities.

6.      Having taken into account the downside risks stemming from the global crisis and
slowdown in the world economy, Turkey's main focus is to mitigate the adverse impacts
of this turmoil on our financial markets, real sector and fiscal stance. Therefore, the
volatility in the global markets and its effects on Turkish economy is being closely
monitored and policy responses are being designed and implemented.

Investment Climate

7.      The Government gives utmost importance to a strong investment climate for
sustaining economic growth. Therefore, improving the investment climate is one of the
main strategic goals of our Development Plan.

8.      Implementation of structural reforms to improve the investment climate is a
necessary condition for increasing domestic and foreign direct investments. To this end,



                                              25

the Government is aiming to improve the investment climate through, inter alia: (a)
removal of administrative obstacles encountered by firms in all phases of investment
process; (b) reducing and simplifying the Corporate Income Tax and Personal Income
Tax (CIT and PIT) and improving effectiveness of the tax administration; (c) monitoring
and adjusting state aid as necessary; (d) implementing a large program of privatization of
state-owned enterprises; (e) establishment of the Coordination Council for the
Improvement of Investment Environment in Turkey (YOIKK) and (f) improving
corporate governance.

9.      A significant progress has been achieved in these areas over the recent years
which can easily be tracked by record-high FDI inflow figures and privatization
revenues. Turkey has attracted USD 60 billion of FDI inflows for the last three years and
privatization revenues amounted to about USD 26.7 billion between 2005 and 2008.

10.     The Government will further enhance the investment environment to induce both
domestic and foreign investors to invest more in Turkey. In this respect, the Committee
for the Improvement of Investment Climate (YOKK), which follows the implementation
effectiveness of structural reforms and reports the progress to the Government, aims to
rationalize the regulations about investments, develop policies to improve investment
climate and remove obstacles faced by investors.

Labor Market

11.     During 2002-2007 period, the Turkish economy grew by approximately 7 percent
on average, whereas employment did not follow an increasing pattern; a situation which
can be defined as "jobless growth". This is mainly due to the decline in the rural
employment in parallel to the structural transformation of the Turkish economy and to the
shift from a labor intensive industrial production structure to a more capital intensive one.

12.     Therefore, generating more and better jobs has been identified as one of the main
priority areas of Turkey, as it is stated in the Ninth Development Plan. A comprehensive
reform agenda on labor market has been designed to this end and the Government has
already started implementation of the first phase of this agenda.

13.     Within this framework, the enactment of the Labor Market Reform Law confirms
the strong commitment to improve the labor market. The law aims to increase
employment through, inter alia; reducing the financial and non-financial burdens on
formal employment, encouraging the employment of women and young, strengthening
active labor market programmes, designing vocational education policies based on the
needs of labor market, and ensuring the employment in least developed regions. With the
impact of both the reforms realized in the labor market and the active labor market
policies being carried out, the future growth is expected to be reflected in employment.

14.     Moreover, the Government increased its support to private sector and especially
to SMEs by increasing the availability of financial sources and providing incentives for
short-term employment. In this respect, Small and Medium Sized Industry Development
Organization (KOSGEB) and Ziraat Bank (a State Owned Bank) have programs to
provide concessional loans to SMEs and exporter SMEs. In addition, Turkey's Eximbank
increased its funding and insurance programs targeted to exporters. The aim is to mitigate


                                              26

the impacts of the global slowdown on the private sector, decrease their vulnerability to
external shocks, and with the consideration of SME's share in employment (about 77
percent), prevent the lay-offs to the extent possible.

Credit and Capital Markets

15.     The Government recognizes the importance of improving firms' access to finance
and ensuring confidence and stability in financial markets in order to strengthen Turkey's
competitiveness. In this respect, a comprehensive reform program has been implemented
in financial sector through enhanced regulation and supervision.

16.     The fluctuations in global markets are considered as a stress test for the financial
sector. As a result of this stress test, it has been proved that our financial sector has
preserved its strong outlook in financial stability, mainly due to measures taken after the
2001 economic crisis. The positive 2008 year-end figures released by banks prove that
Turkish financial sector maintained its health even in the course of the global crisis.
These figures have also enhanced confidence to the sector and increased the strength of
Turkish banks by conveying the message that the Turkish banks were well prepared
against the crisis and do not have liquidity problems. The capital adequacy ratios of
Turkish banks also remain robust (at around 18 percent on the average as of end-2008)
which is a key indicator that the Turkish financial sector will make it through 2009,
maintaining its strength.

Innovation, Knowledge, Technology Adoption, Labor Force Skills

17.     The Government acknowledges the need to base our growth dynamics on
productivity increases and on creating new comparative advantages in order to sustain
and strengthen our competitiveness on the global arena. To this end, placing an emphasis
on innovation, increasing scientific and technological capacity, improving human capital,
and effective usage of information and communication technologies are our priority
areas.

18.     In Turkey, the share of R&D expenditures in GDP was 0.71 percent in 2007,
while it was 1.84 percent for the EU average in 2006. Our aim is to increase the share of
R&D expenditures and reach at 2 percent of GDP in 2013. On the other hand, the weight
of private sector in R&D investments is increasing. The rate of private sector's R&D
activities in Turkey, which was 24 percent of the total in 2004, increased to 41 percent by
2007. However, this figure still lags quite behind the EU-27 average of 64 percent in
2006. Another issue is to overcome the shortage of researchers. In Turkey, ratio of R&D
personnel to total labor force was 0.43 percent in 2006 which is well below the EU
average of 1.33 percent in 2006.

19.     In this respect, the enactment of the law on Research and Development is a very
important step to encourage R&D investments which in turn will contribute to our
international competitiveness. By implementing necessary policies related to R&D
activities; it is aimed to increase the share of R&D investments in GDP, expand the
production of high-value-added goods and services, decrease costs through productivity
gains, support the employment of qualified research personnel, facilitate the inflow of



                                             27

R&D based FDI, establish, and support pre-competition cooperation projects.
Furthermore, several programs and projects have been initiated since 2005 to educate
researchers inside and outside the country to overcome the shortage. Consequently, a
substantial improvement has been observed in the (full-time equivalent) number of
researchers from 39,9 thousand in 2004 to 63,4 thousand in 2007.

General Comments

20.     We consider the design of CEDPL I to be very well in line with our development
objectives and priorities that are embedded in our main policy documents. "Increasing
competitiveness" and "increasing employment" being two of five development axes of
the 9th Development Plan, illustrates this strong relationship.

21.     Furthermore, the program areas of CEDPL I are well identified and their
complementary nature is well established. "Improving the business environment",
"improving the financial system" and "improving R&D and innovativeness" are all sub-
pillars of 9th Development Plan.

22.     In this context, we extend our appreciation to the Bank for its support to our
reform program through the CEDPL series. Furthermore, we commend the Bank for its
approach in terms of customization and alignment, which are prerequisites for ensuring
country ownership. Since the satisfactory implementation of the development policy
operations depends on government-led initiatives, ensuring the country ownership is a
critical aspect of the design process.

23.     With respect to the design of the CEDPL I, another issue of importance is the
structure of prior actions. The CEDPL I contains only eight prior actions that are
considered to be the most critical policies to achieve its objectives. In this respect, we
welcome the decrease in the number of prior actions of development policy loans, which
is of great importance for an effective implementation.

24.     We appreciate the analytical and advisory work of the Bank which significantly
contributes to the policy dialogue in several reform areas supported by the CEDPL series.
Strong links between analytical studies and Bank lending, provided the foundation for a
well-designed development policy operation. Furthermore, the analytical framework
served to provide a basis for the design of our reform program and its effective
implementation.

25.     The CEDPL series is a well designed development operation in its programmatic
nature. As the government continued implementation of its reform agenda, the prior
actions defined for the CEDPL II has been met and the agreement for the loan was signed
on December 17, 2008. The CEDPL II can be considered as a good sign of continuity of
a well designed and precise programmatic operation.

26.     We would like to underline the importance of having a constant policy dialogue
based on country's needs and priorities. In this respect, we would like to have the
continued support of the Bank on sectoral Development Policy Loans, in addition to on-
going series of operations. We especially welcome the prospect of the CEDPL III which

will deepen the support of the Bank in the areas of enhancing competitiveness and
increasing employment.
