Policy Loan (CEDPL) Project for\n            Turkey were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: some\n            political difficulties at the time of CEDPL inception and\n            negotiations may have called for a postponement of program\n            negotiations, but looking in retrospect the decision to go\n            ahead was appropriate. It was well supported: a) policy\n            actions-all prior actions-constituted good public policy and\n            were technically and politically difficult reforms; b) these\n            policies were (and still are) difficult to reverse; and c)\n            clearly the relationship with the Government will have been\n            unnecessarily strained if a postponement had taken place,\n            particularly as the Bank had already publicly expressed\n            support for these reforms. The approval of a follow-on\n            operation supporting additional policy actions under the\n            Government's Ninth Development Plan (NDP) validates\n            this conclusion. Long time relationship with the country\n            provides a good deal of knowledge and experience which has\n            been taken into account when discussing with the\n            authorities, designing the operation, and conducting its\n            supervision. Establishing targets for indicators as specific\n            as possible is of first order to monitor the program. The\n            program matrix does provide a list of program outcomes and\n            monitoring indicators. Many indicators are amenable to\n            practical monitoring only at the end of the program. To the\n            extent possible, targets should be stated more explicit in\n            the program document."}, "docdt": "2009-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
