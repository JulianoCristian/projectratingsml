F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The overarching goal of the Government's 9th Development Plan is to achieve sustained
stable growth that translates into job creation and poverty reduction. The 2008-11
Country Partnership Strategy is shaped directly by the 9th Development Plan and fully
integrated with the government's program. The specific objectives of the government's
competitiveness and employment reform agenda, supported by CEDPL 2, are to help (i)
raise export competitiveness and FDI by contributing to improve the investment climate:
(ii) enhance the efficiency and depth of the financial sector; and (iii) expand employment
opportunities through labor market reforms and skill building. The CEDPL series is
envisaged in the CPS.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background. During the 2002-2006 period, Turkey experienced rapid
growth (7.2 percent on average), supported by sound macroeconomic policies and the consistent
implementation of a strong structural reform agenda. In the second half of 2007 and the beginning
of 2008, growth started to slow down, and the last quarter of 2008 witnessed the outbreak of the
global financial crisis. The Competitiveness and Employment Development Policy Loan
(CEDPL) was approved in June 2007. Reflecting the complexity and nature of the reform
processes, while designed as a free-standing operation, the CEDPL was embedded in a
programmatic framework. The second Competitiveness and Employment Development Policy
Loan (CEDPL 2) was approved two months after the failure of Lehman Brothers, at a time of
high uncertainty about global economic prospects.

Turkey was thus faced with the challenge of an unfavorable external economic
environment, at a time of already slowing domestic economic growth. The EU, Turkey's main
export market, was about to experience a significant recession. World GDP growth was projected
to be below 2 percent in 2009.1 With the advent of the crisis, Turkey's 2008 fourth quarter growth
plunged to -7.0 percent (y/y), bringing annual GDP growth for 2008 to a stagnant 0.7 percent.
The developing world was losing investor confidence: the spread between the Emerging Markets
Bond Index (EMBI+) and US Treasury bills had risen from 239 basis points at end-2007 to 612
basis points as of November 6, 2008. Maintaining investor confidence in Turkey, key to avoiding
capital reversals, required three main ingredients: (i) continued political stability; (ii) the real and
signalling effects of strong macroeconomic management; and (iii) continued structural reforms to
drive growth and decrease economic vulnerability.

Even before the crisis, employment growth and long-term macroeconomic stability were
key policy challenges for Turkey. Most crucially, employment generation was still low, as
evidenced by declining employment ratios and comparatively high unemployment. In 2007, the
overall employment rate for ages between 15 and 64 in Turkey was 41.5 percent, significantly
lower than the 65.4 percent of EU-27 countries and far from the Lisbon target of 70 percent in
2010, with the biggest challenge coming from the low employment rate for women (for ages
between 15 and 64) in Turkey, which stood at 23.6 percent in 2007 compared to 58.3 percent for
the EU-27 countries (and the Lisbon target of 60 percent in 20 10).

In response to the policy challenge of low employment growth and long-term
macroeconomic stability, the Turkish authorities adopted a comprehensive long-term
program to modernize the economy: the Ninth Development Plan (NDP). The NDP's broad
policy vision is "a Turkey which grows in stability, shares her income more equitably, is
competitive at a global scale, transforms into an information society and has completed the stage
of legal harmonization for EU membership." In order to achieve this vision, the NDP comprises
five "development axes" or strategic areas of action, namely: (a) Increasing Competitiveness, (b)
Increasing Employment, (c) Strengthening Human Development and Social Solidarity, (c)
Ensuring Regional Development and (d) Increasing Quality and Efficiency in Public Services.

 Rationale for Bank Assistance. The Country Partnership Strategy for 2008-2011 is fully
integrated with ­ and maps all planned Bank activities into -the Government's Ninth
Development Plan. Under the CPS, the Competitiveness and Employment Development Policy
Loan (CEDPL) series was designed to support Turkey's ambitious competitiveness and
employment reform agenda. The policy actions supported by the series are directly linked to five
of the development objectives spelled out in the CPS: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability
and sustaining economic growth, (ii) improving the investment climate and decreasing the
informality of the economy, (iii) increasing labor market flexibility and improving skills, (iv)
maintaining soundness of the financial system, and improving access to finance, and (v)
enhancing technology adoption and innovation. Moreover, the results framework for the CEDPL
series maps to the broader results framework for the CPS. The first and second operations in the
series were prepared in line with the Government's program, whose main objective is raising
export competitiveness and foreign direct investment by improving the investment climate,
enhancing the efficiency and depth of the financial sector, and broadening employment
generation.2

A third operation in the series (CEDPL3) was expected to cover key outstanding parts of
the government's investment climate reform agenda. The Government plans included: 1) the
continuation of its privatization program; 2) the adoption of a Commercial Code that is in line
with the EU Acquis; 3) in the area of innovation and technology, the approval of a Patent and
Intellectual Property Law; a Geographical Indicators Law; an Industrial Design Law and
Trademarks Law which would further align the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) regime in
Turkey with the EU Acquis; 4) the enactment of the Capital Market Law; 5) the adoption of the
Basel II capital adequacy framework as market conditions permit and the approval of the legal
requirements for the transfer of Risk Center to the Bankers Association; 6) the second-phase labor
market reforms, to include measures to increase labor market flexibility, income-protection for
unemployed workers, as well as steps to align skills and labor demand.

Reforms which were originally planned to be supported under CEDPL 3 are now being
pursued under a new programmatic DPL (see section 2.4). To maintain the competitiveness
and employment reform dialogue with the Government, a more comprehensive new DPL series,
which includes crisis response measures along with a continuation of the structural reform
agenda, called the Programmatic Development Policy Loan for Restoring Equitable Growth and
Employment (REGE DPL) was approved by the Bank's Board of Executive Directors on March
23, 2010.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

 Based on the Program Matrix embedded in the CEDPL 2 program document (See Annex 2), the
following objectives and indicators were identified:

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)
Building on the Competitiveness and Employment Development Policy Loan (CEDPL) approved
in June 2007, the CEDPL 2 operation supported prior actions in three main policy areas, in line
with the objectives ­and indicators--mentioned before:

        Investment climate reforms to raise export competitiveness and FDI, including the
        enactment of the new research and development law, simplification of customs
        procedures, amendment to the Land Registry Law, and Turkey's privatization program;

        Improving financial intermediation, including the enactment of the new Insurance Law
        and of corporate governance regulations in the Capital Markets.

        Expanding employment opportunities, including the enactment of a first-phase Labor
        Market reform and advances in defining competency-based occupation standards.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)
No revisions were made to the approved policy areas.

1.6 Other significant changes
There were no significant changes.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix-Annex 2)
To support measures in the previously mentioned areas, CEDPL 2 included the following prior,
core policy actions:

        The government maintained a satisfactory macroeconomic framework. Bank staff
        found the existing macroeconomic framework to be adequate with well-defined targets.

        A new Law on Research and Development had been enacted. This law established a
        new incentive regime for research and development which was expected to lead to higher
        private R&D investment, particularly by foreign companies.

        The Borrower had approved an amendment to the Land Registry Law, which
        reinstated the legal foundations for land ownership by foreign individuals and companies.

        The Government had simplified its customs procedures substantively, especially for
        imports, which was expected to facilitate further trade integration and FDI in Turkey.

        The transparent, competitive, and socially and environmentally responsible
        implementation of Turkey's Privatization Program had continued during the June
        2007 and June 2008 period. Total value of completed privatization transaction amounted
        to around US$6.5 billion.

        The Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) had made Turkish
        Accounting Standards mandatory for Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI),
        improving the quality of financial information which in turn was expected to reduce risks,
        improve regulation, and enable more efficient financial intermediation.


                                                4
       BRSA had issued regulations to strengthen banking supervision and had enhanced
       off-site supervision to help manage systemic risk in the banking sector, tightening
       foreign exchange exposure rules and strengthening other areas of banking regulation
       including loan-loss provisioning and collateral valuation rules.

       Financial Sector Commission had been created to enhance the overall coordination of
       the supervision of the financial sector.

       A new Insurance Law had been enacted and secondary regulations had been issued,
       establishing guidelines for minimum capital, fit and proper requirements, direct licensing,
       and changes in control.

       Regulations had been issued by Capital Markets Board (CMB) on related party
       transactions, raising information disclosure and investor protection. These regulations
       were expected to help improve corporate governance in the capital markets.

       CMB had made Turkish Accounting Standards mandatory for joint stock
       companies traded on the Istanbul Stock Exchange, improving the quality of
       information available to investors in Turkish capital markets.

       The Government had reduced the social security contribution of employers to create
       additional jobs for the young and women in a time-bound and declining manner. Given
       the expected employment as well as fiscal cost impact, the targeted reduction in the
       employers' social security contribution was deemed a cost-effective and efficient way of
       creating entry jobs for young people and women.

       The Government had reduced the non-wage labor costs by lifting specific hiring
       quotas, allowing flexibility in the provision of specific services, and financing the
       social security contribution for employees with disabilities from general Treasury
       funds. The lifting and flexibilization of such restrictions was expected to lead to
       additional formal job creation as well as to additional hiring of workers with disabilities.

       Sector qualification committees had been created for three sectors with signed
       protocols for the development of competency-based occupational standards, in line with
       the EU qualification framework.

       Eligibility of beneficiaries entitled to participate in active labor market programs
       financed by the Unemployment Insurance Fund had been broadened, raising the
       pool of eligible beneficiaries to all unemployed registered with ISKUR from only those
       receiving unemployment benefits.

Both CEDPL and CEDPL 2 put an emphasis on the continuity of the Government's program and
took into account a broad range of measures in partnership with the Government. There had been
other actions or elements included in the program which were not part of the core prior actions
but nevertheless played an important role in the realization of the program objectives. Among
those that were significant for CEDPL 2 were:

       Increased R&D funding from 0.6 percent of GDP in 2006 to 0.73 percent of GDP in
       2008.

CEDPL 3 had been planned to support the following indicative reforms:

        Approval of a new Commercial Code in line with the EU Acquis as a crucial step for
        creating an investment climate conducive for private sector investment.
        Continued implementation of the privatization program, as a core component of its
        overall competitiveness and employment program.
        Approval of a Patent and Intellectual Property Law; a Geographical Indicators Law; an
        Industrial Design Law and Trademarks Law which would further align the Intellectual
        Property Rights (IPR) regime in Turkey with the EU Acquis.
        Alignment with the EU Acquis in the field of metrology, quality and standards, for the
        legislation governing the Turkish Accreditation Agency (TURKAK), Turkish Standards
        Institute (TSE) and Turkish Patent Institute (TPE).
        Enactment of the Capital Market Law.
        Adoption of the Basel II capital adequacy framework as market conditions permit and the
        completion of the legal requirements for the transfer of Risk Center to Bankers
        Association.
        Reform measures on labor market flexibility and worker protection
        Completion of the development of competency-based occupational standards for ten
        occupations and award of certificates to first students in three pilot sectors.

Reflecting the complexity and nature of the reform processes, while designed as a free-
standing operation, the CEDPL was embedded in a programmatic framework. More
specifically, while the original intention of the Bank team was to prepare this operation as the
first in a programmatic series, the political circumstances at that time, led to the decision to
proceed with it as a stand-alone operation in order to preserve the policy dialogue with the
authorities while still acknowledging possible emerging risks to the sustainability of the reform
effort and the achievement of the development objectives. As the CEDPL was prepared as a
stand-alone operation, an ICR was already prepared on that basis (See Report No. ICR
00001008). The rationale for the adaptation of CEDPL 3 into a new DPL series is provided in
Section 2.4.


2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:



                                               6
Government's commitment. The Government's dedication to pursue an ambitious
Competitiveness and Employment reform program was marked in its Ninth Development Plan
(2007-2011), Medium Term Plans and its EU harmonization agenda. In the preparation and
implementation of CEDPL and CEDPL 2, all relevant Government institutions were involved and
worked in collaboration with the Bank. All prior actions were successfully implemented by the
Government, including some which were challenging by their nature (i.e. privatization of state-
owned companies).

With the onset of the global financial crisis in the second half of 2008, the Government's private-
sector development agenda began to focus largely on immediate measures to mitigate the impact
of the crisis. There was a slowdown in the business climate reform agenda, and specifically in the
implementation of reforms expected to be supported by a prospective CEDPL 3 operation, as
legislative activity had to focus on protecting workers and firms from the worst effects of the
global crisis. It is important to note, however, that none of the previous reforms in this area were
reversed.

The Government now plans to continue and reinvigorate the policy and institutional reform
agenda to strengthen the business climate and deepen the financial sector. Bank support for this
agenda continues, consistent with the FY08-11 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and
reaffirmed in the CPS Progress Report (CPS PR) discussed by the Bank's Board of Executive
Directors in January 2010.

Global financial situation. In late 2008, international financial markets were facing a major
challenge by the liquidity crisis, which broke out with the collapse of US mortgage markets and
the fall of Lehman Brothers. The timing of the crisis coincided with the final preparations and
negotiations for CEDPL 2. Four factors have compounded the impact of global events on the
Turkish economy: (i) The speed of the economic expansion in the preceding five year period had
led to a marked inventory and capital build-up in Turkish manufacturing; (ii) Uncertainty about
the growth and fiscal impact of global events was compounded by Turkey's external financing
needs; (iii) Although there was no visible slowdown in credit intermediation to the private sector
prior to September 2008, Turkey's banking system was then quick to cut lending to all but the
most creditworthy borrowers; and (iv) Turkey's exports are concentrated in globally affected
sectors such as automotive vehicles, consumer durables, and capital goods and machinery.

The CEDPL 2 program document had fully acknowledged the risks associated with this situation
and identified potential impacts on the Government's reform program. Specifically, it noted that
the outlook for 2009 was `exceptionally uncertain' and identified three main tools to maintain
investor confidence in the country: (i) continued political stability; (ii) the real and signaling
effects of strong macroeconomic management, especially setting realistic fiscal targets and
meeting them; and (iii) continued structural reforms to drive growth and decrease economic
vulnerability.

Political environment. The stable political environment that accompanied CEDPL 2 has had a
soothing impact on Turkish economy's relative resilience during the crisis. Prior to the crisis,
Turkish politics had experienced few difficulties, which had been overcome by the Government
without major consequences. Despite occasional political difficulties, the ruling party AKP was
able to maintain assurance on the Government's determination for macroeconomic stability and
the continuation of structural reforms in the long run, as well as the restoration of the economy in
the shorter run immediately following the crisis. At the time of signing of CEDPL 2, the
Government remained solid and fully committed to its structural reform agenda.




                                                 7
Analytical work. The 1993-2004 Country Assistance Evaluation found that little formal economic
and sector analysis was carried out up to the late 1990s. Thereafter, the economic and sector
analysis have become a larger part of the Bank`s program, and an integral part of the Bank's
partnership with Turkey. The CPS Progress Report (CPS PR) for 2008-2011 underlines that
Turkey particularly values the Bank Group's global experience, knowledge, and expertise. This
approach has increased the effectiveness of Bank involvement. As a result, CEDPL 2, and the
specific measures supported by it, were informed by a large number of analytical work that
contributed--and continue to contribute--to nourish a permanent and stable policy dialogue in
the areas supported by the reform. Specifically, the Bank provided analytical support to the
government's program through extensive economic and sector work on the program areas of the
CEDPL 2, including through the: (a) Labor Market Study (2006) and Labor Tax Report (2008),
which identified flexibility and effective social protection as key policy elements for creating
more and better jobs; (b) Country Economic Memorandum (2008), which had special emphasis
on `Productivity and Competitiveness' as well as `Promoting Employment' as drivers of
sustained growth; (c) Investment Climate Assessment (ICA, 2007), which identified key
constraints to higher investment flows and productivity gains; (d) Joint Bank-Fund FSAP (2007),
which identified remaining legislative and regulatory policy challenges; (e) The Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) (2007) on Accounting and Auditing, which shed
light on the bottlenecks in Turkey's compliance with financial standards; and (f) Education Sector
Study (2006) and Youth Employment Study (2008), which together provided a connected look at
the education sector, how it prepares the young for the labor market and how skill mismatches
can be reduced.

Identification of risks. Items with a high-risk rating at appraisal included external economic and
financial developments, continuity of labor market reform, and institutional capacity. While
mitigation measures have been identified and reflected in the program document, these risks are
still relevant for the development outcomes. Stronger fiscal accounts and strengthened financial
sector will help Turkey avoid a systemic crisis, but growth and employment in the private sector
may remain vulnerable.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

        Overall design. Given that this was originally designed as a programmatic operation,
        efforts were made to identify outcomes that could be linked to a longer-horizon program
        of reforms. In this regard, indicators were selected in a suitable fashion to allow for
        regular monitoring in a systematic and long-term manner. Most indicators were supported
        by targets and baselines. Nevertheless, at times some of the expected results were too
        general and long term oriented to link directly to supported actions in the CEDPL
        program. Experience has shown also that some of these results may be induced by factors
        other than the supported policy actions. At entry, some shorter-term indicators measuring
        the performance of CEDPL 2 reforms could have been added.

        No implementation or utilization issues have been identified.


2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

As set out in the CPS PR, continued Bank support for the Government's Competitiveness
and Employment Reform Program will be through the Restoring Equitable Growth and
Employment Programmatic Development Policy Loan (REGE DPL) series. Due to the
outbreak of the financial crisis and the need to support the Government's crisis response in a
streamlined manner, the CEDPL series was merged into the REGE DPL series which combines


                                                8
        the public sector support DPL (PPDPL) and CEDPL series (see Figure 1 for the design of REGE
        DPL). The REGE DPL was approved by the Bank's Board on March 23, 2010. The series
        supports Turkey's transition from crisis response to renewed economic growth, both in the public
        sector with a focus on fiscal management, and in the private sector with a focus on business
        climate reform and employment generation. As such, the REGE DPL series both (i) continues the
        Programmatic Public Sector DPL (PPDPL) series and (ii) incorporates the remaining substantive
        policy agenda from the CEDPL series. Specifically, reforms from the earlier planned CEDPL 3
        operation will become triggers for an expected follow-up operation (REGE DPL2).4

        3. Assessment of Outcomes

        3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
        (to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

        The objectives defined for CEDPL 2 remain highly relevant with regard to the long term
        development objectives of Turkey and the Bank. In the past decade, Turkey has made
        significant progress in the areas of competitiveness and employment and the reforms in these
        areas were consistently supported by the PFPSAL series, CEDPL and CEDPL 2. Notwithstanding
        the progress, Turkey continues to face significant policy challenges. The extensive collection of
        analytical work produced by the Bank in collaboration with Turkey in recent years have
        demonstrated that labor market inflexibility, skill mismatches, legal framework for commercial
        activity, excessively long and costly bankruptcy procedures and access to finance are only a few
        of these remaining challenges.

        The design and implementation of the operation were relevant to realize its objectives. As a
        middle income country, Turkey has complex structural reform needs for sustainable job creation
        and enhanced competitiveness. Measures supported by the CEDPL, CEDPL 2, and now REGE
        DPL, including, but not limited to, the labor market reform, improvement of the investment
        climate, passage of the Commercial Code and a new Capital Markets Law all require strong and
        continued support, achievable only within a programmatic framework.

        The design of CEDPL 2 pillars reflected major reform areas defined in Turkey's
        development strategy documents. Turkey's long term development strategy documents, most
        notably the NDP, and the World Bank-Turkey CPS for 2008-2011 outline a set of major reforms
        under their Competitiveness and Employment Pillar to realize the country-level objectives of
        improved investment climate, increased competitiveness, higher and better employment
        opportunities and a stable financial sector. The CPS PR, discussed by the Bank's Board of
        Executive Directors in January 2010, reiterates these policy objectives, while also pointing to
        needed adjustments to the CPS to support the transition from weathering the global financial
        crisis to returning to sustainable growth. The main impact of the global economic downturn has
        been on the real economy: export, production and jobs were adversely affected. These are also




                                                                        10
the issues that have been addressed by CEDPL 2 and they continue to motivate the follow-on
REGE DPL series.

Turkey and the Bank jointly decided to adapt the operation design to respond to the
immediate needs of the country in the wake of the financial crisis. Turkey has been affected
severely by the recession. Economic stimulus packages became a priority to buffer the impact of
external shocks on the financial sector; the real sector needed additional liquidity to sustain itself;
with rising unemployment rates, social and employment measures were required. These new
constraints required a tailored operation to both: (i) support crisis response measures, and (ii)
continue the long term structural reform agenda. Merger of the CEDPL series with PPDPL under
the Programmatic REGE DPL aims to achieve both of these goals and provides an efficient
solution to the changing needs of the country.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by operations and
outcomes)

The CEDPL series supported the Government's reforms geared to enable a more favorable
investment climate, higher productivity, and higher employment and growth. Major steps
have been taken in the direction of enhancing innovative activity, which has already been
contributing to Turkey's increased competitiveness. Reducing the role of the state in economic
activity (privatization) and the amendment to the Land Registry Law have made the economy
more attractive for investment, particularly FDI, which reached 40.3 billion in the period 2007-08.
Simplified customs procedures contributed to more efficient trade activity as the reform had a
direct effect on reducing red tape in customs, leading to a reduction in documents needed from 13
to 8 in two years. Under the financial sector pillar, steps taken by the CMB in increasing
transparency and investor protection have been noteworthy, as reflected in a significant
improvement in this Doing Business Indicator (from 5.3 to 5.7). Moreover, reforms led by the
BRSA reflected in the indicators of financial sector strength, as evidenced by its resiliency in the
aftermath of the global crisis. Due to the adverse effects of the financial crisis on the employment
figures, the final impact of the labor market measures is not clear currently. However, the positive
effects of the individual measures can be observed (i.e. increase in the number of participants in
Active Labor Market Programs).

In assessing the achievement through monitoring indicators identified in CEDPL 2, there
are two important caveats to be considered: (i) the global financial crisis hit at the time of
appraisal, but most of the reforms supported by the loan had already been adopted by the time the
crisis broke out. End-2008 data captures this latter effect in most cases; (ii) measuring the
behavior of outcome indicators at this stage may underestimate the overall success of the
operation. Therefore, the results emanating from the REGE DPL series should be used to closely
monitor and assess the actual intended effects of the CEDPL series policies. Those indicators will
only be informative in the coming years, after the effects of the crisis start to dissipate and as the
implementation of REGE DPL series progresses.

The overall results of CEDPL 2 as measured by the identified indicators are nevertheless
broadly positive. A significant number of results indicators associated with the key objectives of
CEDPL were identified (see Table 2). End-2008 data5 show stability in trend or an improvement,
albeit marginal, in 10 out of 15 indicators. More specifically, the following observations can be
made:

   Policies to sustain macroeconomic stability were greatly affected by the impact of
   the crisis. While most indicators (current account deficit, inflation and public debt levels)
   did show an improvement in 2008, some of those gains were reversed in 2009.
   Specifically, public debt and deficits have risen as a result of the downturn. The overall
   public sector deficit is expected to be 5.5 percent of GDP in 2009. The primary balance is
   estimated at a 1.3 percent deficit in 2009 (the first primary deficit this decade), down
   from a 1.7 percent surplus in 2008. Public debt (EU definition) has slightly increased to
   45.5 percent of GDP at end-2009, from below 40 percent at end-2007.

   Indicators on investment climate reform show reasonable progress despite adverse
   economic conditions. (1) Investments in innovation by the Turkish private sector,
   especially by large companies, have risen after the enactment of the Law on Supporting
   R&D Activities and now account for more than 47.3 percent of total expenditures; (2) As
   a result of large privatizations, SOE's contribution to employment as a ratio of total
   industrial employment reached less than 5 percent (compared to the 8 percent target); and
   (3) there was a slight increase in the tax rate as a share of total profits, though it did not
   exceed the results framework threshold of 45 percent.

   The banking sector remained stable and has proven to be an underlying strength of
   the Turkish economy. Non-bank financial institutions benefited from the reform
   measures supported by CEDPL 2. Banking prudential indicators continue to show the
   relative strength of the domestic financial market, with capital adequacy ratios exceeding
   regulatory requirements by a large margin. Asset quality deteriorated due to the recession,
   with the NPL ratio rising from 3.4 percent in November 2008 to 5.3 percent in the same
   period of 2009. The Bank performed regular stress tests during 2009 to monitor financial
   sector soundness and the system proved to be resilient against shocks to a great extent.
   Indicators of the size of insurance and leasing sectors show that NBFIs managed to
   sustain adequate growth between 2007 and the second half of 2009. Regulations issued
   by CMB contributed to the improvement in Investor Protection Index, contributing to the
   progress in corporate governance in Turkey.

   Evidence is mixed for the indicators of employment generation, pointing to a need
   for sustained support to structural reforms in the area. In 2007-2009, unemployment
   soared, reflecting the vulnerability of the labor market to adverse shocks to the economy.
   The first phase of labor market reform helped increase the youth labor force participation
   rate, and the female participation rate remained roughly stable, as can be observed in
   Table 2.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The development objectives of the operation remain highly relevant in Turkey's development
agenda. The close alignment of CEDPL 2 objectives with the Bank's goals are detailed in the
CPS PR for 2008-2011. Progress has been achieved in most of the targets, which were connected
to specific operation outputs. Long term monitoring of these indicators will be crucial for
continued cooperation with Turkey in achieving the stated development objectives. The global
crisis has once again demonstrated that structural reforms in the area of Competitiveness and
Employment are vital for a sound institutional framework and consequently to build resilience
against shocks. The challenge for Turkey now is to find the right blend of measures which will
enable crisis recovery and structural policy reforms in this difficult environment.

3.4Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
While the operation is not intended directly to benefit the poor, the CEDPL series was
designed to support the poor by helping the private sector create more employment
opportunities and better jobs.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

Risks to the operation's outcomes encompass: (i) economic management; and (ii) political and
(iii) operational risks.

Economic Management Risks. The main risk comes from the challenge to macroeconomic,
especially fiscal management as there is still uncertainty with respect to global recovery The
2010-2012 Medium Term Program has set a fiscal policy framework with measures and targets
addressing the risk of rising public debt ratios. In the longer term, the concern is declining levels
of public investment in growth-enhancing areas such as core infrastructure, reducing potential
growth. Altered priorities due to the recession have caused a slowdown in reforms under the
competitiveness and employment agenda. Continued close dialogue between the government,
Bank teams, and those of other institutions (e.g., IMF, European Commission (EC)), and the
programmatic structure of the Bank's DPL support to Turkey are expected to help mitigate these
risks.




                                                 17
Political Risks. The single-party Government which has been in power since 2001 with a strong
parliamentary majority enabled a fast reform process in the 2001-2010 period. There is an
upcoming general elections in July 2011. Second phase labor market reform and the Commercial
Code are reforms that could be delayed due to the political agenda.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory.

Diagnostic analytical work and effective policy dialogue were at the core of the operation's
design. CEDPL 2 policy areas relied heavily on existing Bank AAA and stakeholder consultation.
The operation's identification and design were consistent with the 2008-2011 CPS, and is still
highly relevant under the CPS PR. Use of AAAs in project preparation and appraisal reflected the
lessons learned from 1993-2004 Country Assistance Evaluation. Risks were openly identified in
the program document, with relevant mitigation measures. Macroeconomic and financial
environment was carefully studied. Given the original intention to have the CEPDL a series as
programmatic in nature, the results framework mainly focused on the evaluation of longer-term
outcomes, which, in hindsight are now difficult to connect to the indicators in the short period
after the closure of the loan. Inclusion of two matrices in the program document complicated the
monitoring process, and the relevant indicators in the second matrix could have been embedded
in the actual results framework for a more efficient M&E design.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

Supervision was conducted as part of the policy dialogue for--and preparation of--the REGE-
DPL operation. Although this operation was designed to be part of a programmatic series, it
eventually became a single-tranche operation supported by the implementation of prior actions.
Nevertheless, as mentioned above, a continued policy dialogue with the authorities in the key
areas of reform took place in preparation of the REGE DPL series and will continue as part of a
prospective follow-on operation. The Bank and the Turkish authorities have monitored
performance based on agreed upon measures as well as the results framework included in the
CEDPL 2 Policy Matrix.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry and of supervision is rated satisfactory (as
discussed in respective sections above).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government has been committed to the reform agenda even in cases where such reforms
were difficult to implement by their nature (as in the privatization agenda). An added difficulty
was the disruption caused by the global financial crisis. Supported policy actions in CEDPL 2
required a tight coordination effort across a number of government institutions as well as
consultations with the private sector. The Committee for the Improvement of Investment Climate
(YOIKK) proved to be an effective platform for sustaining the public-private dialogue. The Bank
and the Treasury maintained a continuous technical and policy dialogue, complemented by strong
engagement between Bank staff and the relevant government agencies. The Government has
more recently focused more on measures to address the impact of the global crisis, but it has
nonetheless reiterated its commitment to the competitiveness and employment agenda for
sustained growth and the creation of more and better jobs through the new REGE DPL series.

6. Lessons Learned
CEDPL 2 offers the following key lessons:

In a difficult global setting, it was important for the Bank to show enough creativity in
designing a vehicle to provide continued support to the Government's reform agenda. Due
to the outbreak of the financial crisis, the CEDPL program evolved into the REGE DPL series.
The series, aside from providing support for the existing public sector reform agenda,
incorporates the remaining substantive policy agenda from the CEDPL series. Specifically,
reforms from the earlier planned CEDPL 3 operation will become triggers for an expected follow-
up operation (REGE DPL2). The REGE DPL constitutes a good example of the Bank's flexibility
in tailoring its products under special circumstances.

The importance of maintaining a policy dialogue in support of longer-term strategic goals
should be highlighted. That helped Turkey to set a long term vision, define programs along
those lines and designed policies with increasing societal support. The implementation of the
CEDPL 2 is a good illustration of this point. The alignment of the program with the Government
strategy has a lot to do with its ownership. The CEDPL 2 was a well supported operation. a)
policy actions--all prior actions--are consistent with international good practices of public
policy; b) they were technically and politically difficult reforms; c) the government is committed
to not reversing these policies; and d) continuity in Bank support will be obtained by the REGE
DPL.

The importance of combining knowledge and lending operations was reaffirmed. The
CEDPL program was guided strongly by the collection of previous/ongoing analytical work. The
long term relationship with the country also provided a good deal of knowledge and experience
which has been taken into account when discussing with the authorities, designing the operation
and conducting its supervision. At the time of appraisal, Government counterparts were highly
experienced about DPL operations, as they have successfully implemented many programmatic
and stand alone DPLs.

In hindsight, it would have been useful to include indicators that would assess performance
in the short term. Given that the CEDPL 2 was designed with a programmatic approach in mind,
it is difficult to evaluate its impact on the basis of the indicators chosen at the time of its design.


                                                  19
Nevertheless, it would have been useful to also have allowed for the possibility of assessing
progress in a short span to properly supervise the project and evaluate its impact.

                             COMMENTS OF GOVERNMENT
           ON IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT OF CEDPL II


  Introduction


   The Competitiveness and Employment Development Policy Loan II (CEDPL II) was the
     second loan in a series of programmatic loans to support the Government in sustaining
     growth, increasing competitiveness and generating more jobs. The main objective of
     CEDPL II is to provide support in the areas of (a) sustaining macroeconomic stability; (b)
     enhancing export competitiveness and FDI through investment climate reforms; (c)
     improving financial intermediation and (d) expanding employment opportunities.


   Our comments about the implementation of the structural reform program supported by
     CEDPL II are as follows:


  Sustaining Macroeconomic Stability


   The government maintained a satisfactory macroeconomic framework in recent years. The
     sustainability of macroeconomic stability was maintained through combination of tight
     fiscal policy and implementation of structural reforms. Tight fiscal policy which had been
     pursued until the beginning of the global crisis was the cornerstone of Turkey's
     macroeconomic policy. It facilitated disinflation process, helped reducing real interest rates
     and declining debt ratios. Starting from the end of 2008 the government had to take
     measures to deal with the effects of the global crisis.



   The global crisis affected our economy through trade, financing and expectations channels.
     On trade, given the impact of the crisis on the EU region, which constitutes around 50
     percent of our exports, Turkish exports started to fall from October 2008. This affected the


                                                1
   leading sectors which had significantly contributed to growth in recent years, reducing
   production and employment.



 The second channel through which the crisis affected the Turkish economy is the financing
   channel. Weakening private capital flows and tighter international financial conditions
   reduced the debt rollover ratios of the corporate sector and made it harder to access external
   financing. Finally, increased global economic uncertainty caused delays in investment and
   consumption decisions and thus led to a further decline in economic activity and domestic
   demand.


 Even though global crisis affected Turkey negatively, it had some positive consequences on
   current account balance, inflation and external debt stock. Imports declined more than
   exports, thereby current account deficit decreased significantly. The decrease in current
   account deficit eased the financing of deficit.


 Government took proactive actions starting from the first signs of the effects of the global
   crisis on the economy. These actions include monetary, fiscal, employment and social
   measures. These measures aimed to revitalize economic activity, sustain employment and
   production. To maintain existing employment and create new jobs, the payment conditions
   regarding short-time employment compensation and unemployment insurance benefits have
   been improved; the funds allocated to vocational training programs have been increased;
   and measures to decrease non-wage costs have been introduced. Transfers to EXIMBANK
   and Small and Medium Enterprises Development Organization (KOSGEB) were increased
   in order to support private sector employment and production. At the same time, measures
   taken by the Central Bank, the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) and
   Capital Markets Board (CMB) aimed to increase credit volume, liquidity, financial
   intermediation and confidence in financial markets.


 Having taken the necessary actions to alleviate the adverse impacts of the crisis in 2008 and
   2009, economic management is now focused on securing sustainable growth in the medium
   and long term. Turkey's new three-year economic program was announced in September


                                              2
   2009 in order to set the medium-term macroeconomic framework and also to further
   strengthen macroeconomic stability.


 According to the projections in the MTP, economy will resume growth in 2010 and pace of
   growth will increase in 2011. Economy is expected to reach 3.5 percent, 4 percent and 5
   percent growth rates in 2010, 2011 and 2012 respectively. General Government deficit to
   GDP ratio is expected to decline to 2.7 percent by the end of 2012.


 With the aim of reducing public debt, strengthening long run fiscal discipline and
   improving the quality of the budget, Government is working on designing a fiscal rule. The
   legal framework for the fiscal rule will be completed in 2010. Starting from the 2011 budget
   period, public financial management will be conducted in line with a fiscal rule over the
   medium to long term.


Enhancing Export Competitiveness, FDI Through Investment Climate Reforms


 Increasing Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is an important part of the Government's
   competitiveness and employment program. FDI provides a stable source of external
   financing and contributes to technology transfer as well as productivity growth. FDI not
   only helps increasing employment but also helps improving quality of jobs created. It is also
   an important factor in financing Turkey's current account deficit.


 Amendment to the Land Registry Law was enacted in order to increase the confidence of
   investors and provide legal certainty for foreign investors investing in real estate.


 Quality certification has an important effect on firm's probability to receive FDI. For this
   purpose Turkish Standards Institution (TSE) gives ISO 9000 certification to small and
   medium sized firms (SMEs). To increase quality infrastructure of SMEs, TSE signed a
   protocol with KOSGEB. Due to this protocol SMEs certified by TSE can receive support
   from KOSGEB. In addition to this protocol, a new KOSGEB law which enables SME's in




                                              3
   service sectors to benefit from KOSGEB's support programmes was enacted on May 5,
   2009.


 Government acknowledges the importance of tax administration and simplifying custom
   regulations to enhance investment climate. With the amendment to the Corporate Income
   Tax Law, corporate tax rate was decreased from 30 percent to 20 percent, which resulted in
   a decline in the tax burden of the corporate sector. With the amendment of the Custom Law
   and new Computerized Custom Activity System (BILGE), Turkey has advanced in
   simplifying custom procedures. Approximately 75 percent of the import declarations are
   completed within 24 hours with the help of this new system.


 To enhance investment promotion capacity of Turkey, White Paper on investment
   promotion strategy is prepared by Investment Support and Promotion Agency (ISPAT).
   ISPAT serves as a reference point for international investors and as a point of contact for all
   institutions engaged in promoting and attracting investments at national, regional and local
   levels. White Paper will provide a strong basis for Turkish investment promotion strategy
   and support the promotion of Turkey's investment opportunities to the global business
   community.


 In order to improve investment climate, Turkey has set a clear Research and Development
   (R&D) agenda. In February 2008, the Government approved a new Law (Law No. 5746) on
   "Supporting Research and Development Activities" that provides a range of fiscal
   incentives for R&D and innovative activities of the private sector. The main objectives of
   the law are i) attracting FDI to establish R&D centers in Turkey, ii) commercializing the
   technologic knowledge, iii) creating jobs for high-skilled R&D personnel and increase
   employment, iv) decreasing production cost, v)increasing product quality and standards, vi)
   increasing productivity and facilitate product and process innovations. The supports and
   incentives which are provided through the law are i) R&D allowance, ii) incentive for
   income withholding tax, iii) incentive for employer's social security contribution, iv) stamp
   duty exemptions, v) incentive for techno-initiative capital support.

 The government increased the allocation of funds for R&D in recent years. In 2008 gross
   domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) as percentage of GDP has reached to 0,73 percent;
   GERD funded by the private enterprise sectors has increased to 0,35 percent of GDP and
   private sector share of total R&D expenditure has reached to 47,3 percent of GDP.


Improving Financial Intermediation


 Sustaining financial sector stability and improving access to finance are key for private
   sector growth. For the development of a stable and efficient financial sector, government
   has taken measures to upgrade legal and regulatory aspects of the financial sector's
   supervisory framework. As a result of these measures, overall capital adequacy ratio of the
   banking sector rose to 17 percent as of September 2008 and 20,5 percent as of September
   2009, which is one of the highest among emerging economies.


 In spite of the negative effects of the global crises Turkish banking sector is in great shape
   compared to many emerging and advanced economies. Decisive implementation of the
   financial sector reform program and prudent financial policies which were also supported
   by CEDPL programmatic series have played an important role in the strong stance of the
   sector.


 Basel II capital adequacy framework is one of the priorities in financial sector. Banking
   Regulation and Supervision Agency has carried on studies to adopt Basel II and good
   progress has been made.


 Taxation regime is important for the efficient financial intermediation. Within this context
   Government has taken certain tax measures and reduced resource utilization support fund
   contribution on non commercial consumer loans offered by banks and financial institutions
   from 15 percent to 10 percent.




                                             5
 In order to comply with International Financial Reporting Standards, Turkish accounting
   standards have been published and made mandatory for all publicly held companies as well
   as financial institutions operating in the capital markets.


 To ensure cooperation and coordination among financial sector institutions, Financial
   Sector Commission has been established. This commission is expected to ensure the
   exchange of information, cooperation and coordination among relevant institutions, propose
   joint policies and express views regarding the matters that relate to the future of the
   financial sector. Another aim of this Commission is to establish and maintain confidence
   and stability as well as to ensure development in the financial markets.


 To increase the cooperation and coordination among non-banking financial sector agents
   Capital Markets Board has established "Turkish Capital Markets Advisory Board". The aim of
   this Board is to create new projects to increase stability and confidence within the sector which
   will substantially improve the competitiveness and employment development capacity of
   Turkey.


 To reduce risk for financial intermediation, the Credit Bureau of Turkey which is a private
   entity created one of the most important and the largest credit databases of Turkey. The
   Central Bank of The Republic of Turkey also created a separate credit registry (Risk
   Center). To transfer this Risk Center to the Banks Association, amendments to the Banking
   Law and the Law on the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey have been submitted to the
   Parliament. Effective implementation of this transfer will expand the coverage of the Credit
   Bureau and thus will enhance lenders' ability to assess credit risks and financial
   infrastructure.


 The insurance and pension sectors' legal and regulatory framework has been significantly
   enhanced. New Insurance Law was enacted in June 2007 and all secondary regulations were
   completed by July 2008.


Expanding Employment Opportunities.



                                               6
 Increasing employment is one of the main priority areas of Turkey, as it is stated in
   Turkey's 9th Development Plan. The Government has identified a comprehensive labor
   market reform that falls, broadly, in three areas: (i) reducing the non-wage labor costs of
   hiring; (ii) increasing labor market flexibility while improving the protection of workers;
   and (iii) raising labor skills and reducing labor mismatch.


 The Government introduced the employment package in May 2008. The package
   includes policies that will have a significant positive impact on labor market outcomes.
   Some of the main measures included in the employment package for reducing non-wage
   labor costs are broad reduction of the employer's social security contributions for
   pensions, disability, and death insurance by 5 percentage points, a time-bound reduction
   of employer's social security contribution for women and youth and the easing of
   obligatory hiring regulations.


 The mentioned employment package also includes measures in order to strengthen the
   active labor market programs such as increasing the financing of active labor market
   programs by allocating a portion of the state share of the Unemployment Insurance Fund
   to IKUR; broadening the eligibility of active labor market program beneficiaries from
   only unemployment benefit recipients to all registered unemployed; and unification of the
   provincial employment and vocational training councils and broadening their
   responsibility.


 As a result of these measures the vocational training programs, which have a potentially
   significant impact on poor household incomes both in the short-term through the daily
   stipend and in the medium to long-term through skills enhancement, have expanded. By
   the end of 2009 more than 150,000 people were trained through these programs, which is
   a significant increase compared to around 23,000 trainees in 2007.


 In order to reduce labor mismatch The Vocational Qualification Authority (VQA) was
   established in 2006 to link the education and qualifications in technical and vocational



                                             7
   fields with occupational needs and standards. Some of the accomplishments of VQA by
   January 2009 are the following: 11 Sector Committees have been established;
   qualification development protocols have been signed in three sectors; and 21
   Cooperation Protocols have been signed with institutions on developing 468 occupational
   standards in 13 sectors. Moreover, VQA is recognized by the EU as the Coordination
   Center for qualifications in Turkey and its certificates will be recognized by the EU.


 Furthermore, ongoing curriculum reforms are the complementary measures of the policy
   towards raising labor skills and reducing labor mismatch.


General Comments


 The government's competitiveness and employment program is a central pillar of Turkey's
   9th Development Plan. The overall goal of the Government's program is to maintain a
   stable macroeconomic environment and achieve a sustained growth path that translates into
   job creation. The CEDPL II is very well in line with our development objectives and
   priorities. Furthermore, the program areas of CEDPL II are well identified and their
   complementary nature is well established. "Raising export competitiveness and FDI through
   investment climate reforms", "improving financial intermediation" and "expanding
   employment opportunities" are all sub-pillars of 9th Development Plan.

 We appreciate Bank's support to our reform program through the CEDPL series. Country
   ownership is a critical aspect of the design process for a successful development policy
   operation. Reform areas supported by CEDPL II were in line with Turkey's development
   programs and the program was designed in accordance with government-led initiatives.
   Successful implementation of the CEDPL II operation demonstrates a strong country
   ownership. Furthermore, we commend the Bank for its cooperative approach in terms of
   customization and alignment with the government program while designing CEDPL II.


 With respect to the design of the CEDPL II, another issue of importance is the structure of
   prior actions. The CEDPL II contains twelve prior actions that are considered to be the most
   critical policies to achieve its objectives. In this respect, we welcome the decrease in the


                                             8
   number of prior actions of development policy loans, compared to previous operations
   which are of great importance for an effective implementation.


 We appreciate the analytical and advisory work of the Bank which significantly contributes
   to the policy dialogue in several reform areas supported by the CEDPL series. Strong links
   between analytical studies and Bank lending, provided the foundation for a well-designed
   development policy operation.


 We would like to underline the importance of having a constant policy dialogue based on
   our country's needs and priorities. Our reform initiatives are continuing in the areas
   supported by CEDPL II operation. In this respect, we would like to have the continued
   support of the Bank for our reform programs for enhancing competitiveness, employment
   and private sector development.
