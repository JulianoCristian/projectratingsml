The global financial crisis\n            hit Latvia at a time when the country was particularly\n            vulnerable and its impact was felt more deeply than\n            elsewhere in the world. Responding to the global financial\n            crisis, Latvia enacted an Emergency Social Safety Net\n            Strategy in October 2009. The project financed pre-primary\n            education and child development programs for five and six\n            year old children. It covered the costs of transporting\n            students from communities where schools have closed to the\n            new places of instruction and increased the coverage and\n            pay-out period of unemployment insurance. The project\n            sustained and improved general practitioner and primary\n            health care services. As a result, people received medical\n            services when they needed it and not when they can afford it."}, "docdt": "2010-09-15T09:55:01Z"}
