outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. The lesson\n            highlights the importance of the debt restructuring\n            operation among the fiscal consolidation measures behind the\n            fiscal turnaround in RS. The restructuring not only saved\n            budgetary resources, but was also a key to smoothing the\n            debt service profile in 2009 and 2010, at a time when the\n            global economic crisis increased uncertainty and rollover\n            risks worldwide. The improved profile also facilitated the\n            task of budget planning. The debt restructuring was thus of\n            paramount significance to the state and spurred a new demand\n            from sub-national clients willing to engage in fiscal\n            consolidation operations with debt restructuring components\n            with the Bank. A political economy lesson can also be drawn.\n            The loan supported reforms aimed at addressing structural\n            fiscal imbalances. However, undertaking such reforms\n            requires strong social coalitions. These coalitions in turn\n            take a relatively long time to build while the DPL\n            instrument is short-lived. In this sense, the DPL merit was\n            at least to help build the needed coalition by bringing up\n            the issue. The submission of a new draft law on pension\n            reform by the new Government is suggestive that this DPL may\n            have contributed to building a consensus around this issue.\n            Finally, the timing of the loan suited very well the\n            state's needs."}, "docdt": "2011-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
