Description         The proposed operation is a two-tranche development policy loan, with the
                    first tranche (US$650 million) to be disbursed upon effectiveness and the
                    second tranche (US$450 million) on completion o f measures described in the
                    loan agreement and expected to be accomplished by the end o f 2009.

                    The objectives o f the proposed operation are to assist the State o f Rio Grande
                    do Sul achieve a more stable and sustainable fiscal position, to improve its
                    debt profile, to reduce social security imbalances, and to enhance the
                    efficiency o f state public sector. The proposed loan will also help the State to
                    comply with the Fiscal Responsibility Law.

                    The proposed operation with Rio Grande do Sul contains the following four
                    components:

                             Fiscal strengthening throughrevenue enhancement and expense
                             containment measures.
                             Debt restructuring.
                             Social security reforms.
                             Public sector managementreforms.
Benefits            The proposed loan supports a program aimed at creating a more stable fiscal
                    situation, which i s critical for improving the economic environment in the
                    State. With a more sustainable fiscal situation, the State will have a stronger
                    and more predictable public investment program. In addition, the program
                    will improve public service delivery through public sector reforms.         The
                    program supported by the proposed loan will help the state move towards
                    compliance with the Fiscal Responsibility Law (LRF), an objective shared by
                    the Federal Authorities who           are interested in maintaining overall
                    macroeconomic stability inBrazil. Insum, the program will make fiscal space
                    available for investment and improve the State's growth prospects.

Risks              This is a high-riskbut high-reward operation. The risks are associated with
                   unexpected economic events and sustainability policy reversals.       Adverse
                   macroeconomic developments, such as lower growth or a larger and
                   unanticipated depreciation o f the domestic currency, could undermine the
                   reductions o f the State's debt burden expected from the program. Past State
                   Administrations had difficulties sustaining policy reforms. Lack o f policy
                   continuity may cause the expected gains not to materialize. The proposed
                   reforms are difficult and will likely encounter political opposition. Many
                   factors mitigate these risks. There i s broad consensus on the need for these
                   reforms -- the operation i s strongly supported by the Federal Government,
                   despite the fact that the State i s governed by the major opposition party.
                   Second, there i s an equally strong consensus on the need to address the debt
                   issue in a way that will minimize the risk o f recurrence, and will strengthen
                   the application o f Brazil's landmark Law o f Fiscal Responsibility.       To
                   maximize the prospects o f success, the State and Federal Governments have
                   requested that the loan will be disbursed in two stages, in accordance with an
                   explicit implementationprogram.

                                          I. INTRODUCTION


1.      This ProgramDocumentpresents a proposedtwo-tranche DevelopmentPolicyLoan(DPL)
in the amount of USN.1 billion to the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The operation is
designedto assist the Government of Rio Grande do Sul (RGS) to attain a more sustainable fiscal
position and undertake important public sector reforms. The proceeds o f the proposed loan will
used to restructure part o f the state's debts and smooth its debt servicingprofile. It will provide financial
support at a critical juncture, as a new administration pursues policies to reverse a non-sustainable fiscal
position. The proposed operation i s also a priority for the Federal Government, since it will enhance
compliance by the state with the federal Fiscal Responsibility Law.

2.      Rio Grande do Sul is an importantstate in Braziland its economicperformance may have
nationalrepercussions. RGS is the fourth largest state economy inBrazil, with a GDP o fUS$90billion
(7.5 percent o f national GDP). The economy i s well diversified, with highly developed agro-business
and industrial sectors that make the state an export leader in the country. Rio Grande do Sul has a
population o f 11 million inhabitants. Its human development indicators are above average for Brazil.
But over the last few years, its economic performance and social welfare indicators have been lagging,
due inpart to the state's chronic fiscal problems.

3.      The State has one of the most difficult fiscal situations of any state in Brazil. RGS is one o f
only two states (out o f 27) that have been unable to comply with the federal Fiscal Responsibility Law
(LRF). Years of rising expenditures, extensive use of tax incentives, generous social security benefits,
and a growing civil service have led to a highlevel o f indebtedness and a rigid fiscal structure. Inthe last
few years, the weak fiscal position and limited financing forced a sharp reduction in investment spending
and a freeze in several areas o f spending. The ensuing reduction inthe quality o f public services led to a
growing realizationo f the needto correct the situation.

4.      The current administration is cognizant of the major challenges confronting the state and
has moved forcefully to deal with them. Upon taking office in early 2007, the Government rapidly
began improving the fiscal position by controlling expenditures, increasing revenues, and implementing
structural reforms. The initial result was an impressive fiscal adjustment. With the recognition that
those initial measures need to be sustained and buttressed by more fundamental reforms, the
administration developed and i s implementing a far reaching programo f medium-term reforms.

5.      The program supported by this operation is broad based and reflects a commitment to a
multi-year processof reforms. The program can be dividedinto four areas: (a) fiscal consolidation; (b)
debt restructuring; (c) social security reforms; and (d) modernization o f the public sector (Annex 1). The
actions include, among others, a rationalization o f expenditures, improving tax collection efficiency,
limitingthe use of tax expenditures, improving fiscal and debt management systems, restructuringo f the
state's debt, reforming the social security system, modernizing public sector management, reorganizing
the civil service, and improving the provision o f public services. The proposed DPL i s multi-tranched in
order to support policy continuity. The disbursement o f the first tranche would be made on the basis o f
actions already implemented.         The second tranche i s expected to be disbursed following the
implementation o fpolicy actions in2009.

6.       The proposed operation has the support of the Federal Government. Federal authorities
place considerable strategic relevance on ensuring that RGS resumes a sustainable fiscal trajectory and
are keen on RGS complying with the Fiscal Responsibility Law (LRF). This landmark legislation
enacted in 2000 caused much o f the improvement in Brazil's fiscal performance o f the last few years.
Most states have adopted prudent fiscal policies under the law, but Rio Grande do Sul has not been able
to meet LRF debt indicators and other fiscal targets.       As in most legislation o f this type, institutional
mechanisms are included in order to be able to bring subnational authorities outside o f the legislation
back in line in an orderly manner. The debt restructuring and significant program o f reforms supported
by this loanreinforces the institutionalmechanismsbuiltinto the LFR.


                              11.      COUNTRYAND STATE CONTEXT

         A.      RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS INBRAZIL

7.       After years of responsible macroeconomic management and a benign international
environment, Brazil has entered a period of robust economic growth and poverty reduction. The
Brazilian economy grew by 5.4 percent in 2007 well above average annual grow inrecent decades Cjust
below 3 percent).     This growth has been accompanied by fiscal and external equilibrium and low
inflation. A recent increase in investment suggests that this spurt may be more sustainable than past
episodes. Growthresumptionand the adoption o f targeted social policies resulted inpronounced poverty
and income inequality reductions. The poverty rate dropped to 25.6 percent in 2006 from 32.9 percent in
2003. The Gini index also continued to fall to 0.56 in2006 from 0.59 in2002).

8.       There are several factors that explain the improvement in Brazilian macroeconomic
conditions. A strong fiscal policy based on primary fiscal surpluses has been at the core of sound
macroeconomic policies. During2003-07 the public sector primary surplus averaged 4 percent o f GDP.
The primary surplus, falling interest rates and more robust GDP growth caused public debt to fall to 43
percent o f GDP in December 2007.         The introduction o f an inflation targeting regime has reduced
inflation and nominal interest rates. Inflation fell from 12.5 percent in 2002 to 4.4 percent in 2007. The
headline interest rate (SELIC) has fallen from a peak o f about 26.5 percent in 2003 to 11.25 percent in
early 2008. Real interest rates -- at about 8 percent-- continue to be highby international standards.

9.       Strong macroeconomic fundamentals and a flexible exchange rate have strengthened
external indicators and made Brazil more resilient to external shocks. External debt sustainability
indicators are stronger than they have been in 30 years. The strength o f Brazil's external position allowed
Brazil to make an early repayment o f its entire outstanding obligations to the IMFinDecember 2005 and
to the Paris Club in2006, as well as to retire its Brady Bonds in 2006. The limited domestic effects thus
far from on-going volatility ininternational financial markets suggest that Brazil i s now better positioned
to absorb temporary financial shocks. International reserves are historically high (US$l90 billion) and
net external debt is negative. All credit rating agencies have upgraded Brazilian sovereign debt and
expect continued strengthening o f external debt indicators. Brazil i s now one-level below investment
grade.

10.      Despite this impressive performance, Brazil's economic performance could improve in
some areas. One inparticular i s the quality and sustainability o f the fiscal adjustment. Fiscal adjustment
over the last few years has been accomplished through strong revenue increases and by curtailing public
investment. There i s limited scope for further fiscal adjustment based on revenue increases or investment
cuts.

11.      However, the fiscal position of the states has improved significantly. Prior to 2000 the fiscal
stance o f sub-national governments was an important source o f fiscal disequilibrium in Brazil.


                                                      2

Expansionary fiscal policies and the lack of controls on indebtedness resulted in Erequent sub-national
debt crises. After the signing o fthe debt renegotiationcontracts with the National Treasury Secretariat in
1997 and the enactment o f the Fiscal Responsibility Law (LRF) in2000, sub-national governments were
obligated to adopt fiscal adjustment measures (see Box 1). The strict observance o f the debt renegotiation
contracts and the LRFresulted in a significant improvement in state government fiscal performance (see
Figure 1.) The increasing primary balances obtained by sub-national governments represented a
contribution o f about 25 percent to the total public sector fiscal adjustment effort.                       Continue state
compliance with the LRFi s thus essential for the macroeconomic stability o fthe country.


Box 1. BrazilianFiscal Federalism and the Control of Sub-National Fiscal Performance*

The fiscal stance o f Brazilian states is a key element in macroeconomic management in Brazil. Untilthe late 1990s,
the expansionary fiscal policies o f the states and the lack o f effective controls over their indebtedness resulted in
frequent sub-national debt crises. On three different occasions (1989, 1993 and 1997) the Federal Government had to
assume and reschedule the debts o f the states. The largest operation occurred in 1997, under Law 9496, when the
Federal Government restructuredR$200 billion(12 percent o f national GDP) of the debts owed by the states.

Inthe 1997refinancing operation, the debts were refinancedfor 30 years. This refinanced debt, so called intra-limite
debt, cames a real interest rate o f 6 percent, with the nominal value of the debt risingby inflation. One feature o f the
agreement was the capping o f the debt service at 13 percent o f states' net current revenues. Any debt service above
the 13 percent cap i s recapitalized and added to the intra-limite debt stock. At the end o f the contracts (in 2028), if
there are residual debt balances, the state will have to pay o f f the remainder within 10years

The 1997 bailout was conditioned upon the state's compliance with medium-term fiscal adjustment and structural
reformprograms. Inexchange for the rescue package, the debt renegotiation contracts mandate the implementation o f
three-year rolling Programs of Fiscal Adjustment (PAFs) to be agreed upon by the National Treasury Secretariat and
the 25 states that had their debt restructured by the STN during the period of the contract. The PAFs set annual
targets on indebtedness, primary balances, personnel spending, tax revenue and public investment, in order to
guarantee a gradual decline in indebtedness. Inaddition, the PAFs include structural reforms such as privatization or
other public sector modernization initiatives.

In2000, the controls on sub national fiscal performance were strengthened by the Fiscal Responsibility Law (LRF).
The LRF institutionalized fiscal discipline at all levels o f government, incorporating hard budget constraints into a
single unifjmg framework. The LRF explicitly prohibits debt refinancing operations between different levels o f
government (which moderates the moral hazardproblem inintergovernmental fiscal relations derived from sequential
bailouts,) set limits on personnel costs, credit operations, total debt, debt servicing, and guarantees. Complementary
resolutions from the Senate limit sub national borrowing.

Despite its demonstrated effectiveness, the system o f hierarchical controls on sub national fiscal behavior suffers from
important limitations. First, the debt renegotiation contracts bring considerable risk to the creditor, the STN. After
the rescheduling o f the debts, STN now holds more than 90 percent o f the total sub national debt. In addition, more
than 85 percent o f the financial assets held by the S T N correspond to the renegotiated debts o f sub national
governments (Laws 9496, 2185 and 8727). Both the fact that S T N is the relevant creditor for sub national
governments and the highshare o f sub national debt on STN assets exacerbate its credit risk.

Inaddition, the use o fthe GeneralPrice Index (IGP) for the correction o fdebt balances has introduced a highdegree
o f volatility and complicates states' debt dynamics. With the abandonment o f the fixed exchange rate regime in 1999
the increase in the IGP has been higher than other price indexes. After the strong depreciation o f 2002 that led the
IGP to increase by 28 percent that year, the exchange rate returned to pre-2000 levels, but the IGP continue to grow.
As a result, the IGP grew by 90 percent from 2000 to 2007, a rate much higher than that observed for the Consumer
Price Index (IPCA), which grew by only 62 percent inthe same period. Therefore the use o f the General Price Index
has introduced an additional element o f volatility and contributed to the rapid growth of state debts.

12.     Rio Grande do Sul has had difficulties complying with the Fiscal Responsibility Law. The
state has not been able to meet most of the requirements of the law since its enactment in 2000. RGS i s
the most indebted of the 27 state governments. Its debt i s above the LRF indebtedness ceiling of 200
percent of net current revenue.     Figure 2 shows that the state has also been slow in reducing its
indebtedness. Personnel expenditures by RGS absorb more than 70 percent of its Net Current Revenue
(NCR), which i s the highest ratio among Brazilian states, exceeding the LRF limit of 60 percent. Debt
service payments represent 13.5 percent of NCR, which i s above the LRF limit of 11.5 percent. Since
1998 the state has only partially met the targets in the PAFs negotiated with the National Treasury
Secretariat (Annex 5).

13.     Both Federal and State authorities recognize the importance of placing Rio Grande do Sul
on a fiscal path that will ensure future compliance with the LFW. Without the short- and medium-
term fiscal turnaround embodied in the proposed loan, RGS's situation could put the existing LW
framework at risk. A focused effort to address the situation is thus o f considerable importance.


        B.        ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS INRIO GRANDEDO SUL

B.1 Economic and social developmentsin Rio Grande do SUI

14.     Located at the extreme south of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul is the fourth largest state
economy and the fifth largest in population. The State's GDP in 2007 reached R $ 175 billion (US$90
billion) and represents 7.4 percent o f national GDP. Industry and services each represent 44 percent o f
state GDP, while agriculture contributes the remaining 12 percent. Economic activity i s driven by export
sectors, high-productivity ago-business, and a well developed industrial sector. Rio Grande do Sul has a
population o f 11million inhabitants, representing 6 percent o f the Brazilianpopulation.

15.     Rio Grande do Sul is a well developed state and has enjoyed high socio-economic welfare
standards in the Brazilian context. Per capita GDP was US$8,100 in 2007, the fourth highest inBrazil
and 16 percent larger than the national average. Social indicators are also well above national averages.
In2006, Rio Grande do Sul's poverty headcountrate was 17.1 percent, the fifth lowest inthe country.
Income inequality i s also much lower than national figures. Education and health indicatorsare also well
above national averages. (See Table 1.)

16.     Despite the privileged position that Rio Grande do Sul holds in the Brazilian context,
economic and social development has deteriorated since the mid 1990's. RGS economic growth has
been anemic, averaging 2.1 percent from 1994 to 2006, lower than the national economic growth o f 3.1
percent in the same period. As a consequence, Rio Grande do Sul's share in national GDP has fallen
from 8.9 percent in 1996 to 6.8 percent in2007.

17.     The state's growth has been very volatile, with large expansions followed by strong
recessions. The state's economy i s more volatile than the national one. While long run trends are
similar, in the short run the RGS growth cycle has a variance two times larger than the national one

18.      The difficult fiscal situation i s behind the recent deterioration in economic and social
conditions. Chronic fiscal imbalances have reduced the investment capacity o f the state government,
harming growth prospects and social development. Continuous fiscal deficits from the seventies to the
nineties led to a debt overhang. This, combined with increasing current expenditures (derived from high
debt service payments, rising personnel expenditures, and civil service pension deficits), has squeezed
the fiscal space for public infrastructure investments. Public investment fell from 30 percent of state
government revenues inthe eighties to less than 3 percent in2007 (see Figure 4 below).

19.      Analysis of public services indicates that the fiscal crisis and the consequent deterioration
of public services have had negative impact on the poor. Based on the Household Survey (PNAD) for
2006, incidence analysis shows that in Rio Grande do Sul, students from low income families generally
go to public schools and that the low income population tends to utilize public health units, while high
income groups attend private schools and use private health providers.2 The fiscal crisis thus hinders the
Government from improving income inequality and promoting equal opportunities inthe state.


B.2 Structural Fiscal Imbalances


20.      Rio Grande do Sul currently has the most difficult fiscal situation of all 27 Brazilian state
governments. The difficult fiscal situation o f Rio Grande do Sul results from its poor management o f
fiscal policy. From the seventies to the nineties, the state was unable to generate positive primary
balances. Despite the increasing incompatibility between expenditures and fiscal revenues, RGS used a
variety o f mechanisms, including debt accumulation, mandating loans from the state bank, the spending
o fprivatization proceeds, and floating debt financing to maintain its level o f expenditures.

21.      Following the debt renegotiations agreement and the passage of the LRF, successive
administrations have tried to restore fiscal sustainability. Since 1998, several administrations
attempted fiscal adjustments only to see their efforts interrupted towards the end of their four-year terms.
In most instances, adverse shocks affected state revenues and made the adjustment initiatives more
difficult to follow. As the political costs o f adjustments were high and the results o f the initial measures
were not immediate, tight fiscal stances were abandoned by state administrations. Thus, initial
adjustment efforts were followed by wage increases to compensate accumulated real salary losses,
expenditure expansions or tax reductions. These reversals left increasingly difficult fiscal situations for
incoming administrations.

22.      The sources of the structural and entrenched fiscal imbalances are many. They reflect poor
revenue efforts, an increasing trend in personnel expenditures, a large structural deficit o f the state's
social security system, the state's debt dynamics, and a rigid structure inthe provision o f a large array o f
public services.

         Revenue and Expenditure Issues

23.      Poor revenue performance has made fiscal adjustment efforts and debt dynamics more
difficult. The slow growth o f the state economy, the extensive use o f tax incentives to attract investment
to the state, and the fact that the exports, the most dynamic sector in the state economy, are exempted
from taxation (in line with national legislation), together explain the state's poor revenue performance.
Net Current Revenues (NCR), an important measure in Brazil since many o f the fiscal targets are
measured against it, i s approximately 8.2 percent o f the state's GDP. Total revenues are about 11.8
percent, with the difference between total and NCR being the transfers to municipalities. The Value
Added Tax (VAT) contributes close to 85 percent o f tax revenues. However, the state ranked 24" out o f
27 states in 2004 in terms o f VAT revenues per GDP, because o f the economy's large export share and
Brazil's zero-tax rate for VAT on exports.       There i s also considerable use o f tax incentives, some the
result o f national legislation, others because o f competition among the states. Studies show that "fiscal
incentives" (e.g. tax exemptions) amount to roughly 35 percent o f the potential revenues o f the state.
Another 30 percent i s perhaps lost due to inefficient collection. The poor performance o f revenues not
only affects fiscal balances, but also the debt dynamics, since capitalization o f debt service payments

under the agreements with the Federal Government are based on the state's net current revenues (given
the low NCR more o f the debt service i s capitalized at highrates).

24.     On the expenditure side, the increasing trend of personnel expenditures has limited the
Government's ability to promote a strong turnaround in the fiscal accounts of the state. Total
expenditures of the state central functions are approximately 12.3 percent o f GDP, and have been
growing in real terms by about 3.5 percent per annum over the last few years. Personnel expenditures
account for approximately 70 percent o f state current revenues.       Employee compensation has been
growing, mostly outside the Executive Branch. While RGS has maintained a constant number o f civil
servants and restrained the growth o f the payroll for the Executive Branch, it was unable to restrain
salary increases for the other branches o f government, as these are not within the Government's control.
As shown inFigure 5, from 2000 to 2006 the real increase inthe executive branch's payroll billwas only
4 percent, while the personnel expenses in the Public Attorney's Office, the Judiciary and indirect
administrative grew by 58 percent, 38 percent and 28 percent respectively during the same period. The
other branches o f government also account for rapid increases in expenditures o f goods and services,
which have risen by more than 30 percent inreal terms during the same period, mostly because o f a lack
o f control over procurement. The rigid structure o f expenditures has exerted strong pressure on state
finances, and has severely limited the room for expenditure cuts to a small set o f discretionary expenses.

        Imbalances of the Pension System

25.     The increasing deficit in the civil service pensionsystem underpins the state's inabilityto
curb the increasingtrend of current expenses. Retired personnel and their beneficiaries (survivors)
represent 48 percent o f all state servants, and pension benefits consume more than 45 percent o f total
personnel expenditures (Figure 6). The pension scheme for the public employees o f the state o f RGS
(the Regime Prbprio de Previdzncia Social (RPPS)) has been running large deficits o f about
approximately 2.6 percent o f GDP over the last few years), or almost 30 percent o f RGS current revenue.

26.       Imbalances in the pension system are a common problem for all three levels of government
in Brazil, but inR o Grande do Sul these imbalances are much higher than in other states. Pension
contribution revenues inRGS are essentially in line with those o f other states. However, expenditures are
significantly larger, resulting in notably larger deficit than those o f the average state RPPS. As a
consequence deficits in the RGS civil service pension system are 70 percent larger than the average for
the rest o fthe Brazilian state^.^

27.       The large deficit of the Pension System of R G S is a result of the mature nature of the
system. The dependency ratio in RGS (the ratio o f inactive to active workers) is 65 percent, roughly
comparable to the dependency ratio o f the pension scheme o f the federal executive branch and the state
o f Rio de Janeiro (around 65 percent), and significantly higher than the ratio for the state o f Ssio Paulo
(42 percent) or the average state RPPS (40 percent). These differences are explained by factors such as
demographic differences, administrative inefficiencies, and an adverse remuneration incentive structure
for specific careers (for instance, rules excessively reward early retirement for teachers). By contrast, the
ratio of survivors to total beneficiaries i s significantly lower in RGS compared to the other mature
schemes o f Ssio Paulo, Rio de Janeiro or federal civil servants inthe Executive Branch. This suggest that
the ratio of survivors to beneficiaries i s likely to increase in the future given recent patterns o f fertility
rates, indicatingthat the RGS scheme may become increasingly imbalanced inthe near future.

28.       Over the past few years, two Constitutional Amendments were introduced in an attempt to
reduce the imbalances of the civil service pensions systems at the national and state levels:                  Some
short-run measures included levying o f pension contributions for current retirement and pensionbenefits
and the introduction o f stricter conditions for retirement. Most o f these measures, however, have had
limited effects. The important changes will not have sizeable impacts until 2028 when the new civil
servants affected by the 2003 reform begin to retire.




3.   Annex 7 provides a comprehensive analysis of the state civil service pension system and the envisaged impacts
o f the reforms supported by the proposed operation. A technical note on the civil service social security system can
be found in:The W     S inthe state of Rio Grande do Sul.

29.      RGS civil service pension deficits are expected to rise over the next several years. As with
the other social security systems in Brazil, the system in RGS i s also scheduled to grow until 2028
(Figure 7). Under reasonable ass~mptions,~expenditures on pensions and disability benefits for all
branches o f government should remain stable relative to the state's GDP over the next 25 years, while
pensions for survivors are expected to grow.6 Without any reform the imbalances in the pension system
will experience a small increase over the next two decades, remaining at between 2.5 - 3 percent o f state
GDP.

30.      There are several features that make the RGS Social Security more generous than others.
The imbalances o f civil service pension schemes inRGS i s to a large extent the result o f generous benefit
rules and eligibility criteria enshrined in the Federal Constitution, but in RGS are magnified by specific
design flaws stemming from state legislation and administrative practices. Among the most distortionary
compensation practices that affect pensions benefits are the special bonuses incorporated inthe pension
base, bonus for additional hours worked, multiple contracts, inefficient compensation structure,
automatic pre-retirement promotions and relaxation o f indexation rules. The correction o f these
anomalies could bringshort term savings.


         Public Sector Inefficiencies

31.      Other factors leading to increased pressure on expenditures are the growth of the public
sector and inefficiencies. The State provides a wide array o f services and faces growing demand for
expanding the network o f services.       The State has a total o f 76 entities, among then 17 ministries
(secretaries), 20 foundations, 7 state enterprises, 12 central agencies, 15 joint societies, and another 12
independent agencies. Most o f these are governed by different management and budgetary systems that
have become quite unwieldy. The state has a total o f 183,000 active employees. This structure, when
combined with a deficient human resource management system and protective legislation that thwarts
labor flexibility, explains much o f the increase pressures on expenditures. Unless the state finds way to
improve the provision o f services, these pressures will continue.


5.  Projections are based on the assumption that GDP will grow at 3.5 percent of GDP, number o f the civil servant
positions will grow inline withpopulation and the ratio o f wage bill to GDP will remain constant.
6.  It is also noteworthy that pension expenditures in RGS start increasing from a higher initial level, reflecting its
higher level of maturity.


                                                         10

32.      An area that requires special attention is the management of human resources. The civil
service system in the state suffers from many deficiencies, such as: an inadequate career structure; an
inefficient deployment o f civil servants,' lack o fwork force planning; bewildering compensation systems
(with different types o f compensation and privileges for different groups); salary increases linked to
seniority and not performance; the absence o f coherent policies for professional development and
training; and a distorted system o f incentives, particularly those associated to the generous pension
system. The overall impact is a very costly and inefficient work force inthe state.


         Debt Dynamics

33.      Fiscal pressure also arises from very unfavorable debt dynamics. The state has some costly
debt, high debt service obligations and an uneven profile o f debt payments. Inparticular, the state debt
profile presents an accumulation o f debt service obligations over the next four years that increases the
scale and difficulty o f fiscal adjustment. The consolidated debt o f Rio Grande do Sul was R$35.9 billion
(roughly US$20 billion) in December 2007, equal to 254 percent o f its net current revenues and well
above the LRFlimit of 200 percent.8

34.      Most of the R G S debt i s held by the Federal Government. The debt with the Federal
Government represents 88 percent o f the state's debt, while other domestic debt accounts for 4 percent o f
the total, the judiciary debt (precatdrios) 5 percent, and external debt 3 percent. The bulk o f RGS debt
with the Federal Government was established under the debt refinancing agreement signed with the
National Treasury Secretariat. As explained above, under Law 9496 o f the debt renegotiation agreement,
the state debt was divided intwo components:

         0   Intra-limite debt i s all debt covered under the 1997 restructuringprogram as well as residual
             debt from the previous bail-out operations o f 1989 and 1993. The intra-limite debt (R$ 30.1
             billion in 2007) represents more than 80 percent o f the state's total debt. Under the Law
             9496, the real interest rate was set at 6 percent, and nominal value o f the debt was indexed to
             a price level. The annual debt service on this debt was capped at 13 percent o f state's real
             net revenues, and any amount above this cap i s automatically capitalized. Thus, the 13
             percent debt service ceiling provides an effective smoothing mechanism o f the debt service
             profile, but clearly does not ensure debt sustainability.

         0   Extra-limite debt includes all the remaining debts that were not renegotiated with the S T N
             and any new debt contracted after the debt renegotiation o f 1997. RGS extra-limite debt
             amounts to R $ 3.6 billion or 12 percent o f the state's total debt. It includes the external debt,
             the debt under the Program o f State Bank Restructuring (PROES), a floating rate bond debt
             (LFT) linked to the Brazilian Central Bank headline rate, a debt with the pension fund for
             employees o f the state bank Banrisul (Fundapio Banrisul, FB) and other small debts. In
             addition, it also includes contingent liabilities, most o f them coming from judicial decisions
             (so called precatdrios) that also contribute to debt accumulation and high volatility o f debt
             service payments.




7. For example, there i s an excessive number of teachers in the state, recently the Secretary o f Education closed
schools and let off 1,400 temporary teachers, giventhat there were schools with 5 teachers and 20 students.
8.  For the states that were above the LW ceiling o f 200 percent in 2000 (when the law was enacted), a uniform
declining path for their debts to revenues ratios was established so that they would reach 200 percent in 2015. The
declining path for the RGS indebtedness currently suggests that the debt to revenue ratio at 2015 will be, without
reforms, at 244 percent which means that RGS is ten percentage points above the LRF declining path.

35.     The extra-limite debt, which is being refinancedunder the proposedloan, generates a very
unevendebt profilevarying from 2 to 5 percent of NCR in the near term. Projected debt service on
extra-limite debt shows a strong accumulation o f debt payments during the period from 2008-2012. (See
Figure 8.)  Ifnot eliminated, this rise inprojecteddebt service could leadto further reductions inother
expenditures by the State Government.

36.     The cumulative impact of the factors noted above, from the weak revenue structure to the
debt dynamics, reveals a fiscal situation that will worsen in the future unless significant measures
are taken now. Fiscalprojectionsindicate a very difficult financial situation, which according to current
trends will lead to increasing deficits, rising debt and debt servicing and a likely elimination inthe fiscal
space available for public investment and expanding public services.

37.     Rio Grande do Sul is thus facing one of the biggest economic challenges in its history: It
will have to take decisive action and introduce persistent measures to promote a strong and permanent
turnaround o f its public finances, thus establishing a fiscal sustainable path that would allow the state
government to once again foster sound economic growth.




                              111.    THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM


38.     Governor Yeda Crusius ran her election campaign on a platform of guiding the state
towards a sounder and a more sustainable fiscal position. The Governor was able to impress upon
the electorate the dangers that a non-sustainable fiscal position could pose to the future o f the state's
economy. Her platform also emphasized that an insolvent and ineffective public sector was hindering
Rio Grande do Sul inits efforts to have a dynamic, competitive, export oriented private sector.




                                                      12

39.      Upon taking office in early 2007, the new administration moved quickly and forcefully to
deal with the fiscal situation of the state. The Government concentrated its efforts on two priorities:
(a) the implementation o f a strong emergency fiscal adjustment in the short run; and (b) a process o f
reorganizingand modernizingthe state's public administration system. The latter was the core of a series
of medium-term measures designed to reinforce and consolidate the emergency fiscal adjustment and to
ensure longrunfiscal sustainability.

40.      Following the initial emergency measures, the Government proceeded to work on its
medium-term program.             The administration prepared a broad based Multi-Year Plan (Pluno
Pluriunual, PPA)9designed to: attain economic growth rates above the national average; attract new
investment to diversify the state's economy; promote technological innovation; reestablish RGS's
leadership position innational education; improve public security; strengthen the health care system; and
rationalize the management o f water resources. The program o f the state i s explained in greater detail in
Annex 1o fthe Letter o f Development Policy (LDP).

41.      At the core of the program is a public sector reform agenda.                         The Government
recognizes that to buttress and sustain the fiscal adjustment there is a need to carry out
fundamental public sector reforms. Hence, the Government has made the center piece o f its
program a wide-ranging and comprehensive reform o f public sector management. The pillars o f
this initiative are: (a) the identification o fpriority (or strategic) programs, which will be managed
through results based agreements; (b) the transfer o f the provision o f non-essential public
services to outside partners; (c) the establishment o f management contracts for the state
enterprises; and (d) an overhaul o f the human resource administration system. All o f these
policies, along with the reform o f the social security system, are designed to contribute to the
fiscal adjustment and improve the efficiency o f the public sector, through the establishment of
modem management practices and a capable civil service operating under aligned incentives.


         A.       THE EMERGENCYFISCAL ADJUSTMENT OF 2007

42.      Shortly after taking office in January 2007, the newly-elected administration quickly
introduced emergency measures to reduce the projected deficit for 2007. The package encompassed
initiatives to reduce discretionary expenses and increase state tax revenues. On the expenditure side, the
Government: eliminated 20 percent of commissioned positions (about 750 positions); restructured the
Executive Branch (reducing from 76 entities to 69 entities); issued a decree imposing expenditure
ceilings for all the state secretariats and indirect administration entities; mandated a linear cut o f about 30
percent in the operating cost o f all the state secretariats; and finally implemented a reduction inplanned
investment by more than 50 percent.

43.      On the revenue side, Government actions were geared toward increasing tax collection
efficiency and obtaining quick revenue increases. Given the restrictions on raising tax rates duringan
on-going fiscal year, the Government measures concentrated on improving tax collection efficiency. It
introducednew managerial tools to reduce tax evasion (a matrix management model) and embarked on a
revision o f the system of tax credit devolution to exporters, in order to restrict its abuses. Other measures


9. The PPA is the central piece o f the planning system inBrazil. The LRF request that federal, state and municipal
administrations with more than 200 thousand inhabitant to prepare during their first year in office a multi-year
expenditure plan. The PPA defines the Government's medium-term objectives that orients the state's multi-year
expenditure plan and it i s built on consultations and dialogue with other branches o f government, civil society,
workers, and employers, including long-term plans on regional development, logistics, and transport, and other long-
term strategies.


                                                        13

to raise revenues included the implementation o f the Growth Incentive Program(Cresce RS), which was
designed to stimulate those sectors o f the economy with great revenue generating potential. It also
mandated the use o f electronic fiscal receipts, in order to avoid tax evasion in interstate trade (RGS
accounted for 60 percent o f all fiscal receipts issued electronically inBrazil in2007).

44.      The Government also embarked on a process, coordinated with the Federal Government,
to restructure part of its debts. As noted above, a sharp expected rise extra-limite debt service for the
period 2008-2012 will place additional pressures on the already weak state public finances, and would
require further expenditures cuts, unless the state was able to refinance those debts. The authorities took
advantage o f the Article 7 o f the LRF, which allows highly indebted states to contract credit operations
for debt restructuring under a fiscal program agreed with the Federal Government.          Thus, the state
authorities entered into negotiations with the National Treasury Secretariat (STN) regarding a potential
debt restructuring operation to smooth the very uneven debt profile. As a result of the negotiations, the
state approached the World Bank for the loanbeingpresented for debt restructuring.

45.      Finally, in order to begin dealing with deficits of the civil service pension system, the
government created a pension fund for new civil servants. Usinghalf o f the proceeds from the initial
public offering for the state bank (Banrisul, which raised a total o f about US$1.2 billion in July 2007),
the Government received the approval o f the State Assembly to place these proceeds into a
complementary pension fund for new civil servants entering the state public sector after 2003. The new
cohort will be under a new system, which places a ceiling on the state's RGPS contributions and benefits.
This new arrangement will generate future savings as the complementary fund will be financed by
personal contributions in excess o f the public ceiling. The draft law regulating this complementary
pension system and its fundi s currently being discussed inthe State Assembly.

46.      The fiscal adjustment results in the first year of the new government have been substantial.
Favored by the strong recovery o f state economic activity, the state increased its primary fiscal balances
to R$967 million in 2007 (6.9 percent o f Net Current Revenues, NCR) compared to 3.4 percent o f NCR
in 2006 (Figure 9). The gross operating deficit was reduced to R$472 million in 2007 (3.4 percent o f
NCR) from 5.1 percent o f NCR in2006. Net lending was also reduced to R$853 million (6.1 percent o f
NCR) from 10 percent o f N C R in 2006. As a consequence, the budget deficit was reducedto R $ l billion
(7.8 percent o f NCR), down from R$2.6 billion in 2006 (19 percent o f NCR) and much lower than the
initially projectedbudget deficit o f R$2.4 billion

47.      The Plan also included structural reforms such as social security reforms and public sector
modernization initiatives. Part o f the package submitted to the State Assembly was a draft law for the


                                                       14

creation o f a single administrator o f all o fthe state's pension systems (Gestor Unico du Previdenciu) and
the regulation o f the complementary fund for new state civil servants (similar to draft federal civil
servants law recently submittedto the national congress.) Finally, the Recovery Plan contained a block o f
measures targeting the modernization o f public sector management, including legislation regulating
partnership with non-governmental providers o f services through OSCIPs (Organizapio du Sociedude
Civil de Interesse Publico, Civil Society Organizations with Public Interest), the creation o f the
Government School and the establishment o f management committees (Cornit&de GestLio dus Estutuis)
to enhance the Executive's control o f state enterprises and other indirect administration entities.

48.      The State Assembly voted down part of the Recovery Plan, but this short run setback did
not deter the Executivecommitmentto fiscal adjustment. Political factors ledto a rejection o fthe tax
increase package and the draft fiscal responsibility law inNovember 2007. While there was recognition
o f the need to deal with the fiscal situation, legislators could not agree on the components of the package.
As a result, the executive took compensatory measures to make up for the potential loss o f revenues by
extending the coverage o f the tax substitution regime, which i s geared at reducing tax evasion on the state
VAT. The Government also pursued a more aggressive a reduction o f tax expenditures (such as fiscal
incentives through tax exemptions, presumed VAT credits, and reduced tax bases).

49.      Subsequently,the State Assembly approved other elements of the Fiscal Recovery Plan.In
December 2007 the assembly passed legislation authorizing the creation o f OSCIPs, which are
partnerships for the provision o f non-essential public services.       It also approved the formation of a
Government School (for training and capacity building o f civil servants) and the use o f distinct
management tools in the public sector. InFebruary 2007, the State Assembly approved the proposal for
the single administrator o f the state pension system (Gestor Unico da Previdhcia), which i s key for
consolidating and standardizing information and management o f benefits. InMarch 2007, the Assembly
also unanimously approved the proposed Bank loan, presented here, which reflects its support the
program.

50.      The consolidation of current adjustment efforts will now depend on dealing with
unfavorabledebt dynamics and on pursuingkey structuralreforms in the areas of civil servants'
pensionsand public sector management. The reforms discussed indetail below have several features
in common. They are geared towards curbing the growth o f expenditures, improving public sector
efficiency, making better use o f human resources, rationalizing the provision o f public services, and in
general, modernizing the public sector.


         B.       DEBTRESTRUCTURING

51.      One of the objectives of the State Government is to smooth the profile of its debt service,
while at the same time reducing the risks associated with its current debt composition. With
technical assistance from the Bank, the state government has designed a debt restructuring operation that
will substitute cheaper debt with more predictable debt servicing, for high cost open-ended debt with a
variable servicingprofile.

52.      The administrationincluded inits Multi-Year plan (PPA 2008-2011) debt restructuring as
one o f the strategic projects that it intendedto pursue. During the preparation of the proposed
operation, the authorities and the Bank team worked intensively on measures to achieve
maximum debt reduction on a net present value terms and also to minimize the risks to a smooth
and more certain debt servicing profile. The design was accepted by the National Treasury
secretariat o f the Federal Government, which provided the approval to proceed with the proposed
operation. The operation focuses on the extra-Zimite debt, since this is the portion o f the State's



                                                         15

debt that generates the most uneven debt servicing and i s the most sensitive to changing
economic conditions. As explained in more detail below, there are several debts that will be
retired ifthe proposed loan is approved. The Bank loan is essentially the core financial element
that will make the debt restructuring possible. As shown in section V and Annex 6 o f this
document, the savings from a lower and smoother debt servicing profile lead to an estimated
reduction inprojectedpayments byR$332 million on net present value terms.


         C.      SOCIAL SECURITYREFORMS

53.      The reform of the civil service pension system (RPPS) is another priority established by the
State Government. The objective o f the proposed reforms in this area i s to reduce the large deficits
currently being generated by the pension system, which exert considerable pressure on state finances.
The proposed actions by the Government envisage a progressive reduction o f the share o f total state
spending devoted to retirees' benefits and the establishment o f a better relation between benefits and
contributions.

54.      The Government is planning to take several measures to deal with the social security
system. They are both administrative and policy related. In the administrative area, the measures
include: i)the establishment o f the single administrator o f the state WPS; and ii)institutional capacity
building for the State Pension Institute (Instituto de Previdgnciu do Estudo do Rio Grunde do Sul -
IPERGS), given that this institution will be the single administrator o f the WPS system. Inthe policy
area the Government plans to: i)introduce a new compensation system for public employees, by
strengthening the link between paid-up contributions and benefits; ii)create a complementary fund for
new civil servants; and iii)switch the indexation rule for survivor pensions from salary adjustments to
inflation.

55.      The Government has already launched the reform process of the civil servants' pension
system. Last September the Government sent to the State Assembly two draft proposals for the creation
o f the single administrator o f the state pension system (Gestor Unico du Previdgnciu) and the regulation
o f the complementary fund for new state civil servants. The creation o f the single administrator o f the
state W P S was approved by the Assembly inFebruary, while the law regulating the complementary fund
has followed the regular procedural steps for its congressional approval and it i s expected to be voted by
May. The introduction o f a single administrator i s crucial to bring order, to consolidate information and
standardize procedures and benefits to the number o f civil servant system that are currently inplace.

56.      There are many key policy measures contemplated for the next two years, particularly
those related to establishing better links between benefits and contributions. They form part o f the
program being supported by the proposed operation, and are going to be implemented as the appropriate
conditions emerge. As noted in the LDP (Annex 1) the Government will introduce measures to link
benefits to average earnings, and not necessarily the most recent wages. The Government also intends to
use a new indexationprocedure, linkingpension benefits to prices instead o f wages but not until i s sure
that the use o f the price level will be more advantageous for its fiscal goals. Whereas, the possible
revision o f contributions will depend on political conditions and the ability o f the Government to achieve
the administrative savings planned for the next two years. As discussed in greater detail in section V and
in Annex 7, the potential savings o f all reforms could be about one percent o f GDP per year, over the
next several decades.

         D.       REFORMOF THE STATEPUBLICSECTOR



57.      The planned reform of the state public sector is multifaceted and comprehensive. It is
comprised of three main pillars (see Figure 10). The first pillar is the "rationalization program,"
which will cover revenue collection and expenditure management, and a review and reform o f
administrative processes and structures o f the State.        This contains the main actions aimed at
consolidating and expanding the fiscal savings obtained in the first year o f the new government. The
second pillar i s the "strengthening o f the state's planning capacity," which focuses on the selection o f
strategic (priority) programs that will receive special budget treatment and will be closely monitored.
These strategic programs will be the managed through the introduction o f modern results-based
agreements. Finally, the third pillar i s the overall "modernization o f public sector entities," which
includes: results-based managerial tools in public sector administration; developing innovative ways o f
delivering public services, as well as reforms incivil service and human resource management.

                                                                          HRstrengthening
                                                                            E-Government




         Pillar 1 Rationalization: consolidatingthe short run savings of thefiscal adjustment
                  -

58.      The first pillar of the program is designedto reinforce and sustain the initialfiscal actions
taken in 2007.        It focuses on rationalizing spending, enhancing revenue collection, pursuing
administrative restructuring, and streamlining institutional processes. As with the rest o f the public
sector reforms, each area i s organized under a strategic program. The strategic program that forms the
first pillar i s called "Fiscal Adjustment," and includes two projects: a) modernization o f the state
revenues, aimed at increasing tax collection; and b) rationalizationof expenditures.

59.      Several policy actions and administrative reforms are contemplated under the
modernizationof the state revenues project. The first is to institutionalize the "matrix management
model," which has been used successfully in other states, such as Minas Gerais. The model i s essentially
a new set o f procedures and a system to enhance tax collection efficiency. It will provide the State with
the ability to audit and cross-check tax claims from different sources (sectors and regions), thus
increasing its ability to enforce tax collection and detect evasions. Since oversight and responsibility for
tax administration lies with the Department o f State Public Revenue within the Finance Secretariat, the


                                                      17

Government i s using it to introduce a system o f accountability through a results agreement. This
agreement will establish clear revenue goals for DRPE, with incentives and penalties for the degree o f
compliance. This i s the first o f several results agreements being introducedinthe public sector.

60.      The second priority project for the rationalizationof public expenditures, called "Doing
More with Less", encompasses a set of activities designed to contain operating costs, decrease
waste, and ingeneralimprovethe effectivenessof public spending. The State Government will focus
on three major areas under this project. They are the budget system, procurement, and administrative
processes.

61.      Under the reform of the budget system, the Government is introducing a very ambitious
initiativeof Zero Base budgeting. The measures are designed to introduce the means to evaluate the
efficiency and effectiveness o f spending inpublic programs. The introduction o f a variety o f techniques,
such as cost accounting, public sector production functions, beneficiary scorecard, and performance
budgetingtools, will allow the Executiveto identify those programsthat should be further supported and
those that need restructuring.       The purpose o f introducing these tools i s also to assist with the
negotiations o f budget allocations among state secretariats. A pilot project along these lines is currently
being developed inthe State Secretariat o f Education (SEE).

62.      The other important component of the project is the modernization of the state
procurement system. Based on a diagnosis o fthe strength's andweaknesses o f the state's procurement
functions, the Government prepared an action plan to reform the existing system. The Government can
achieve considerable short-term savings by modernizing procurement and i s moving quickly with the
implementation o f the action plan designed in 2007. For example, the State Government introduced a
matrix management model to cross-check prices for purchases by different government agencies in order
to detect potential sources o f expenditure savings. The Government has estimated the savings resulting
from the use o f expense matrix management model in 2007 to be R$300 million; with further gains over
a longer implementationperiod, total savings could reach R$500 million inthe next few years. The Bank
has been providing technical assistance duringthe proposed loan preparation for the improvement o f the
procurement system".

63.      Finally, the project "Doing More with Less"                 also includes a rationalization of
administrative processes in different Government agencies. The objectives here are to make
government operations more efficient and services more easily accessible to citizens and private firms.
The Government already has a network o f centers where citizens can obtain a number o f documents,
permits or licenses. These will be enhanced, and the system will be reinforced with the creation o f one-
stop-shops, which will congregate many agencies in a single building in local communities.                The
Government i s also intent on reducing the number o fprocedures and bureaucratic requirements. The aim
i s not only to facilitate the provision o f services, but also to cut costs. Currently, the Government i s
implementing a pilot project that includes the reengineering o f 25 administrative processes in ten
government agencies with an expected gain o f R$ 150million.


        Pillar 2 Strengthening Planning Capacity: thestrategicprograms
                 -

64.     In order to effectively carry out its program, the Government has decided to strengthen
and restructure the planning capacity of the Executive. Starting with the preparation o f the Multi-
year plan (PPA) for 2008-201 1, the authorities started to promote a different approach to planning and its


10. A description of the existing state procurement system and the options for its enhancement is presented in:
RGS:the modernization ofthe state procurement system.


                                                       18

management functions.        First, the former state Planning and Coordination Secretariat absorbed
management responsibilities and became the state Secretariat o f Planning and Management (Secretaria
de Planejamento e Gestio, SEPLAG). The new agency was responsible for the preparation o f the multi-
year plan and will also now be in charge o f overseeing the implementation o f the main strategy behind
the plan.

65.     At the core of the new approach to planningand management is the creation of a structure
of "strategic programs" and "priority projects." The new plan identifies 11 strategic programs
(programas estruturantes), ranging from fiscal adjustment, as explained above, to modernization o f
public management (explained below), to health, education, security, infrastructure, innovation and
employment, among others. Each o f strategic programs i s composed o f very specific "priority projects"
where managerial responsibility lies. Under the PPA, there are 42 strategic projects that range from
actions to modernize public sector management to specific infrastructure investments that are considered
priority for the administration. The plan establishes priorities according to criteria grouped under three
areas: a) Social Development (an improved quality o f life for all citizens); b) Public Finances and Public
Sector Management (fostering the development of a state that better serves its people); and c) Sustainable
Economic Development (more and better employment opportunities).

66.     Strategic programs and priority projects have been chosen as the most important areas for
the current administration and will receive special attention. This will include the allocation o f
budget resources, and also close supervision. While these projects together represent a small part o f the
state budget (together they amount R$726 million or almost 20 percent o f the projected investment
budget for 2008-201l),   the strategic programs also introduce new management principles into the public
sector.

67.     The innovative aspect of the new multi-year plan is the manner in which the "strategic
programs" and "priority projects" will be managed. The main innovation is the introduction of
indicators and targets for the programs, along with an agreement (or contract) between the Executive and
Inter-Sectoral Chamber (or Multi Agency Policy Committee) that will be responsible for overseeing the
program. In turn, a more specific results-based agreement will be signed with the managers o f the
individual projects, thus clearly assigning managerial responsibility for the activities contemplated under
each project. The projects and programs will also receive intensive monitoring to guarantee their timely
and accurate implementation. Priority projects will also have funding predictability and will receive
budgetary treatment with predictable flows o f resources. Finally, the introduction o f results-based
management techniques with the use o f indicators, targets, implementation timetables, and monitoring
systems will facilitate the identification and solution o f problems. Each program manager will sign a
results agreement (termo de compromisso com resultados) with the Governor and the Planning
Secretariat inorder to align expectations and facilitate the feedback on goals attained.



        Pillar 3 Public Sector Modernization
               -

68.     The inadequate functioning of the public sector has played a significant role in the
deteriorating fiscal situation and the precarious quality of public service delivery. Deficiencies in
the state's public administration include: a fragmented and uncoordinated administrative structure; weak
planning and management capacities; inflexible human resource management; ineffective and
overgenerous compensation policies; and the delayed development o f e-government initiatives. The
reorganization and modernization o f the state's public administration i s therefore critical to guarantee the
sustainability o f current fiscal adjustment efforts and to improve the provision of public goods and
services. The government reorganization was designed to reduce its size and thereby obtain some fiscal




                                                     19

savings; but, more importantly, it was aimed at adjusting the public administration to the new
management model.

69.       In addition, results-oriented management will be also adopted by other government
entities. The results- oriented model applied to the autonomous entities (state enterprises and non-
dependent agencies) i s based on management contracts that define the responsibilities o fthe managers o f
these entities and grant them more autonomy to enhance accountability. The management contracts set
performance indicators for the entities as well as their counterparts inthe central administration. Ina first
phase, the managerial contracts will be adopted by state enterprises. Ina second phase, the use o f these
managerial tools will be extended to other entities in the indirect administration.          A Management
Committee was created to design, monitor, and assess these contracts. By the end o f March, the
Government will sign management contracts with six state enterprises.

70.       The Government's desire to expand and improve the quality of social service delivery has
led to a partnership policy with non-governmental providers of services, the so called Civil Society
Organizations for the Public Interest (Organizactio da Sociedade Civil de Interesse Publico,
OSCIPs).      The partnership with OSCIPs i s intended to be an instrument to enable a new form o f
partnership between the state and civil society inthe delivery o fpublic services, redefiningthe traditional
role o f the state. It i s expected that OSCIPs will bringefficiency gains to public service delivery derived
from their greater flexibility and will promote the responsiveness o f social services to the needs o f
citizens. OSCIPs are governed by the same regulations as the private sector and therefore enjoy greater
management flexibility than state agencies.       These organizations can also receive private funds in
addition to state grants and may create new partnerships to deliver services more effectively.

71.       The State Assembly has approved Law 12.901/2008, which established the legal foundation
of the OSCIP model in Rio Grande do Sul. The next step i s for the Government to convert certain
public entities to OSCIP management and then to identify non-profit organizations able to assume the
service delivery with a high probability o f success. The state Secretariat o f Justice and Social
Development (SJDS) will begin an assessment o f these agencies' institutional structure and evaluate the
quality o f their services before contracting the services to OSCIPs. The SJDS i s expected to sign
contracts with 4 OSCIPs during2008.

72.       The Government i s also undertaking measures to reform its human resource management
and shift the current performance culture to a results-based system. The Government has identified
the absence o f work force planning, inadequate salary scales, inflexible career options, and weak
management as the main problems affecting human resource management in the state. The civil service
reform program will tackle these difficulties. The objectives are to prepare a new personnel policy
designed to simplify career paths and compensation structures, introduce more flexibility and mobility
into the workforce, develop a new system o f promotions, and reform the anarchic system o f special
compensations.

73.       The state has already created a task force to design the so-called "New Personnel
Development Policy". This group i s preparing an action plan to be implemented during 2008. Given its
fiscal impacts on government personnel expenditures and the state pension system, a centerpiece o f the
HRreform is the civil service career review. The review will provide inputnot only on the design o fnew
compensation policies, but will also set forth the conditions necessary to overcome the excessive
fragmentation and rigidity o f careers that prevents a better allocation o f the workforce. The career review
will provide information on the qualifications o f current employees and will identify the demands for
training and specialized qualifications that will support workforce planning inthe state. The Government
i s committed to presenting a draft proposal to the State Assembly for the reform o f the career structure
and implementingthe action plan that i s being prepared. Finally, to support the transition to results-based




                                                      20

management, the Government i s creating a broader career path called the "public managers' career"
(carreira de gestores).

74.     In addition, the Government founded the School of Government in December 2007 to
supportthe change inmanagerialculture. The School will provide technical courses for civil servants
involved in sector policies and will create a space for discussion, disseminating the new managerial
models, and providing employees with the opportunity to acquire new competencies. The School is under
the direction o f the Secretariat o f Administration and has already received personnel and finds inherited
from the former Foundation for the Development o f Human Resources (Fundaqiio para o
Desenvolvimento de Recursos Humanos, FDRH). The Bank i s providing technical assistance during
project preparation to help the Government establish appropriate roles for the School to play in the
reform process.


        Participatory and ConsultativeProcess


75.     The definition of RGS's development priorities, as embodied in the PPA, reflect not only
rigorous technical analyses but also a participatoryprocessof decision making. The participatory
process for developing the PPA i s defined in the state's constitution. The Multi-Year Plan, Annual
Budget Law, and related government initiatives are regularly and extensively discussed by the State
Assembly, which has the authority to revise and approve the government's proposals. The PPA i s the
subject o f an annual review by the State Assembly, at which the Government reports on the previous
year's performance inmeetingthe objectives o f the program.

76.     The state's participatory/consultativemechanismswere also present inthe programdesign
phases. For example, the state administration presented the proposed state fiscal recovery plan inmore
than 50 forums over 45 days before its formal presentation to the State Assembly. Discussion o f the
proposed DPL operation has been extensive and began inthe initial phases o fpreparation.

77.     Furthermore, the state government presented to the Bank a plan for public discussion of
the program to be supported by the proposed DPL operation. The plan includes consultations with
more than 20 civil society organizations duringMarchand April o f 2008.




                 IV.     BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

        A.       RATIONALE FORBANKINVOLVEMENT AND LINKTO THE CPS

78.     The proposed operation is fully consistent with and closely linkedto the objectives of the
Brazil Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), 2008-2011. Sound macroeconomic management, fiscal
reform, efficient public sector management, and good governance are key pillars o f the CPS strategy for
achieving inclusive economic growth inBrazil. The current partnership strategy was developed in close
consultation with the Federal authorities, who see Bank support to the states as central to their efforts to
improve fiscal management and the provision o fpublic services. The CPS identifies support for the states
(under results-oriented public sector reforms) and improvement in fiscal management as two o f the most
important areas o fBank engagement over the next four years.

79.     The proposed loan helps turn around a critical situation in a key Brazilian State in
responseto a requestby the State andthe FederalGovernment.Ithelps to reinforce fiscal discipline;
supports public sector management reforms and improved governance. It also helps to strengthen federal-




                                                      21

state relations. It also responds ina flexible and timely fashion to the needs o f the state and to requests by
the National Treasury.

80.      The proposed operation has the full support of the Federal Government.                        Federal
authorities place considerable strategic relevance in ensuring that R G S resumes a sustainable
fiscal trajectory. As a large Brazilian state, the policy actions by RGS can affect the institutional
framework governing the relations between the states and the Federal Government.                  The federal
authorities are keento have RGS comply with the Fiscal ResponsibilityLaw (LRF). (see Box 2 below)


Box 2. The ProposedOperationand the FiscalResponsibilityLaw

The proposed operation reinforces the Fiscal Responsibility Law and fiscal discipline in Brazil. It i s
based on clauses that allow for debt restructuring. Hence it does not entail any debt reduction, or any
associated bail out. The State i s expected to pay its debts intheir entirety.

The LRF includes an institutional mechanism for dealing with states and/or municipalities that do not
meet the legislation's requirements. More specifically, Clause VII o f the LRF allows states that are not
within the required parameters to undertake debt restructuring operations in order to restore compliance
over time. This operation i s based on this debt restructuring clause, and also on a significant set o f
reforms that will help place the State's fiscal position onto a more sustainable path and, over time, inline
with the LRF. This operation demonstrates that there are institutions in place to address difficult
situations. It also demonstrates that they involve a significant and difficult reform effort by the state. It
does not create an incentive for other states to breach the LRFinorder to attain such a loan.

The alternative o f not addressing Rio Grande do Sul's fiscal crisis would likely lead to a default on debt
payments and then require a Federal level bailout. This scenario would weaken the Fiscal Responsibility
Law.



81.      The operation may lead to requests from other states for support on debt management. If
the operation i s successful, other states could also choose to pursue similar debt restructuring, even
though they are within the parameters o f the LRF. DPLs could provide a mechanism for the
improvement o f state debt repayment profiles while simultaneously promoting other fiscal and structural
reforms that contribute to fiscal sustainability at sub-national levels o f government. The operation i s also
an example o f the innovations being considered under the Bank's Middle Income Strategy, and responds
quickly to the requests o f the clients inBrazil.

82.      Finally, the operation will also lend external credibility to state reform efforts. Technical
advice provided during the preparation stage has already delivered results, as reflected inthe design and
the analytical underpinnings for the program.        The Bank and the authorities are also discussing a
companion package o f technical assistance and knowledge sharing activities that would provide inputs
into the design and implementation o f further public sector reforms, debt restructuring operations as well
as the neededreforms to the civil service pension systems, and revenue-collection.


           B. CHOICE OFINSTRUMENT

         B.1 Policy Based Loan versus an Investment Loan or SWAP

83.      The DPL instrument supports urgently needed policy reforms and debt restructuring. A
DPL is the natural instrument for this operation as the critical need o f the state is to pursue fundamental
reforms while gaining relief fiom onerous debt servicing payments.               Setting RGS on a fiscally
sustainable path should improve its economic prospects, and thereby lead to poverty reduction in the



                                                      22

state. Moreover, creating fiscal space would allow the state to undertake overdue spending in social
areas. The nature and requirements o f the loan are inline with OP8.60

84.       The option of investment lending has been considered by the team, but in this case is not
the appropriate instrument. In the current circumstances, the State's priority is addressing reform
needs, rather than identifying a specific set o f investments. The lengthypreparation time necessary for an
investment operation would diminishits ability to support the present government's reformpackage. The
slower pace o f disbursement in an investment operation would further compromise its impact and would
not be able to sufficiently address the state's immediate needs. Also, an investment operation typically
requires counterpart funding, which the RGS authorities lack. The other important reason for not opting
for either investment lending or a SWAP operation involves the limitations imposed on the state by the
LRF. The state can only borrow for debt restructuring (Article 7 ofthe LRF). Support from the Federal
Government i s only available for debt restructuring operations through policy based loans with neutral
effects on indebtedness.


          B.2 One-trancheprogrammatic series versus two-tranche operation


85.       The reason for choosinga single Bank approval, insteadof a series of programmatic loans,
i s the considerable transaction costs involved in processing sub national loans in Brazil. As
described in Box 1, the complex and strict system o f fiscal control o f sub national governments imposes
high transaction costs on lending to Brazilian states. Each loan goes through a rigorous process o f
multiple reviews and approvals by the Federal Government agencies, a process that could take months or
even years and which introduces a high degree o f uncertainty regarding the timing o f the loan approval.
Itwould therefore be best to obtain a single approval instead o fhaving to pass through the same lengthy
process for each individual loan in a programmatic series. There is also an issue o f political timing.
There i s currently a great deal o f goodwill toward the State Government and interest in supporting its
r e f o m efforts. It may be difficult to assure such support over an extended period o f time. Finally, the
state authorities are keenly interested in having the Bank involved in the implementation o f its program,
and the agreements made under the loan are viewed as an important political signal o f their commitment
to adhere to the proposedreforms.


          B.3 DPL and technical assistance
86.       An alternative approach would be TA lending focused on the institutionalstrengthening
requiredto makethe reformprocessmoreoperational. The problemwith limitingthe option to a TA
loan i s the same as with investment loans, RGS i s not currently eligible for these types o f loans under the
LRF framework. Inlight of the state's borrowing restrictions, the state has not requested a separate TA
loan, but instead intends to establish an agreement with the Bank for TA (described in Section V) that
could be carried out under a fee-for-services arrangement. The Bank and the Government are placing
considerable emphasis on the need for close cooperation and follow up during the implementation o f the
program, and views the TA as a necessary complement to the proposed DPL. Given the size o f the loan,
part o f the discussions hinges on the degree o f support that the Bank may provide under its supervision
budget.

          C.      COLLABORATIONWITH OTHERDONORS

87.       The other major internationallender involved in Rio Grande do Sul is the Inter-American
DevelopmentBank (IDB), which is financingsanitation (Pro-Guaiba) and several roadsprojectsin



                                                       23

the state. RGS debt with the IDB amounts R$450 million (the outstanding debt with the Bank i s R$330
million). The implementation o f the state's reform program also counts on technical assistance from the
IDB, with resources being channeled through the Federal Government's National Program for State
Management. The State i s usingthe funds from this program, available to all states, to hire consultants to
help with the design and implementation o f some o f the components o f the public sector management
reform program. Another international lender i s the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC),
which has been working with the state on road rehabilitation projects. The RGS debt with JBIC amounts
to R$29 million.

88.      The operation has also benefited from collaboration with the private sector. The State
Programo f Quality and Productivityhas drawn on private-sector fundingto hire management consultants
to advise the Government on cutting-edge techniques in the areas o f fiscal management, procurement,
review o f processes, and tax revenue collection. Duringthe loan preparation period, participants in this
programhave been an important source o f information for the Bankregarding the Government's progress
inimproving institutionalefficiency.

         D.      RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

89.      The proposed DPL has benefited considerably from the longstanding relationship the Bank
has had with the state of Rio Grande do Sul, and from its increasing engagement in other states.
The Bank has many joint federal projects with activities in the region and i s very familiar the needs o f
the state. The Bank has also made direct loans to RGS in the past, including a policy based loan in 1997.
The experience with Rio Grande do Sul has allowed the Bank to gain considerable insightinto the needs
o f the State and the challenges it confronts. The Bank has also learned from past policy based loans, and
the necessary conditions, such as government ownership, that are needed for their success. In addition,
an important antecedent of the present loan i s the Bank's similar involvement in other states, such as
Minas Gerais, which provides the basis for applying important lessons learned, as describedbelow.

        D.1 Direct Loans to theRGSstategovernment

90.     The Bank has extended several loans to R G S in the past. The most significant in terms of
the current proposal was the Rio Grande do Sul State Privatization and Reform Loan approved in
March of 1997 (Staff Appraisal Report No. 15943-BR) for a total of US$125 million. The loan was
fully disbursed and closed on schedule in December 1998. This policy based loan was one o f several
loans the Bank had providedto the Brazilian states at the time for structural reforms to be implementedat
the federal level. The RGS reform loan was the first one o f these operations and emphasized fiscal
adjustment and privatization.       The project was successful in terms o f the privatization o f
telecommunications and electricity companies and the concessions o f ports and road maintenance
services. However, the state's fiscal condition did not improve. On the contrary, the State adopted an
expansionary policy financed in part by the privatization proceeds, thereby damaging its medium-term
fiscal sustainability. The experience showed the need for a more binding sub national fiscal policy
framework, such as those that were eventually designed during the debt renegotiation agreements o f
1997-98 and the enactment o f Fiscal ResponsibilityLaw in2000.

91.     The Bank also approved two investment projects around the same time, in 1997: the RGS
Highway Maintenance Project, in the amount o f US$70 million, along with Natural Resources
Management & Poverty Alleviation - Rio Grande do Sul, in the amount of US$lOO million. The first
project was designed to improve the serviceability o f the state highway network; while the second sought
to improve natural resource management by promoting an integrated strategy o f sound soil and water
management practices in order to boost the income generation capacity o f poor communities. Both
projects closed successfully in2005.




                                                    24

        0.2 Federalprojects and RGS
92.      Several current federal projects have direct impacts on Rio Grande do Sul. Investment lending
operations approved in the previous CAS period with implications for RGS include: Family Health, Aids
and STD Control, Vigisus,Fundescola 111,Bolsa Familia, PARSEP, and Proagua.
        0.3 Municipal projects in RGS
93.      Finally, the Bank i s working directly with RGS municipalities through the Rio Grande do Sul
Integrated Municipal Development Project (PMDI). This US$40 million project covers five
municipalities in the state (BagC, Pelotas, Rio Grande, Santa Maria and Uruguaina). The objective i s to
strengthen the capacity o f the municipalities to provide selected infrastructure services and employment
opportunities for their population. Under the 1988 Constitution municipalities are autonomous entities in
the Brazilian Federation and can borrow directly from international financial institutions, such as the
Bank, with the sovereign guarantee o f the National Treasury Secretariat. The five projects comprising the
P M D I have been prepared and appraised simultaneously. A decision meeting was held in July 2007.
After National Treasury Secretariat (STN) authorization, the Board approved the project for the
municipality o f Pelotas inJanuary 2008. The remaining 4 projects are still awaiting S T N authorization.


         E.       LESSONSLEARNED

94.      The design of the proposed operation reflects several lessons from the recent experience
with DPLsin Brazil and more broadly (Box 3). Most important i s the need for client ownership o f the
reform program. Once in office, the RGS authorities quickly prepared an emergency fiscal adjustment
package to interrupt the increasing deficit and initiate a strong fiscal turnaround. To consolidate initial
fiscal adjustment efforts the Government prepared and submitted to the State Assembly the State
Recovery Plan, which was partially rejectedby the legislature. The State Administration has persisted in
its fiscal adjustment efforts, assessing alternative measures to compensate for the rejection o f part o f the
proposed recovery legislation. The RGS authorities have consistently demonstrated strong ownership and
commitment to the reform program, as well as working to build the constituency for reform. These
efforts are yielding results with the recent approval by the State Assembly o f legislation to carry out the
reforms being supportedby the proposed operation.

95.      A related lesson is the need for strong leadership in order for significant fiscal adjustment
and deep public sector reforms to succeed. As attested to by the firm commitment o f Governor Yeda
Crusius' administration to the fiscal adjustment and structural reform programs, and the measures taken
during its first year in office, RGS benefits from the necessary strength o f leadership throughout the
higher levels o f government

96.      Client ownership and commitment to the program has been reinforced by the close
dialogue that the Bank has conducted with the state during the preparation of the proposed
operation. The State Government's proactive role inthe technical preparation phase has been exemplary.
Furthermore, the State Government strongly supported the two-tranche design because o f the stronger
commitment that the the second tranche requires.




                                                     25

Box 3. Good Practice Principleson Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership

The operation builds on the various government documents including the Government Program o f Governor Yeda
Crusius, the state Multi-year plan (PPA) and the State Recovery Plan called Facing the Truth of State Finances to
Invest in the Future of the People. The definition o f RGS's development priorities, as embodied inthe PPA and in
the State Recovery Plan, reflects not only rigorous technical analyses but also a genuinely participatory process of
decision making. The participatory process for developing the PPA i s defined inthe state's constitution. The Multi-
Year Plan, Annual Budget Law, and related government initiatives are regularly and extensively discussed by the
State Assembly, which has the authority to revise and approve the Government's proposals. The PPA is the subject
o f an annual review by the State Assembly, at which the Government reports o n the previous year's performance in
meeting the objectives o fthe program.

The state's participatory/consultative mechanisms are also present in the program design phases. For example, the
state administration presented the proposed state fiscal recovery plan inmore than 50 forums over 45 days before its
formal presentationto the State Assembly. Discussion o f the proposed D P L operation has been extensive and began
in the initial phases o fpreparation. The State Assembly approved the draft law proposal describing the DPL loan.
Finally, the government organized a public consultationprocess to be developed throughout April.

Principle 2: Agree upfront with the Government and otherfinancial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework

The Bank's support is summarized in a brief and focused policy matrix. The matrix draws on the Government fiscal
targets in the Fiscal Adjustment Program PAF agreed with the STN and on the indicators included in the result
agreements under the public sector modernization axis o f the state Multi-year plan PPA. Performance indicators
included in the Annex 2a will monitor and evaluate the progress o f the different components. The state Finance
Secretariat (SEFAZ) will be the responsible for the tracking of the proposed loan progress. In addition, the state
Planning Secretariat (SEPLAG) is buildingup a M&E system for the management o f the strategic projects.

Principle 3: Customizethe accountabilityframework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances

Given Brazil's rigorous fiscal control regime that has contributed so much to sustenance o f fiscal responsibility since
the late 1990s also imposes relatively high transaction costs involved inprocessing sub-national loans. Given this
reality, the RGS government has strongly preferred a two-tranche DPL for which a federal approval is needed only
once, and the Bank concurred that under the circumstance a two-tranche D P L was the most appropriate instrument.

Principle4: Chooseonly actionscriticalfor achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement

The Bank's policy matrix uses a limited set o f second tranche o f conditions. Government commitments are also
clearly stated inthe Letter o f Economic Policy. Conditionality i s focused on critical steps, including accomplishment
o f fiscal targets, adoption o f laws and satisfactory implementation o f government reform agenda. Conditions also
address basic transparency issues (i.e tax expenditures disclosure).

Principle 5: Conduct transparentprogress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support

As agreed with the Government, the two-tranche operation is timed to the State's debt restructuring needs and the
reform timing. The review o f second-tranche conditions is expected to take place at the beginning o f 2009. This
process should allow for a predictable release o f the second tranche during the second semester o f 2009, allowing a
second debt restructuring operation still in2009. The policy matrix contains a limitednumber o f outcome indicators,
which will be assessed as part o f the operation implementation and are closely linkedto the supportedpolicy actions.

         F.        ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

97.      The proposed operation is built on a number of reports by the Bank and the state
government, alongwith significant technical assistancethat has been providedto the Government
during the preparationstages of the operation. The Bank has produced three analytical studies on
fiscal federalism in Brazil. The Bank has followed the evolution o f Brazilian fiscal federalism since the
Constitution o f 1988."

98.      The Bank's analytical advisory activities (AAA) on civil service pension systems in Brazil
have decisively contributed to the design of the pension component of this proposed loan. The
forthcoming report "Brazil: Towards a Sustainable and Fair Pension System" has guided the design o f
the pension component. In addition, the report provided useful information for the preparation of the
complementary fund legislation submitted by the Executive Branch o f RGS to the State Assembly.

99.      Analyticalwork containedin other sub nationalloans documentsin Brazilprovided input
into the loan design. In particular, the program document for the Minas Gerais: Partnership for
Development project and the associated 2007 ESW report "Brazil: Minas Gerais-World                              Bank
Partnership: Building on a Strong Foundation and Leading to Next Steps" were fundamental to the
design o fthe public sector modernizationcomponent and for the debt sustainability analysis (DSA).

100.     The TA that has beenprovidedso far, duringthe preparationphaseof the loan, focusedon
policy formulation and program design. The state authorities benefited from an analysis prepared by
the Bank on the civil service pension system. The evaluation o f the current state system, along with a
broad knowledge o f the various national systems, yielded a set o f policy options that provided the basis
for the choices made by the authorities. Similarly, the Bank worked closely with the authorities to
identify the best alternatives for the debt restructuringplan, and in estimating the fiscal consequences o f
certain measures. Finally, the Bank has supported the government with input and material on the review
and reform o f human resource policies, including career review, incentives, training, and the
establishment o f a school o f government service. Additional support included the transfer o f knowledge
from the Bank's experience o f other states with results-based management and partnerships with non-
government organizations inthe provision o f non-essential public services.

101.     The quality and usefulnessof the TA provided by the Bank has been recognized by RGS
Government and TA designed to assist the authorities with the implementation of their reform
programhas beendiscussed. Given the importance o f a close follow up and support from the Bank for
the implementation o f the policies being supported by the DPL, the Government has decided to rely on
fee-for-services arrangements, complemented by a strong supervision on the part o f the Bank.

evaluated the consequenceso f the 1988 Constitution and its fiscal arrangements.The second report, "Issues inFiscal
Federalism" (2002), examined the immediate difficulties arising from the previous decade o f fiscal laxity, and
analyzed the new system o f fiscal controls introduced by the debt renegotiation contracts o f 1997 and the Fiscal
Responsibility in2000. The thirdreport, "The Consolidation o f Fiscal Federalism inBrazil" (forthcoming) highlights
the limitations o fthe existing system o fcontrols o f sub national governments' fiscal performance raisedinSection 11.

        A.        OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

102.    The proposedoperationwould be a two-tranche developmentpolicy loan. The first tranche
(US$650 million) will be disbursed upon loan effectiveness, with the second tranche (US$450m)
contingent upon the Government's adherence to the conditions described inthe loan agreement including
a set o f predetermined objectives, which are expected to be accomplished by the end o f 2009. The
objectives o f the proposed operation are to assist the State Government achieve a more stable and
sustainable fiscal position, to improve its debt profile, to reduce social security imbalances and enhance
the efficiency o f state public sector. The proposed loan will also help the State comply with the Fiscal
Responsibility Law, which i s an important objective o f the Federal Government.'*

103.    The selectionof the four componentsof the proposedDPL relatedirectly to the factors that
have led to the state's current, unsustainablefiscal position.The project is designed around four key
components, with fiscal, social security and public sector reforms at the core o f the program, backed by a
debt restructuring operation that will improve the debt profile and generate some degree o f liquidity
relief inthe short run.The four components are described inmore detail inTables 2 and 3 below, as well
as inAnnex 2, which contains the policy matrix. These components are:

                                  0   Fiscal Adjustment

                                  0   Debt Restructuring
                                  0   Civil Service Social Security Reform

                                  0   Public Sector Modernization

104.    Disbursement of the first tranche would recognize the RGS Government's strong fiscal
consolidation and reform-minded actions since taking office in January 2007. The first tranche
disbursement reflects the fundamental reforms designed to reverse the State's non-sustainable fiscal
position. These include a strong increase in the state's primary fiscal balance, the approval o f laws
establishing a single administrator for the civil service pension system and another to regulate the
functioning o f OSCIP arrangements, the introduction o f results-based managerial tools into the design o f
the strategic programs, the signing o f results-based agreements for their implementation, the
establishment o f management contracts with state enterprises, and the preparation of document setting
guidelines for the reform of civil service career structure. These are all considered relevant prior actions
justifyingthe first tranche disbursement, and they are describedmore explicitly inTable 2

105.    Disbursement of the secondtranche would signal that the state has consolidated the fiscal
adjustment initiatedin 2007, continuedthe reformof its pensionsystem, and achieved substantial
progress in the modernizationof the public sector. Inparticular, the state should have accomplished
the fiscal targets set out inthe PAF 2007-2009 agreement with the STN, and would have reinforced the
declining trend o f indebtedness and improved its debt profile. Inthe reform o f the civil service pension
fund, the State should have established a complementary fund law, the single administrator system
should be completely operational, and, ifeconomic and fiscal conditions permitting, the state should have
shifted the survivor benefits indexation rule from wages to prices, corrected the distortions in the
compensation structure that affect pension benefits, or increased contribution rates. In terms o f public
sector modernization, results-based management should be firmly established with results agreements,
management contracts, investment planning and project evaluation and partnership terms fixed as routine



12. Throughout the loanperiod, the Federal Government as the guarantor is committed to maintain the
macroeconomic framework that does notjeopardize the objectives ofthe program.

features o f public administration, and the reform of civil service career structure compatible with the
result oriented management should have begun to be implemented.

         B.       POLICYAREAS

106.     The proposed operation would support Government actions in seven policy areas within the four
broad components summarized in the tables above.                 The measures that constitute second tranche
disbursement conditions are italicized and underlined inthe text that follows.

         B.1 Fiscal Sustainability

107.     Fiscal sustainability will require that RGS adopt strong, consistent, and continuous fiscal
adjustment measures. The DPL operation would support the continuity o f the State Government's
adjustment efforts, which are designed to achieve the targets set out inthe Program o f Fiscal Adjustment
for 2007-2009 signed with the National Treasury Secretariat (STN) and to improve the state's Fiscal
Responsibility Law indicators. In 2007, the new RGS Government implemented a strong fiscal
adjustment program; these achievements under this effort constitute conditions for the first-tranche
release.

108.     The targets set by the Fiscal Adjustment Program 2007-2009 are compatible with a
decreasing trajectory of indebtedness as depicted by the fiscal sustainability exercise. The
achievement o f the targets for the primary balance constitutes the best indicator o f the maintenance o f a
responsible fiscal policy during the operation period. However, the Government is committed to obtain
higher primary surpluses than those set in the PAF, and i s prepared to take compensatory measures in
case o f unforeseen shocks. Therefore, one second tranche disbursement condition would be
generation of primary surplus of R$ 1.100 billion in 2008 and of R$ 1,400 billion in 200, above the
targets set out in the PAF 2007-2009.

         (i)Expenditurecontrol

109.     The new RGS Government hasestablishedstrict spendingcontrolsthat resultedin a fall in
the real growth rate of total spending. Overall compensation to Government employees remained
constant inreal terms during this period. The largest expenditure adjustment was inoperational spending,
which fell by 4.4 percent, and a 40 percent cut in investment expensesI4. The reduction in operating costs
and the containment o f employee compensation are conditions for the first tranche disbursement.

110.     Personnel costs are the most important state expenditure item, and it is the most rigid
expenditure category, due inpartto national constitutionalregulationsthat guaranteejob stability
for public servants. Despite these limitations the Government can exert some degree o f control over
salary readjustments, new hiring, and promotions. Hence, the second tranche disbursement condition
anticipates a more accentuated reduction o f personnel expenditures than that required by the PAF 2007-
09; it establishes that the ratio of personnel expenditures to net current revenue (NCR) will fall to at least
66percent in 2008 and to 65 percent in 2009.
111.     Given that expenditure rigidities resulting from legal mandatescannot be reduced, at least
in the short run, and that investment spending has already been drastically cut, spending control
will continue to rely on reducing the Government's operating costs. The Government has achieved
significant progress in this area, which i s demonstrated by the fall o f operating expenses in 2007''.          In
this area, the second tranche disbursement condition is the satisfactory implementation of the
modernization of the state procurement svstem under the strategic urogram Fazendo Mais com Menos,

14. Pensions and transfers to municipalities grew by 5 and 6 percent respectively. Bothcategories are not under the
control of the government as they are defined by national constitution.
15. Operating expenses had been growing at a rate of 12 percent inthe period 2003-2007.


                                                         31

as evidenced bv the issuance of an executive decree and/or regulations rewiring government agencies to
use the restructured procurement svstem.

         (ii) Revenue enhancement

112.     Tax revenue has increased as a result of the combination of enhanced tax collection
efficiency and the adoption of the tax substitution regime for VAT collection. In addition, the
Government reduced tax incentives, which contributed to the increase in state revenues. These
improvements allowed the Government to achieve the target for revenue collection defined in the PAF
2007-2009, which constitute a condition for first tranche disbursement.

113.     The fiscal adjustment effort of RGS will depend on the maintenance of a strong revenue
performance since the alleviation of expenditure rigidities can only occur in the medium term.
Therefore, the Government will continue to adopt a set o f measures to increase state revenue collection
efficiency. The Government will expand the adoption o f the tax substitution system and broaden the use
o f the electronic fiscal receipt for the state ICMS, which would increase tax collection efficiency on
interstate trade. In addition, SEFAZ signed a results agreement with the Department o f State Public
Revenue (DRPE) that set targets for the ICMS revenue collection in 2008. In this area, the second
tranche condition consists of compliance with the PAF targets for revenue collection, and reaching
state's revenue collection ofRS 14.5billion for 2008 and R$16.0 billion for 2009.

114.     The generous system o f tax incentives intended to attract investment to the state has been one of
the principal reasons for the state's previously modest revenue performance. One importantdimension
of tax expenditures is transparency and accountability. Because tax expenditures are Government
expenses (channeled through the tax system) they should be subject to the same transparency and
accountability criteria as direct expenditures. In this respect the proposed DPL operation will support
government initiatives designed to bring improved transparency and accountability to the state's tax
expenditures, emphasizing budget allocation and efficiency issues. Therefore, the second tranche
condition would be the explicit inclusion of tax expenditures in the annual budget of the state in 2009
and 2010. along with thepublication of historical statistic series on tax incentives including an annual
performance reuort of Fundouem on the website of SEFAZ.

        B.2 Debt Restructuring

115.     The purpose of the debt restructuring component in this proposed operation is to smooth
the profileof debt service, reducethe debt stock innet presentvalue terms, increasedebt duration,
and improve the state's liquidity.As the extra-limite debt profile is responsible for the uneven total
debt schedule, the proposed operation will restructure it, using resources from the first tranche to pay
down the debts with the Banrisul Foundation (Fundapjo Banrisul, FB), the floating debt bonds (LFT),
and a smaller debt with the National Bank o f Economic and Social Development (Banco Nacional de
Desenvolvimento Econ6mico e Social, BNDES). Resources from the second tranche are designed to pay
down the debt o fPROES with the National Treasury Secretariat.

116.    The selection of these debts was determinedby their cost and maturity.The most expensive
debts are with the Banrisul Foundation and the PROES, which have an interest rate of 6 percent indexed
to the IGP and the debt bond (LFT), which i s fixed at the SELIC interest ratel6.Inaddition, the operation




16. In2007, IGP achieved 7.8 percent while SELIC is at 11.25 percent.


                                                    32

will pay down the LFT bonds that mature in 2008 and, given the strict regulations concerning sub-
national borrowing, the government can not roll-over".

117.     The first tranche disbursement condition would be the compliance with the PAF 2007-09
target on indebtednessto state revenue ratio in2007 andthe resourceswill financethe pay downof
the debtsmentionedabove.The resources o fthe secondtranche will be used to pay-down the debt with
the S T N corresponding to PROES. The second tranche disbursement condition would be i) the reduction
of the financial debt to net real revenue in line with the set out in the PAF 2007-2009.

         B.3 Socialsecurity

118.     As described above, the civil service pension scheme of RGS is a main source of
disequilibriumof the state public finances. It has been running deficits o f about 2.6 percent o f the
state's GDP or 30 percent o f its net current revenues. Contributions to the pension fund are around 0.3
percent o f GDP, while benefit payments have reached 2.9 percent o f GDP. To a great extent, the
financial situation o f the civil service pension schemes in RGS and other states is the result o f generous
benefit rules and eligibility criteria enshrined in the Federal Constitution and in other federal legislation.
However, deep federal reform i s unlikely and a possible reduction inthe imbalances o f the RPPS o f RGS
will depend on reforms which can be implemented by the state, through changes in state legislation
and/or administrative measures.

119.     The Government of RGS has already obtained the Legislative approvalon February 2008
to introduce a singlepensionadministratorfor all public pensionsystems existent inthe state. The
draft law establishes that the Instituto de Previd8ncia (IPE), which currently handles only survivor
pensions, will administer all state pension schemes, including those for the civil servants o f executive,
legislative and judicial branches, as well as military and survivor pensions, ensuring transparency and
uniformity o f treatment for all workers and pensioners. The approval o f the law creating the single
administrator was a prior condition for the first tranche disbursement.

120.     A draft law on the introductionof a complementary state pension fund was also recently
submitted to the State Assembly. The proposed legislation was inspiredby the draft law submitted by
the Federal Government to the federal Congress inthe last quarter o f 2007. It includes asset segregation,
submission to federal laws 108 and 109, outsourcing o f external asset managers selected through open,
transparent, and competitive bidding, and the adoption o f passive or indexed portfolios. The submission
of this draft legislation constitutes a condition for the first tranche disbursement. while the apuroval of
the law is a second tranche disbursement condition.

121.     Introducinga ceiling to future benefits would generate importantsavings in the long-run.
The introduction o f a complementary pension fund i s also a precondition for imposing a ceiling on wage
income insured by the current Pay as You Go (PAYG) pension schemes, as provided for by
Constitutional Amendment N"41. This ceiling should be equal to the ceiling in the general pension
scheme for private sector workers (the RGPS) and would apply only to workers hired after December
2003.

122.     The RGS Government also intends to revise remunerationand pensionbenefitcalculation
rules for all civil servants. The purpose o f this revision is to correct the distortions in the lifetime
remuneration stream, strengthen the link between lifetime contributions and benefits, improve the
incentives for employees to perform well, and reduce fiscal costs due to the over generous pension
bonuses. For the second disbursement, the Government has committed to implement the pension reforms



17. A more detailed description ofthe debt restructuring operation is presented inAnnex 7.


                                                       33

for new civil servants, and consistent with parallel HR reform program that affect the civil service social
security svstem,as described in uaraaraph 37 of the Letter Development Policy (Annex 1).

 123.    Given that the preparation of the reform plan would involve additional data collection and
analysis as well as the elaboration of numerous legislative amendments, it is expected that the
implementationof the plan can be completed only in July of 2009. Untilthat time, the Government i s
committed to continue implementing additional administrative measures to improve the efficiency o f
public service delivery, which would generate some preliminary reductions in wage and pension
expenditures.

 124.    The government also will adopt price indexation of survivor pensions. This measure i s
already allowed by Constitutional Amendment N"41, and many states have started adopting it for their
pension schemes. Inthe long run the switch to the price indexation o f survivor pensions would enhance
the actuarial sustainability o f the RPPS and at the same time allow the state to reward active civil
servants for productivity increases. However, it i s unlikely that the RGS state will have the capacity to
implement this measure inthe short-term because wages still need to be contained, and a premature move
to price indexation o f survivor pensions would prove more costly than continued wage indexation.
Therefore, this measure can feasibly be implemented around 2010, when real wages are expected to start
recoveringon a sustained basis.

 125.    The fiscal effects of the proposed reform program are sizeable. The top panel o f Figure 11
shows the simulated impact o f each o f the reform measures discussed above,'* while the bottom panel
presents the total impact o f the proposed package on the consolidated deficit of all state pension systems.
While the increase in the contribution rate would provide gains o f about 0.08 percent o f GDP around the
year 2010, the savings resulting from expenditure reductions would slowly build up and dominate in the
long run, reaching 0.8 percent o f state GDP by the end o f the 4* decade after the reform. Overall, the
proposed reform package would complement the 2003 pension reform, generating some fiscal relief to
the state in the next two decades, before the new civil servants start retiring under the new pension
calculationrules inthe 2020s.




18.  Introduction o fthe single pension administrator is not expected to generate significant fiscal savings.

B.4     Public Sector Management Reform

126.    The State has recognized that enhancing the efficiency of expenditure management i s a
necessary condition both to guarantee the sustainability of fiscal adjustment efforts and to improve
the provision of public goods and services. Drawing on the lessons o f the experience inMinas Gerais,
the activities under this component will focus on the introduction o f results-based management in the
state administration and on the restructuring o f the civil service career system and the reform o f human
resource management".

        (i) Introduction of Results-BasedManagementModel

127.    The adoption of the results-based managerial model has been undertaken at three levels:
(a) under the strategic programs and priority projects that form part o f the PPA for 2008-2011 and


19. These pillars were supported inMinas Gerais through a DPL operation.


                                                     35

results-based agreements between SEPLAG and the program and project managers; (b) between the
central administrationand the state enterprises (SOEs); and, (c) under the Civil Society Organizations for
the Public Interest (OSCIPs) through the partnership contracts for the delivery o f public o f services
between the Government and these organizations. In addition, public sector modernization will
encompass the r e f o m o f the public service career structure and the enhancement o f state humanresource
management.

128.     The operation will support the establishment of management and monitoringsystems for
the 11 strategic programs and 42 priority projects included in the PPA for 2008-2011. The State
Planning Secretariat (SEPLAG) has been working to define the overall framework and construct specific
performance indicators for each o f the strategc projects. Specific support activities will include the
adoption o f modem managerial tools for the execution o f the multi-year plan, capacity building for the
staff o f SEPLAG and the planning units o f the sector Secretariats, and monitoring and evaluation o f the
strategic projects in the PPA. The first tranche disbursement condition i s the completion o f the design
for the 11 structural programs and the signing o f the Results Agreements for 3 o f them. The second-
tranche disbursement condition i s the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system for the
management of the strategic programs as published in the website of the Planning and Management
Secretariat 1SEPLAG).This system should show that at least 25 out of the 42 strategic projects are being
satisfactorily implemented.

129.     Inthe case ofthe management contracts for state enterprises, the first-tranche conditionwas the
creation o f the management committee and the signing o f management contracts with six state
enterprises. These contracts will be under execution duringthe entire time o f the program, as described in
the Letter o f Development Policy.

130.     The operation supports the implementation of the OSCIPs modelto expand the provision
of services within the state's limitedfiscal capacity. Inthis area the Government has made significant
advances that will serve as first tranche conditions: the State Assembly has already approved the legal
foundation o f the OSCIP model in Rio Grande do Sul (Law 12.901/2008) and the Executive has issued a
complementary decree regulating the certification o f OSCIPs. The next steps consist in the selection o f
non-governmental organizations that can be qualified as OSCIP service providers in areas ranging from
social assistance, health, education, cultural and youth services to environmental preservation and the
identification o f government organizations that can be converted to OSCIP management, or which may
have all or part o f their services delegatedto OSCIPs.

131.     The Government's strategy is to first convert public organizations that could be managed
by OSCIPs. The Secretariat o f Justice and Social Development, SJDS will carry out agencies'
institutional diagnosis and evaluations o f the quality o f services before contractualizing the services.

132.     The managerialinstrument governingthe introductionof a results-basedorientationinthe
OSCIP model is the Partnership Agreement signed betweenthe government and the OSCIPs.This
partnership agreement must specify the social objective o f the OSCIP and the responsibilities, rights and
obligations o f the signatories, the goals to be achieved through the Agreement, and how progress i s to be
measured. The proposed DPL will support the implementation o f the OSCIP model and promote its
expansion. The second-tranche disbursement condition will be signature of at least six OSCIPs
partnership agreementsfor the provision of public services bv 2009


         (ii) StrengtheningHuman ResourceManagement

133.     The Government recognizes that the policy of salary containment needs to be
complementedby a strong enhancement of human resourcepolicies.Likewise, the government also


                                                      36

perceives that a structural and permanent reduction o f the weight o f personnel expenses in state finances
depends on the implementation o f a deep reform of the civil service career structure. As a result, the
Government has included in the portfolio o f strategic projects the design o f the New Personnel
Development Policy under the strategic program "Public Sector Modernization".

134.     In order to implement the HR plan the government created by Decree no45.123/07, the
Advisory Group for Personnel Policy (Grupo de Assessoramento Estadual da Politica de Pessoal,
GU)*'. The objectives o fGAEare to control personnelexpenditures, and appraise HRdecisions such as
establishing new positions, creating new career paths, revising rules governing promotion and the
admission of approved candidates inpublic service exams. The preparation o f the action plan constitutes
a first-tranche disbursement condition.       For the second-tranche disbursement, the condition i s the
presentation of the draft law strengthening civil service careers, in the Direct and Indirect
administration, including the creation of a public management in accordance with the action plan
prepared bv the Government and presented in its letter of developmentpolicv.

135.     The reform of career structures and the system of compensation will have a direct impact
on the civil service social security system. The Government and Bank teams workmg in the social
security program clearly identified that most o f the distortions that weaken the link between lifetime
contributions and benefits result from the career and compensation structure. The correction of these
distortions will be part o f the broader reformo f humanresource management.

136.     The creation of the School of Government constitutes a first-tranche disbursement
condition. The School of Government is part of the overall human resources reform of the R G S
public sector. It was created to support the complex changes inmanagerial culture that accompany the
larger reformplan. The intention i s to increase the capacity o f the new public managers and general civil
service to deal with contracting, results-basedmanagement, and other principles compatible with the new
managerial model. The aim o f the School i s to clarify and align the values, vision, interests and
expectations o f the civil service with the Government's reform efforts. The Government is currently
defining the School's organizational structure, curriculum, types o f courses, and other operational
specifics. Inthis regard, other first tranche condition that i s being completed by the time o f effectiveness
i s the design o f the organization and the structure o f curriculum, etc. The Bank i s providing technical
assistance duringproject preparation to help the government sort out the roles the School should play in
the reform process.

137.     Another Government initiative to be supported by the proposed operation is the creation of
the Public Manager's Career. RGS civil service i s composed of several specialized careers, which can
be overly rigid and prevent a more efficient allocation o f labor in state agencies. As part o f the HR
reform, RGS is planning to establish a Public Manager's Career, which is part o f a trend amongst
Brazilian states21inspiredby the experience o f the Federal Government. The aim i s to recruit individuals,
with managerial capacity through open selection, who will help steer the reform process. Public
managers will be generalists capable o f planning, budgeting, management and evaluation, all phases o f
the so-called "management cycle".




20. GAE is composed by the Secretaries o f Finance, Planning, Administration, Procuradoria-Geral do Estado,
Chiefo f Staff and School of Government.
21. The states of Bahia, Pernambuco, Goias and SHo Paul0 also created the career o fpublic managers.

B.5    Fiscal impact of the measures supported by the proposed operation and overall fiscal
sustainability

 138.    The impact of the measures supported by the proposed Bank operation has been assessed
through a debt sustainability analysis presented in detail inAnnex 522.Two scenarios were depicted:
the first scenario was based on the revenues and expenditure trends observed before the measures taken
by the government in 2007 and without the measures contemplated in the proposed lending operation.
The second scenario took into account the measures adopted in2007 and the measures supported by the
proposed operation. The projection exercises are designed to project the evolution o f the government
balances, the civil service pension deficit, and the key Fiscal Responsibility Law indicators o f total debt,
debt service, and personnel expenditures.

 139.    The first scenario, without the World Bank lending operation, depicts a progressive
deterioration of fiscal balances and increasing indebtedness. Assuming that the Government will not
reform the civil service pension system and will preserve the trends in employee compensation, goods
and services expenditures, and state investments observed before the reforms initiated in 2007, the result
will be fiscal weakening, low investment capacity, and the state's inability to meet the LRF-required
limits.23 Debt as a percentage o f NCR will fall slightly and will not reach 200 percent in 2015 as
required by the LRF. The moderate fall in the debt ratio i s explained by the assumption o f growth in
N C R at about 7 percent innominal terms ledby the increase intotal revenues. The debt service ratio will
remain at about 17 percent o f NCR, falling slightly to 15 percent by 2020, which i s still well above the
LRFlimit of 11.5 percent. The ceiling for personnel expenditures (60percent ofNCR)willnot be met; in
fact, it will remain fairly constant at about 73 percent o f NCR. Lack o f reform in the civil service
pension system results in the deficit remaining at about 32 percent o f NCR for most o f the projected
period.

 140.    The second scenario, which includes the effects of the World Bank lending operation,
indicates a progressive improvement in fiscal balances and the reduction of state indebtedness.
Assuminggreater efficiency intax collection compared with that observed inthe no-reform scenario, the
implementation o f the reforms to the civil service pension system, the application o f a rule o f employee
compensation that limitsreal adjustment to GDP growth, a controlled increase inexpenditures on goods
and services, would result in increasing public investment and the generation o f higher fiscal surpluses.
Therefore, RGS will be able to impose a declining trend o f indebtedness and to comply with LRF
requirements.

141.     Projectedfiscal strengthening is reflected in improvementsin state indebtedness. Under the
second scenario debt as a percent o f N C R will fall from 254 percent in 2007 to less than 200 percent in
2017 and to about 150percent o f N C R in2020. The debt service ratio will fall from about 17 percent o f
NCR to 11.2 percent o f NCR (below the LRF limit o f 11.5 percent o f NCR) by 2018 and drops to
9.4 percent in 2020. The ceiling for personnel expenditures (60 percent o fNCR) will only be met in2018
and will fall to 57 percent o f N C R by 2020, down from the current 72.6 percent. Reforms in the civil
service pension system are expected to have a significant effect, reducing the deficit to 25 percent o f
NCR in2020 from 31percent o fN C R in2007 (Figure 12).




22A Technical note on debt sustainability under uncertainty canbe found in: DSA under uncertaintv: the case o f
RGS.Detailed assumptions for the scenarios discussedbelow are inAnnex 5.
23.  Federal Senate Resolution n. 40/2001, as determined by Fiscal Responsibility Law, established limits for state
indebtedness at a ceiling is o f 200 percent o f net current revenue. For states that were above this level, a 15 year
period was given to reach this level, with a reduction o f 1/15 each year. In the case of Rio Grande do Sul, as
explained before, which net debt was 272.7 percent of net current revenue at 2001, each year the level o f
indebtedness was to decrease by 4.85 percent o f net current revenue, to reach 200 percent in2016.

142.      Without Bank-supported measures, the RGS fiscal path and debt burden continues to
deteriorate, in large part due to explosive debt dynamics. Projections show that the package o f
measures described above reverses this deterioration.

143.      In addition, the assessment of the impact of each policy change on the primary surplus,
giventhe level of publicinvestmentfor eachyear, allows the contributionof each componentof the
proposedloanto be identified. With the exception o f social security contributions on 2008 and 2009,
every other policy variable for every year has a positive impact on primary surplus. For the period 2010-
2020, after the policy changes have been established, the containment o f government salaries has the
largest impact on the change inprimary surplus, followed by Goods and Services (see Table 4). Reform
in social security has a combined effect of 21 percent (with 13.5 percent from lower spending on
pensions and 7.7 percent from higher contributions). Tax increases contribute 20 percent to the increase
inthe primary surplus.

144.      Annex 5 shows that the effects of the World Bank operation and ensuing reformshave a
measurable impact towards improving debt sustainability. Indebtedness remains a very important
issue for the Government, as the large public debt remains higher than the path of adjustment towards a
more sustainable level.      The results, summarized in Table 5 below, show that the ceiling for the
indebtedness level i s achieved with probability of 56 percent without the World Bank operation but the
probability o f compliance rises to 78 percent with the World Bank operation, and the average level of
debt to NCR falls from 211 percent without the World Bank operation to 165 percent for the case in
which reforms supportedby the World Bank are included.

145.      The model also shows measurable improvement in the ratio of personnel expenditure to
NCRwith the LRFlimit of 60 percent reachedin2017. The model suggests that compliance with the
LRFratio onpersonnelexpenditures isunlikely inthe short run. The 32 percentprobability withreforms
i s still significantly above the no-reform scenario in which the probability of compliance i s only 13
percent.

   146.     As mentioned above, outcomes of the projection exercise depend critically on our
   assumptions regarding economic growth, as they are linked to revenues, while spending is mostly
  linked to population growth. Figure 14 shows how debt dynamics are affected by different growth
   assumptions under the reform scenario. Results indicate that lower growth prospects would lead to rising
   debt ratios ifreforms are not implemented.

   147.     As part of the loan preparation the Bank has been supportingRGS with technical advice
   for the design of the reforms containedin this program. Duringthe preparation o f the DPL, the Bank
   team worked closely with the authorities on the analysis of the different policy proposals, such as inthe

areas o f social security reform, debt restructuring, and public sector management, along with fiscal
projections.

 148.    The TA for the implementation of the reforms for the second tranche, through a possible
fee-for-services arrangement, will cover those areas where the state could use Bank support and
that are closely aligned with the proposed operation. The Bank and the authorities are in the final
stages o f identifying the details o f this TA. The Government i s currently receiving assistance from
INDG, PGQP (Progrumu Gazicho de Quulidude e Produtividude) and the PNAGE project (an IDB
program to enhance public management at the state level). These organizations are assisting with the
implementation o f parts o f the current program. The Government has asked the Bank to support those
areas that are not being covered and where the Bank has a sound knowledge base derived from the
experience o f assisting governments elsewhere.



                               VI.      OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

         A. POVERTYAND SOCIALIMPACTS

149.     The proposed operation will have both direct and indirect impacts on poverty and social
conditions. The indirect impact is through improved growth conditions and will take longer to
materialize. The direct effects may be felt more quickly, and will have a differential impact on different
groups. Those who benefit more from public services and public investment should see a positive
impact, while civil servants may face a more constrained environment. As noted below, a more efficient
delivery o f public services and an improved management o f the public sector should favor the poor as
they are the predominant users o f public goods. Thus the operation should have a positive impact on
poverty. Neither o fthose impacts should be significant or lead to considerable losses.

150.     The Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) entitled Brazil: Stability for Growth and
Poverty Reduction (2003), highlighted the positive effect of economic stability on poverty levels. In
particular, the document recognizes that economic stability affects poverty by holding down inflation and
limiting government expenses. Inflation disproportionately harms the poor, who have less access to
banlung and financial services, or other mechanisms to guard against the loss o f real value in their
income and wealth. Fiscal instability also tends to affect the poor, as governments are forced to cut
expenditures to discretionary social programs such as investments to maintain public service delivery or
progressive transfer payments. Inaddition, economic stability affects poverty indirectly as, other things
being equal, stability typically leads to increasedeconomic activity, employment and labor income.

151.     This first indirect link between the potential effects of the proposed DPL operation and
poverty reduction rests on the hypothesis that fiscal sustainability will improve RGS growth
conditions which in turn would reduce poverty. Different studies have shown that in Brazil the
elasticity o f poverty with respect to economic growth i s about one and calculations by the Bank team
using information from PNAD 2006 confirm this figure.. As Brazil has a poverty rate o f 29 percent and
had an average growth rate o f 3 percent duringthe period 1994-2006), this implies that an increase inthe
growth rate o f 20 percent (from 3 percent to 3.6 percent) would reduce the poverty rate from 29 percent
to 23 percent. The calculations for RGS indicate that the elasticity o f poverty with respect to economic
growth i s 1.2, thus an increase in the RGS growth rate o f 20 percent (from the observed average o f
between 2.5 and 3.2 percent) will reduce the poverty rate fi-om the current 17 percent down to 13 percent.
Therefore, with the proposed DPLhaving a positive effect on RGS economic growth, it should contribute
to poverty reduction.

152.     Effects of income inequality improvements on poverty are much stronger than growth
effects in both Rio Grande do Sul and in Brazil as a whole. Calculations indicate that poverty


                                                    42

elasticity with respect to income distribution is 3.6 for Brazil.        A 10 percent reduction in income
inequality in Brazil (from a Gini index o f 0.56 to 0.50) would reduce poverty from the 29 percent to 16
percent. In E o Grande do Sul, the poverty-income inequality elasticity is 4.7, which implies that a 10
percent reductioninincome inequality (from a Gini index o f 0.52 to 0.47) would reduce poverty from the
current 17percent to 9 percent (see right panel o f Figure 15).




153.     This last result has interesting policy implications for the proposed DPL operation. The
potential expansion and improvements inthe quality o f service delivery favored by increased investment
expense (due to the larger fiscal space generated by the resumption o f fiscal sustainability) and
enhancements in public management fostered by the reforms supported by the loan would have positive
impacts on income distribution, and thus povertyreduction effects.

154.     I t is expected that the resumption of fiscal sustainability and the expansion of the fiscal
space for investment would allow for the more rapid expansion of access to public services by the
poor. Tables 6 and 7 show that higher income groups already have highlevels of access to these public
services (about 90 percent o f top quintile group has access to water, sanitation and garbage collection)
while low income groups have reduced access to these services (76 percent for water and about 40
percent o f lowest quintile group has access to sanitation and garbage collection). Therefore, further
expansions in their coverage should mainly benefit the groups that now have relatively low coverage
ratiosz4.

155.     In the same direction, the improvement in the quality of educational and health services
through the strengthening of public sector management will have clearly positive effects on the
poor. Tables 6 and 7 show that the a higher proportion o f the poor use public schools and public health
units (more than 90 percent o f the lowest quintile go to public schools and public health units) and that
the poor are the predominant beneficiaries o f these services (more than 60 percent o f beneficiaries o f
public education and health come from the first two quintiles). Therefore, improvements inthe quality o f
public management, such as the introduction o f results-based management and the strengthening of
human resource management will bring better service delivery to the predominant users o f public
services, the poor. It i s also important to point out the lack o f access to public employment by the poor,

less than 1 percent o f who work in the public sector. Thus, salary containment policies and adjustments
to the pension system will not have any direct effect on the poor.

156.     Finally, the RGS Government has placed great importance on social development in its
medium-term strategy, allocating more than 65 percent (R%474 million out of a total of R%726
million) of the projected investments to the social development axis in the Multi-Year Plan (PPA
2008-2011). The plan includes strong education and health projects to improve the quality o f public
service delivery inboth sectors. In addition, public sector management reforms such as the strengthening
o f human resource management, which will be supported by the Bank operation, will deal directly with
the education sector. In addition to increasing the resources available to the education sector, the
Government has introduced the Student Pe$ormance Evaluation System with the aim o f assessing the
quality o f educational services provided by the state. Inhumanresource management, the Government i s
adopting incentive schemes for schools and teachers based on a regular flow o f reports and performance
results. Reforms in the public health sector will focus on reducing child mortality and improving the
quality o f life for the elderly. Finally, sanitation i s the third sector that will receive budget allocation
priority under the state PPA. The objective o f the Government's efforts in this sector i s the expansion of
the water supply and sewage networks, especially for low-income families living in communities with no
current access to either clean water or adequate sewage disposal.

        B. IMPLEMENTATION,MONITORING, AND EVALUATION


157.    The Secretariat o f Finance (SEFAZ) will be responsible for the overall implementation o f the
proposed operation and for reporting progress and coordinating its actions with the Secretariats o f
Planning and Management (SEPLAG), Administration and Human Resources (SARH), and Justice and
Social Development (SJDS).         The Bank will monitor and review the progress o f implementation
according to the matrix conditions specified inAnnex 2.


        C. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS/DISBURSEMENTAND AUDITING


Flow of FundsArrangements


158.    This i s a USD 1.1billion two-tranche sub national DPL that, consistent with OP 7.00, would be
contracted directly with the Government of the State o f Rio Grande do Sul (RGS) responsible for
program implementation. The purpose o f the DPL i s to finance the payment o f short-term, high-cost debt
with a long-term, lower-cost Bank loan. Fiduciary arrangements were designed to ensure that loan
proceeds are used for this purpose and to satisfy requirements o f the national Treasury (STN) for this
loan.

159.    Once the Bank formally notifies the borrower that the loan i s available for withdrawal, the
borrower may submit withdrawal applications requesting the Bank make first tranche payments to
creditors and to RGS. (USD 650 million). The second tranche (USD 450 million), for payment o f PROES
debt to S T N would be disbursed in2010 once the Bank i s satisfied that conditions for the second tranche
release are met and upon receipt of a withdrawal application from the State Government.

160.    At the specific request o f STN and RGS, the Bank will exchange the U.S. dollar loan proceeds
for Brazilian Reals, the currency o f the debt payments, with the Central Bank o f Brazil and instruct the
Central Bank to transfer the Reals resulting from the exchange transactions to the accounts o f the
creditors. As part of the first tranche, the Central Bank will also transfer loan proceeds to the State single
treasury account to reimburse the State for debt payments previously made by the State on LFT bonds
specifically identified inthe debt swap program with the Bank. The Bank will exchange U.S. Dollars for
Brazilian Reals at the exchange rate offered by the CentralBank.

161,    The following estimated payments are expected to be made with loan proceeds:

162.    The exact value o f the payment to be made to each creditor may vary by payment date in
accordance with the terms of the debt agreement with each creditor. As the Bank cannot guarantee
payment to creditors on a specific date, the State Treasury (SEFAZ) will submit a IO-day schedule of

with the Central Bank to execute payments to creditors on the Value Date. However, if payment to
creditors i s made after the Value Date, resulting in underpaying the creditor, the State has agreed to pay
the additional amount due the creditor from its own resources. All efforts will be made to avoid making
payments to creditors before the Value Date resulting in an overpayment o f the debt. In this unlikely
event, the State has agreed to recover the overpayment and apply it to debt payments.

163.       The total o f the first tranche debt payments will vary by the debt amount owed creditors on the
Value Date and the exchange rate offered by the Central Bank at the time o f loan disbursement. If this
total i s less than the authorized ceiling for the first tranche (USD 650 million), the Bank may disburse the
undisbursed balance from the first tranche to S T N for payment on PROES debt upon receipt o f a duly
authorized Withdrawal Application from the State.

164.       The Bank front-end fee will be paid by the Borrower with its own resources prior to
disbursement o f the loan so that the full value o f the loan will be disbursed to (i)   debt holders and (ii)
RGS for LFT debt payments previously made by the State..

165.       SEFAZ will provide the Bank written confirmation and evidence o f payment o f the extra Iimite
debt within one week as described inthe Bank's Disbursment Letter to the Borrower.

166.       The Central Bank purchase o f the US. dollar proceeds o f the loan satisfy the OP 12.0
requirement that the U.S. dollars enter the national reserves o f the country. The IMF Safeguards
Assessment on the Central Bank o f Brazil (Banco Central) control environment concluded that the
Central Bank does not present widespread vulnerabilities that could compromise the safeguarding o f
Fundresources. Inparticular its audit is conductedby an internationally recognized audit firm, while its
internal audit function contributes effectively to internal control systems. Therefore from a fiduciary
point o f view, the control environment, procedures and regulations governing the Central Bank's
operations are generally adequate.


FinancialManagement


167.       Brazil i s a federative republic. Much o f the public financial management framework i s therefore
developed at the federal level and state and local governments are required to comply with federal
legislation, policies, procedure, rules, practices and norms. The Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal (LRF) -
Financial Responsibility Law and L e i 4.320 that regulates financial controls, budgeting and reporting at
the federal, state and municipal levels are cornerstones o f the federal public administration framework
that regulates and impacts day to day public administration in states such as RGS. The World Bank
CFAA for Brazil (2002), concluded that the country Public Financial Management (PFM) i s well
developed and among the most robust inthe LatinAmerica and the Caribbean Region), thus ensuring that
Bank lending i s done in context o f acceptable oversight arrangements. Since 2002, the federal
government has maintained its commitment to strengthening its P F M systems and the risk to both Bank
and country own funds continues to be deemed low at the national level.

168.      A review o f RGS public financial management (PFM) system was performed as part o f the DPL
preparation to complement the assurances obtained through the CFAA and to drill down into the specific
RGS regulations, procedures, practices and financial systems that would provide control over the use o f
Bank loan proceeds not directly disbursed to creditors by the Bank. The review o f public financial
management focused on the following areas: (i)treasury and debt management; (ii)          budget preparation
and execution; (iii)monitoring and evaluation; (iv) financialkash forecasting; (v) accounting and
financial reporting; and (vi) external audit. The state-level review concluded the State o f RGS has a PFM



                                                         46

system which adequately controls and reports the use o f public resources, thereby providing adequate
assurance that public resources are used for the objectives as set forth in the State budget. The PFM
review also concluded that the overall financial managementrisk for this operation i s moderate.

169.    The State PFM system has weaknesses as discussed in the analysis o f RGS public sector
modernization performed by the Bank for the DPL and elsewhere in the Project Document. Diagnostic
studies commissioned by the State have revealed excessively centralized planning, including lack o f
focus on priorities and low budget execution due to fiscal pressures, personnel management, policy and
budget reality issues. Highdebt levels create fiscal pressures and highdemands on cash.

170.    The RGS PFM reforms however clearly demonstrate the intent and strong commitment o f the
State Government inovercomingthese weaknesses,

        D. ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS

171.    Given that the proposed loan i s for debt restructuring, the proposed operation will have no
significant environmental impact and thus no direct environmental issues are considered here. The State
o f Rio Grande do Sul has very effective environmental policies and institutions, being one o f the most
advanced states in Brazil in terms o f environmental management.          It i s expected that the proposed
reforms will improve the environmental management capacity o f the state, through the general review o f
the effectiveness o f government programs. The Government also identified some key priorities within
the programthat will receive close scrutiny and will be closely supervised. Among the identified areas i s
improvement inthe management o f the state's water and sanitation systems, an important element inthe
state's environmental policy matrix. Finally, under the program supported by the loan, the state will
improve the evaluation o f public investment projects. It i s expected that environmental issues and
safeguards will be important components o fthe investment analysis.


        E. RISKSAND RISKMITIGATION

172.    The proposed operation is considered to be high risk, but also with potentially very high
benefits and returns.      The risks are inherent in the political constraints present in RGS, where
successive administrations have shown a historical pattern o f lax fiscal policies and a tendency to reverse
adjustment policies duringthe latter part o f their term. The same political environment i s present today,
where there is still opposition to a reform minded administration trying to correct a very difficult fiscal
situation. The track record o f RGS and the Bank's own experience in the state contribute to a realistic
evaluation o f the risks and to a position o f caution. They also have led to the decision to move forward,
ingreat partbecausethere are now circumstances inplace that mitigate the possible risks.

173.    One of the main reasons adjustment and reform policies have not been as successful as
expected in the past is the lack of decisive actions. Most administrations pursued very gradual
approaches that did not count on considerable support and were abandoned once results failed to
materialize soon. Many o f the Governments also faced several unexpected adverse shocks, and had to
adjust their policies. Adjustment fatigue was also a factor. But, most importantly, the Governments faced
a very rigd expenditure and tax structure that limited their actions, and opposition to any changes in the
public sector structure. The lack o f decisive structural reforms, the inability to curb increasingdeficits o f
the social security system and the deterioration of the public sector have been the factors that prevented a
permanent turnaround o f the State's fiscal conditions.

174.    There are, however, factors today that make conditions different from previous
administrations. The current Administration won the elections on a campaign platform based on the
need for fiscal and reform measures. The new state government i s convinced that structural reforms in



                                                      47

social security and public sector modernization are essential for fiscal consolidation. The State also has
few other options but to reverse its fiscal course. Today, as compared to previous attempts, there i s a
public realization o f the need for reforms and a strong commitment by the administration to cany them
out. The Administration i s holding an effective public campaign and consultations to ensure that the
citizens understand the needs for reform. Finally, the Federal Government i s very supportive o f the
proposed operation, and fully agrees on the need for the State to begin complying with the Fiscal
Responsibility Law.

175.     It is evident that insufficient fiscal adjustment efforts and reform fatigue could still be an
issue and threaten the success of the Government's proposed reform program. The reforms will
need to be persistently implementedand will not yield visible results inthe very short term. As with any
multiple-tranche policy loan, reform fatigue could set inas difficult reform efforts need to be endorsed by
a variety o f actors within the state. It i s natural for resistance to increase over time, especially ifresults
are slow to emerge or eventual success appears unlikely to key stakeholders. As an additional method to
reduce the failure to implement the debt restructuring or the fiscal measures adequately, there are
incentives and disincentives incorporated into the lending instrument.                  The consequences for
discontinuingthe reformprogram defined here could be significant since it would affect the ability o f the
State to rely on timely Federal funding. Inorder to achieve fiscal sustainability the RGS authorities may
need to be willing to undertake even stronger fiscal measures; however, the room to do so appears rather
limited. Strong, diligent and continuous support from the Bank would help to mitigate these risks and
promote the success o f the reforms.

176.     The potential benefits, however, are also very high. A successful operation would breakwith
historical patterns and would establish an important precedent for other states. The loan would assist a
very important state in Brazil, whose size and economy play an extremely important role in the national
economy, achieve fiscal sustainability and reestablish sound economic growth. The proposed operation
also provides support for a Government that has demonstrated its willingness to make difficult political
and economic decisions.                                                           fi



177.     The support from the operation is also taking place within the context of the LRF, and as
such the Bank loan is helping to establish a precedent and is contributing to strengthen the
institutional framework governing inter-governmental relations in Brazil. Success in RGS could
lead other states, who are within the limits o f LRF, to choose also to pursue similar debt restructuring.
Therefore, the proposed DPL would provide a mechanism for the improvement of state debt repayment
profiles, while simultaneously promoting other fiscal and structural reforms that contribute to fiscal
sustainability at sub-national levels o f government. The loan would also help the State and the country to
cope with both domestic and international economic shocks. The current economic environment reveals
the vulnerability o f many economies, particularly those that are highly indebted, to adverse shocks. In
general, RGS has few economic policy tools to cope with these exogenous shocks. Nevertheless, such
shocks can put pressure on the fiscal adjustment program, especially because the state has little room to
initiate counter-cyclical fiscal policies. Ifthe shocks are rapid or large, they could derail fiscal adjustment
efforts entirely. Mitigation o f these risks relies largely on the fiscal space and the improved efficiency o f
state public sector that can be created through debt restructuring, fiscal adjustment measures and the
broad modernization o f public sector. Thus, speedy implementation and steadfast support from the Bank
could be critical.

178.     There are several factors that attenuate the risksand make the underlyingconditionstoday
different than in the past. These factors augur well for the possible success o f the reforms. Perhaps the
two most important factors are that the current administration i s committed to resolving the problems o f
the State and has a clear agreement with the Federal Government on the actions to be taken. The Federal
Government fully supports the operation and asked the Bank to be a third party in the process and assist
the State. Besides the commitment to the program with the Bank, the State also has a well defined fiscal


                                                        48

program agreed with the Federal Government, and compliance i s critical to maintain Federal support.
One major difference from the past i s that now the State i s working within a tripartite structure, where all
three parties have strong interest in seeing the Administration succeed. Also, the program i s formulated
under the structure of the LRF,which provides a strong legal and credible basis for the State.

179.    While the politicalsituationstill may notbe fully conduciveto the necessaryreforms, there
i s a growing recognition of their need. Many o f the proposed reforms, especially regarding tax revenue
enhancements and pension cutbacks, are likely to be unpopular with vested interest groups. RGS labor
unions are strong and the probability o f strikes seems high, especially by teachers. Moreover, the
Governor i s from a minority party in RGS; she does not control the legislature and i s running the
Government through a relatively weak coalition. But several mitigating measures have been taken to
overcome this possible opposition.         The Authorities have relied on well planned events to explain
thoroughly the rationale and need for the proposed policy measures. In this context, it i s worth noting
that Governor Crusius ran on an electoral platform based on the commitment to adopt a strong fiscal
adjustment and structural reforms. Furthermore, the Government has been very effective in building
shared understanding in RGS society on the gravity o f the conditions o f the state's public finances, as
well as the need for strong reforms to arrest the deterioration o f socio-economic conditions.                The
deterioration has been perceived with increasing clarity in the last few years. Infact, there i s a common
diagnosis that points out the fiscal disequilibrium as the main reason for the state economic stagnation
and the deterioration of previous good live quality standards. It i s now clear that if the State does not
correct its fiscal problems and inefficient public sector, the state economy and social welfare will become
increasing uncompetitive relative to other states inBrazil. This i s another important difference from the
past when the worsening o f state public service delivery and social welfare had not been felt by the RGS
population.

180.     Hence, the program now has stronger chances of being continued by future
administrations if the first results are visible and the current administration breaks the past
pattern of policy reversals. In addition, much o f the program is based on fundamental legal reforms
that will create more permanent structural changes that mightnot be easily reversed. This i s particularly
the case for the social security and civil service reforms. Most o f the fiscal savings expected from the
program are linked with measures in these two areas. Finally, with the close involvement o f the Federal
Government that will be supervising the fiscal position o f the State for years to come, there i s some
guarantee that future governments will have a stronger incentive to comply with the PAF targets being
generated under the operation. The sanctions under the FRL are significant and are more likely to be
applied after the State has received such large support, as in the case o f this operation, to begin
implementinga programthat will have lastingresults only ifpursued over an extended period of time.

181.     The consensusbuildinghasalready producedimmediate results.The approval o fthe OSCIPs
legslation inDecember 2007, the approval o f the creation o f the single administrator for the civil service
social security system in February and the unanimous approval o f the proposed World Bank DPL by the
State Assembly (47 votes in favor and 0 votes against) show the strong support to the envisaged reforms
included in the proposed             Inorder to mitigate the expected internalresistance against public sector
reform the Government has designed a communication strategy to involve civil servants in the reform
process. In this respect, the Government School is aimed at becoming a space for public discussion on
the direction o f the public sector modernization reforms. The Government i s also convinced o f the
necessity to adopt a gradual approach to the reform process. For example, to alleviate opposition to the
outsourcing o f service delivery to OSCIPs, the Government strategy consists o f implementing this new
arrangement first insectors with highprobability o f success and less expectedresistance


25. To support the approval o f the proposed loan operation the opposition parties required and the government
accepted to publishthe content o f the DPL.


                                                        49

182.    In summary,the proposedoperation is timely support for a committedadministrationthat
must deal with a formidable and difficult situation. The Government counts on the assistance of the
World Bank to help reverse its fiscal position and place the State on the path of sounder economic
policies and a more sustainable level of economic growth that will ensure its important contribution to
the Brazilian economy.

Mr.Robert B.Zoellick
President
The World Bank
Washington, D.C.


A.1.1. The purpose o f this Letter o f Development Policy is to present the fiscal adjustment and public
sector modernization program that is beingdeveloped by the government o f the State of Rio Grande do
Sul with the aim of re-establishing our investment capacity and increasing the efficient provision of
public goods. We are writing in order to request financial assistance from the IBRD in the form o f a
Development Policy Loan (DPL) to assist us with this policy of structural reform. We sincerely believe
that this programi s vital for promoting the economic growth of our state and for improving the quality o f
life o f our population. We are also of the firm opinion that the program i s an important initiative that
merits support through a Program DevelopmentLoan (PDL) from the World Bank.


Macroeconomic and social outlook


A.1.2. In the context o f Brazil's current circumstances the State of Rio Grande do SUI enjoys a high
quality o f life. The state occupies for example 4th place (0.814) on the Human Development Index (HDI)
and has aper capita Gross Domestic Product of U S $8,119 (also in fourth place on the national scale).
The average educational level of our population i s higher than the national average and our poverty
headcount rate i s the seventh lowest in Brazil. Nevertheless, over recent years our state has suffered a
downturn in a number o f key socio-economic indicators whch has resulted in the relative decline o f
quality of life in comparison with other states. Whereas in 1980 we were second in the HDIranking and
by 1994 ourper capita GDP was 45.7% higher than the national average, by 2005 it had fallen to 14.2%
over the national average. Furthermore, our average educational attainment i s the sixth in Brazil (6.9
years), still below international standards and has grown slower than the average for Brazil. In 1992 we
had the thirdlowest poverty headcount ratio inthe country, but we have been unable to hold that position
and have now fallen to seventhplace. Inshort, the fact i s that we began to construct the broad bases for
good quality of life earlier than other states and we have succeededinaccumulating a stock o f human and
social capital that allows us to enjoy a reasonable basic quality o f life, but unfortunately this is a life
which holds out few prospects o f improvement in the near future. We are indeed faced with a rapid
processo frelative decline ina range of socio-economic indicators.

A.1.3. In the economic field, Rio Grande do Sul possesses Brazil's fourth largest economy and has
traditionally accounted for 7% o f the country's total. The state's productive structure is based mainly on
its specialized activities in the agroindustrial exporting sector and excels in a number o f specialized
sectors such as chemicals, petrochemicals and metallurgical engineering. Although the longer-term
growth rate of the Rio Grande do Sul economy is similar to the national rate it suffers from higher levels
o f short-term volatility (almost twice the national average), with the result that the social costs arising
from the vagaries of the state's economic cycle tend to be high and returns on investments somewhat
uncertain. This short-term economic instability i s a result of the specialized nature o f the Rio Grande do
SUI economy which i s vulnerable to among other things a variety of seasonal climatic factors and foreign
exchange fluctuations. The state for example experienced a substantial fall in GDP in 2005 owing to a
lengthyperiodof drought combined with the relative appreciation of the nationalcurrency (the real), both
o f which led to a significant decline inproductivity in the agricultural sector and negatively affected our
entire agroindustrial production for that year. Our periods o f economic recovery are generally swift and



                                                      53

                                                                         Annex 1:Letterof DevelopmentPolicy


robust, but they also tend to contribute further to highlevels o f GDP volatility. In2005, for example, the
Rio Grande do Sul GDP declined by 2.8% and recovered again in2007 (growing by 7%).

A.1.4. The marked instability which characterizes the Rio Grande do Sul economy, together with the
relative decline in the population's quality o f life over recent years, are also directly linked to persistent
imbalances in the state`s public finances. We are currently experiencing a severe fiscal crisis which has
restricted investments in both infrastructure and the social areas and has prevented the state from
introducing the anti-cyclical policies needed for alleviating the social costs o f our economic downturns.
Our state has a history o f budget deficits resulting from the gradual depletion o f financing sources over
the years. Infact, with the worsening o f the fiscal situation inthe state, public investment has become an
adjustment variable and has declined drastically in recent years. This crisis has reached such a critioal
level that we now run a high risk o f fiscal insolvency and a consequent decline in essential services
provision for the population. We are currently adopting a series o f structural adjustment measures in the
public sector with the aim o f achieving fiscal equilibrium, restoring the financing capacity o f the public
sector and guaranteeingmore efficient delivery o f services to our population. We believe that the policies
that are at present being undertaken, together with others that will be adopted (described below), are
essential for guaranteeingmore stable economic growth inthe state as well as for improvingthe quality o f
life for present and future generations.



Medium-TermDevelopmentStrategy ofthe StateGovernment


A.1.5. While the fiscal crisis is the main structural problem currently experienced by Rio Grande do Sul
we began our mandate with a highly positive agenda targeted on economic and social development. All
the political actions o f this government are based upon three major strategic priorities: good public
administration and finance, sustainable economic development and social development. The following i s
a short account o f the key initiatives currently underway.



(i)Publicadministrationandfinance



A.1.6. This priority sector entails a series o f actions aimed at fiscal adjustment and the modernizationo f
the public sector. Our target i s to achieve fiscal equilibrium by 2009, to restore the financing capacity o f
the public sector from 2010onwards and to guarantee the efficient delivery o fpublic services.

A.1.7. The first step towards fiscal adjustment was the introduction o f a realistic budgetary policy,
combined with efforts to convince all the three branches o f government and public sector bodies in
general to commit themselves to working together in order to guarantee a reasonable balance between
current expenditure and income over the next few years. This principle o f `budgetary realism' i s now
fully accepted as a benchmark for all government activities and has been strictly adhered to by all
practitioners throughout 2007. It has had for example a powerful impact on the negotiations on the 2008
budget. Furthermore, in order to ensure genuine fiscal sustainability, we are now in the process o f
submittinga proposal for the reform o f the public sector pensions system and, inaddition, we expect that
by restructuring the `extra-limite' debt (debt falling outside the 1998 debt renegotiations between the
Federal Government and the states) our Treasury will be subject to fewer medium and long-term financial
pressures. We are also developing a series o f P O (Initial Public Offering) operations with the aim o f
exposing a number o f state enterprises to the private capital market. The resources yielded by these
operations will be retained infunds to be used exclusively for future pension outgoings and for providing




                                                      54

                                                                          Annex 1:Letter ofDevelopment Policy



a state counterpart contribution to the capitalization o f the new Complementary Pension Fundwhich will
be created as part o f the pension systemreform.

A.1.8.   Our aim is to reach our target o f budgetary equilibrium by (i)   controlling growth o f expenditure,
particularly on public sector salaries; (ii)increasing state revenues by reducing tax evasion; (iii)
introducing `tax substitution'; and (iv) revising the system o f fiscal incentives ina number o f sectors that
have proved to be fully operational and competitive, by reducing tax waivers associated with these firms'
presumed credits. We are also introducing `matrix presentation o f accounts' techniques in an effort to
control revenue and expenditure, to secure more efficient tax-collection and upgrade the consistency o f
public spending. With these measures we intend to ensure that the public spending rate o f growth will be
significantly below that o f the state govemment revenues. In2007 our conscientious fiscal drive resulted
inaprimary result ofR$954 million and abudget deficit o f R$874million. Withthis range o fmeasures
we now estimate that for 2008 we should be able to increase revenue by R$ 1.0 billion and reduce the
deficit forecast from R$1.3 billion to R$600 million.
A.1.9. These fiscal adjustment efforts go hand-in-hand with actions targeted at modernizing this public
sector, ensuring greater accountability within the public administration and increasing the efficient
delivery o f public services. W e have chosen to adopt a public sector results-oriented management model
under the aegis o f an institutional device called the CSPP (Public Policies Sectorial Chambers), the
purpose o f which is to enhance coordination and integrationbetween different government activities and
to monitor the portfolio o f `Strategic Programs' (PE). The CSPP, answerable to the Governor's Office, i s
basically an interactive group of administrative divisions (represented by the relevant Secretaries o f State)
with a strategic and decision-making mandate. On the other hand, the PE i s a portfolio o f state
government priority projects possessing clearly identified targets and indicators, with carefully monitored
results. Four other initiatives designed to modernize the public sector have been taken: the establishment
o f Public Interest Social Organizations (OSCIPs), the overhaul and rationalization o f a number o f
administrative processes, the creation o f a `School o f Government' and the introduction o f the career o f
`public administrator', together with a general restructuring o f public service careers. The OSCIPs
represent a partnership between the public sector and civil society and are responsible for delivering more
efficiently and effectively services that do not fall within the state's exclusive remit. We have already
established the regulatory framework for the OSCIPs on the basis o f a Bill o f Law and we intend to begin
the selection process for these bodies in 2008. We are also taking steps to improve 25 administrative
processes in 10 state organs with the aim o f maximizing public sector management efficiency gains.
Meanwhile, the School o f Government was created to improve workforce skills, runprofessional training
courses with a view to filling specialist gaps inthe public sector and inparticular to upgrade the skills o f
public employees by teaching them the techniques o f management by results. The career o f public
administrator i s being established in order to overcome a shortage o f permanent staff members
specializing in sector public policies and/or process management. By restructuring public service careers
we hope to achieve a more simplified structure, with promotion based on merit and performance
assessment.



(ii)Sustainable economic development


A.l.lO. Under this heading the state govemment is concentrating on pursuinga development policy to
benefit the entire state, emphasizing the need to increase the productivity and competitiveness o f firms
located in the state, to reduce the volatility o f the economic cycle and to diversify and boost the state's
energy network by encouraging the use o f renewable resources and investing in other environmentally
sustainable methods.

A.1.11. The stock o f human capital and our knowledge base (i.e. universities and technological
institutions) are salient features o f the Rio Grande do Sul economy. Our development policy seeks to
integrate these advantages with the production sector by increasing technological innovation, adding
value, enhancing the competitive advantages arising from product differentiation and boosting
diversification inthe productive sector. We are at present preparinganInnovation Law which will provide
a regulatory framework to underpin the process o f technological innovation in Rio Grande do Sul. Inthe
field o f systemic competitiveness we have supported investments in an effort to expand our energy
capacity, mainly through the use o f renewable sources o f energy such as biodiesel and wind farms.
Furthermore, we intend to introduce a PPP scheme in 2008 aimed at widening existing highways and
buildingnew roads inareas hitherto regarded as bottlenecks which cause difficulties for the movement o f
goods and people.

A.1.12. The growth o f the Rio Grande do Sul economy i s highly volatile as the result of the exposure o f
the productive structure to our unpredictable climate. Inorder to reduce the effect o f periods o f drought
on both production and profits in the agricultural sector we are developing a State Irrigation Plan under
which farmers will be trained inappropriate techniques for ensuring the sustainable management o f water
resources. Furthermore, small and medium-sized dams and weirs will be built to store water for use,
when necessary, incrop imgation. We hope that by taking these steps at the primary production stage we
shall be able to reduce the socio-economic costs o f the periodic recessions caused by adverse weather
conditions.




(iii)Socialdevelopment

A.1.13. This priority concerns actions in the areas o f public education management, apprenticeship
training, intermediate and graduate level professional training, expansion o f the family health network
(mainly for children and elderly people), improvement o f basic sanitation services, crime prevention and
poverty reduction. The state's basic social development policy aims to stem the decline in overall socio-
economic indicators and to improve the quality o f life o f the population.

A.1.14.We have already introduced new class and teacher schedules inour public schools with a view to
improving the overall education structure without compromising the quality o f teaching. We have also
introduced the Student Performance Evaluation System with the aim o f identifying and correcting
learning and teaching shortcomings. In order to increase the quality o f teaching we intend to introduce
incentive schemes for schools and teachers based on a regular flow o f appropriate information and
performance results. Inthe area o f technical and professional training we are upgrading the intermediate
and higher-level courses on offer in order to overcome skills shortages and to facilitate the reinsertion o f
unemployed workers into thejobs market.

A.1.15. In the public health field our objective is to upscale the medical care network by focusing on
reducing child mortality and making efforts to improve the quality o f life o f elderly people in our
community. As for law and order, in addition to the traditional approach to combating and repressing
crime, we are also implementing a prevention scheme in which crime and violence i s treated as a public
health problem. This program includes a series o f initiatives with emphasis on decentralization,
intersectoriality, social interconnectivity and coordinated actions aimed at reducing crime levels in Rio
Grande do Sul. Finally, inthe area o fbasic sanitation we are givingpriority to expanding the water supply
and sewage networks, especially for low-income families living in communities with no access to either
water or adequate sewage disposal.

Fiscal situation and short-term measures


A.1.16. The public finances o f Rio Grande do Sul have a history o f continuous budgetary deficits since
1970. However, it i s worth pointing out that these deficits did not produce fiscal insolvency or a shortfall
o f public services over the thirty year period since the early 1970s since we were able to successfully
employ a series o f both orthodox and heterodox financing mechanisms to deal with the deficits. At
present, however, these mechanisms are exhausted, public investments have been drastically reduced and
we now face a substantial risk o f the state being unable to provide public services for the population
unless new strategies are adopted to address the fiscal imbalance and establish a sustainable medium and
long-term fiscal regime. Given the current critical scenario, we have sought to adopt a series of
emergency measures to control the ballooning deficit. Our main commitment naturally remains that of
eliminating the deficit and o f undertaking the structural changes necessary for guaranteeing the fiscal
sustainability and recovery o fthe financing capacity o fthe state public sector.

A.1.17. In 2006, according to data provided by the National Treasury Secretariat, Rio Grande do Sul
possessed the worst fiscal indicators o f all the federative states, measured in terms of Net Current
Revenue (NCR). The state had the worst budgetary result (-6.4%), the highest expenditure on personnel
(67.5%), the lowest level o f investment (4.7%) and the largest financial liabilities (61.0%) in the entire
country. Expenditure on retirement pensions represents virtually half o f the entire spending on personnel
inthe state (31.5% ofNCR) and constitutes one ofthe main causes o f our fiscal imbalance. The state's
primary result (2.2%), in 20th position, was influenced by extraordinary revenues transferred by the
Federal Government at the end o f 2006. Ingeneral, the primary result has been positive inRio Grande do
Sul, but nevertheless insufficient to make a consistent inroad into the public sector debt. In 2006, debt
service reached 12.5% and spending on government runningcosts stood at 24.0%. These numbers reveal
that the most serious aspect o f the fiscal crisis inRio Grande do Sul i s the rigidity that is a feature o f our
expenditure, leaving relatively little headroom for generating significant short-term savings. This fiscal
straitjacket i s a result o f around 80% of the NCRbeing committed to payroll expenditure and debt service
payments, neither o f which are subject to discretionary reductions in view o f the fact that (i)        public
employees have guaranteed tenure and (ii)     the Debt Renegotiation Agreement under Law 9496 negotiated
with the Federal Government in 1997 established a fixed debt servicing commitment based on state
revenues.

A.1.18. When we first took office, the fiscal scenario for 2007 was extremely critical. For 2007 Fiscal
Year the initial deficit forecast was R$2.4 billion, based upon the expected effect on state revenues of the
reduction o f the ICMS aliquots in a number o f different sectors (fuel, electricity and telecommunications)
which had previously been increasedbut were not to be applied until2005 and 2006. Another segment o f
the deficit related to the impact o f salary increments that had already been awarded during the previous
administration and were due for payment in installments inthe course o f 2006, and even programmed to
runover into 2007. Worse still, we hadto face a number of increasedpersonnel costs arising from court
rulings ordering the state to permanently incorporate a series o f ex gratia allowances into the monthly
salaries o f certain categories o fpublic employees.

A.1.19. Faced with this critical situation and the high risk o f fiscal insolvency we decided to adopt a
series o f emergency measures on boththe revenue andexpenditure sides inorder to reduce the deficit. We
immediately took steps to establish a target to reduce discretionary expenditure on government running
costs by 30%, to be applied to all divisions within the Executivebranch. We hoped to achieve a reduction
o f approximately R$300 million with this measure. The reduction was not linear but we succeeded
nevertheless in fully achieving the hoped-for R$300 million saving. It i s worth emphasizing that the
measure did not significantly detract from the functioning o f the various state organs or undermine
delivery o f public services to the population. Before fixing this savings target we undertook a review o f
administration costs which in the event resulted in more efficient resource allocation and enabled us to
maintain the level o fpublic services at reduced cost. However in 2007 it was not possible to maintain the


                                                      57

                                                                          Annex 1: Letter of Development Policy


same level o f investments as in 2006 - these were reduced to less than half o f those plannedinthe budget
and declined to R$380 million (under 3% o f NCR) inthe course o f the year. The cash flow situation at the
beginning o f 2007 did not allow us to fully honor our debts with suppliers. Moreover, we were unable to
pay public employees their full salaries on the due dates. In the case of monies owed to suppliers, we
placed priority on the payment o f 1,221 minor creditors who had provided and continued to provide
essential services, and at the same time we agreed a longer term debt rescheduling procedure with them.
As for settling our debts with larger suppliers, we undertook a debt renegotiation and restructuring
exercise which resulted inthe suppliers awardingdiscounts inreturn for the state`s undertaking to arrange
immediate payment o f their debts. In addition, we undertook to guarantee payment for newly contracted
services within negotiatedand agreed deadlines, thereby reducing costs that suppliers hadbeen embedded
inthe contracts to compensate for uncertainties over payment. Inthe case ofthe government payroll, we
delayed payments by ten days for public employees receiving salaries o f over R$1,950 inorder to balance
our cash flow. On the revenue side, we managed to renegotiate R$300 million worth o f export credit
transfers that were due to the productive sectors, and we subsequently implemented a credit transfer
policy where credits were transferred in proportion to the level o f acquisitions by firms o f inputs
manufactured inRio Grande do Sul. Inaddition, we adoptedrevenue and expenditure matrix management
techniques, which made it possible for us to identify and combat tax evasion and sources o f public
spending inefficiencies. Our target was to reduce the deficit forecast by half, but the results o f these
measures, combined with the present economic recovery in fact enabled us to close the 2008 Fiscal Year
with a primary result o f R$954 million (over twice that obtained in 2006) and a budgetary deficit o f
R$874 million, a reductionto less than halfo fthe deficit forecast at the beginning o f the year.

A.1.20. The major source o f the above inconsistencies i s rigidity on the spending side, associated with
current payroll costs and pension payments to retired public employees. These two items amount to
31.5% o f NCR (virtually half o f total personnel costs) and represent approximately 3% o f the state's
GDP. With a view to alleviating the impact of this expenditure over the next few years we have
undertaken an P O operation with the preferential shares o f BANRISUL and have allocated resources
amounting to R$1.2 billion captured in two reserve funds that were created exclusively to cover pension
costs: the Pension Balancing Fund (FE-Prev) and the State Public Pensions Guarantee Fund: (FG-Prev).
The former was constituted with 90% o f the above sum, with a forecast 7-year duration and monthly de-
capitalization for meeting current pension costs. This fund generates a financial saving o f around R$14
million per month on pension outgoings. On the other hand, the FG-Prev was constituted with 10% o f the
R$1.2 billion and serves as a financial reserve for meetingfuture pensioncosts. When the Complementary
Pension Fund i s introduced, contributions by the state will be effected with the resources o f the FG-Prev.
We have already set aside funds to guarantee that the initial fiscal costs arising from the creation o f the
Complementary PensionFundare adequately covered.

A.1.21. With the above measures we have managedto contain short-term growth o f the deficit. However,
despite the major fiscal effort during 2007, our state's budgetary deficit forecast for 2008 remains high
(R$1.3 billion), and it i s obvious that further significant fiscal tightening will be required throughout the
entire public sector. It is obvious that these measures have entailed very highcosts for both state creditors
and public employees due to the drastic reduction o f investments and the reduction of administrative
running costs. We are well aware o f the emergency nature o f these measures which performed a
necessary part o f our structural adjustment exercise both in the fiscal sphere (revenue and expenditure)
and the area o f public administration as a whole. The overall thrust o f our strategy has been, and remains,
to deal with the budgetary deficit problem in a sustainable manner, to restore the state's financing
capacity and to boost the efficiency o f the public sector. For these reasons we are proposing (i)  a series o f
fiscal adjustment measures with a potential medium and long-term impact and (ii)         modernization o f the
public sector to benefit the socio-economic development o f Rio Grande do SUI.

Fiscaland public sector reforms


A.1.22. Our present program forms part o f the state government's strategic approach to finance and
public management outlined above. Inaddition to the above account o f the emergency measures adopted
during the first year o f our mandate to control growth o f the budgetary deficit, we present below the
planned structural adjustment measures which we intend to undertake in order to secure sustainable
budgetary equilibrium and improve the performance o f the public sector (some o f them are already being
implemented).



(iv) Fiscalsustainability


A.1.23. We believe that dealing with the fiscal crisis o f Rio Grande do Sul entails a strategy containing a
minimumrequirement to fulfill the fiscal adjustment targets establishedwith the FederalGovernment in
the context o f the Annual Financing Plan (PAF), combined with actions that will lead to improved tax-
collection and that at the same time are capable o f stemming public expenditure growth. Given the
rigidity o f a number o f key public expenditure components (e.g. payroll and debt servicing costs), it is
essential that the fiscal adjustment effort goes hand-in-hand with an increasedtax-collection capacity.

A.1.24. Our approach to increasing tax revenues i s based upon a program o f tax fraud reduction, an
overhaul o f the fiscal incentive policy and the formulation o f a Results Agreement with the RIO Grande
do Sul State Secretariat o f Finance, with a view to achieve a gross ICSM revenue collection o f R$ 13.8
billion in 2008 compared with the R $ 12 billion collected in 2007. This Result Agreement will be sign in
March, 2008. To reduce tax evasion we are implementing a regime o f tax substitution in those areas
where we have detected the highest rates o f fraud (auto parts, personal hygiene products, pet food, rice
cultivation and mattress manufacturers). This new regime, allowing for anticipated ICMS payments at
intermediate stages o f the productive chain, i s designed to stem the substantial tax evasion that
customarily takes place at final point o f sale. Meanwhile, by overhauling the incentives policy we also
seek to reduce the number o f tax waivers, but care will be taken to avoid undermining the systemic
competitiveness o f the state's economy. It i s worth emphasizing that the ICMS tax burden of 6.8% is less
than the national average (7.0%) and that traditionally we have practiced a highly generous fiscal
incentives policy in which tax waivers effectively represent 1.6% o f state GDP. While such incentives
have played an important role in the past in shaping our productive system, the main sectors that have
benefited are now fully consolidated and competitive. Furthermore, the significant concentration o f the
incentives policy on a number o f specific sectors has certainly impeded diversification of the productive
system and to an extent has increasedthe volatility of our economic growth rates. It i s for this reason that
we consider that it i s essential to address the whole issue o f incentives with a view to attaining a fairer
sectoral distribution o f the various incentives, accompanied by a reduction in the overall number o f tax
waivers. This approach will mainly impact on presumed credits where the sum total o f the waivers
represents approximately 0.8% o f GDP. The overhaul procedure takes into account the local modus
operandi o f our productive chains (and the fiscal policies of other states) and will basically consist o f
reducing the discounts built into the calculations o f the assessablevalues. We have already begun to cany
out this initiative in a number o f different sectors such as steel, milk, rice cultivation and the meat
processing industry. In2008 we will extend this review to other sectors. However, since this i s a complex
subject which is likely to impact on the competitiveness o f our state economy we would welcome IBRD
technical assistance in order to help us with the task o f overhauling the various mechanisms. Inaddition,
aimed at strengthening transparency on tax expenditures, we will publish annually a report on fiscal
incentives attached to the budget proposal and inthe Finance Secretariat website.




                                                      59

                                                                         Annex 1:Letter of DevelopmentPolicy



A.1.25. On the expenditure side, our strategy involves continuing efforts to reduce government running
costs, to contain payroll expenditure increases and to rationalize the public expenditure through the
program "Fazendo Mais com Menos" , which will review 25 administrative procedures in ten
government entities. In 2007 we managed to reduce by 30% the discretionary expenditure on running
costs and we are now negotiating to maintain this level throughout the entire Executive branch for 2008.
Inthe 2008 budget negotiations we succeeded in securing the commitment of the Judiciary and the
Legislature to the fiscal adjustment program and we are thus able to guarantee support by all three
branches o f government for the new budget limitations. This collaborative effort targeted at maintaining
the state's adjustment policy will also continue duringthe 2009 budget negotiations.

A.1.26. Payroll costs weigh heavily on our budget. In 2007 we experienced some increase in personnel
costs due to the salary increments awarded duringthe previous administration. These adjustments, agreed
on an installment basis, ran over into 2007 (with obvious financial repercussions) and a number o f
upward salary adjustments also had to be made as the result o f a series o f labor court actions against the
state. However, we are now pressing ahead with our policy to control the increase o f payroll costs over
the short-term that presupposes no further salary increases. The payroll expenditure forecast in the 2008
budget i s based on this same approach and we intend to continue the containment policy next years. Over
the medium term, we intend to make changes to career and pay structures with a view to suppressing the
permanent incorporation into public workers' emoluments o f ex gratia allowances and bonuses which
generate imbalances in the public sector pensions' regime. We also intend to introduce performance
assessment mechanisms for appraising public workers which hopefully will provide incentives for more
efficient operating standards. It i s worth emphasizing that throughout 2007 we managed to avoid approval
of a Bill o f Law calling for the introduction o f so-called `subsidiary payments' for the Judiciary branch,
which would have had a substantial impact on the state's finances in 2008 and would have seriously
undermined fiscal adjustment as a whole. The Legislative Assembly redrafted this particular Bill in order
to reduce its likely financial impact and extended the date for its implementationuntil2009.

A.1.27. The strategic program "Fazendo Mais corn Menos" has been adopted since 2007. It is designed to
reduce and rationalize state expense obtaining not only fiscal savings but also efficiency gains in public
service delivery. The main actions o f this program are: the matrix expense management (Gerenciamento
Matrical de Despesa, GMD), the review and enhancement o f 25 administrative procedures in 10
government entities, the Base Zero project to identify service delivery production functions, the
strengthening o f the state procurement system for govemment purchases and contracts, capacity building
at the state debt management unit and the improvement o f the budget execution information system. We
are already using the GMD model to identify inefficiencies in expenditure execution. We launched the
review o f procedures at the state Institute o f Social Security in the health service provision for civil
servants area and the decentralization o f the procurement system. All these actions will continue to be
implemented during2008. With regardto the state's procurement and contracts system we have identified
opportunities for rationalizing a series o f operations that will produce a more efficient structure and
reduce costs by stimulating competition between our suppliers. We intend to use this new system for 75%
o f our purchasing activities by 2009. At the same time we are examining 25 administrative processes in
10 different state bodies with a view to achieving further public administration efficiency gains.

A.1.28. Our government is deeply committed to structural adjustment targets that can ensure budgetary
equilibrium and improve the state's financing capacity. Talung this group o f actions into account we
believe that we can succeed in our objectives as well as comply with the PAF targets agreed with the
Federal Government. Specifically with regardto the PAF, we obtained a primary surplus o f 1,076 million
in2007 and our goalisto achieve aprimary surplus ofR$l,100 in2008 and R$1,400 million in2009. We
hope to reduce payroll costs to 66% o f net current revenues in 2008 and 65% o f net current revenues in
2009. In addition to seelung to reach the PAF targets, we are also workmg hard to achieve budgetary
equilibrium in2009 and to increase the level o f public investments in 2010. Inthe event o f fiscal shocks
which could undermine the adjustment process, particularly those associated with economic fluctuations,



                                                      60

                                                                       Annex 1: Letter of Development Policy



we are keen to emphasize that we will adopt compensatory measures inorder to meet the primary result
targets.


(v) Debt restructuring
A.1.29. A further source ofrigidity affecting the state budget is the cost ofdebt servicing, which amounts
to 12.5% o f NCR. In2006, the debt amortization costs amounted to R$1.5 billion. The majority o f these
costs related to the `intralimite' debt inwhich the expenditure amounts are agreed between the state and
Federal governments within the context of the PAF and do not lend themselves to renegotiation.
Meanwhile, servicing the `extralimite' debt involves a very high expenditure bunching for the period
2008-2012, which i s likely to exert further pressure on the budgetary deficit. The expenditure planned for
the extralimite debt amounted to R$564 million in 2008 or 5% of Real Net Revenue and an average o f
R$344 million for 2009-2012. Since this does not form part o f the PAF portfolio, we aim to restructure
this debt with the resourcesfrom the current operation withthe IBRDinorder to obtainPresentNet Value
(PNV) yields and a more balanced expenditure flow in future interms o f revenue commitment. The plan
i s to use the financial flows from the proposed DPL operation to attain the best combination o f these
sometimes-conflicting debt management objectives. As the extra-limite debt profile i s responsible for the
uneven total debt schedule, the proposed operation will restructure it, using resources from the first
tranche to pay down the debts with the Banrisul Foundation (Fundaggo Banrisul, FB), the floating debt
bonds (LFT) and debts with Banco do Brasil (BBRundef). Resources from the second tranche are
designed to pay down the debt of PROES with the National Treasury Secretariat. We will sign Separate
Agreements with each creditor defining the payment and discharge conditions. PNV gains will be
obtained by settling a number of debts which have interest rates relatively higher than the rates applied to
this operation. An improved future debt profile will be achieved by the newpayments flow over a period
30 years, and it is hoped that the final result will be a more balanced expenditure structure from an
intertemporal standpoint. Our estimate i s that in 2008 we should be able to reduce the PNV share o f
extralimite debt service from 5.1% to 3.1%.

A.1.30. Although the intralimite debt is not at present open for negotiation, we consider that the
downward trend of the SELIC interest rates will in future lead to a renegotiationprocess inthe event that
interest payments on the debt exceed those of other financial instruments inthe market. Inthis case, debt
restructuring operations will in future be carried out more regularly. With this change in mind, we
believe that it i s necessary to improve the Debt Administration Division o f our Finance Secretariat by
providing the necessary training for staff to manage the state debt portfolio more efficiently. In this
respect we are developing an Action Plan focused on the institutional modernization o f the above-
mentioned department. This planwill be implemented inthe course of 2008 and the first half o f 2009. We
are interested inIBRDtechnical assistance to help with the modernizationo f the Debt Department.



(iv) Social Security Reform


A.1.3 1. Public worker pension expenditure inall brancheso f the state government amounts to around 3%
o f GDP and over one third o f total state revenues. At present these costs contribute significantly to the
severe fiscal problems o f our state. We know that our program of overarching fiscal reform needs to
contain the important component of social security reform. This will embrace a series of important
institutional and administrative reforms designed to improve the mechanisms for awarding new pensions
and to monitor existing pensions. The fiscal reform will also introduce a series o f parametric reforms to
improve the pension eligibility rules and to tightenup the relationshipbetween lifetime contributions and
retirement benefits. While we are seeking therefore to reduce pension costs and deficits over the medium
term as a contribution to the objectives contained in the wider reform process, we are also anxious to



                                                     61

                                                                        Annex 1:Letter o fDevelopmentPolicy



ensure fairness for people employed at the different levels o f our public service and above all to restore
incentives for public sector employees to perform effectively throughout their careers.

A.1.32. The scope for implementing pension reform at the state level is to a degree constrained by the
Federal Constitution and pension legislation, which prescribe a number o f rules and parameters for all the
public sector pension schemes inBrazil at the federal, state and municipal levels. This collection o f rules
i s known as the RPPS (RegimesPrbprios de Previdkncia Social). While the PensionReform o f December
2003, introduced through a Constitutional Amendment          (NO, 41), led to the introduction o f various
measures designed to reduce excessive RPPS expenditure, this reform will not have any significant
impact untilthe 2030s, when public employees hired after 2003 begin to retire. From our state's point o f
view, we need to complement the 2003 Brazil-wide reform with a more restricted reform initiative
confined exclusively to the Rio Grande do Sul RPPS, aimed at producing short-run benefits to the
finances o f our state.
A.1.33. We have identified four potential measures which Rio Grande do Sul could introduce which
would contribute to a more balanced pension scheme over the next 20 years. The four measures are as
follows: (i)to appoint a single administrative body (gestor zinico); (ii)to introduce a new
'complementary' pension fund for new civil servants; (iii)         to introduce new rules governing the
calculation o f benefits for civil servants designed in such a way as to forge a realistic link between paid-
up contributions andbenefits; and(iv) to switch `salary indexed' survivor pensionsto pensions indexedto
prices after a period o f fiscal adjustment.

A.1.34. We believe that the appointment o f a single administrative body to deal with all the pension
schemes (measure i)will constitute an important institutional reform. The basic objective will be to
coordinate the different pension schemes in order to ensure transparency, fairness and uniformity o f
treatment for public workers inthe Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches o f the Rio Grande do Sul
government, as well as the military and the entitled surviving relatives. With this in mind we have
submitted to our Legslative Assembly draft legislation that, if accepted, would transform the existing
Pensions Institute (Instituto dePrevidkncia), which currently handles only survivor pensions, into a single
administrative body charged with the management o f all the pension schemes that currently operate
separately inthe state.

A.1.35. The new Complementary Pension Fund for new government employees (measure ii)is another
important institutional reform. Constitutional Amendment W 41, published in December 2003, allows
the federal and sub national governments to impose a benefit ceiling on new public employees equal to
that indicated in the general pension reform for private sector workers (the RGPS), on condition that the
respective government introduces a complementary fund for employees affected by this measure.

A.1.36. Although this benefits cap would generate substantial savings in the longer term, we are also
concemed to ensure a sound legal and institutional framework for the Complementary Fund in order to
safeguard contributors` assets and ensure adequate benefits at retirement. With this in mind we have
prepared legislationbased on the draft law for the Complementary Pension Fund for Federal Government
Employees (recently submitted to Congress). This draft legislation specifies that the funds will be subject
to federal laws 108 and 109 that apply to all closed-end funds inBrazil and which guarantee a sound legal
framework for the scheme. Moreover, our draft law stipulates that portfolios will be passive and that their
management will be outsourced to professional managers selected on the basis o f transparent and
competitive biddingprocedures.

A.1.37. Some rules for computing the pension benefits affecting civil servants have seriously diluted the
relationship between lifetime contributions and pension benefits, resulting inexcessive replacement ratios
(between the average lifetime wages and retirement pension benefits), thereby contributing significantly
to the actuarial imbalances o f the RPPS o f Rio Grande do Sul. W e therefore intend to introduce new rules
for this area (measure iii)which will involve the computation o f final pension benefits on the basis o f
average earnings over the beneficiary's working life and the adoption o f a different approach to pension

                                                                         Annex 1:Letter ofDevelopment Policy



benefits and rights related to certain special ex gratia allowances. We must emphasize that such changes
need to form part o f the broader administrative reform involving changes incareer and pay structures - all
o f them initiatives designed to reward more effectively performance duringpeople's working lives.

A.1.38. Measure (iv) regarding the proposal to switch `salary indexed' survivor pensions to pensions
indexed to prices is already allowed by Constitutional Amendment W 41 and many states have adopted
the new procedures. Inour view this i s an important measure for enhancing the actuarial sustainability o f
the RPPS over the long term and, crucially, for making it possible for states to pay productivity bonuses
to current public employees. However, Rio Grande do Sul i s not ina position to implement this measure
over the short term because we have a pressing need to contain pay and pensions. W e also fear that the
premature introduction o f `price indexation' for survivor pensions could prove in present circumstances
more costly than the present `wage indexation'. However, we intend to implement this measure during a
second stage o f our fiscal reform program when we expect real wages to enter a period o f sustained
recovery.

A.1.39. We propose to implement the necessary RPPS reforms in three stages. Regarding the first two
components, we have already submitted to the State Legislative Assembly two draft laws to create the
gestor linico and the Complementary Fundfor new public employees, and we expect these to be approved
by June 2008. Regarding the third component, we intend to pay close attention to the question o f the
administrative reforms affecting government employees, with technical assistance provided by the World
Bank. We expect to be in a position to submit the reform package addressing the issues of career
structures, pay and pensions to the State Assembly by early 2009 and to have this package approved by
June 2009. Finally, we intend to commence indexing survivor pensions to prices as soon as the state's
fiscal situation improvesand real wages show signs o fsustained recovery.



(iv) Modernizationofthe public sector

A.1.40. The fiscal crisis has had a severe impact on the population o f Rio Grande do Sul as the financial
difficulties have restricted the expansion and improvement o f service delivery. We believe that it is
important that the fiscal adjustment measures should be carried out simultaneously with a policy designed
to modernize the public sector with the ultimate aim o f enhancing the efficiency o f public services
delivery for our population and smooth the negative impact derived from the strong fiscal adjustment.
W e are convinced that the key modernization initiatives should place emphasis on a model of public
management geared to results. We are also keen to introduce a human resources management policy
based on recognizing the real worth o f public employees through the introduction o f performance
assessmentmechanisms and productivity improvement incentives.

A.1.41. The results-based management model is already being implemented, based upon a new
institutional arrangement and institutional changes designed to adopt the model o f the Public Interest
Civil Society Organizations, OSCIP, whose final objective i s to ensure accountability in public
administration and improve efficiency o f public goods provision. These new arrangement consists o f the
Public Policies Sectorial Chambers (CSPP) and the Strategic Programs (PE) and the State Enterprises '
Governance Committee.The CSPPs are subordinated directly to the Governor's Office and are effectively
interdepartmental public administration units with an important strategic and decision-making role. Given
that the heads o f the various Secretariats are members of the CSPPs, a degree o f synergy exists across the
range o f different public policies, and inthis environment it i s easier to identify bottlenecks that impede
the efficient execution o f the various policies, and to take action to correct such problems as speedily as
possible. At present the CSPPs are focused on the following key areas: security and crime prevention,
imgation and multiple water usage, sustainable economic development,                    social development,
infrastructure and logistics, public management and finance. The PESmeanwhile consist o f portfolios o f



                                                      63

                                                                         Annex 1: Letter of Development Policy



priority government projects with clearly identifiedtargets and indicators and carefully monitoredresults.
We established the so-called Results Agreements (RA) which are a type o f contract between the
government and the PE managers and which aim to instill a degree o f discipline on all the practitioners
involved in running the PES. We have already drawn up a portfolio o f 11 PESto be introduced in the
course o f 2008 and we expect these to be fully functioning by 2009. The intensive monitoring o f the PES
will be undertaken by the Planning and Management Secretariat (SEPLAG) and their results will be
periodically assessedin the CSPP. We have also created a State Enterprises Management Committee that
i s responsible for defining the regulatory framework o f the various management contracts and for
monitoring compliance with institutional performance targets. This Committee comprises the Secretaries
for Planning and Management, Finance, Administration, Human Resources, the State Solicitor-General,
the Head o f the Civil Household and two representatives nominated by the Governor (one o f them
representing civil society). Chairmanship o f the Committee is exercised by the Secretary for Planning and
Management and his Executive Secretary has been deployed to SEPLAG, working under the direction of
the Public Management Modernization Department.

A.1.42. We also intend to apply the management-by-results system inthe indirect administrationwith the
aim o f improving delivery o f services for our population. The related contracts will establish targets that
the various organizations must reach, as well as stipulating time limits for the government's counterpart
contributions. This process has been initiated with state enterprises and will be extended to other organs
within the indirect administration.

A.1.43. With a view to consolidating a new public management model based on results and efficiency
gains, we believe it i s important to design a legal framework for regulating partnerships with organized
civil society and the private sector, aimed at providing services that are delivered to the public but which
are not the exclusive remit o f the state. We also believe that it is important to implement and create
awareness inRio Grande do Sul o fthe Public Interest Civil Society Organizations known as OSCIPs. The
OSCIPs serve as a funnel for allocating resources more efficiently and with greater social control since
they focus on final results and enjoy a different lund o f administrative regime, ensuring flexibility and
optimization o f the use o f resources. We have already approved a Bill defining the framework of the
OSCIPs and its regulatory status. We also intend to initiate the qualification process o f various entities in
the course o f 2008. Our goal i s to have at least six OSCIPs functioning by the first semester o f 2009.

A.1.44. To guarantee the efficiency o f the new public management oriented by results, we established
three contractual instruments to be adopted in this new institutional model: the Term o f Commitment for
Result (TCR), the Management Contract (CG) and the partnership Term (TP). The TCR i s a contract
among the government and the managers o f the Strategc projects (PE), regulating the rights and
commitments o f the different agents involved in the PES.The CG defines the managerial responsibilities
o f the heads o f the state enterprises including corporate targets such as service delivery goals and
financial performance. Under this modality, the managers have more autonomy and the state enterprises
are controlled by the results they achieve. Our target i s to sign six CG with state enterprises by March
2008. The TP i s a contractual instrument between the public administration and an OSCIP entity that
defines rights and responsibilities o f the parts. Each OSCIP will have a TP with the government
describing the rules for the use o f resources, service delivery and targets and outputs to be achieved. With
regarding the Strategic Programs (PE), it i s expected to have at least three TCRs signed with the managers
o f the programs under the Secretaries o f Planning, Finance and Educationby March 2008. By the end o f
2008, it i s expected to have functioning the 11 strategic programs with their respective TCRs and our
target i s to achieve a satisfactory implementation o f at least 60 percent o f strategic projects evaluated in
terms o f the indicators set inthe M&E system.

A.1.45. All these contractual instruments are part o f the public management monitoring and evaluation
system that will be operated by the Secretariat o f Planning and Management. We are creating a
Management Portal (Portal de GestSio) with two layers, one for internal use with more detailed and




                                                       64

                                                                         Annex 1:Letter ofDevelopmentPolicy



managerial information to monitor performance and the other for external use to enhance transparency
and accountability.

A.1.46. We believe that an administrative reform i s needed to bring about changes in the career structure
o f public employees and the rules governing pay. This reform will need to be integrated with the new
management policy and with the series o f reforms planned for the state pension system. Rio Grande do
Sul at present possessesa relatively unorganized career system for public employees which suffers from a
number o f anomalies, including a pay system that includes a plethora of allowances and embedded `extra'
payments that contribute to the imbalances in the public sector pensions system. Promotion within the
public service careers continues to depend on length o f service and the pay system is structured in such a
way that substantial distortions occur between basic and take-home remuneration. Inthe current financial
circumstances, any adjustment o f base salaries would have a powerful knock-on effect and would
significantly undermine fiscal adjustment. Our objective therefore is to draw up a new personnel policy
based upon the principles o f simplification, sector and functional mobility, merit, performance assessment
and replacement o f the incorporated allowances with different pay bands based upon performance, the
elimination o f compensation distortions that have negative impact on the state civil service social security
results and, in the short-term, fiscal neutrality. In parallel, we are consolidating our human resource
information system, including statistical information on public sector personnel that would serve as
database for planning the workforce and achieve a more efficient human resource management. W e have
already initiated a diagnosis o f career structures and we are preparing Action Plans for reestructuring the
career o fpublic employees on the basis o f the above principles. Our intention i s to submit the reform draft
proposals to the state Assembly duringthe first semester o f 2009.

A.1.47. We have recently created the School o f Government in order to organize and improve workforce
skills and undertake training courses to fill specialist gaps inthe public sector. The School o f Government
will also take the lead inthe debate concerning the establishment of the career o f `public administrator'
that to date does not exist in our administration. We believe this initiative i s the key to overcoming
shortages o f permanent staff members specializing inpublic policies or process management. Given that
our public sector modernization policy will mean significant institutional and cultural changes, we will
also use the School o f Government as a useful venue for discussion and dissemination o f these changes
with public employees. Inaddition to the courses needed to fill specific gaps inthe various government
bodies, we also intend to run courses on results-based public management both at the conceptual level
(for improving understanding and a simulation o f the model) as well as at the operational level (training
courses for program and project managers). Our overall target is to train 22,000 public employees at the
School o f Government by first semester o f 2009.
A.1.48. The institutional changes requiredby our public sector modernizationpolicy are complex and are
bound to affect the present and future expectations o f our public employees, particularly where the
OSClPs model, implementationo f results-based management and career restructuring are concerned. In
view o f the importance o f this entire process we believe that IBRD technical assistance would be
extremely useful for helping to design and implement the various measures flowing from this process o f
change. We believe that the new management policy will also imply improvements in the budgetary
institutions given the new approach involving planning, execution, audit and monitoring and evaluation o f
results. We also consider that IBRD technical assistance could play an important role in this process,
especially in terms o f improving training in the areas o f formulating and analyzing performance and
results indicators to be applied to program and project management.

Request for financial assistance


A.1.49. The State Government o f Rio Grande do Sul is deeply committed to its program o f fiscal
adjustment and public sector modernization presented above and we hereby take this opportunity to
request financial assistance from the World Bank. We would welcome assistance in the form o f a
DevelopmentPolicy Loan intwo stages, aimed at sustaining the measures that have already been adopted,
as well as those that are still to be implemented. Furthermore, we believe that IBRDexpertise could make
an important contribution in a number o f strategic actions within the reform program ifthe Bank were to
offer a Technical Assistance package. Our main areas o f interest are the following: modernization o f the
Debt Department, training in actuarial modeling, evaluating fiscal incentive policies, tax expenditure
budget, results-based management models (performance and results indicators and establishment of the
OSCIPs), public employee's career restructuring and performance-related appraisals.

Public InformationNotice (PIN) No. 07/114, September 18,2007

 Public lnformation Notices (PINS)form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
 views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or
 countries) concerned, PlNs are issuedafter Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultationswith
 member countries, of its surveillanceof developmentsat the regional level, of post-program monitoring,
 and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PlNs are
 also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by
 the Executive Board in a particularcase.


A.3.1    On July 30, 2007, the Executive Board o f the InternationalMonetary Fund(IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Brazil.'

    Background
A.3.2    The Brazilian economy is reaping the benefits o f the continued implementation o f strong
stabilization and social policies, in the context o f a favorable external environment. In recent years,
economic growthhas picked up and poverty has declined. To increase growth fbrther over the medium
term, the government has announced, within the current macroeconomic framework, the Growth
Acceleration Program, which contains steps to increase public and private investment.

A.3.3    Growth has been strong in recent quarters, at 4%-5 percent year-on-year, as domestic demand
has picked up, supported by the ongoing monetary easing. Real GDP growth is projected to rise fiom
3% percent in 2006 to 4% percent in 2007. In May 2007, twelve-month CPI inflation was 3.2 percent,
well below the mid-range inflation target (4.5 percent). The inflation outlook remains benign, with 12-
month inflation expected at around 3.5 percent by year-end.

A.3.4    Fast export growth has underpinned sustained external current account surpluses which, together
with strong private capital inflows, have allowed the authorities to builda comfortablecushion o fforeign
exchange reserves. Brazil's trade surplus remained high in 2006, at 4%percent o f GDP, and export
volumes picked up in the first part o f 2007. With declining country risk premia, still relatively high
interest-rate differentials, and reduced exchange rate volatility, capital inflows, including foreign direct
investment, have risen. In that context, official international reserves have more than doubled over the
past 12 months.

A.3.5    The fiscal accounts remain strong, despite some weakening inthe primary surplus in2006. After
reaching a record-high o f 4.4 percent o f GDP in 2005, the primary fiscal surplus declined to 3.9 percent
o f GDP in 2006. However, strong revenue collections have raised the surplus in early 2007. For the year
as a whole, the government plans to step up capital outlays under the Pilot Investment Program, to help
address infrastructure needs. Owing to a falling interest bill, the overall deficit o f the public sector i s
expected to decline in2007.

A.3.6    Reflecting the effect o f substantial primary surpluses, net public debt has declined significantly
inrecent years, from close to 60 percent at end-2002 to 46 percent at end-2006. Over that period, the
government has repaid a large share o f its external debt, thus contributing to a significant reduction in
vulnerabilities. At the same time, debt management operations have eliminated exchange rate-linked
domestic debt and raised the share o f inflation-linked and fixed-rate debt. With improved debt
composition and debt dynamics, and prospects for stronger growth, credit-rating agencies have raised
Brazil's sovereign rating to one notch below investment grade.




                                                     74

                                                                                 Annex 3: FundRelations Notes



A.3.7    The authorities have also taken advantage o f favorable external conditions to deepen Brazil's
domestic financial markets and enhance their integration with global markets. Banking system indicators
are sound, and equity and domestic debt issuance by corporations has surged since 2004.

     Executive BoardAssessment
A.3.8    Executive Directors commended the authorities for the strong performance o f Brazil's economy,
which-against     the backdrop o f a favorable global environment-has        been reaping the benefits of an
impressive fiscal effort, sound monetary policy, and a reduction in vulnerabilities. Particularly notable
have been the significant reductions in inflation and in public debt ratios, and the buildup o f official
reserves to comfortable levels. Directors also praised Brazil's enhanced social policies, which have
contributedto a significant decline inpoverty rates.

A.3.9    Directors considered that Brazil's near-term economic prospects are favorable. Notwithstanding
the significant appreciation o f the real and a sustained increase inimports, the external current account is
expected to register another moderate surplus in2007, reflecting the continued strength o f exports. At the
same time, Directors expected that Brazil's improved fundamentals and attractive asset prices will
continue to encourage strong capital inflows.

A.3.10 Directors considered that the main challenge facing Brazil remains the creation o f conditions for
higher sustainable economic growth and further poverty reduction. This will require the continued
implementation o f sound macroeconomic policies and a deepening o f structural reforms to make the
economy more flexible and competitive. Directors welcomed the authorities' recognition o f these
challenges, which are reflected in the recent launching of the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC), with
its focus on raising investment and growth.

A.3.11 Directors commended the central bank on its skillful management o f the inflation targeting
regime, and stressed that further entrenching the gains from a low rate o f inflation remains a priority.
While underscoring the need for continued vigdance, Directors saw room for further interest rate cuts. In
this context, several Directorsnoted that resource pressures are expected to be contained. With inflation
and inflation expectations below the authorities' mid-range target, a number o f Directors also suggested
lowering somewhat the inflation target, while narrowing the tolerance band. Many other Directors
preferredto retain the present target range untillow inflation is further entrenched, thus allowing greater
flexibility for dealing with adverse shocks. A number o f Directors favored granting de jure autonomy to
the central bank to further solidify the inflation targeting framework and reduce inflation uncertainty.

A.3.12 Directors considered that the flexible exchange rate regime has served Brazilwell, and noted that
the level o f the exchange rate i s broadly in line with fundamentals. They noted the authorities'
commitment to use interventionto minimize volatility and to strengthen international reserves. A number
o f Directors suggested that-while    Brazil's foreign reserves buildup has helped create a welcome, strong
buffer for the economy-large-scale        intervention in the recent period may have reinforced capital
inflows. Intheir view, reducing the magnitude o f intervention would help attenuate one-way bets on the
currency and minimize the fiscal costs o f sterilization.

A.3.13 Inthe context o f the strong private demand and buoyant tax collections, a number o f Directors
suggested that government revenue in excess o f budgeted projections be saved. Raising public sector
saving would alleviate appreciation pressures on the currency, introduce a welcome element o f counter-
cyclicality in fiscal policy, and strengthen public debt sustainability-thus  widening the room for hrther
interest rate cuts. Some other Directors-noting        the strong track record o f fiscal performance and
declining debt ratios-were    inclined to support the authorities' view that additionalrevenues may be used
to reduce taxes andor increase priority infrastructure spending. Several Directors considered that
limitingthe growth o fprimary fiscal current spending, which has been very rapid inrecent years, would
help strengthen the basis for high growth by creating space for much-needed infrastructure investment,
reductions inthe still-highgross public debt, and a lower tax burden.

A.3.14 Directors welcomed the reform plans in the fiscal and social security areas, aimed at further
improving the quality o f fiscal policy. Directors supported plans to merge all indirect taxes into two
VATS,as this will help simplifythe tax system, reduce tax evasion, and promote investment. To ensure
its success and sustainability, several Directors noted that this complex reform will require a broad
consensus and the introduction o f mechanisms to minimize losses for some states. Some Directors
considered that a meaningful social security reform i s crucial to improving Brazil's fiscal position over
the medium- and long-term. Directors also welcomed the authorities' plans to continue extending the
average maturity o f the public debt.

A.3.15 Directors noted that the Brazilian financial system i s healthy and that the banking sector i s
adapting smoothly to lower interest rates. As long-term credit markets develop, it will be critical to
ensure that lending growth remains guided by sound prudential principles. In the context o f declining
interest rates and to help deepen financial intermediation, Directors encouraged the authorities to reduce
reserve requirements gradually and to lower the statutory rate o fremuneration o f savings accounts, and a
number o f Directors encouraged the authorities to also phase out financial transaction taxes. With new
financing opportunities developing rapidly for the corporate sector, Directors saw room for phasing out
directed lending by commercial banks. Directors noted that the welcome deepening o f the Brazilian
capital market should promote growth, but underscored the need for careful supervision and prudent
management.

A.3.16 Directors considered that improvements in infrastructure, as envisioned inthe PAC (Program to
Accelerate Growth), will be critical to enhancing the climate for long-term investments and
competitiveness. Given the sizable resource requirements for infrastructure and the benefits o f private
investment and expertise, Directors saw scope for the authorities to foster sound public-private
partnerships and concessions. They also encouraged the creation of conditions to accelerate needed
investments in electricity generation, and welcomed the authorities' plans to reform and strengthen the
role o f autonomous regulatory agencies.

A.3.17 Directors called for further labor market reforms and improvements inthe business environment
to help boost productivity and investment. Some Directors also encouraged the authorities to make
further progress in trade liberalization. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to play a
constructive role inthe Doharound negotiations.

A.3.18 It i s expected that the next Article IV consultation with Brazil will be held on the standard
twelve-month cycle.

A.3.19 Under Article IV o f the Ih4F's Articles o f Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to
headquarters, the staffprepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At
the conclusion o f the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman o f the Board, summarizes the
views o f Executive Directors, and this summary i s transmitted to the country's authorities.

                                               I.Introduction


A5.1     The fiscal situationof Rio Grande do Sul (RGS)is widely recognizedas the most difficult in
Brazil. RGS i s the larger of the two most significant outliers whose debt indicators fail to meet the
conditions set forth in the Fiscal Responsibility Law (Lei de Responsabilidad Fiscal, LRF) (Alagoas i s
the other). Having exhaustedvirtually all forms o f financing, and given bothits highlevels o fmandatory
spendingand the fact that it has all but eliminatedinvestment spending, the state was facing an impending
fiscal crisis. This situation was alleviated by the drastic fiscal adjustment o f 2007, but only temporarily.

A5.2     The challenge to turn this situationaroundis at the core of the new government'sprogram
for fiscal adjustment and reform. RGS's large and growing debt i s due in part to the 1997-98 debt
restructuring agreements with the Federal Government that limit debt repayment to no more than
13 percent o freal net revenue (RNR, or Receita Liquida Real, RLR).

A5.3     Chronic fiscal disequilibria, expressed in the continuous generationof budget deficits since
the seventies, have resulted in high indebtedness and increasing expenditure rigidities (derived
from the debt burden, as well as rising the pension fund and personnel expenditures). These
constraints have squeezedthe fiscal space for public infrastructure investments and the provision o f social
services. The compression of public investment inroad transportation, ports, and irrigation has reduced
the economy's current competitiveness, while diminished spending on education and health threatens to

The continuity o f responsible fiscal behavior initiated in 2007, in addition to the reforms on the pension
system should guarantee the debt sustainability. The expected effect of the loan by the World Bank is
largely positive: new debt will substitute debt due inthe next few years. Thus, there is a reduction inthe
debt service pressurebeginningin2008.

                                            11.Historical Context
A5.6     The fiscal situationof Rio Grande do Sul has historicallybeenvery weak, with its primary
deficit reachingan average of 14.2 percent of net current revenue (NCR) from 1971-2002. Nor was
RGS alone in struggling to maintain its fiscal solvency. Runaway spending resulted inhighsubnational
indebtedness, which ultimately forced the federal government into three bailouts of highlyindebted states
between 1989 and 1997.         During this period, state governments had financed the gap between

expenditures and revenues through a variety of mechanisms ranging from simple debt accumulation to
inflationary financing to mandating loans from state banks and usingprivatizationproceeds.

A5.7     During the eighties and nineties R G S obviated the gap between expenditures and fiscal
revenues by using the above mentioned financing mechanisms. RGS benefited from three bailouts by
the federal government. RIO Grande do Sul's renegotiated debt in 1989was R$1.7billion or 1.4 percent
o f state GDP, the renegotiated debt o f the bail-out o f 1993 achieved R$5.8billion or 6.3 percent o f state
GDP, and the debt bailoperation o f 1997was R$22billion or 18percent o f state GDP.'

A5.8     Brazilian subnational governments have carried out fiscal adjustment efforts after the debt
renegotiation contracts signed with the National Treasury Secretariat in 1997 and, following the
enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility Law in 2000. By 1997, the new legislation limited the states'
access to sources o f finance and because their credit lines had largely run out. With its strict adherence to
debt contracts and the provisions o f the LRFresulted in a significant improvement of state governments'
fiscal behavior. States' indebtedness indicators have experienced a pronounced reduction since 2002,
including RGS.

From largefiscal imbalances to moderatefiscal adjustment

A5.9     Insufficient and discontinuous adjustment efforts together with poor revenue performance,
highrigidity of current expenditures, and especially difficult debt dynamics continue to present a
crucial challenge to fiscal reform. Meanwhile, investment has been cut back drastically, and continued
austerity threatens to create additionalproblems for an already troubled regonal economy.

A5.10 Between 2002 to April 2007, Rio Grande do Sul's net current revenues increased
21 percent, while the national average for Brazilian states' was 30 percent2. On the revenue side, the
anemic growth o f the state economy i s reflected on tax collection. RGS i s also a major exporter and
exports are zero-rated by federal law. Finally, the extensive use o f tax incentives to attract investment to

the state further damages its revenue performance.         It may be noted that the state's FRL indebtedness
indicators and its debt dynamics under the debt renegotiation contract with the STN depend on the
evolution of current revenues.

A5.11 On the expenditure side, difficulties in reducing personnel expenditures, the most important
component of state spending, i s the major limitation on the success of fiscal adjustment. Moreover,
the increasing imbalance o f the state pension system and the impossibility o f regulating the salaries of the
judiciary and the public attorney's office contribute to then pressure on state finances3.

A5.12 While the number of state employees has been brought under control (state agencies
experienced employment growth of only 4 percent from 2000 to 2006), the weight of state pensions
has been a major disequilibria factor. Retired personnel represent almost 50 percent o f total state
employment and their benefits about 50 percent o f the government wage bill. As a result o f the generous
benefit rules and eligibility criteria enshrined in the federal constitution and in other state and federal
legislation, the deficit offthe system i s o f 2.6 percent o fthe state's GDP in2006/07.

A5.13 The state government's inability to control salaries outside of the executive branch further
limitsits ability to curtail spending. While the executive branchreduced its personnel expenditures by
6 percent between 2001 and 2006, the judiciary and the public attorney increased their payrolls by 25 and
42 percent, respectively, over the same period. According to the National Treasury, Rio Grande do Sul
spends the most inpersonnel and pensions inrelation to its net current revenue.

A5.14 Finally, extensive earmarking of revenues by state and federal constitution has constrained
the current government's ability to either curtail overall spending, or adjust the expenditure mix.
Moreover, all transfers from the federal government are earmarked in advance and compounded by

the state's fiscal space.


The 1997Debt Bailout and its Consequences
A5.15 In 1997the federal governmentrestructuredthe debt with the states andfinancedthe state-
owned public banksthrough the Stimulus Programfor Reducing the Activity of the Public Sector
in the Banking System (Programa de Estimulo a Reducao do Setor Publico nu Atividade Bancaria,
PROES). By December 2007 the consolidated debt o f Rio Grande do Sul was R$35.9 billion (roughly
US$20 billion). The federal government's debt currently represents 88 percent o f the state debt; other
domestic debt represents 4 percent o f total debt; judiciary debt (precathrios) represents 5 percent; and
external debt represents 3 percent. Naturally, most o f the debt held by the federal government originated
inthe debt refinancingagreements withthe state governments.

A5.16 Under Law 9496 of the debt renegotiationagreement, the RGS state debt was divided in
two groups. The intra-limite debt includes all debt included under the restructuring program o f 1997
with the remaining debt corresponding to the previous bail-out operations o f 1989 and 1993. Under Law
9496, the interest rate was set at 6 percent plus the price index on the balances and with a 30 year
maturity. Service o f the intra-limite debt was set using a constant debt service schedule. However, a cap
o f 13 percent o f the state's real net revenues was fvred for the annual debt service with the exceeding
interest being automatically capitalized. While the intra-limite represents almost 80 percent o f the state's
total debt, the ceiling o f 13 percent o f state revenue for debt services guarantees an effective smoothing o f
the debt service profile related to this debt, but also virtually guarantees that the total debt will continue to
grow.

A5.17 The extra-limite debt includesthe external debt, the debt under the PROES', a floating rate
bonddebt linkedto the BrazilianCentralBankheadlinerate(SELIC), adebtwith the pensionfund
of the Banrisul employees and other minor debts. Although less important in terms o f outstanding
value (20 percent o f total debt), the extra-limite debt service profile explains the overall uneven debt
service profile. Besides the heavy burden it places on state finances-representing           more than 15 percent
o f the state's net real revenue-debt service presents an unfavorable profile. In particular, the debt
service flows display a noticeable concentration inthe period 2007-2010.

                                      111.GovernmentFinances,2003-2007

A5.18 Duringthe period2003-2007, fiscal managementof the state government of Rio Grandedo
Sul has improvedcomparedto the experienceof the previousthree decades. Before the adoption o f
fiscal adjustment program by the current state government, the primary balance reached an average
surplus o f 1.8 percent o f NCR from 2003 to 2006.6 Nevertheless, improvements in budgetary and

4. The FederalGovernment set upthree bailout operations during 1989 to 1997. At prices o fDecember o f2006, in
1989 the federal government assumed R$24.5 billion o f state's external debt which represented 1.4 percent o f
national GDP. In 1993, the National Treasury Secretariat assumed R$ 93 billion or 7.2 percent o f GDP o f state's
debt with federal financial institutions. Finally, in 1997, the federal government restructured state's bond debt by
R$209 billion or 12percent o f GDP.
5.   Under this program, the federal government provided financing to state governments to clean up their banks and
prepare them for privatization. In most o f the states, this debt was included in the intra-limite debt, but as Rio
Grande do Sul decided no to privatize its bank, the Banrisul, the PROES debt was included inthe extra-limite debt
worsening the debt profile.
6. The net real revenue (NRR)concept was originated from the debt renegotiation contracts o f 1997-98 and the net
current revenue (NCR) in the Fiscal Responsibility Law o f 2000. They are different concepts. The differences
include coverage and current revenue items that are deducted. The NRR covers only the direct administration
(central government and state-dependent agencies). The NCR, on the other hand, refers to the consolidated public

financial management have been uneven. Government operating costs have continued to rise rapidly and
unsustainably, as have salaries in the Judiciary, the Legislature, and the Public Attorney's Office. The
state pension system remains a major liability. The overuse o f tax expenditures imposes a huge cost in
foregone revenue. Constitutional earmarking has limited the space for fiscal adjustment. Finally, despite
earlier restructuring efforts the overall debt profile o f RGS remains dismal, due to an unfavorable debt
mix, high interest rates compounded by an oversensitive inflation index, and the cap of 13 percent on
debt. Insum, previous improvements mustbe shored upby continuing reform.


Fiscal Balances 2003-2007


A5.19 During the period 2003-2007 the state government of RGS increased its primary balance
from a deficit of $R100 million in 2003 to a surplus of R$454 million in 2006 and R$967 million in
2007. This was achieved mainly through drastic cutbacks in public investment. The fiscal austerity
necessary to main the primary balance surplus already threatens infrastructure maintenance and the
provision ofbasic services.

Revenues
A5.20 Rio Grande do Sul's current fiscal situation is largely defined by the absence or
underutilization of major potential revenue streams.                The ICMS (Imposto sobre CircuZagZo de
Mercadorias e Sewips), Brazil's value-added tax, is the most important element o f Rio Grande do Sul's
revenue. During2007, it accounted for about 85 percent o f the state's tax revenue and 60 percent o f total
revenue. According to data available for 2004, RGS ranked 24h out o f 27 states in terms o f ICMS
revenue per GDP of the state. RGS i s the third largest state exporter inBrazil, after Sao Paulo and Minas
Gerais. In 2006 RGS exports were valued at US$11.8 billion, and accounted for 8.6 percent o f Brazil's
total exports. As noted above, exports are zero ratedunder federal law. Ifinstead o f exporting to foreign
markets RGS sold to other states, its tax additional revenue could reach between R$1.15 billion and
R$1.98 billion.    Given that the federal government reimburses the state at only R$300 million, the
revenue shortfall due to the tax exemption on exports i s considerable.

A5.21 The use of tax breaks and similar incentives designed to lure both foreign and domestic
investment represents another major source of foregone income.                         These policies, called tax
expenditures, are widespread among the Brazilian states, and competition in tax expenditures is often
referredto as the "fiscal war". RGS government studies indicate that fiscal incentives inthat state alone
amount to roughly R$ 6.6 billion, representing 35 percent o f potential state tax collection. Most RGS tax
expenditures (17 percent o f potential revenue) relate to the exemptions to the export sector mentioned
above, which are included in national tax legislation and which therefore do not depend on the state
government's decisions. Another important part o f the state's tax expenditures (11 percent o f potential
revenue) are general tax exemptions to specific types o f taxpayers such as micro-businesses. These are
tax base (threshold) reductions, which are difficult to alter once inplace. The remaining tax expenditure
category corresponds to the modality o f presumed credit (crdditopresumido) which represents 7 percent
o f the state potential tax collection. Differently fi-om the other categories, this type o f tax incentives could
be reviewed and progressively eliminated. The state government announced the review o f the fiscal
incentives under this last modality.

A5.22 Tax income lost to inefficient collection represents a third major source of foregone

A5.23 Despite these difficulties, significant progress has been made in increasing revenues on
current budget lines. As the table 5.2 shows, total revenue has increased by 17percent in real terms
over the past four years, while net current revenue has increased by 15.4percent.            The largest total
increase has been in tax revenues, which has risenby nearly BR$1.5 billion at 2007 prices (or 12percent
inrealterms) since 2003, largelyonthe strength ofthe value-addedtax.

A5.24 Transfers from the federal government have also increased considerably in recent years.
Current transfers rose by 42 percent. While FUNDEF (educational) transfers rose by 24 percent (BR$1.2
billion at 2007 prices), "other federal transfers" more than tripled from BR$363 million in 2003 to
BR$1.1billion in2007. However, these transfers cause deficits in the margin because they are linked to
higher outlays.

A5.25 Among the largest increases has been in contributions to the civil servants pension fund
(Regime Pr6prio de Previdhcia Social, RPPS), which are up more than 50 percent. Contribution
revenue has increasedas a result o fthe 2003 reform and is now essentially inline with that o f other states,
pension expenditure i s still significantly higher.

Expenses
A5.26 In terms of fiscal performance the pension scheme for civil servants in RGS is among the
worst in Brazil. Old age and disability pensions (aposentadorias por tempo de sewiqo, idade, e

invalidez) account for 77 percent o f total expenditure, while survivor pensions (pens6es por morte)
account for the remaining 23 percent. Retired teachers represent the single largest segment o f RPPS old
age and disability pensioners and related expenditure - they account for 37 percent o f old age and
disability expenditure and more than one-fourth o f total pension expenditure.

A5.27 The RPPS o f RGS i s more mature than the average state RPPS. The dependency ratio in
RGS (the ratio o f beneficiaries to active workers) is 92 percent, roughly comparable to the dependency
ratio o fthe federal scheme, but significantly higher than the ratio o f the average state RPPS. The survivor
ratio inRGS is also higher than the average for all states. These differences are primarily due to the fact
that RGS introduced its own RPPS before the other states, but there could be other factors at work as
well, including demographic factors (e.g., longer life expectancies) and the characteristics o f teacher
plans.

A5.28 As seen inTable 5.3, personnel costs have continued to rise but at a more moderate pace, in
due to the efforts by the current and previous administrations t o limit salary increases. Employee
compensation rose by 5.8percent in real terms between 2003 and 2007, while total pensions rose
15.3 percent in real terms. Executive Branch salaries have risen only modestly in the past six years, as
opposed to those o f the Judiciary, Legislature, and the Public Attorney's Office, inwhich nominal salaries
have all more than doubled since 2000.

A5.29 Expenditures on goods and services have risen significantly between 2003 and 2006 (at
about 36percent in real terms), mostly as a result o f fastest growth in other branches o f
government, led by the judiciary and the attorney general's office. This prompted the current
administration to make reducing procurement costs a top priority o f budget reform. The government was
able to cut spending on goods and services in2007 by 4.4 percent at constant prices.

A5.30 Spending on non-financial assets has fallen considerably, highlighting the ongoing decline in
public investment expenditures. While this has contributed significantly to the overall solvency o f the
primary budget balance, continuing the trend o f low public investment i s likely to have serious negative
consequences for the long-term growth prospects o f Rio Grande do Sul.

                                     IV. The 2007 FiscalPackageReforms


A5.31 Since its inaugurationin January 2007, the administration of Governor Yeda Crusius has
faced a very difficult fiscal situation. For the first time, a new government had won the state elections
by running on a platform o f fiscal adjustment, improvement in the quality of public services, and
budgetary reform.

A5.32 The original government program, based on a drastic fiscal adjustment followed by a
reform in public sector management, contains an array of fiscal efforts based on both enhancing
revenues and reducing expenditures. In spite o f the rejection by the state assembly of an increase o f
the rate o f ICMS, the government has, however, continued with its program o f fiscal adjustment based on
improving tax collection, decreasing the creation o f tax-expenditures, containing expenditure pressures on
government salaries, andreducing government spending on goods and services.

A5.33 The newly-elected administration faced a very difficult fiscal situation. A large projected
deficit o f R$2.4 billion, an expected decrease in tax revenues o f R$700 million due the no renewal o f tax
rate increases, and increasing pressures for salary increases conceded in the final days o f the previous
administration, along with a considerable accumulation o f debt service payments in the short run and a
sizeable debt with suppliers contributed to a deep financial crisis at the beginning o f the current state
administration.

A5.34 To dealwith this difficult situation,the governmentadopteda set of emergencymeasuresto
reduce the projected deficit for 2007. The package encompassed initiatives focusing on both sides o f
the budget to reduce expenses and increase state tax revenues. On the expenditure side, the government
adopted the following measures: first, a reduction o f 20 percent of commissioned positions (about 750
positions); second, administrative reform reducing 10 percent o f the administrative structure o f the
Executive Branch (from 76 entities to 69 entities)'; third, issuing a decree revising the 2006 Budget Law
to adjust it to a more conservative revenue collection forecast and impose expenditure ceilings for all the

                                                                         Annex 5: Fiscal Sustainability Analysis



state secretariats and indirect administration entities; fourth, a linear cut of about 30percent in the
operating cost o f all the state secretariats complemented by a broader expenditure rationalizationprogram
that encompasses the modernization o f the state procurement system, fifth, a matrix model to manage
expense and auditing processes to detect inefficiencies and waste; sixth, negotiation with credit providers
to reduce short term liquidity pressures coming from floating debt corresponding to the fiscal year 2006
and; seventh, given the expenditure rigidities the government was obligated to cut more than 50 percent
o f the investment budget.

A5.35     On the revenue side, government actions were directed to compensate the revenue losses
derived from the non-extension of the VAT rate increase by the previous legislature. Given the
impossibility o f increasing tax rates, the government measures concentrated on the enhancement o f tax
collection efficiency through the introduction o f new managerial tools to reduce tax evasion (a matrix
management model), a review o f the system o f tax credit devolution to exporters. Other measures
designed to yield revenues included the implementation o f the Growth Incentive Program (Cresce RS) to
stimulate certain sectors through reduced tax rates (as long as increased revenue i s guaranteed) and the
progressive adoption o f electronic fiscal receipts to avoid tax evasion ininterstate trade.

A5.36 In order to reduce medium to long run deficits from the civil service pension system the
government created a pension fund for new civil servants. Usinghalf o f the proceeds from the initial
public offering for the state bank (Banrisul, which raised a total o f about US$ 1.2 billion in July 2007),
the government received the approval o f the state assembly to place these proceeds into a complementary
pension fund for new civil servants that entered or will enter in the state public sector after 2003. The
draft law regulating this complementary pension system and its fund is currently being discussed in the
state assembly.

A5.37 The results in the first year of the new government have been substantial despite the
revenue losses, high spending rigidity and the salary increases decreed by the outgoing state
government in 2006. The primary fiscal balance increased to R$967 million in 2007 (6.9 percent o f
NCR), up from R$471 million in 2006 (3.4 percent o f NCR). Total revenue increased 3 percent inreal
terms in 2007 while total spending growth fell to 1.8 percent, compared to an average real expenditure
growth o f 3.8 percent in the period from 2003-2006. The largest adjustment relied on a real contraction
o f 4.4 percent in the use o f goods and services, while overall compensation to government employees
remained basically constant inreal terms.

A5.3 8 The package includes containing salary increases, rationalizing spending across the different
branches o f government, the modernization o f human resource administration and public sector
management, rationalize the use o f tax expenditures, reforms to the pension system, and overall debt
restructuring (including thisproposed DPL).

A5.39 Rio Grande do Sul consolidated debt reached253 percent of net current revenues in 2007,
far above the FiscalResponsibilityLaw target ceiling of 200 percent. At the end-2007, 88 percent o f
consolidated debt was with the National Treasury due to refinancing agreements between federal
government and the state government. Despite the reduction in the Debt to Net Current Revenue ratio,
from a higho f 295 percent in2002, total debt continues to grow at an unsustainable level due to the year
onyear increaseinthe non-paidresidual.

            (')According to the Fiscal Responsibility Law, deductions are equal to zero ifthe sumo f
            Financial assets and others is negative.


A5.40 In addition to the intra-limite debt owed to the STN, RGS has a considerable extra-limite
debt. RGS has an extra-Zimite debt which amounts about R$ 3.5 billion or 12 percent o f the total debt,
which generates large debt services payments that are not included under the 13 percent cap. The main
RGS extra-Zimite liabilities are the debt coming from the federal Program of State Bank Restructuring
(PROES)', amounting R$1.5 billion, a debt with the pension fund of the employees o f the State Bank
amounting R$700 million, external debt (with IFIS)amounting R $ l billion and a bond debt o f
R$160million with a floating rate linked to the Brazilian Central Bank headline interest rate (SELIC).
Contenting liabilities, most of them coming from judiciary decisions (the so called precativrios)
(R$2 billion) also contributing to debt accumulation and bringing high volatility on debt service
payments.

A5.41 Extra-limite debt generates a very uneven debt profile, from 1 to 5 percent of net current
revenue during the period 2008-2015. Projected debt service on extra-Zimite debt shows a strong
accumulation of debt payments duringthe period from 2008 to2012. Debt service rises to 5 percent o fnet
current revenues in2008 and falls slowly to about 2 percent of NCR in2015.


8.  RGS did not undertake the privatization o f its state bank (Banrisul). The refusal to privatize the Banrisul led to
the exclusion o f the debt services coming from the PROES program from the cap o f 13 percent used for the intra-
limite debt.

A5.42 The use of the General Price Index (IGP) to correct the debt balances also accelerated the
rate of debt accumulation. Table 5.5 shows that the faster rate of increase inthe IGP compared with the
Consumer Price Index (IPCA) led to an additional increase in the debt to net current revenue ratio of
56 percentage points from 1998-2006. Therefore the debt service capitalization and the monetary
correction of the debt stocks have been the dnving factors of the RGS debt increase, and are responsible
for more than 116percent o f the debt stock increase, while the net balance among new borrowing and
amortizations had anegative contribution on the RGS indebtedness o f -16 percentagepoints ofnet current
revenues.

    VI. Compliance with the FiscalResponsibility Law andwith the FiscalAdjustment Programs
                                        Agreed with the NationalTreasury
A5.43 The state government of RGS has met only partially with the FiscalResponsibility Law key
indicator requirements since its enactment in 2000, mainly becauseof its high level of debt and debt
service payments. The reduction of net consolidated debt to net current revenue from 280percent in
2003 to 254 percent in 2007, mostly as a result of growth in net current revenue has not been enough to
comply with the fiscal responsibility law. The state i s far from reaching the 200 percent o f NCR overall
target, but also the adjustment target, which was 243.6 percent ofNCR in2007.

A5.44 The state also did not comply with the indicator of the ratio of debt service payments to
NCR that has been between 13 and 14percent between 2003 and 2006, above the target of
11.5 percent of NCR.According to its own estimates, the state has been mostly in compliance with the
other indicators o f the FRL. The personnel expenditures to net current revenue ratio, which under the
Fiscal Responsibility Law should be inferior to 60 percent, declined from 58 percent in2003 to 51percent
in 2006. It is important to note here that the figures compiled by the state differ substantially from the
ones obtained directly from the fiscal accounts, as seen in our own estimates and those compiled by the
federal government and presented in the program o f fiscal adjustment.'                     According to the state


9. The figures presentedby RGS (and all other states) do not follow a nationally recognized standard and are under
the supervision o f the office o f the comptroller o f the state (Tribunal de Contas do Estado). As a result each state
can include and exclude different items. Inprinciple the accounts refer to the consolidated fiscal figures o fthe state.


                                                            94

                                                                             Annex 5: Fiscal Sustainability Analysis


comptroller's office, personnel expenditures do not include, severance payments, payments derived from
judicial decisions, payments derived from past fiscal years, certain fringe benefits, among others.

A5.45 New loans as a proportion of the net current revenue have not exceeded 3 percent of net
current revenue, well below the legally-imposedlimits of 16 percent. The state has also maintained
the concession o f guarantees under the legally-imposed limits o f 22 percent o f net current revenue, falling
from 6.2 percent in2003 to less than 2.5 percent in 2007. The primary balance indicators required by the
PAF, have been mostly outside their targets, but moderated fiscal improvement in 2005 resulted in a
primary surplus above the target, and more so with the fiscal adjustment implemented in2007.

A5.46 In addition, the state has also met partially the fiscal targets defined in the rolling three-
year Fiscal Adjustment Programs (PA0 negotiatedwith the National Treasury Secretariat (which
are part of the debt renegotiationcontract signed in 1997).'' Table 5.8 shows that the state has not
been in compliance between 2004 and 2006 with a significant number o f the targets which have been
negotiated with the National Treasury. In 2007, however, all o f the targets were met with the exception
o f the level o f financial investments. The fiscal accounts included in these calculations are revenues and
expenditures that correspond to the state treasury, and exclude public enterprises and other autarchies. As
a result they are not comparable with the consolidated fiscal figures that we have in the fiscal accounts.
These figures, however, are comparable across states as are well definedby the federal treasury"




 10. The Fiscal Adjustment Program agreed with 26 state governments (and some large municipalities) under the
 Debt Restructuring Program was an additional tool usedby the Federal Government to reinforce fiscal discipline for
 subnational governments. The achievement o f the targets facilitates new credit operations by the states.
 11. According to the technical terms o f understanding between the National Treasury and RGS, personnel
 expenditure does not include spending derived fromjudicial decisions, severance payments, payments derived from
 certain fringe benefits, and others. As a result, the expense recorded for compliance with the fiscal responsibility
 law for 2006 and 2007 at 65.5 and 68.1 percent o f NCR differs from the spending recorded on the fiscal accounts, at
 69.2 and 71.8 percent o fNCR, respectively.

A5.47 In this section, the fiscal situation of RGS will be projected in order to asses fiscal
sustainability of the state, the state's capacity to repay the Bank's loan, with and the fiscal impact of
the new policies. Inaddition, compliance withkey indicatorsof the LRFwill be evaluated through time.
For this, two scenarios will be depicted: first without the lending operation and second with the World
Banklendingoperation.

A5.48 The main hypotheses for both projections are presented in Table5.9 below. The market
expectations, based on the consensus forecast published in the Central Bank Report "Focus-Market
Readout," were used to set values for inflation, GDP growth and exchange rate inthese exercise^.'^ The
level of investment from 2008 afterwards is assumed to increase so as to reach a constant with respect to
Net Current Revenue after 2011of about 4 percent inthe baseline scenario case andabout 8 percent inthe
case o f the World Bank lending operation scenario. The simulation considers new credit operations when
the net lendinghon-owing balance i s negative and debt repayments ifpositive.



13. The expectation was from the February 8,2008.

                                                                              Annex 5: Fiscal Sustainability Analysis




First Scenario: without the World Bank lending operation and reforms
A5.49 This scenario projectsthe fiscal situation of RGSwithout the World Bank lending operation
and reforms. The assumptions, which were made explicit inTable 5.9, show that there i s no reform in
the civil service pension system, employee compensation and goods and services continue to grow as
before 2007, and state investment remains below 4 percent o f net current revenue. The results o f this
scenario are presented inTable 5.10 below.

A5.50 As a result, all fiscal balances deteriorate. The primary balance slowly deteriorates and
even becomes negative at the end of the analyzed period, falling from a surplus of 6.9 percent of
NCRin2007 to a deficit of2.1 percent ofNCRin2020. Net lendinghorrowing also falls continuously
from a deficit o f 6.1 percent o f NCR in2007 to a deficit o f 13.6 percent o fNCR in 2020. By assumption,
public investment i s caped at about 3.6 percent o f NCR, but even such low level of investment (lower
than the average inthe last 5 years o f 5 percent o fNCR), does not help the weak fiscal balances.

A5.51 Projected fiscal weakening is also reflected in increase in total indebtedness in nominal
terms, although debt as a percent of NCR falls sli htly from 254 percent in 2007 to 235 percent in
2020, always above the limits implicit in the LW." The moderate fall inthe ratio o f debt is explained
by the assumption o f growth in NCR at about 7 percent in nominal terms led by the increase in total
revenues. The debt service ratio remains at about 17percent o f N C R to fall slightly to 15 percent o f NCR
by2002 well above the LRFtarget o f 11.5 percent.

A5.52 The ceiling for personnel expenditures (60 percent of net current revenues) will not be met
(according to the consolidated numbers and not considering ad-hoc exemptions), in fact, it will remain
fairly constant at about 73 percent o f NCR. In addition, the lack of reform in the civil service pension
systemresults inthe deficit to remain at about 32 percent ofNCR for most of the projected period.

A5.53 The weakening inthe projectedfiscal balances for the coming years occurs despite the fact that in
the hypotheses considered: some items o f the revenues depend on economic growth while important
components o f expenditures are influenced by population growth.                 As our hypothesis o f projected
regional economic growth i s higher than the estimated RGS population growth the estimationpredicted a
better fiscal situation in the future. An analysis of the sensibility of the projection to economic growth
will be done inthe section VIII




14.  Federal Senate Resolution n. 40/2001, as determined by Fiscal Responsibility Law, established limits for state
indebtedness at a ceiling is o f 200 percent of net current revenue. For states that were above this level, a 15 year
period was given to reach this level, with a reduction of 1/15 each year. In the case o f Rio Grande do Sul, as
explained before, which net debt was 272.7 percent of net current revenue at 2001, each year the level of
indebtedness was to decrease by 4.85 percent o f net current revenue, to reach 200 percent in2016.

SecondScenario:withthe World Banklendingoperation
A5.54 This scenario projects the fiscal situation of RGS including the World Bank lending
operation of US$1billion to be used for restructuring extra-limit debt and the reforms. The
assumptions, which were made explicit in Table 5.9, include the reform in the civil service pension
system, constraints in the growth of employee compensation and o f the use goods and services at more
moderate levels and following the reforms which were initiated in 2007. The level of state investment
doubles inrelative terms compared to the baseline scenario and remains slightly lower than 8 percent of
net current revenue. The results of this scenario are presentedinTable 5.1 1below.

A5.55 In addition to the reduction inthe rate of growth of spending compared to the baseline scenario,
the projection exercise adds a margmal increase in tax collection efficiency as a result of the reforms in
tax collection. Compensation of employees by the state is now projected go grow at inflation plus
population growth, in line with the government decision to moderate increases in wages and salaries in
the public sector.

A5.56 Comparedto the baselinescenario, all fiscal balancesimprove slowly but consistently. The
primary balance slowly improves to reach a surplus of 16.9percent o f NCR in 2020 compared to
6.9percent o f NCR in 2007. Net lendinghorrowing also improves continuously from a deficit of
6.1 percent of NCR in 2007 to a surplus o f 9.2 percent o f NCR in 2020. By assumption, public
investment i s caped at about 7.6 percent of NCR, 4 percent higher than inthe baseline scenario. Despite
this, the overall fiscalbalancebecomespositive in2015 when debtpayments canbe accelerated.

A5.57 Projected fiscal strengthening is reflected in moderate improvementsin total indebtedness
in nominaland relativeterms. Debt as a percent of NCR falls from 254 percent in 2007 to less than
200 percent in2017 (meeting only them the limits of the LRF) and to about 150percent of NCR in2020.
The debt service ratio falls from about 17percent of NCR to 11.2 percent of NCR (below the limit o f the
LRFof 11.5 percentofNCR) only in2018 andfalls to 9.4 percent in2020.

A5.58 The ceiling for personnelexpenditures(60percent of net current revenues) will only be met
in 2018 and will fall to 57 percent of NCR in 2020, from 72.6 percent in 2007. Reforms inthe civil
service pension system are expected to have some meaningful effect by reducing the deficit to 25 percent
ofNCR in2020 compared to 31percent ofNCR in2007.

                                        VIII. Sensitivity Analysis


A5.59 Using the World Bank lending operation as the baseline, a sensitivity analysis exercise
was performed.       The purpose was to identify the most important risks to future financial
performance of the Rio Grande do SUI state government. The analysis is based on a set o f
potential risks. Changes inrevenues (tax, social contribution and current transfers) and expenditures
(personnel and others current expenditures - without interest and constitutional transfers) will be
considered as well as changes in the most important economic determinants o f fiscal sustainability,
economic growth, andthe exchange rate.

A5.60 Onthe revenue side, the most important riskis tax revenues, as it represented 71 percent
of total revenues in 2007. Transfers from the federal government, the second most important source
o f revenue, represented 21 percent o f total revenues in the same year.      On the expenditure side,
personnel expenditures are the major source o f risk, especially the state employees' social security
imbalances which represent a real and substantial source o f risk for non-compliance with the LRF
requirements  .
A5.61 Exchange rate variations are also a major source of riskas almost all of the stock of debt
i s influenced directly or indirectly (through the general price index) by the exchange rate. The
projection exercise in the previous section assumes a higher rate o f economic growth (which affects
revenues) vis-a-vis the population growth (which affects mostly expenditures).         As expected the
positive scenario i s very sensitive to economic growth. Inthis way, changes in this hypothesis may
change our results o f fiscal sustainability inthe longrun.

Revenues
A5.62 At the revenue side, by looking at tax revenue (the most important component o f revenues),
we find that a reduction o fonly 5.4 percent o ftaxes increases the debt to N C Rratio above 200 percent
in2020. Other financial indicators show also no compliance comparedto the baseline case. The debt
service to NCR ratio rose to 13.3 percent (from 9.4 percent) and the personnel to NCR ratio rose to
60.7 percent (fi-om 57.1 percent). Innbothcases above the limitso fthe LRF.

A5.63 Current transfers for the federal government, the second most important source of
revenues, have a significant but more moderate effect on the debt to NCR ratio. A decrease o f
20 percent is needed inorder to produce an increase equivalent to 50percent o f NCR in 2020. As a
result, the debt service to NCR ratio rose to 13.2 percent and the personnel to NCR ratio rose to
60.4 percent.

Expenditures
A5.64 On the expenditure side (excluding earmarked transfers) personnel expenses amounted to
48 percent of total expenditures, followed by the use o f goods and services at 17percent o f total
expenditures.

A5.65 An increase of 9 percent of personnel expenditures is enough to increase total debt above
the 200 percent limit in 2020. The cost o f use o f goods and services, on the other hand, will have to
increase by about 22 percent inorder to rise the net to NCRratio above its legal limit by 2020.




                                                     104

                                                                        Annex 5: Fiscal Sustainability Analysis

Growth
A5.66 An annualeconomic growth 0.8 percent lower thanthe original hypothesis is sufficient to
prevent the state from complying with the legal debt ceiling in 2020. That is, if economic growth
in2008 were 3.7 percent and o f 3.2 percent in 2009 and beyond, RGS will not meet the debt ceiling,
or the debt to NCRratio will increase by about 50 percent in 2020. Inaddition, debt service to NCR
will also increase above the limit (to 12.4 percent o fNCRin2020) andpersonnel expense to NCRwill
also rise above the limit (reaching 62 percent).


Exchange Rate
A5.67 The debt of RGS i s strongly affected by the exchange rate not directly but through the
general price index to which most of the debt is indexed. Although only about 3 percent o f total
consolidated debt i s indexedto the dollar, slightly more than 90 percent of the state debt i s affectedby
changes in the general price index (IGP-DI). For the sensitivity analysis we have assumed that the
pass-through effect o f exchange rate devaluation on the IGP-DIindex i s 50 percent.

A5.68 The debt to NCR ratio is extremely sensitive to a movement in the exchange rate (and
the expected change in the general price index). The exercise shows that a 2.7 percent devaluation
(measured in Reais per US. dollar) i s enough to increase the debt to NCR ratio above 200 percent in
2020.


                                              IX. Riskanalysis
A5.69 Besides the sensitivity analysis for each variable, risk analyses were conducted to observe
simultaneous random shocks ina set o f variables and their impacts on the state's financial situation.

A5.70 A random error was added to each o f the following variables: tax revenues, federal
government transfers, state government transfers, personnel expenditures and pension fund
contributions, other current expenditures (including goods and services), and the exchange rate. For
each variable, the random error affected the simulationinthe following way":




                                                    where:

                                         xt :variable at the time t;

                                             xt-l: variable at t-I;

                  gxt:growth rate o fthe variable x at time t on the base case scenario;

                                               Et: random error



A5.71 For all variables, the assumption was normal distributions with zero mean for all random
errors. For the exchange rate the standard deviation was 10%. Exchange rate errors will impact
dollar-indexed debt and general price index (IGP) indexed debt.              The hypothesis is that 50% o f
exchange rate variation has a direct impact on the general price index. For other current expenditures
and personnel expenditures, the standard deviation was 3% and for the current revenues and transfers
the standard deviation was 5%.       The lower standard deviation for expenditures is based on the
hypothesis that the state has more control over these variables. These assumptions are shown inTable

A5.72 Indebtedness remains a very important issue for the government, as the large public
debt remainshigher than the pathof adjustment towards a more sustainable level. As shown in
Table 5.13 below the ceiling for the indebtedness level is achieved with probability o f 56% without
the World Bank operation but the probability o f compliance rises to 78% with the World Bank
operation. The probabilistic approach shows a much better figure compared to the base case scenario
o f the more deterministic exercise presented in Tables 5.10 and 5.11, but more significantly indicates
that the effect of the World Bank operation and ensuing reforms have a measurable impact towards
improving debt sustainability. In addition, these results also show that the average level o f debt to
NCR falls from 211% without the World Bank operation to 165% for the case in which reforms
supportedby the World Bank are included.

A5.73 At the same time, debt service paymentsremain above the levels requiredby the Fiscal
ResponsibilityLaw. As already discussed above, debt service to net current revenue ration remains a
critical variable. The probability o f compliance with the legal ceiling o f 11.5% for this variable is 1%
without the World Bank operation and only 6% including the World Bank operation. The average
estimated for the ratio o f debt service to NCRis 15% without the World Bank operation and 14%with
the World Bank operation, inboth cases well above the required threshold o f 11.5%. Inour base case
scenario this variable was not complied with in any o f the years projected, although it showed a
slightly decreasing pattern.

A5.74 The probability of compliance with the personnel expenditures ceiling is only 32%.
Although the numbers show a significant probability o f non-compliance on indebtedness and
personnel expenditures, it i s worth remembering that until2007 these limitshave never complied with
by the state government (including personnel expenditure measured according to the fiscal accounts).
This result i s still significantly above the no-reform scenario in which the probability o f compliance
i s only 13%. Inboth cases, the average for all years considered remains above the recommendratio at
64% and 71%, respectively.         Most significantly, the lack of access to credit (both due to legal
impediment and lack o f market access) show that the probability o f compliance i s 100% in both
scenarios as the state has not incurred and i s not expected to incur innew credit operations, excluding
debt restructuring as inthe case o f the debt restructuring with the World Bankpresentedhere.

                                             X. FinalRemarks


A5.75 The Government of the State of RGS has gone through an impressive fiscal adjustment
inthe last year, with a significant reduction in expenditures combined with healthy increases in
revenue collection. As a result, the state government presented better figures than usual for its
primary balances (6.9 percent in 2007 compared to an average o f 1.X percent in the four years ending
in2006). Although fiscal adjustment has been impressive, and it is expected to continue of over the
medium term with the government fiscal program, the state is far from complying with all the legal
limitsestablished by the FiscalResponsibilityLaw and the FiscalAdjustment Programagreed with the
National Treasury.

A5.76 Medium-term impacts of the adjustment measures developed by the state in conjunction
with the US$1billion World Bank loan are expected to be quite positive and sustainable.
Sensitivity analysis nonetheless shows that this predicted positive trend depends on continued
improvements in the efficiency o f tax revenue collection and perseverance in the tight control o f
current expenditures.    Positive prospects also depend on economic growth exceeding population
growth, a reasonable hypothesis.

A5.77 Risk analysis shows that the most important underlying source of vulnerability is the
state's high level of indebtedness. High debt service will continue to exert pressure on public
finances. The exchange rate constitutes another risk factor for debt sustainability despite the fact that
only less than 3 percent o f the state's debt stock i s indexed to exchange rate but because more than
90% o f the state's debt i s indexedto the General h c e Index (IGP) which i s very sensitive to changes
inthe exchange rate. While a logcal measure to mitigate the exchange raterisk would be to improve
the debt composition by reducing the share o f the IGP-indexed debt, the state's ability to implement
such conversions i s limited because most o f these debts are fixed in the bilateral debt refinancing
agreement between the state and the National Treasury.

                              ANNEX 6: DEBTRESTRUCTURINGOPERATION

A.6.1 The financial difficulties faced by RGS stemming from elevated debt service obligations
caused by its high level of indebtedness are exacerbated by the uneven profile of debt payments. In
particular, the state debt profile presents an accumulation of debt service obligations over the next four
years that increases the scale and difficulty of fiscal adjustment. The consolidated debt o f RIOGrande do
Sul was R$ 35.9 billion (roughly US$ 20 billion) in December 2007, equal to 254 percent o f its net
current revenues and well above the FRLlimit o f 200 percent that needs to be reached by 201516.

A.6.2 Most of the RGS debt is held by the federal government. The debt with the Federal
Government represents 88 percent o f the state's debt, other domestic debt represent 4 percent of total
debt, judiciary debt (precatbrios)represents 5 percent, and external debt represents 3 percent. The bulk o f
RGS debt with the federal government was established under the debt refinancing agreement signed with
the National Treasury Secretariat. As explained above, under Law 9496 of the debt renegotiation
agreement, the state debt was divided intwo components:

     0   intra-limite debt, w h c h i s all debt covered under the 1997 restructuring program as well as
         residual debt from the previous bail-out operations of 1989 and 1993. InDecember 2007, RGS
         intra-limite debt was at R$ 30.1 billion. Under Law 9496, the interest rate was set at 6 percent
         plus price indexation on balances. The debt service of the intra-limite debt was set using a Price
         Table. The intra-limite debt represents more than 80 percent o f the state's total debt. However, a
         cap o f 13 percent o f state real net revenues was set for annual debt service, and any amount above
         this cap is automatically capitalized. Thus, the 13 percent debt service ceiling provides an
         effective smoothing mechanism o f the debt service profile, but clearly does not ensure debt
         sustainability.

     0   extra-limite debt, which includes all the remaining debts that were not renegotiated with the STN
         and any new debt contracted after the debt renegotiation o f 1997. RGS extra-limite debt amounts
         to R$3.6 billion or 12 percent ofthe state's total debt. It includes the external debt, the debt under
         the Programof State BankRestructuring (PROES)", a floating rate bonddebt (LFT) linked to the
         Brazilian Central Bank headline rate (SELIC), a debt with the pension fund for employees of the
         state bank Banrisul (FundaGio Banrisul, FB) and other small debts. Extra-limite debt payments
         are responsible for the uneven debt service profile, as its projected debt obligations for the period
         2008-2015 vary between 5 percent of state revenues in 2008 to 1 percent o f state revenues for
         2013 to 2015. In addition, the RGS government has been accumulating a debt originated in
         judiciary decisions (precatdrios) that also adds a high degree o f volatility to the debt service
         profile because o f its contingent nature.




16. For the states that were above the FRL ceiling of 200 percent in 2000 (when the law was enacted), it was
established a uniform declining path for their debts to revenues ratios that should reach 200 percent in 2015. The
declining path for the RGS indebtedness indicate that the debt to revenue ratio should be at 244 percent which
means that RGS is tempercentage points above the FRL decliningpath.
17. Underthis program, the federal governmentprovided financing to state governmentsto strengthen their banks'
financial situation and prepare them for privatization. Inmost of the states, this debt was included inthe intra-limite
debt, but as Rio Grande do Sul decidednot to privatize its bank, Banrisul, the PROES debt was included in the
extra-limite, debt worsening the debt profile because the extra-limite debt is not subject to the 13 percent debt
service ceiling.

A.6.3 The state's debt service obligations impose a heavy burden on its finances, and will
represent more than 15 percent of the state's real net revenue during 2007-2012 (see Figure 12 in
Section I1above). Furthermore, despite the cap o f 13 percent on the intra-limite debt, the debt service
profile i s uneven due to the volatility o f the extra-limite debt and the riBd institutional framework
regulating subnational borrowing that prevents the use o f debt management strategies to smooth the debt
profile and promote an equitable intergenerational distribution o f the debt burden. In addition, the flat
intra-limite debt service obligations (13 percent o f real net revenue) combined with the uneven debt
payments on the extra-limite debt obligations (that vary from 1percent to 5 percent), the overall profile i s
clearly uneven, with total debt payments varying from 14 percent to 18 percent o f the state's current
revenues.

A.6.4 The purpose of the debt restructuring component in this proposed operation is to smooth
the profile of debt service, reduce the debt stock in net present value terms, increase debt duration,
and improve the state's liquidity. The plan is to use the financial flows from the proposed DPL
operation to attain the best combination o f these sometimes-conflicting debt management objectives. As
the extra-limite debt profile i s responsible for the uneven total debt schedule, the proposed operation will
restructure it, usingresources from the first tranche to pay down the debts with the Banrisul Foundation
(FundupTo Banrisul, FB), the floating debt bonds (LFT), and a smaller debt with the National Bank o f
Economic and Social Development (Bunco Nacional de DesenvolvimentoEcondmico e Social, BNDES).
Resources from the second tranche are designed to pay down the debt o f PROES with the National
Treasury Secretariat.

A.6.5 The selection of these debts was determined by their cost and maturity. The most expensive
debts are with the Banrisul Foundation and the PROES, which have an interest rate o f 6 percent indexed
to the IGP and the debt bond (LFT), which is fixed at the SELIC interest ratel8. Inaddition, the operation
will pay down the LFTbonds that mature in2008 and, given the strict regulations concerning subnational
borrowing, the government can not roll-over.



18.  In2007, IGPachieved 7.8 percentwhle SELIC is at I1.25 percent.

A.6.7 The flattening of the debt service profile will promote a more equal intergenerational
distribution of the debt burden. Comparing the current non-restructured debt service flow with the
restructured one it may be observed that the variance in debt service will fall with the new schedule.
Following the implementation o f this proposed DPL debt service payments will vary between 3.5 and 1.5
percent o f net current revenue for the period 2008-2020, compared with the significantly wider variation
projected for the current debt profile. In fact, the debt restructuring operation will reduce the standard
deviation o f the debt service flow from the current 1.05 percent to 0.6 percent of the restructured debt
flow service.

A.6.8 In terms of short run liquidity relief, the proposed operation would reduce debt service
payments by about 150 million from 2008 to 2012, covering two administrations and avoiding the
concentration of relief to only one administrative term". Infact, the liquidityrelief benefit will extend
until2018, when the debt service flow o fthe restructured debt will be superior to the current debt service
flow.

A.6.9 Another important advantage of the proposed operationis the reductionof risks associated
with the debt composition. More than 90 percent of RGS debt is indexed to the IGP; therefore, a debt
diversification strategy designed to reduce the participation of one debt instrument would reduce the risk
o f the excessive concentration o f debt instruments. In fact, the IGP index incorporates not only exchange
rate volatility but also domestic inflation shocks, which are more volatile than the exchange rate. Figure
20 shows that since 1994 the growth and the variability o f the IGP have been higher than that observed
for the nominal exchange rate. The much larger increase in the IGP has had a significant impact on the
cost o fthe debt and as described above was the mainreason for the development of such unfavorable debt
dynamics. In addition, the standard deviation o f the exchange rate has been lower than the standard
deviation o f the IGP for the entire period 1994 to 2008 (up to January). Therefore, given the stronger

volatility o f IGP compared to the exchange rate, the substitution o f debt indexed to the IGP for debt
linked to the exchange rate will reduce the volatility o f the debt composition. In summary, the proposed
debt restructuring operation would reduce the strong concentration of the RGS debt on a debt instrument
linkedto a very volatile index that was a contributing factor to the unsustainabledebt dynamics observed
since the signing of the debt renegotiation contracts in 1997.

A.7.1 This annex provides an overview o f the pension scheme for civil servantsinthe state o f Rio
Grande do Sul (RGS), assesses the scope for parametric reforms within the control o fthe state, and
identifies areasonabletimefiame for implementationof these parametric reforms that i s consistent with
the overall fiscal reformprogram.

A.7.2 The annex i s structured as follows. The first section provides an overview o f the regime o f civil
servant pension schemes inBrazil (the Regimes Prdprios dePrevidkncia Social -RPPS), and serves as a
reference or benchmark for examining the performance o f the civil service pension system o f RGS. The
second section examines the performance o f the civil service scheme o f RGS in recent years by
comparison with the performance of other Brazilian states. The third section identifies the particular
features o f the civil servant pension scheme of Rio Grande do Sul that may explain its more severe
imbalances. The fourth and final section examines the state's reform program and assesses its impact on
pension expenditures.


1.        Overview of Civil Servant Pension System in Brazil(RPPS)
A.7.3 The Brazilian Constitution allows federal, state and municipal governments to have their
own pension schemes for workers in the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches. The national
armed forces and similar groups at the sub-national level also have separate career-based schemes. All o f
themare regulatedby a single federal law -the RegimeJuridic0 Unico(W)of 1990. Inadditionto the
federal scheme, all 27 Brazilian states (including the Federal District) and 2,115 municipalities (out of
5,500) maintain their own pension schemes for their employees. These schemes are known as the
Regimes Prdprios de PrevidknciaSocial (RPPS), or "own regimes o f social security", as opposed to the
"general regme o f social security" (RGPS) that mainly covers private sector workers. The RPPS offers
the whole range o f benefits including old age, survivor, and disability pensions, as well as sickness
benefits.

A.7.4 The majority of the RPPS schemeswere introduced or expanded after the 1988 Constitution
and the approval of the RJU in 1990. Most o f them operate on a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) basis,
although some o f the states and municipalities are pre-funding their schemes. The 1988 Constitution
either increased or maintained benefits that were already generous and relaxed eligibility rules that were
already liberal. Among other rights, the 1988 Constitution guaranteed an old age pension (and an ensuing
survivor pension) equal to the final pre-retirement wage as well as wage indexation o f all benefits. At the
same time, the Constitution, as well as federal legislation, did not establish clearly the principle o f
actuarial and financial equilibrium of RPPS schemes. In addition, public sector employees were
transferred to the RPPSregimes but the funds to cover their accruedrightswere not provided.

A.7.5 As shown in Figure 7.1, during the first half o f the 1990s these policies resulted in an overall
increase in RPPS pension spending amounting to 3 percent o f GDP. This was one o f the factors that
motivated the pension reform o f 1998, which affected both the RGPS and the RPPS through
Constitutional Amendment N"20. The amendment removed the generous benefit formula from the
Constitutional text and opened the way for further reforms. It also introduced a minimum age o f
retirement inthe RPPS, a minimumvestingperiod of 10 years incivil service (and 5 years inthe position
preceding retirement), and the tightening of several other rules. However, the 1998 constitutional

amendment was more important for opening the way for further reforms than for its direct impact on the
sustainability o f the RGPS and the RPPS regimes.22

A.7.6 During the late 1990s and early 2000s federal and sub-national governments struggled
continuously with large and growing pension expenditures and deficits and were only able to
prevent an even greater increase in expendituresby containingthe growth of public sector wages in
real terms (any increase in wages would have spilled over to pensions through wage indexation).
The burden imposed by the RPPS system on the public finances also forced federal and sub-national
governments to sacrifice the delivery o f essential services to the population, and impose a heavy tax
burden on the economy. By 2003, the fiscal position o f sub-national governments had reached a critical
point, with most state governors pressing the federal government for another reform to the RPPS. The
inequities between RGPS and RPPS systems constituted another motivation for the RPPS reform.

A.7.7 The second reform to the RPPS was approved in December 2003 through Constitutional
Amendment No. 41 (EC-41).           The reform introduced stricter retirement eligibility rules and less
generous benefit and indexation formulae, reduced some survivor pensions, capped wages and benefits,
imposed a minimum 11percent contribution rate on all public sector wages and retirement income above
the RGPS ceiling, and, finally, introduced the possibility for federal and sub-national governments to
impose a ceiling on insured wages equal to the RGPS ceiling, provided that a complementary pension
fund is created for the new civil servants. The reform did not affect military personnel, the police and
firefighters.

A.7.8 The December 2003 reform has contributed to a substantial reduction in the actuarial
imbalancesof the RPPS, especially at the sub-national level, as shown in Figure 7.2. The stronger
impact o f the reform on sub-national schemes was essentially due to the fact that these schemes are less
mature on average. It i s also noteworthy that the reform has improved slightly the balances o f the federal
and sub-national schemes in recent years, as shown in Table 7.1. This was primarily due to the
introductiono f the special contributionrate on retirees and the stricter conditions for retirement.




22. In 1999 the Government implemented an important reform to the RGPS that entailed a change to the benefit
formula (The Fator Previdenciario).

A.7.9 However, the projections also show that RPPS expenditures are bound to increase again in
the next two decades. This i s because the most important reform measures affected only the workers
who joined the civil service after the 2003 reform and will translate into significant savings only during
the 2030s, when these workers will start retiring.23This effect will be more pronounced for younger sub-
national schemes as future pensionpromises were reducedbefore these schemes became fully mature.

2.       Current Situation of the RPPS of the State of R G S


A.7.10The deficits of the pension scheme for employees of the state of R G S (the RPPS of RGS)
have recently reached 2.6 percent of the state's GDP. As shown in Table 7.2, these deficits are the
result o f contribution revenues of about 0.35 percent of GDP and expenditures o f about 2.9 percent of
GDP. Contributionrevenues increasedin2004 as a result o fthe 2003 reform (EC-41) and are essentially
in line with those of other states. However, expenditures are significantly larger, resulting in notably
larger deficit than those o f the average State RPPS.



23. The reform did not include critical components, such as a full and immediate move to price indexation o f
benefits, the tightening o f survivor pension rules, an increase inretirement age, and the reduction o f the privileges
grantedto teachers and female employees.

A.7.11 The dire fiscal situation of the RPPS of the state of RGS is in part a result of the greater
maturity of the scheme. As shown in Table 7.3, the dependency ratio in RGS (the ratio o f inactive to
active workers) i s 65 percent, roughly comparable to the dependency ratio o f the pension scheme of the
federal executive branch and the state o f RIO de Janeiro (around 0.65), and significantly higher than the
ratio for the scheme o f the state o f SBo Paulo (0.42)24or the average state RPPS (0.40). These differences
are primarily due to the fact that RGS introducedits own RPPS before the other states, but there could be
other factors at work as well, including demographic factors (e.g.,                 longer life expectancies),
administrative inefficiencies (reflected inter alia in low student-teacher ratios), and remuneration
incentive structure for specific careers, especially teachers, excessively rewarding early retirement.

A.7.12 By contrast, it is interesting to note that the ratio o f survivors to total beneficiaries is significantly
lower in RGS compared to the other mature schemes o f SBo Paulo, RIOde Janeiro or Federal civil
servants o f executive branch (0.16 compared to 0.24 - 0.26).             This i s somewhat unexpected, but
discussions with officials in the Instituto de Previdkncia o f RGS suggest that the ratio o f survivors to
beneficiaries is likely to increase in the future given recent patterns o f fertility rates, indicating that the
RGS scheme should mature further inthis particular area.

A.7.13 As shown in Table 7.4, old age and disability pensions (aposentadorias por tempo de sewiqo,
idade, e invalidez) account for 77 percent o f total State pension expenditures, while survivor pensions
(pens6espor morte) account for the remaining 23 percent. The available data does not allow an accurate
breakdown o f expenditures between old age and disability pensions, but suggests that disability pension
expenditures are probably small - as shown inTable 7.4, in the past few years only 6        - 10percent   o f new
retirees in RGS were disability pensioners, while in the federal government this share was around 25
percent.   The executive branch o f the state accounts for 79 percent o f total old age and disability
expenditures nearly halfo f which i s paid to former employees o f the Secretariat o f Education. Therefore,



24. The lower ratio of inactive to active workers in the state of Sao Paulo is partly due to a higher number of
studentsper teacher -25 students per teacher, comparedto 15 students per teacher inRGS.

A.7.14 Figure 7.3 shows the projected path o f the main components o f pension expenditures o f the State.
Under reasonable                    pensionexpenditures should increase slightly as a share o f GDP over the
next 2 decades, due primarily to the projectedincrease in survivorpensions. Number o f survivors should
increase as RGS survivor dependency ratios gradually reach the levels o f the federal government and
other mature states. This expected effect should be further magnified by the spillover o f the future wage
growth into survivor benefit increases?' Expenditures on old age and disability pensions should remain
stable relative to GDP over the next two decades, although at highlevels.

A.7.15 Figures 7.2 and 7.3 show that the projected path of pensionexpenditures inRGS is similar to
that of other states. As inthe case o f other states, pension expenditures and deficits, are only expected
to decline significantly around 2030, when new civil servants hired after December 2003 start retiring.
This is because some o f the reform's strongest measures, including new benefit and indexation rules,
were introduced only for these new civil servants. It i s also noteworthy that pension expenditures inRGS
start increasing from a higher initial level, reflectingits higher level o fmaturity.

25. The data for RGS reportedbefore 2004 is not very reliable as it contains many classification errors.
26. Projections are based on the assumption that GDP will grow at 3.5 percent o f GDP, the number o f the civil
servant positions will grow inline withpopulation, the ratio o f wage billto GDP will remain constant.
27. While the federal government and the other states have already adopted price indexation for new survivor
pensions, RGS continues to index these benefits to wages.

A.7.16In sum, the current and future imbalances of the RGS pension system are severe,
contributing to the overall fiscal imbalances and constraining the capacity of the state to invest and
create the conditions for future growth. Even if the ratio o f civil servant pension expenditures to GDP
does not increase as projected, due to a lower than assumed rate of growth o f survivor numbers, the
imbalances o f the pension system will remain large over the next two decades, untilthe new civil servants
affected by the 2003 reform begin to retire. Therefore, it i s important for the state to consider reform
measures that would contain pension expenditures and deficits, especially inthe next 20 years.

3.       Current State Policies NegativelyInfluencing PensionExpenditures


A.7.17 The financial situation of civil service pension schemes in RGS and other states i s to a large
extent the result of generous benefit rules and eligibility criteria enshrined in the federal
constitution and in the federal legislation. As mentioned above, the 2003 reform didnot address all the
sources o f these imbalances, among them privileged pension eligbility conditions for teachers and
women, who comprise a large share o f the civil service inthe states. However, the current level and the
projected path o f pension expenditures in the RGS also reflect specific design flaws stemming from state
legislation and administrative practices, as examined inmore detail below.

A.7.18 Special bonuses incorporated in the pension base. Teachers can receive multiple special
bonuses that are added to the final pension base. One example is the bonus for workmg in schools o f
difficult access. Depending on the degree o f school remoteness this wage multiplier can vary between 20
and 100percent o f the base salary. The bonus is permanently incorporated into the teacher's pension even
if it was part of the remuneration only for the last day prior to retirement. The disaggregated data that
would allow direct evaluation o f the prevalence o f this bonus in the last years o f teacher's career i s
limited, but aggregate data indicate that 75 percent o f RGS schools are classified as schools of difficult
access and almost 70 percent o f teachers receive this bonus. Moreover, the classification o f schools has
not been updated for the past 12 years, suggestingthat the bonus may notbejustified inmany cases.

A.7.19 There are other bonuses whose treatment merits adjustments, such as the bonus for "unidocSncia",
the bonus for management, and the bonus for special classes, as all these bonuses can be permanently and
hlly incorporated into the final pension, even if they are received temporary and/or for short periods o f


28. Total pension spending is derived from individual data and is 0.1 percent of GDP lower than the spending
quoted inthe treasury's financial statement.


                                                   122

                                                                                 Annex 7: The PensionSystem



time just prior to retirement. The bonus for unidocencia accrues to teachers workmg in elementary
schools with classes o f more than 20 children, the bonus for management accrues to teachers who
exercise management functions, and the bonus for special classes is granted for working with children
with special needs. Although all these bonuses may be justified under special circumstances, the
Secretariat o f Education does not have the capacity to monitor the schools and prevent abuse. Moreover,
temporary bonuses should not be automatically incorporated into the final pension benefit, as they break
the linkbetween lifetime contributions and benefits andresult inexcessive replacement ratios.

A.7.20 Teacher bonus for additional hours worked. RGS teacher contract stipulates a regular 20 hour
working week but allows teachers to increase the number of hours worked to 40 hours per contract. For
this bonus to be permanently incorporated into the pension teachers only have to work the additional 20
hours for the 5 last consecutive years or 5 cumulative years within the last 10 years of their career. For
example, a teacher might choose to work 20 hours for the first 20 years and 40 hours for the last 5 years,
which on average constitutes 24 hours worked over 25 years. However, this teacher would qualify for the
pension based on the 40 hour wage. This generous rule breaks the link between lifetime contributions and
benefits and translates into a replacement rate o f 167 percent o f the average career gross wage or 187
percent o fthe net average wage. Figure 7.4 shows that this practice i s extremely prevalent inRGS.

A.7.2 1Multiple contracts. Current state regulations do not prohibit individuals to have multiple civil
servant contracts with the state, provided the sum o f the hours worked does not exceed 60 hours. A
pension i s tied to a contract, not to an individual, which allows for the same person to be paid two wages,
two pensions or a wage and a pension. Furthermore, the 60 hour limit i s only enforced for "active
contracts", while the combinations of a wage and a pension, or multiple pensions can feasibly exceed 60
hour limit.Teacher contracts can be combined especially easily both inparallel and consecutively as they
feature minimum20 hour-week and substantially shorter careers (as short as 25 years for women).

A.7.22 Multiple contracts create additional room for abuse of the rules and excessive benefits. For
example, additional pre-retirement hours and special bonuses can be used to inflate one pension, be
reassigned to a different contract and inflate yet another pension, all in short period of time. The added
flexibility also discourages postponed retirement as a person does not have to forgo his or her wage in
order to receive a pension. For example, a person with two 20 hour contracts can retire through one o f


29. Remainingteachers work mostly 20 hoursper week

them, increase the other to 40 hours and in so doing to increase his or her income by 50 percent all
without changing their preferred employment arrangements. The available data show that one third o f
active teachers have more than one contract. Many o f these cases eventually produce 2 pensions with 40
hours and many additionalbonuses each.

A.7.23 Inefficient compensation structure for teachers. Discussions with government officials and
analysis o f individual data indicate that teacher compensation rules are flawed and fail to reward
performance. For one, there is an excessive wage differentiation at the start of the career based on
outdated classification o f education levels. Later in their carrier, teachers are granted numerous wage
increases based on criteria that are divorced from performance, such as 3-year automatic increases,
rewards for attending courses and conferences (not necessarily job related), rewards for measures o f
performance that are artificial and not based on results (e.g. rewards for punctuality).

A.7.24A comparison of the age earnings profdes of female teachers and non-teachers, shown in
Figure 7.5, suggests that the average seniority premium for teachers i s 2.5% per year compared to
1.4% per year for other civil servants3'. This point out the excessively low wages for a few categories
o f teachers in the beginning o f their careers, steep wage increases during their working life, and, "finally,
elevated pensions. Such compensation structure distorts teacher remuneration by shifting the payments
further towards the end of a person's life, not necessarily in accordance to the needs o f the average
employee or the growth o f his or her productivity attributable to experience and personal effort. Finally,
such compensation structure creates inequalities and distortions that produce sub-optimal employee
behavior, reduced labor mobility and low overalljob satisfaction.

A.7.25 Automatic preretirement promotions for lower ranks of military policemen. The
compensation structure for lower ranks o f military policemen also shifts remuneration towards the end o f
employee's life. Table 7.6 shows the increases in gross income that military policemen are awarded in
relation to their automatic promotions at retirement. It i s noteworthy, that this practice has already been
abandoned for the nationalmilitaryforce inthe year 2000.




30. The wages presented in the figure are per contract and not per person. The actual income of teachers is
significantly higher due to the highprevalence of multiple contracts.
31. The slope of the regression line denotes the growth rate of wages when the wage i s expressed inlogs.

A.7.26 Relaxation of survivor pension indexation rules called for by federal laws. Constitutional
Amendment NO41 stipulates that survivor pensions awarded after 2003 should be indexed to inflation.
However, the state continues to index these pensions to wages. This practice has not yet resulted in a
burden to the state because wages have not been growing significantly. However, the cost of wage
indexationo f survivor pensions will prove highthe moment wages start growing again. Alternatively, the
highcost of wage indexationmay force the state to continue freezing wages inorder to contain pension
survivor expenditures. Assuming 2 percent real wage growth per year, the difference in spending
generated by the two policies would amount to 10-15 percent of survivor pension expenditures in 10
years, or the equivalent of 0.1 percent of state GDP.32

A.7.27 Lax survivor benefits eligibility rules. Survivor benefit eligibility rules are notoriously lax in
Brazil. There is no marriage vesting periods or minimum age restriction for childless widowers. The
benefit payments continue even if the widow or widower remarries. Children remain eligible for the
benefits untilage 21, regardlessof whether the child continues to attend school. Most importantly, when a
survivor dies or looses eligibility to the benefit the payments revert to other qualified survivors rather than
beingdiscontinued. Given that survivor pensions constitute one fourth o f all benefit payments tightening
these provisions would result in significant savings for the state.

A.7.28 Contribution revenues. The state is currently charging the minimum contribution rate o f 11
percent on the wages of active civil servants and on some pension benefits. Although all other states are
also charging the minimum 11 percent contribution rate, this contribution rate could be in principle
increased to 14 percent, raising contribution revenues by about 0.1 percent o f GDP per year, or the
equivalent of 150millionReais (2006 prices).33

4.       Proposed Reform Program for the state RPPS of RGS


A.7.29 The Government has identifiedfive critical reform measureswhich can be introduced by the state
and would contribute to a more balancedpension system. These five measuresinclude:

     1) creation of a single pension administrator (gestor linico) for all civil servant pension systems
         currently operating inthe state, including those o fthe legislative andjudiciary branches;

    2) introductionof a single complementary pension fund for all new civil servants, allowing the state
         to impose the RGPS ceiling on contributionsand benefits for the current schemes;



32.   At the same time, ifthe state introduces price indexation when wages are contained (as is currently the case),
this could lead to larger expenditures. Therefore, there i s an optimal moment to change the indexation rule for
survivor pensions.
33.  The state o f Amazon charged temporarily a contribution rate o f 14 percent, and this rate was upheld by the
Supreme Court.

    3) introduction o f a new remuneration and benefit computation rules for teachers, the military, and
         other civil servants, designed to tighten the linkbetween lifetime contributions and benefits;

    4) change inthe indexationrule for survivor pensions, from wage to price indexation;
    5) increase inthe contributionrate from 11%to 14%;

A.7.30 Singlepensionadministrator.The Government has already approved the law for the introduction
o f a single pension administrator to the State Assembly. The draft law establishes that the Instituto de
Previdkncia (IPE) - which currently handles only survivor pensions - will administer all state pension
schemes, including those for the civil servants o f executive, legislative andjudiciary branches, as well as
military and survivor pensions, ensuring transparency and uniformity o f treatment o f all workers and
pensioners. The creation o f a single pension administrator will also facilitate future data collection and
policy analysis efforts.

A.7.3 1Complementarypensionfund. The draft law on the introductiono f complementary state pension
fundwas also recently submitted to the State Assembly. The draft was inspiredby the draft law submitted
by the federal government to the federal congress inthe last quarter o f 2007. The federal and RGS draft
laws contain a number o f essential features, including asset segregation, submission to federal laws 108
and 109, outsourcing o f external asset managers selected through open, transparent, and competitive
bidding, and adoption o f passive or indexed portfolios. This is the design adopted for federal civil
servants in the U S (the Thrift Savings Plan - TSP) that has produced very good results in the past 20
years. Based on the provisions o f Constitutional Amendment N"41, the new fund will only accept
contributions from the state employees hired after December 2003. Furthermore, the contributions will be
made only on the wage income above the certain threshold, prescribed by the RGPS contribution ceiling
ineffect at the time ofcontributioncalculation.

A.7.32The introductionof a complementary pension fund i s also a precondition for imposing a
ceiling on wage income insured by the current PAYG pension schemes, as provided by the
Constitutional Amendment N'41. This ceiling should be equal to the ceiling in the general pension
scheme for private sector workers (the RGPS) and would apply only for the workers hired after December
2003. By introducing ceiling to future benefits it would generate important savings inthe long-run.

A.7.33 Revised lifetime remuneration rules. The Government intends to revise remuneration and
pension benefit calculation rules for all civil servants o f the state, with special attention to teacher and
military police careers. The purpose o f this revision i s to correct the distortions in the lifetime
remuneration stream, strengthen the link between lifetime contributions and benefits, improve the
incentives for the employees to perform well, and to reduce fiscal costs due to unsubstantiated pension
bonuses.

A.7.34 The Governmentalso believesthat these changesneedto be introduced as part of a broader
career structure reform, which should be based on a comprehensive plan encompassing all the
details of requiredchanges.The measures will likely involve several amendments to two key pieces o f
legislation, the Law on the State's Educational System (Lei do Sistema Estadual de EducaqTio), and the
Statute of Teacher's Careers (Estatuto de Carreira do MagistCrio) as well as similar laws concerning
military and other careers. Given that the preparation o f the reform plan would involve additional data
collection and analysis as well as elaboration o f numerous legislative amendments, it i s expected that the
implementation o f the plan can be completed only by July o f 2009. Until that time, the Government i s
committed to continue implementing additional administrative measures to improve the efficiency o f the
state education system, which would generate some preliminary reductions in wage and pension
expenditures.

A.7.35 Price indexation of survivor pensions. This measure i s already allowed by Constitutional
Amendment N"41, and many states have started adopting it for their pension schemes. Inthe long run the

switch to the price indexation o f survivor pensions would enhance the actuarial sustainability o f the RPPS
and at the same time allow the state to reward active civil servants for productivity increases. However, it
i s unlikely that the RGS state will have the conditions to implement this measure in the short-term,
because wages still need to be contained, and a premature move to price indexation o f survivor pensions
would prove more costly than wage indexation. Therefore, this measure can feasibly be implemented
only around 2010 when real wages are expected to start recovering on a sustained basis.

A.7.36 Increase in contribution rate. Finally, the Government is considering an increase in the
contribution rate, from the current 11percent to the maximum 14percent. It wouldbe politically difficult
to impose a higher contribution rate incurrent environment when gross wages are not increasing, as that
would imply a decrease innet nominal wages. As inthe case of survivor pensionindexation, this measure
can only be introducedafter the fiscal reform creates room for sustained increase inreal wages, which i s
expected to occur around 2010.

A.7.37 Fiscal effects of the proposed reform program. Figure 7.6 shows the simulated impact of each
o f the discussed reform measures34while Figure 7.7 presents the total impact o f the proposedpackage on
the consolidated deficit o f all state pension systems. While the increase in contribution rate wouldprovide
quick although relatively insignificant gains o f about 0.08% o f GDP around the year 2010, the savings
resulting from expenditure reductions would slowly build up and dominate inthe long run,reaching 0.8%
of state GDP by the end o f the 4thdecade after the reform. Overall, the proposed reform package would
complement well the 2003 pension reform, generating some fiscal relief to the state in the next two
decades, before the new civil servants start retiring under the new pension calculationrules inthe 2020s.

A.       State ReforminBraziland Rio Grande do Sul: LearningFromthe Others


A.8.1 A State reform was introduced during the first Fernando Henrique Cardoso's administration
through the Constitutional Amendment No. 19 (June 5, 1998). The rationale was set out in the 1995
"White Paper on the Reform o f the State Apparatus" produced by the Ministry o f Federal Administration
and State Reform (MARE) to specify the objectives and guidelines for redefining Brazil's public
administration.35 The White paper divided the state apparatus infour buildingblocks: (i)                Strategic Core,
(ii)Exclusive Activities, (iii)    Nonexclusive Services and (iv) Production of Market-oriented goods. For
each sector, the plan proposed a correspondent form o f property (state, private and non-state public) and
two types ofpublic administration (bureaucratic and managerial).

A.8.2 The strategic core would be in charge of formulating and monitoring public policies. The
implementation of public policies would be carried out either by state agencies (when services were
strictly to be offered by the state, such as oversight) or by not for profit organizations, certified for
receiving public funds (OSCPs and Social Organizations). The last ones were meant to deliver services
inareas inwhich the presence of government is important but not exclusive, such as education, health,
culture, etc. Services and products which couldbe delivered ina more efficient way by the market, should
be privatized and regulatedby state agencies.

A.8.3 In order to enhance efficiency and transparency, results based management should be the new
form of bureaucracy control, against the traditional input control orientation. The reform started to be
implemented, but faded away in Cardoso's second term and vanished under the Lula's first term.
However, from 2003 onwards the reform started to be adopted by several states, in a piecemeal way.
Although many states adopted several of the proposed innovations, it was the state o f Minas Gerais,
which implemented the most comprehensive program- the "Choquede Gestclo (Management Shock)".
A.8.4 In2003, Governor Akcio Neves invited several key political appointees that conceived the 1998
managerial reform to be part of Minas Gerais' state government that became nationally known for its
aggressive reform initiative. Under a strategic umbrella, popularly known as "Management Shock," the
State Government has adopted a series o f legal, administrative and structural changes to the public
administration in order to "restructure the public machinery" (i.e., reestablish fiscal equilibrium and
improve performance of the public administration). While the Minas programi s not the only recent effort
at public sector reform inthe Brazilian federation, the magnitude of challenge faced by the Government at
the beginning o f its term and the audacity with which it has addressed these challenges place MG among
the most notable cases o f comprehensive state reform inthe contemporary Brazil, inspiringstates like Rio
Grande do Sul.

A.8.5 The State reform o f Rio Grande do Sul has benefited from the strong engagement o f SEPLAG's
officials with Minas Gerais managers. An intensive lesson drawing process was undertaken through visits
and meetings with Minas' officials that implemented the so-called "Choque de Gestclo" (Management
Shock). This learning process led to a selective policy transfer, mainly in the areas o f results-based
management, human resources, procurement and contracting out services.36


35.   The White Paper assertedthat "rigid hierarchical standard, controlling processesinsteado f results produced an
admitllstrative system shown to be stultified and inefficient and, therefore, incapable o f coping with the magnitude
and complexity o f the challenges established bythe process o f economic globalization". The proposed solution is for
the "State [to abandon] its role as executor and direct renderer o f services, while preserving its task o f regulator and
provider or fosterer o f such services".
36. There are several advantagesinthe benchmarking process adopted by RGS: saves time and money, lower risks
and legitimize what the government i s willing to do. RGS used the Minas reform as benchmark for several reasons.
First, there is ideological and political identification (both are governed by PSDB politicians). Second, both faced


                                                           129

                                                                               Annex 8: Public Sector Modernization



A.8.6 In general, vicarious learning i s considered a good practice in public policy. However,
transference o f public sector reforms i s highly complex, depending on factors, such as: political context,
institutional framework and asymmetries in implementation capacity. Comparing to Minas, RGS
institutional framework o f public administration i s very similar, given that states tend to follow federal
legislation, in areas like budgeting, procurement and human resource management. Regarding the
capacity o f civil service to implement the reform, RGS i s considered very strong, given that it is one o f
the first states with a meritocratic bureaucracy inBrazil.

B.       DiagnosisofRio Grande do Sul: unsustainableandinefficient


A.8.7 As a federal country, improving service delivery in the Brazilian context largely means
strengthening the incentives and institutional capacities of sub-national governments to enhance their
performance. It i s precisely at the sub-national level, however, that Brazil faces greater challenges o f
institutionaldevelopment. Diagnostic work carried out for the IDB-funded Programa Nacional deApoio
a Modernizaqiio da Gestiio e do Planejamento (PNAGE) revealed a number o f common public sector
management problems across Brazilian states. These included:

         Inconsistency between structures and responsibilities, weak regulatory structures, and duplication
         o f institutionalroles;

     0   Deficient planning and policy coordination, and absence o f performance management (i.e., lack
         o fperformance indicators, formalistic and centralizingplanning and budgeting);

     0   Weak human resource management, including lack o f human resource planning; inadequate
         structure in terms o f the number and qualification o f staff; absence of strategic definition about
         required skdls, inadequate career structures, absence o f coherent policies for professional
         development and training, andhighaverage age o f labor force.

A.8.8 Specifically, PNAGE and other diagnostic papers3', commissioned by Rio Grande do Sul, raised
the following issues on the weaknesses ofpublic administration:



         Inefficient deployment o f civil servants (e.g. there is an excessive number of teachers inthe state,
         recently the Secretary o f Educationclosed schools and let o f f 1400temporary teachers, given that
         there were schools with 5 teachers and 20 students) , heterogeneous salaries and privileges
         obtainedby corporatist pressures, distortionary career incentives and lack of training.

         Excessively centralized planning system (e.g. lack o f communication between planners and
         implementers from line Secretariats, lack o f focus on priorities, low budget execution due to
         fiscal pressures).

         Decline in the quality and inability to expand services needed by the population due to fiscal
         pressures, corporatist andjudicial obstacles to abandon services that are not relevant anymore or
         that are already provided by the private sector (e.g. services provided by the Fundaqiio Gaucha
         de Tradiqiio e Folclore to preserve traditional culture o f RGS are better offered by civil society
         organizations)



unsustainable public finances and urgency o f fiscal adjustment. Third, strong support o fprivate sector, that financed
the Brazilian consultancy fm Instituto de Desenvolvimento Gerencial (INDG) to implement cost control measures
to reduce current expenditures. The final reason is the popularity of the Management Shock, the most notable case
o fcomprehensive statereform incontemporary Brazil.

C.        MeasuresAdopted byN o Grande do Sul
Administrative Reform and WageBill Control


A.8.9 Inlight o f these diagnoses, the Government took measures to implement a public sector reform
upon assuming power in January 2007. These measures are expected to have moderate expenditure
efficiency gains inthe short and medium terms. Greater impact on expenditures will occur inthe longrun.
A first set o f measures concentrated on adjusting the personnel establishment, regaining Jiscal
sustainability of the wage bill, and reorganizing the State Government's macro structure ("administrative
reform") to make it leaner and more consistent with the redefined role o f the state, with an emphasis on
revamped policy planning and inter-sectorial coordination. The Government merged organizational units,
improving functionality by reducing from 29 to 22 the number o f organizations according to government
program and federal level correspondence to facilitate partnerships. The government also left vacant 438
political appointee positions, or about 27,55% o f all such positionsinthe public sector.

A.8.10 The Government has mandated the cabinet-level committee (Grupo de Assessoramento Estadual
da Politica de Pessoal- GAQ3' to review and approve all policy decisions with fiscal implications,
including sectors' requests for new hires and other personnel decisions. Upon receiving requests, the
Secretariat o f Finance (SEFAZ) analyzes the medium-term fiscal implications and recommends an action
to the GAE. SEFAZ has centralized management o f payrolls, including o f the Indirect Administration
entities (e.g., public enterprises), to gain full control over salary payments. Centralizing decisions for
strategc establishment control at the highest instance is a positive step toward responsible fiscal
management o f the personnel contingent. However, personnel policy was restricted to keep control over
expenditures, which mightimpact the services provision inthe longrun.

A.8.11 Another important step to improve coordination was the Policy Committees (Cdmaras Setoriais
de Politicas Publicas) to debate the main policy issues o f government agenda. Six Policy Committees
were created: (1) Public Security and Violence Prevention; (2) Irrigation and Water Utilization; (3)
Economic Development; (4) Social Development; (5) Infra-structure and Logistics; and (6) Public
Management and Finance. There i s evidence that they facilitate the planning alignment and transparency.

Prioritization of Investmentsand ResultsBased-Management

A.8.12RGS investment expenditures in 2006 were the lowest amongst Brazilian states, 4.7% o f net
current revenue. Inorder to increase the return o f this low investment capacity, RGS issued in 2007 the
Decree no45.237, the so-called "Management Decree", to regulate a new results-based management
model for public policy. The objective i s to focus on productivity, prioritize investments and expand
services without increasing fiscal pressures. The state made an effort to link strategic planningto fiscal
equilibrium, budgeting reality and quality o f expenditures. The intention was to create an accountability
framework through performance contracts in three levels: (i)      strategic programs (direct administration),
(ii)state owned enterprises (indirect administration) and (iii)non-governmental service providers
(OSCIPS). Performance contracts can be defined as a range o f management instruments used to define
responsibilities and expectations between parties to achieve mutually agreed results.

A.8.13 Strategic Programs and Results Agreements: The broad RGS government strategy "Diretrizes
Estratkgicas 2007-2010" was produced from the review o f three strategic plans that already existed
when the government took office in 2007: Agenda 2020 (produced by the private sector), Rumos 2015




38. GAE is composed by the Secretaries of Finance, Planning, Administration, Procuradoria-Geral do Estado,
Chief o f Staffand School o f Government.

(commissioned by the previous government) and Pact for Rio Grande (made by the State Assembly)39.
The strategy has three pillars: (1) Sustainable economic development": more and betterjobs for gauchos;
(2) Social development: better quality of life for all; and (3) Finance and public management: a state for
citizens.

A.8.14 The document "Diretrizes Estrattgicas 2007-2010" was the base of the Pluriannual Plan 2008-
2011 that encompasses 89 cross-cutting programs that guide the organization o f governmental action.
Fromthese programs, eleven highlevel priorities were selected to compose a portfolio o f eleven strategic
programs4' (programas estruturantes) with 42 projects and 147 actions overall. The following criteria
were usedto select those programs:

         Stability o f funding and capacity to mobilize partnerships: for instance, earmarked areas, like
         education and health, and federal government priorities4', like sanitation and roads, were selected.

         Low risk o f design and execution: e.g., no environmental impacts and completion o f unfinished
         works,

         Programs that could show results up to 2010: highpotential o fpolitical gains.


A.8.15 The eleven strategic programs together will account for R$ 726 million o f investment budget in
2008 from a total of R$ 1 billion. These programs are managed through several special arrangements to
guarantee their timely and accurate implementation. First, the portfolio has a fast track path, coordinated
by cross-cutting Policy Committees (Camaras Setoriais de Politicas Publicus), that aims at eliminating
institutional bottlenecks. Second, fimding predictability i s guaranteed by Treasury. Third, the
accountability chain i s well defined: eachprogramhas a senior project manager with clear responsibilities
over the "intensive management" o f the program. Forth, each program has indicators, targets,
implementation chronogram and monitoring system to facilitate the identification and solution of
problems. Finally, each program manager will sign a results agreement (termo de compromisso corn
resultados) with the Governor and the Secretary o f State in order to align expectations and facilitate the
feedback on goals attained.

A.8.16 Program responsibility i s in line with managerial accountability gwen that the manager belongs to
the main Secretariat in charge of program implementation. The designation of managers that sign the
result agreement with SEPLAG intends to clarify the accountability chain and improve focus of different
agenciesinvolved inthe program.

A.S.17Results agreements are "relational contracts" which main role is mitigating information
asymmetries between agents and principals, i.e. managers and front-line workers. Hence, the negotiation
o f agreements i s a way to align incentives, through goals clarification. Furthermore, the agreements
discussions help to create intrinsic motivation and engage staff, organize complex work processes and
increase teams' dialogue. Finally, the effective information monitoring supports the identification
problems and knowledge-sharing, to further teamwork towards a commonpolicy vision.

A.8.18 RGS appointed all the managers of strategic programs and the plans for programs' monitoring
were design. SEPLAG's Department of Project Monitoring will be in charge drafting, setting up targets,

and tools for intensive monitoring, advise managers regarding action plans to eliminate problems and
inform the Policy Committees about the projects execution. The Bank is providing technical assistance
during project preparation to help the government review the formal contractual tools to ensure the
processcredibility.

A.8.19 By the end of 2008, the objective is to sign results agreements with all eleven strategic programs.
The government already signed the results agreementsfor three strategic programs.

A.8.20 State Owned Entreprises and Management Contracts: SOEs are part of indirect administration,
enjoying great managerial autonomy in Brazil. SEPLAG will sign management contracts with SOEs in
order to control better control expenditures and the salaries of directors. In this case, management
contracts are seen as a way of making agencies more cost-benefit conscious and accountable. The
government already signed managementcontracts with six state-owned enterprises.

A.8.21 Another tool created to ensure good governance, transparency and accountability was the
Committee of Corporative Governance of State-owned enterprises (Comite de Governanca Corporativa
das Estatais - CGCE). The objective o f the committee is to defend the state interest as shareholder by:
improving the economic-financial performance of SOE's, set guidelines for state representatives in the
SOE's fiscal councils, fix shareholdersremuneration, publicize financial and accounting information, etc.
SEPLAG (Departamentode Monitoramento de Gestgo) will support CGCE, negotiating and monitoring
the indicators of managementcontracts.

A.8.22 The Bank has provided TA for RGS during project preparation to support the government for
dealing with key features o f "relational" contracts, such as the need for trust and flexibility. Given the
difficulties to measureinputsand outputs the government i s aware o f the need for a fine-tuningprocess to
make contractualization work.

A.8.23 The RGS government desire to expand the provision of services within the state's limited
fiscal capacity and without expanding wage bill has led to a partnership policy with non-
governmental providers of services through OSCIPS (Organizacao da Sociedade Civil de Interesse

social objectives consistent with public policy goals. The OSCIP i s intended as an instrument to enable a
new form of partnership between the state and civil society (or the so-called "Terceiro Setor") in the
delivery o f public services, redefining thereby the role o f the state. These institutions can enter into
partnerships with the state, receivingbudget resourcesand other public goods to support their activities.

A.8.24 The legal foundation of OSCIP model inRio Grande do Sul i s law 12.901/2008. The precursors to
RGSmodel are: federal OS law (9.637/98) andOSCIP law (9.790/99), SBo Paulo's OSS law (846/98) and
Minas Gerais' OSCIP law (14.870/2003). RGS law defines that, while governed by private sector, only
non-profit organizations can apply to the Secretariat o f Justice and Social Development (SJDS) for
certification as OSCIP. An important qualification criterion i s that the non-profit must show a minimum
of two years of experience administering services for which it i s willing to manage. Another relevant
characteristic of RGS law i s that there will be public selection (publicized by Diririo OJicial) to choose
the OSCIP that will enter into a Partnership Agreement (Term0 de Parceria) for a given service. A
Committee formed by SJDS, Procuradoria-Geral and Public Ministrywill define the winner.
A.8.25 The Partnership Agreements must specify the social objective o f the OSCIP, and the
responsibilities, rights and obligations of the signatories. It also includes the goals to be achieved through
the Agreement, and how those are to be measured. Certain organizations are barred from becoming
OSCIPs, for example commercial organizations, labor unions, political party and religious organizations.

A.8.26The arguments for the creation of the OSCIP model are that they will lead to a more efficient
allocation o f resources, more responsive to the needs o f citizens, and a more productive and effective in
delivering services. They are meant to induce greater civil society participation in implementing public
policy, subjecting public resources to greater social control, while also strengthening social capital.
OSCIPs are governed by private sector law, and therefore enjoy management flexibility.                    These
organizations can also receive private funds and havenew partners to deliver services.

A.8.27 RGS has several non-governmental organizations that can be qualified as OSCIPS to be potential
service providers is areas ranging &om social assistance, health, education/culture/sports to environment
and research in general. Several organizations from indirect administration dfunda@es, autarquias and
sociedades de economia mista) are prone to have part or all services managed by OSCIPS (see table
below).     Employees of indirect administration agencies in RGS are hired through private labor law
(celetistas) but have acquired by judiciary decision some public servants (estatutarios) rights, such as
tenure. There might be some resistance in transferring public servants to OSCIPS' management.
Experience &om SBo Paulo's OSS demonstratesemployees are afraid o f losing benefitswhen transferred
to OSCIPS. Hence, it i s important to give alternatives to these employees, so they can remain within the
government, transferring only those willing to be managedby OSCIPS.42

A.8.28 The Government strategy i s to convert first the public organizations that are willing to become
managed by OSCIPS, with smaller number o f employees, existence o f non-profit organizations able to
assume the services and high probability o f success. The SJDS will undertake agencies' institutional
diagnosis and evaluations of the quality of services before contractualizing the services. Given that
OSCIPS are organizations outside the government, they do not have the same restrictions to hire
employees and procure goods, beingfeasible to move them to a runningcost                   The most important
advantage of OSCIP model will certainly be the expansion o f services, without pressuringthe state wage
bill, and social security andthe possibility ofreceivingfunds from other sources.

Human ResourcesPolicy Reforms


A.8.29Rio Grande do Sul was one o f the first states to implement the bureaucratic model o f public
administration in Brazil. The deterioration o f economic context in the mid 1990's was followed by the
decline of its public administration capacity. Public service has always enjoyed generous benefit rules and
distortionary compensation practices. Among these compensation practices there are special bonuses,
multiple contracts, inefficient compensation structure, automatic pre-retirement promotion and relaxation
of indexationrules. These active personnel benefits are incorporated in the pension base, stimulating the
early retirement, which generated highsocial security deficits.

A.8.30The need o f restraining the increasing trend o f personnel expenditure led RGS to maintain a
constant number o f civil servants, stabilizing the growth o f payroll bill for the Executive Branch. Since
2000, the main human resources policy has been to stabilize personnel expenditure, currently 68 percent
o f NCR, from which 36 percent i s active personnel. The consequence was that RGS abandoned the
strategic planning of human resources with severe effects on services effectiveness and on civil service
profile. The consequences o fthe weak HRmanagement canbe identifiedin several areas:

    Absence of human resources strategic planning: a vast portion o f RGS civil servants will retire in
    the next 5 to 15 years, particularly in education and public security. Hence, RGS should make an
    effort to retain these employees, changmg career incentives for early retirement. The low staff
    renewal, generation gaps and staff ageing i s impacting the quality o f services. Recruitment has been
    fragmented, according to organizations requests and ad hoc public examinations (concursos), causing
    imbalances o f staff allocation (i.e. some organizations have excess o f civil servants, others
    insufficient). There i s needto implement a planningcapacity for the government as a whole.

    Low flexibility of careers: formalistic and inflexible structures are kept for long periods o f time,
    hampering the quick response o f organizations to recruit personnelwith adequate skill-mix to provide
    services. There is an excessive number o f fragmented careers with low mobility. The initiatives to
    improve career incentives are also case by case, mostly concentrated in the development o f the
    orientation courses (cursos de forma@7o) targeted at new staff that is approved in public
    examinations. The sizing o f workforce i s not a major concern, apart from the effort to stabilize staff
    numbers.

    Rigidities of recruitment, mobility and leave: recruitment for permanent positions is guided by
    technical criteria, through public examinations. The authorization for public examinations has to be
    requested by organizations, analyzed by S A R H and approved by the Advisory Group for Personnel
    Policy (GAE) that keep tight control over the number o f civil servants. Usually, they are based on
    emergencies and traditional careers rules and structures. There are no tools to asses the needs for
    recruitment. Despite the effort to define the desired profile o f new civil servants, there is no clear
    strategy about how this profile contributes to overall productivity. Mobility i s oriented towards
    available commissioned positions and political appointments with higher salaries. However, the
    criteria for occupation o f these positions are not clear and not related to merit or productivity. As

    result, the institutionalization o f bureaucratic incentives for occupation of managerial positions i s
     affected by informality. Firing i s restricted to administrative faults or low performance during
    probation period (estbgio probatbrio) o f three years.44However, cases of civil servants firing are
    unusual inRGSadministrative culture.

    Lack of attention to performance and productivity: merit and performance are not taken into
     consideration in the allocation of commissioned positions. Only two careers have salaries tied to
    performance: Finance and Procuradoria Geral do Estado. Other careers have monetary incentives tied
    to the kind o f activity: civil/military police and prison agents receive "life risk" additional; and
     teachers also receive a series of incentives (dificil acesso, unidocencia, gratijicaq6opelo atendimento
     de classes especiais, gratijiqio de direqo and convocap7o com alteraq6o de carga horbria) which
     are currently affecting performance negatively and have distortionary impacts on pensions. These
     incentives are not tied to performance and the rest o f civil service does not have incentives nor are
     evaluated by performance.

     Compensation: RGS salaries are competitive to private sector and public employment is very
     attractive due to other benefits, like tenure, health plan and pension45.The remuneration policy has
     been tightly controlledby the Finance Secretariat due to fiscal adjustment. There i s no compensation
     policy, remuneration is attachedto the fragmented careers' structure. These are heavily influenced by
     corporations and political pressures. The last salary raises were given to the whole administration,
     without distinction on performance.

     FormalisticPromotionand Training:the state direct administrationhas fourteen careers46,plus five
     under extinction and one for commissioned positions and political appointees. Each career has four
     levels A-D, with automatic progression. Salary scales vary 5 percent from one level to the other, with
     total amplitude of 20 percent from the initial to the top level. Inthree years the public servant reaches
     the end o f career. There is no incentive for performance or educational progression inthis framework.
     Most managerial positions are occupied by political appointees. Civil servants are dissatisfied by the
     lack o f perspectives, highturnover of directors and lack o f opportunities. Training i s offered by the
    Fundapio de Desenvolvimento de RecursosHumanos (FDRH,)`?. However, the courses are offered on
     an ad hoc basis, without analysis of organizations' training needs.


A.8.31 "New Personnel Development Policy": There i s a strong awareness about the need for an HR
reform to tackle salaries and benefits' distortions, but that also to change civil service incentives, as an
essentialpart of the public sector modernization. The government i s currently working on an action plan
that aims at implementinga strategic policy to provide solutions for the above mentionedissues. Inorder
to start the HR plan, the government created by Decree no45.123/07, the Advisory Group for Personnel
Policy (Grupo de Assessoramento Estadual da Politica de Pessoal- GAE) to control personnel
expenditure and appraise RH decisions, such as: plans for new positions, creation o f careers, rules of


44.   Constitutional Amendment 19 o f 1998 created the performance evaluation during the probation period, every
six months, during three years as a condition for acquiring tenure. The criteria to be approved inthe evaluation are:
discipline, efficiency, responsibility, productivity and assiduity o f new staff. Evaluation forms are filled by the
immediate superior.

A.8.32The New Personnel Development Policy i s a project of the strategic program "Public Sector
Modernization". The main guidelines of the new policy are: value public servants, rationalize staff
allocation, improve information about personnel needs and adopt meritocracy for promotions. Among the
main points of the plan, the government intends to create personnel planning capacity, simplify HR
legislation and broaden career structures. Additionally, the government also intends to shift promotion
criteria (from exclusive seniority to education and performance), introduce incentives for performance
and improve training through the School o f Government. Specifically, the following actions will be part
o f the plan:
..   Reserve part ofmanagerial and commissioned positions to permanent civil service;

     Certification of managers (school directors, professionals from administration),                 increasing
.... meritocracy.andreducingpolitical influence;
     Create a SearchCommittee and a Talents Warehouse (Banco de Talentos) to allocate managerial;

     Create incentives for educational progression;

     Implement the School of Government;

     Create the public managerscareer.


A.8.33 PublicManagers Career: RGS civil service i s composedby several specialist careers, focused on
direct service delivery. As part of the HR reform, RGS i s planning to implement the public manager's
career, which i s a trend amongst Brazilian states48,inspiredby the Federal Government experience. The
aim is to recruit individuals with managerial capacity, through public selection (concursospublicos), that
will conduct the reform process. Public managers should be generalists4' that will be in charge of the
areas of planning, budgeting, management and evaluation, the so-called "Management Cycle". Ideally,
these individuals should have competencies for human resources management, strategic planning,
performance management, research analysis and financial management. Usually, public managers occupy
commissioned positions insidethe government, side by side with political appointees. The combination of
permanent civil servantswith political staff intop positions allows the sustainability o fpolicies.

A.8.34The public managers' career will be created after the state pension reform. Hence, the pension
arrangements for the new civil servants will not carry the current distortionary benefits. Furthermore, the
new career will not have a major impact on pensions due to the creation o f the complementary pension
fund.

A.8.35 School of Government:The School o f Government is part of the humanresourcesreformo f RGS.
Itwas createdto support the complex change ofmanagerial culture and guaranteethe sustainability ofthe
reform effort. The intention i s to create capacity o f the new public managers and general civil service to
deal with contractualization, automatization, focus on results, etc. The aim is to clarify and align the
values, vision, interests and expectations o f civil service with the government's reform. Additionally, the
School also has a central role in conducing change, helping SEPLAG in the communication and




48.   The states o f Bahia, Pernambuco, Goias and S5o Paulo also created the career ofpublic managers.
49. The ENAP/federal Government model is a mix o f French civil administrators and American policy analysts.
The public selection i s targeted at recruiting professionals formed in Economics, Law, Political Science and
Management.

mobilization of staff. Likewise, there i s a purpose o f motivating civil servants with the possibility o f
acquiringnew competencies to work.

A.8.36 The School i s subordinated to the Secretariat of Administration and it has already personnel and
funds, inherited from the former Fundapio de Desenvolvimento de Recursos Humanos-FDRH. The head
of the School has done benchmarking with similar organizations, like ENAP and Fundacao Joclo
Pinheiro, to define the organizational structure, curriculum, types o f courses, etc. The School is already
engaged in the States School of Government Network (Rede de Escolas de Govern0 Estuduais) a locus
for exchanging experiences, promoting workshops and creating partnerships with international
organizations. They also are going to organize the Public Management Innovation Awards, an idea that
was transferred from the federal and other state governments, to encourageinnovators.

A.8.37Initially, the School is going to provide capacity building in areas like public policy, public
finance, planning, budgeting, procurement, monitoring and evaluation. It will offer continued education,
master of science, distance learning, commission papers and research. The target i s to train 22.000 civil
servants in 2008. The Bank i s providing technical assistance during project preparation to help the
government sort out the roles the School should play inthe reform process.
