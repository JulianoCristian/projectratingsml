It had a long history of fiscal mismanagement.\n            Excessive expenditures and generosity in granting tax\n            exemptions produced budget deficits over many years until\n            2006. The state was failing to comply with Brazilian fiscal\n            responsibility legislation, and its troubled fiscal\n            situation had translated into deteriorated public services,\n            and poor economic performance. An International Bank for\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan was designed to\n            support the state government\u2019s effort to turn around the\n            fiscal situation in the state. It supported the state with a\n            two-tranche development policy loan (DPL). IBRD used its\n            supervision resources to provide technical assistance to the\n            state, helping the government to achieve the proposed\n            results. Its innovative and tailor-made repayment profile\n            was key to smoothing the highly volatile debt repayment\n            profile of the state, and to secure the approval of, and a\n            guarantee, from the federal government. Drawing upon IBRD\n            financial and technical support, Rio Grande do Sul\n            restructured its debt, generating savings of 379 million\n            dollars up to December 2010. The state government was able\n            to turn its finances around from a negative operating\n            balance to a positive figure of 1,497 million dollars and\n            increased investments."}, "docdt": "2012-04-16T02:06:00Z"}
