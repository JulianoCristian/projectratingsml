implementation of the Indonesian government's strategy\n            to modernize the Government Accounting System. It will also\n            enhance the credibility and usefulness of financial\n            information in the private and public sectors, through the\n            implementation of rigorous qualifying examinations for\n            public accountants, a comprehensive set of accounting\n            standards and the enforcement of these standards through\n            capital market regulatory activities. The project is\n            comprised of two major components: 1) the modernization of\n            governmental accounting; and 2) private and public sector\n            enterprise accounting and auditing standard-setting and enforcement."}, "docdt": "1994-07-29T00:00:00Z"}
