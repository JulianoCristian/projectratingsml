Given that the\n            objective of the project was to improve public sector\n            accounting, there is a lesson to be learned in terms of the\n            Bank's allocation of human resources to design,\n            implement, supervise, and evaluate such a macro financial\n            management-oriented project. There should be an appropriate\n            mix of public sector accounting, and information technology\n            (IT) skills, to ensure appropriate project design, in\n            accordance with the country's environment. Other\n            valuable lessons address the need for frequent supervision,\n            particularly when multi-year systems development is\n            involved, to obtain objective assessments of project status;\n            similarly, complex IT projects should be avoided; instead,\n            for accounting systems, off-the-shelf accounting packages\n            are a preferable alternative, i.e., if modifications to\n            software, and business processes are required, these may be\n            tailored to user requirements, and, for significant software\n            changes, pilot testing could be a strategy, in the absence\n            of implementation capacity. Most importantly, the\n            country's human resource capacity should be carefully\n            evaluated prior to the Bank advising on modernization, and\n            reforms: the project was far beyond the technical, and human\n            resource capacity of the Government to operate high-tech systems."}, "docdt": "2001-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
