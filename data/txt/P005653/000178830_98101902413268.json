        rehabilitate and expand the existing sewerage and stormwater\n            systems, including the provision of sewage treatment, in 30\n            urban centers. It consists of investments in: primary,\n            secondary and stormwater sewers, including pumping stations\n            and related structures; sewage treatment plants; maintenance\n            and data processing equipment and office accommodations for\n            ONAS; consulting services for related design and\n            construction supervision; and studies. About one million\n            people would benefit overall from improvements to the\n            environment and public health; about 400,000 would benefit\n            directly from new or improved sewer connections. Forty\n            percent of the direct beneficiaries are at or below the\n            urban poverty threshold."}, "docdt": "1983-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
