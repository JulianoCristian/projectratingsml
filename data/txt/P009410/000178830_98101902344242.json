     Project will provide additional supplies of water to meet\n            the needs of Chittagong's growing population and\n            industry up to 1990. Included in the project are: a new\n            water intake and treatment plant, six tubewells,\n            modifications to an existing iron removal plant and pumping\n            station to expand its treatment capacity, and associated\n            distribution works. The project provides for about 14,000\n            service connections with meters, some 1,500 public\n            standpipes and two public water concessions, which are being\n            introduced on an experimental basis. There is also a\n            provision for training and engineering services for project\n            supervision, and for preparation of an appropriate\n            sewerage/sanitation plan. Direct benefits of regularly\n            available wholesome water supplies and improved access to\n            public hydrants will be supplemented by improvements in\n            public health and environmental conditions."}, "docdt": "1980-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
