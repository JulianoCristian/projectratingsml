the sustainability was highly likely, the\n            institutional development impact was substantial, and the\n            Bank and borrower performance were both satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned from the project: Privatization programs are\n            complex and all the key aspects-social, economic,\n            political-should be taken into account in the design of the\n            program and components. Successful programs should be\n            flexible and scalable in their design, and teams should not\n            stop short of formal adjustments to the originally designed\n            set of indicators to increase the value of what is measured.\n            Well thought-through controls should be in place to minimize\n            risk of misuse of payments. The basis for and duration of\n            job loss compensation should be adjusted as appropriate\n            based on the learning from the process. In large scale\n            privatization lay-offs, governments typically attempt to\n            minimize the pain by first encouraging early retirement of\n            those close to the retirement age. Programs should be\n            carefully designed and targeted to maximize their utility.\n            As in the PSSP, Labor Redeployment Services need to be\n            sub-contracted on a competitive basis to local service\n            providers, which will deliver services on a performance\n            contract basis."}, "docdt": "2006-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
