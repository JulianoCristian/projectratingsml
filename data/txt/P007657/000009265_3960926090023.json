Manpower Training Project seeks to\n            complement Bank assistance for economic restructuring and\n            policy reform, and aims to reduce human resource constraints\n            to growth, improve labor productivity, and lessen the social\n            impact of adjustment.  To that end, the project involves (a)\n            strengthening state employment services and the Ministry of\n            Labor and Social Welfare (STPS) retraining program and\n            implementing a retraining program for 160,000 displaced and\n            unemployed workers; along with establishing a system to\n            assist small and medium scale enterprises in upgrading the\n            skills of employed workers through a demonstration program\n            for promotion and support of inservice training. Further to\n            this, the project includes (c) strengthening the STPS to\n            guide effective development of training; and (d) increasing\n            and better distributing training capacity."}, "docdt": "1987-08-28T00:00:00Z"}
