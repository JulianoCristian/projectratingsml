To that end, the project involves (a)\n            strengthening state employment services and the Ministry of\n            Labor and Social Welfare (STPS) retraining program and\n            implementing a retraining program for 160,000 displaced and\n            unemployed workers; along with establishing a system to\n            assist small and medium scale enterprises in upgrading the\n            skills of employed workers through a demonstration program\n            for promotion and support of inservice training. Further to\n            this, the project includes (c) strengthening the STPS to\n            guide effective development of training; and (d) increasing\n            and better distributing training capacity."}, "docdt": "1987-09-16T00:00:00Z"}
