PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALAYSIA - FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1329-MA)
PREFACE
This is a project completion report (PCR) on the Fourth Education
Project in Malaysia, for which Loan 1329-MA, approved on September 21, 1976,
provided US$35.0 million equivalent to assist with a project that was
estimated to cost US$124.9 million equivalent. The Loan Account was fully
disbursed and was closed on June 30, 1984, two years later than originally
anticipated.
The Project Completion Report represents a collaborative effort
between the Borrower and the Bank. It is primarily a summary of the four
technical reports prepared by the Faculty of Education, University of Malaya
during the period January-June 1984 (which were subsequently reviewed by the
Government) and a final commentary prepared by the Bank. The technical
reports were based on: (a) interviews with project officers, education
officers, school and college principals, lecturers and teachers (b) completed
questionnaires and follow-up surveys, and (c) relevant reports, inventories
and records of the various project entities. Because of the considerable
resources devoted to preparation of the PCR, the analysis of educational
outcomes is much more detailed than normally encountered in education PCRs.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audittng, this project completion report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments in September 1986. Their
telex responses are reproduced as Attachments I and II.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALAYSIA FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1329-MA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
This project, the fourth Bank-financed education project in
Malaysia, was identified and prepared with UNESCO assistance. It was
appraised in November-December 1975, and a loan of US$35.0 million equivalent
was approved in November 1976 to finance a project whose tot*! costs were
estimated at US$124.6 million equivalent. It was anticipated that the proj-
ect would be completed by June 1980.
Objectives and Project Content
The project was designed to meet objectives outlined in the Third
Malaysia Plan (1976-1980). It sought to strengthen certain school planning
functions, improve the quality of and redress imbalances in the provision of
primary schooling, upgrade the quality and Increase the supply of teachers,
meet the need for skilled manpower and prepare for expected government
investment in nonformal education.  In basic education, the project financed:
(a) construction of approximately 4,100 classrooms (about 190,000 places) and
related facilities in about 850 primary schools in seven disadvantaged
states; (b) establishment of four state education resource centers (SERCs) to
provide in-service training for aboat 4,000 teachers annually; (c) replace-
ment of a teacher training college (TTC) in Sarawak, including boarding
places and staff housing units to accommodate an annual enrollment of 480
primary and lower secondary teacher trainees; and (d) technical assistance
and fellowships to strengthen school mapping and school facilities planning
capacities of the Ministry of Education and the Public Works Department
(paras. 2.01-2.02).
In technical education, the project financed: (a) three new and ex-
tension of two existing industrial training institutes (ITIs), including some
boarding and staff housing, thereby increasing the annual training capacity
from 900 to 2,900 and (b) technical assistance and fellowships to strengthen
technical teacher training. In community education, the project provided
support for a study and three pilot community service centers to evaluate
nonformal education needs (para. 2.02). Responsibility for project execution
rested with the Ministry of Agriculture (for the nonforual component) and
with project units in the Ministries of Education and of Labor and Manpower
(for the basic and technical education components, respectively.) Details of
the staffing requirements in the central and state project units and in the
Public Works Department were included as loan covenants (para. 3.01).

Implementation ExperieAce
With the enception of the nonformal education component, which was
ultimately financed entirely by the Borrower, the project was basically
implemented as planned, a considerable achievement given the large number and
remoteness of project institutions (para. 4.01). Nevertheless, the project
experienced major delays at all stages of implementation, and in some cased,
severe construction delays necessitated the termination of initial contracts
and retendering (para. 4.07). Paradoxically, implementation of the technical
assistance program went smoothly, resulting in trained staff with no place to
go who were then absorbed elsewhere in the system and effectively lost to
project institutions (paras. 6.11, 6.30 and 7.07).
Most of the architectural plans were adapted from standard designs
and were r!opridered basically acceptable by users (para. 4.06). Centralized
procurement through the project units was also generally satisfactory,
although some problems surfaced due to the newness of the education resource
centers and unfamiliarity with minimal equipment needs (para. 6.08). All
project components but one experienced cost overruns of between 45-14C
percent. The primary education component absorbed over 70 percent of the
entire project cost but experienced a 19 percent underrun, thereby accounting
for tiue overall cost underrun of 6 percent (para. 5.01 and Annexes 8 and 9).
The main implementation problems stemmed from: persistent staff
shortages, both in the already-overworked project unit in the Ministry of
Education and that being set up in the Ministry of Labor and Manpower, the
awarding of contracts to inexperienced and/or undercapitalized contractors
and the insufficient supervision afforded the contractors by the Public Works
Department (paras. 3.02-3.09 and 7.03).1/
Results
In spite of the delays, the project achieved its major objectives
by the time of completion. Enrollment targets for the primary schools were
being met, while moderate shortfalls at other project institutions were
attributable mainly te program changes (at the TTC and the SERCs) and/or
construction delays (ITIs) (paras. 6.04, 6.16, 6.25, 6.36 and 7.01).
In terms of institutional development, the project helped to estab-
lish systematic procedures for school mapping and implementation of school
construction, as evidenced in the quality of preparation work for follow-on
lending by the Bank (paras. 6.12 and 7.01). In terms of social objectives,
the project succeeded in providing: (a) additional and improved primary
facilities to remote areas that had begun to experience serious overcrowding
and (b) improved teacher training capacity in Sarawak where intake policies
favored local applicants from low socio-economic groups and rural areas
(paras. 6.01, 6.03 and 6.15).
1/   The problems experienced in this project were similar to those of the
previous project, which have been detailed in the Project Performance
Audit Report:  Malaysia--Third Education Project (Loan 974-MA), Report
No. 6280 dated June 27, 1986.



- v -
One unforeseen development was the reorientation of the SERCs, away
ftom an exclusive focus on in-service teacher tra'ning to a broader role in
coot:dinating professional and training activities for teachers, conducting
re'iearch and acting as a vehicle for edicational decentralization. This came
about largely because their purpose was not clearly established at Appraisal
and, by the time they became functional, other avenues for in-service train-
iug were available (paras. 6.24-6.26, 8.03 and 8.11).
Sustainability
The prospects for sustainability of most project institutions are
good, with the exception of the SERCs, whose newness, current understaffing
and administrative ambiguity within the state/federal framework precludes
final assessment (para. 6.31). Unit costs for all project institutions (both
capital and recurrent) compare favorably with similar institutions financed
under earlier Bank loans (para. 5.01). In terms of need, the primary schools
and teacher training college responded to immediate needs in basic education,
while the ITIs responded to estimated manpower needs which, according to
employers surveyed, are being basically met through the ITIs provided under
the project (paras. 6.47-6.53). Principals and staff interviewed in the
course of project completion felt that the facilities were satisfactorily
constructed and equipped for program needs (except for library books, period-
icals and audio-visual aids at the SERCs and ITIs) (paras. 6.09-6.10, 6.18,
6.39 and 7.08). However, as the completion exercise followed closely on the
completion of facilities, it was still too early to comment on maintenance.
Findings and Lessons
Project implementation, however successful in its ulitmate outcome,
suffered from costly delays that arose in part from the Borrower's over-
stretched construction and managerial capacities. The involvement of the
considerable number of education departments and units at tle state, division
and district levels, however pcaitive in strengthening local administration
capabilities, nevertheless underscored the need for closer collaboration and
cooperation among the entities involved.
Several of the lessons arising f-:om this project have been reflect-
ed in follow-on projects in Malaysia, inter alia: site selection and acqui-
sition well in advance of project implementation (paras. 8.01 and 8.0D);
closer monitoring by the Bank of schedules of accommodation and specifica-
tions (para. 8.09); and requiring adequate staffing of project units a condi-
tion of project effectiveness (para. 8.10).
Other important lessons and points of interest include:
(a) the need to coordinate technical assistance and fellowship programs
with those project needs they have been designed to serve (paras.
8.08 and 8.10); aid
(b) the need for and purpose of proposed new institutions, such as the
SERCs, clarifying as early as possible their roles, function and
position in the administrative framework (para. 8.11),

COMPLETION REPORT PREPARED BY THE GOVERNMENT
Introduction
Socio-Economic Setting
1.01      The povulation of Malaysia is estimated to have increased from 10.4
million in 1970 to ab?yt 13.7 million in 1°80, representing an annual rate of
growth of about 2.31.1/  In terms of geographical distribution, in 1980 some
83% of the population lived in Peninsular Malaysia, 8% in Sabah and 9% in
Sarawak. By ethnic composition, about 54% of the population in Peninsular
Malaysia were indigenous Malays or Bumiputeras, 35% Chinese, 10% Indians and
1% others. In Sabah and Sarawak, the Bumiputeras and other indigenous peoples
constituted about 831 and 691 of the population, respectively. About 65% of
the population in Peninsular Malaysia, a majority of whom were Malays, lived
in the rural areas.  DIe corresponding figures for Sabah and Sarawak were 90%
and 821 respectively.-   The population of Malaysia was relatively young with
about 39% of the people in the 0-14 age group and 57% in the working age group
of 15-64. Although the age dependency ratio (non-working age groups, 1-14 and
65 and over, as a percentage of the working age group, 15-64) of 92% in 1970
had been reduced to 761 in 1980, the heavy demand for social aervices such as
education, housing and welfare remained.
1.02      During the decade of the 1970s, the Malaysian economy achieved a
creditable rate of growth. In real terms, gross donmestic product (JTP) at
factor cost grew by about 7.81 per annum  ver the period 1971-1980.-   Real
per ctyita GDP of about M$1,600 (US$724),- in 1978 was one of the highest in
Asia.,   In the 1980s, however, the Malaysian economy is projected to grow at
a slower rate than that achieved in the 1970s as a result of the prolonged

recession in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
countries.  Malaysia's GDP, projected to increase at 7.62 per annum in rgil
terms during the period 1981-85, fell from 6.5% in 1981 to 3.7% in 1982.-
1,03      In the 1970s, the labor force increased at a rate of about 3.9% per
annum, from 3.7 million in 1970 to about 5.4 million in 1980. The rate of
growth in employment was 4.1% per annum. Consequently, the unemployment rate
as a 2qrcentage of the labor force was reduced from 7.8% in 1970 to 5.3% in
1980.1' In spite of this rapid employment growth and overall reduction il
unemployment rates, underemployment as a perg7ntage of the labor force
increased from 1.5% in 1974 to 2.6% in 1978.,'  For the period 1981-85, the
growth rate in employment is estimated to be 3.2% per annum in view of the
slow-down in domestic economic activities. The unemployment rate, anticipated
to be yeduced from 5.3% in 1980 to 4.9% in 1985, was 5.7% in 1981 and 6.2% in
1982.9
1.04      The present development policy, incorporated in the Second Malaysia
Plan 1971-1975, includes the New Economic Policy (NEP) which was designed to
achieve nationai integration through the two-pronged objectives of eradicating
poverty and restructuring society to eliminate the identification of race with
economic function. These objectives were to be achieved through rapid socio-
economic development.
1.05      Considerable progress had been achieved in uplifting the socio-
economic position of the poor. Progress in poverty eradication led tQ,a
decline in the incidence of poverty from 49% in 1970 to 29% in 1980. -'
1.06      Significant results were also obtained in terms of the restructuring
targets of the NEP in the 1970s. Both the mean and median incomes of all
racial groups increased significantly in real and current terms. However, the
rates at which average incomes grew differed from one group to another.
Important structural changes were achieved in relation to occupational
patterns. In Peninsular Malaysia, the proportion of Malay agricultural
workers declined from 72% in 1970 to 68% in 1980. On the other hand, the
increase in the number of Malays in the professional and technical, and
administrative and management occupations was substantial. The effort to
create a viable commercial and industrial community among the Malays met with

considerable success.  In addition, Malay shareholding of the t lol corporate
equity in the country increased from 4% in 1971 to 12% in 1980,
Educational Setting
1.07      The educational objectives, incorporated in the National Education
Policy, are spelled out in the Second (1971-1975), Third (1976-1980) and
Fourth (1981-1985) Malaysia Plans. These objectives are to:
(a) strengthen the educational system to promote national integration
through the continued implementation, in stages, of Bahasa Malaysia
(the Malay language) as the medium of instruction at all levels,
narrow the gap in educational opportunities between the rich and
poor and between regions and races, and eventually integrate the
educational systems of Sabah and Sarawak into the national system;
(b) orient and expand the education and training system to meet national
manpower needs, especially in science and technology; and
(c) improve the quality of education in order to reduce wastage and
increase its effectiveness in nation building.
1.08      One of the most significant developments in the field of education
during the decade was the progress made towards the establishment of a
national education system in which Bahasa Malaysia was the main medium of
instruction. By 1982, Bahasa Malaysia was the medium of instruction at both
primary and secondary levels in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah. In Sarawak,
the change in the medium of instruction was started in 1977 and by 1990, all
classes are expected to be in Bahasa Malaysia. In addition, use of a common
curriculum and an integrated teacher training program are progressively
integrating the education systems of Sabah and Sarawak into the national
system.
1.09      Measures were taken to correct socio-economic and ethnic imbalances
in educational opportunities. By 1975, imbalances of access to schooling had
been rectified to a large extent witb Malays making up 61% of the enrollment
at the upper secondary levels and 54% at the post-secondary levels. Likewise,
Malay enrollment in degree M  rses in the local universities increased from
40Z in 1970 to 67% in 1980,
1.10      Quantitatively, impressive strides were made in primary, secondary
and tertiary education as reflected by improved survival rates and growth in
enrollments (Annex 1). By 1979, about 96% of the primary school age-group in
Peninsular Malaysia was enrolled. Ovecall, 83% of students completing primary
education proceeded to the secondary level in 1979 as compared to 68% in
1970. The enroll.nent ratio at the lower secondary level increased from about
11/ Ibid, p. 58.
12/ Ibid., p. 352. Calculation is based on figures given in Table 21.3.



-4-
521 in 1970 to 831 in 1979 while at the upper secondary level, the enrollment
ratio rose from about 201 in 1970 to 39X in 1979. However, enrollment grew at
a relatively slower rate at the post-secondary and tertiary levels. The post-
secondary enrollment ratio rose from 31 in 1970 to 91 in 1979 but at the
university level, the enrollment ratio increased from 0.61 to 1.61 only over
the same period.
1.11      The 1970s also witnesred the restructuring of the education system
in science, mathematics and technical courses to increase the supply of scien-
tific manpower. At the degree level, the proportion of students enrolled in
the arts declined from 631 in 19?0 to 481 in 1960 while those in science and
technical courses increased from 37% to 521. The ratio of science and
technical graduates to total output improved from 351 during 1971-75 to 391
over the period 1976-80, although still behind the target of 601. Similarly,
the supply of subprofessional technical manpower increased substantially from
570 in 1970 to about 3,330 in 1980. In relation to skilled and semi-skilled
manpower, the annual output showed a steady upward trend from about 3,200 in
1970 to around 13,000 by 1980. Technical and vocational education at the
secondary level were also expanded.
1.12      Apart from quantitative expansion, measures were also taken to
enhance the quality of education. The establishment of the Curriculum
Development Center (CDC) in 1973 and the Education Media Service (EMS) in 1972
and the extension of its services to Sabah and Sarawak during the Third
Malaysia Plan were aimed at improving the teaching and learning processes in
schools. The Kurikulum Baru Sekolah Rendah (the New Primary School
Curriculum) with its emphasis on the 3Rs - reading, writing and arithmetic -
was implemented in Standard I (Grade 1) in 1983.  Presently, the Kurikulum
Baru Sekolah Menengah (the New Secondary School Curriculum) is being
formulated and will be introduced to Form I (Grade 7) classes in 1989. The
supply of college and graduate teachers was increased and in-service training
programs for teachers were implemented.
1.13      In spite of the progress made, the educational system faced a number
of problems. Regional disparities still existed in enrollment participation
rates and the provision of human resources and physical faciLities. The
number of classrooms and schools was insufficient to meet increasing enroll-
ment. Learning was too examination-oriented and students and teachers needed
to rely less on textbooks and notes, and more on other educational resources
to stimulate the quest for knowledge. The performance of students particu-
larly in English and mathematics needed to be imiroved. There was a shortage
of teachers at the primary level and subject specialists in Bahasa Malaysia,
English, science and mathematics at the secondary level. In-service teacher
training was insufficient to meet the demands of new curricula introduced at
the primary and secondary levels. Enrollment in technical and vocational
schools, polytechnics and industrial training institutes (ITI) had to be
increased to meet the demand for semi-professional and skilled workers in the
modern sector.
1.14      The costs of providing education and training in Malaysia are borne
mainly by the Federal Government. In 1970, the recurrent expenditure on



education was about US$205 million,l3/ repreaenting 191 of total government
recurrent expenditure. This amount incr@yZed to US$1,460 million or 18S of
the total recurrent expenditure in 1984.,4/  Development expenditure on
education during the Fourth Malaysia Plan 1981-1985 mounted to US$1,282 mil-
lion or about 61 of total development expenditure. Some US$419 million or 101
of total development expenditure was allocated to development expenditure on
education in 1984.
Project Generation
1.15      The first World Bank loan (Loan 599-MA) to Malaysia for education
was made in 1969 for an amount of US$8.8 million. This was followed by the
Second Education Project (Loan 810-MA) in 1972 for the sum of US$15.5 million
and the Third Education Project (Loan 974-MA) in 1974 for US$19 million. The
Fourth Education Project was appraised in November/December 1975 and the Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR) was completed in September 1976. The Loan Agreement
(Loan 1329-MA) was signed on November 18, 1976. The loan of US$35 million was
to finance the foreign exchange costs of civil works, equipment and furniture,
and technical assistance which comprised 281 of the estimated total project
cost of US$124.6 million. The project was expected to be completed by June
30, 1981 with a Closing Date of June 30, 1982. Subsequently, the Closing Date
of the loan was extended to June 30, 1984. The loan was finally completely
disbursed on March 8, 1985.
Design
Objectives
2.01      The Fourth Education Project was approved in 1976 in order to
support the Government's efforts to improve the quality of primary schooling,
redress imbalances in the provision of primary education, upgrade teachers by
providing them with regular in-service training, meet the requirements for
primary school teachers in Sarawak, provide the skilled manpower necessary for
industrial development and prepare for expected government investment in
nonformal education.      The project was to help:
(a) establish within the MOE the institutions and systematic procedures
required for school mapping and for planning primary school
facilities;

(b) increase the capacity of the Government to implement primary school
construction programs by strengthening the staffing of the MOE and
PWD;
(c) redress inequities in provision of primary schooling through
constructir,n of approximately 4,100 classrooms and related
facilities at about 850 primary schools in poverty areas;
(d) improve primary school instruction by establishing four education
resource centers to provide teachers with regular in-service
training;
(e) make up projected shortages of primary school teachers in Sarawak by
establishing a teacher training college at Miri; and
(f) establish three new and extend two existing ITIS.
Project Components
2.02      In order to achieve these objectives, the project would provide
buildings, eq ipment, furniture and technical assistance for the project
components 3L  indicated below:
(a) Primary Schools
Approximately 4,100 classiooms and related facilities at about 850
prir"ry schools in seven of Malaysia's most disadvantaged states
(Kedah, Kelantan, Pahang, Perak, Trengganu, Sabah and Sarawak),
hostels for about 1,200 pupils and 700 staff housing units.
(b) Teacher Training College
A new teacher training college in Miri, Sarawak (STTC) with an
enrollment of 480 teacher trainees and a total output of about 240
per annum. Provision would also be made for 480 boarding places and
25 staff housing units.
(c) S_ te Education Resource Centers
Four state education resource centers (SERCs) in Alor Setar (Kedah),
Kota Bahru (Kelantan), Kuantan (Pahang) and Kuala Trengganu
(Trengganu). Each of the SERCs would provide in-service training
for 4,000 teachers annually, 40 boarding places and 1 staff housingunit.

(e) Industrial Training Institutes
Three new ITIs in Johore 10ru (Johore), Kuala Trengganu (Trengganu)
and Kota Kinabalu (Sabah)-   and extension of existing ITIs in Kuala
Lumpur (Frieral Territory) and Prai (Penang). The training capacity
of the ITIs would be increased from 900 to 2,900 per annum.
Provisions would be made for 1,145 boarding places and 39 staff
housing units.
Administration and Management
Implementation Units
3.01      Schedule 5 of the Loan Agreement specified that the responsibility for
administrative control and implementation of the Fourth Education Project would rest
with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Project Unit in the Development and Supplies
Division (DSD) of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Development Unit (DU) of
the Ministry of Labor and Manpower (MOLM). The DSD of the MOE was to be staffed
with a Project Director, an architect and two officers. At the-istate level,
the seven development officers of the project states in Peninsular Malaysia
would be designated as State Project Co-ordinators, the five resident
education officers in Sabah as the Regional Project Co-ordinators and the
seven division education officers in Sarawak as Project Directors for their
divisions. As for the DU of the MOLM, it was to be staffed with a Project
Director, an Assistant Project Director, an architect or engineer and a
procurement officer.
Management and Monitoring: DSD Involvement
3.02      When the Loan Agreement was signed in November 1976, the DSD was
implementing the Second and Third Education Projects. At that time, the DSD
was understaffed since the support staff specified in the Second Education
Project were not appointed until the end of 1977. The staffing of the DSD was
finally completed in May 1979 (Annex 2) with the appointment of the project
architect, engineer and quantity surveyor. Thus for the first two and a half
years of the Fourth Education Project, the DSD did not have a full complement
of staff for the implementation of the three projects and the implementation
of the Fourth Project was therefore delayed.
3.03      As the scope and volume of the DSD's work continued to expand from
1979 to 1984 the number of its staff also increased considerably. Presently,
the DSD is implementing three education projects funded by tile World Bank and
preparing for another one in addition to two education projects funded by the
Asian Development Bank. The increase in the volume of work is evident from
the fact that between 1979 and 1984, the DSD handled a total of over US$100
million of development funds as compared to the sum of US$13 million for the
period 1969-1978.

3.04      The Project Completion Report (PCR) team experienced some
difficulties in piecing together the early background of the project in view
of the fact that information had to be retrieved manually from hundreds of
files. However, the installation of a computer-based system of information
retrieval in the DSD scheduled for 1985 is expected to minimize the time and
effort necessary to provide basic data and progress 3chedules for the various
projects.
3.05      Considerable delays in the procurement and supply of equipment were
caused partly by frequent changes of officers within the Supplies Unit of the
DSD and difficulties arising from a lack of understanding of some of the
procurement procedures specified by the Treasury and the World Bank. Also,
the quantity of some of the equipment supplied such as audio-visual aids
including media software and library books was insufficient to meet the needs
of users. A minority of primary school principals felt that some of the items
supplied from the standard list of equipment for primary schools were either
of minimum use or of low priority in terms of school needs.
Management and Monitoring: DU Involvement
3.06      The DU, located in the Manpower Department of the MOLM, was
established by November 1976, the signing date of the Fourth Education Project
Loan Agreement. As specified in the SAR, the DU was to consist of a Project
Director, an Assistant Project Director, an engineer (the Manager) and a
procurement officer (the Senior Accounting Officer). For more than a year
following signing, the DU did not have a full complement of staff and the post
of Senior Accounting Officer was not filled until 1978. Moreover, the
responsibilities of the Director-General and the Deputy Director-General of
the Manpower Department, designated as Project Director and Assistant Project
Director, respectively, were too heavy to permit effective supervision of
project implementation by them. By 1982, the DU had expanded to include two
development officers and three clerks (Annex 3). These factors ted to delays
in implementing the ITI component, particularly in the procurement of
equipment.
3.07      Between 1979 and 1984, the scope and volume of work of the DU
expanded. Currently, the DU is involved in the implementation of two projects
funded by the World Bank and the Center for Instructors and Advanced Skill
Training (CIAST) which is supported by a capital grant from the Japanese
International Cooperation Agency. However, the expansion in the scope and
volume of work in the DU has not been matched with a corresponding increase in
staff appointments.
3.08      Understaffing may have led to the reorganization of staff functions
in the DU in 1985. The Manager is now responsible for all civil works for
Manpower Department projects. Responsibility for the procurement of furniture
and equipment has been given to the Tenders Unit of the Manpower Department's
Finance Division. The volume of work of the Senior Accounting Officer has
increased to include accounting for all projects within the Manpower Depart-
ment.



- 9 -
3.09      The PCR team experienced some difficulties in obtaining an adequate
list of past ITI graduates and their addresses from the Training Service
Division of the MOLM. Such information, useful for subsequent tracer studies,
and basic data for project components are likely to become more readily
available when the DW's request for a computer-based system of information
storage and retrieval is agreed to by the Treasury and installed.
Manaaement and Monitoring: Bank Involvement
3.10      During the period of the Fourth Education Project, fourteen World
Bank review missions visited Malaysia. The frequency of these visits was
somewhat irregular. The first review mission was in May 1977 and a second
mission did not follow until a year later in May 1978 even though the project
was then in its early critical months of implementation. Missions followed
thereafter about twice yearly, averaging about seven months apart.
3.11      There were also frequent changes in mission members.  Considerable
time would have been expended by these members to familiarize themselves with
the background and progress of the project under review. An educator was
included in nine of the review missions. Architects reviewed the project
alone on four missions and an economist was alone on a fifth mission.
3.12      Supervision and monitoring were assisted by the preparation and sub-
mission of quarterly reports by the DSD to the Bank. (The DU, however, in
spite of constant reminders by Bank staff, never submitted a progress
report.) Furthermore, review missions were often willing to make on-the-spot
derisions or to refer the problem by telex to Washington for a quick decision.
This helped to minimize delays and accelerate project implementation.
Compliance with Loan Covenants
3.13      The covenants were fulfilled as indicated in Annex 4, although there
were some delays in appointment of staff to the DU (para. 3.06).
Physical Implementation
Project Components
4.01      On the whole, the planned project components were implemented.  At
the end of June 1984, the Closing Date, construction of both the SERC in
Trengganu and the Kampong Nanka Primary School, Trengganu was incomplete. The
proportion of equipment yet to be supplied was about 5% for the 3TTC, Miri,
201 for the SERCs and 33% for the ITIs. A summary of the achievements and the
relatively minor changes in project content are shown in Annex 5.
Sites
4.02      Overall, the sites were well located and suitable for the intended
purposes. They were generally accessible and provided with basic infrastruc-
ture. Most of the sites were on state land and acquired at nominal cost.
However, the processes involved in the selection of new sites, acquisition of



- 10 -
land and site preparation were, in most cases, time consuming. This caused
considerable delay in the construction of project institutions.
4.03      Sporadic flooding was a common problem faced by the STTC, Miri, and
the SERCs at Kedah, Kelanitan and, in particular, Pahang. The STTC, Miri,
constructed on a beautiful site facing the South China Sea, has experienced
high maintenance costs arising from floods, cyclones and sea breezes and their
effect on the buildings and surrounding structures. In the case of the SERCs
in Kedah and Kelantan, flooding of the compounds due to poor drainage has
occurred at times, though not yet seriously. However, Pahang SERC, located in
a flood-prone area, had already experienced one severe flood during the
monsoon period from December 1983 to January 1984. For the SERC, Trengganu,
an extensive program of turfing was carried out to overcome the problem of
soil erosion as a result of heavy rain.
4.04      The proximity of the industrial estates to the ITIs in Prai and
Johore Bahru created an environmental hazard, mainly in the form of industrial
air pollution. At the ITI, Labuan, the initial site preparation which
involved the use of soil and other materials to fill up the swampy land, was
found to be inadequate. Its rectification further delayed the commencement of
construction work.
Professional Services
4.05      In most cases, professional services were provided by Public Works
Department (PWD) headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, assisted by the state PWDs. In
the primary school component, Sabah was the only state which employed private
consultants, some to plan and carry out soil tests for the construction of
eleven concrete-type schools and a consultant architectural firm based in
Singapore to supervise construction of all the state's education projects,
including the primary schools. Building plans for the STTC, Miri, were under-
taken by a consultant architectural firm employed by the PWD in Sarawak.
Although no private consultants were employed for the SERC project, a lecturer
in educational technology from the University of Science Malaysia was asked to
act as an honorary consultant on the design of the centers. For the ITI,
Labuan, professional services were not only provided by the PWD but also by a
consulting firm of engineers, planners and surveyors based in Kota Kinabalu,
Sabah.
Building Designs
4.06      The plans for the primary schools, the STTC, the SERCs and the ITIs
that were prepared by the PWD, were based on the standard designs used for the
construction of other such buildings in the country. However, modifications
were made to suit local conditions and needs. These buildings were either
concrete or wooden structures. On the whole, their designs served well the
teaching, learning and boarding needs of teashers and pupils. As indicated
below, there were some defects in the schedules of accommodation provided to
the PWDs and the consultants, in the designs themselves and in the resulting
uses of the buildings:



- 11 -
(a) In the hostels built at 61 primary schools located in the rural
areas of Sarawak, the high demand for places has meant that in most
cases efforts have been made to accommodate as many pupils as
possible. This has resulted in very cramped living conditions for
the children.
(b) At the STTC, Miri, the four-story administration and teaching block
with its central courtyard gives rise to a high noise level when
studeuts move from one lecture to another or while waiting for their
lectures to begin. There is insufficient storage space in the main
building and the number of bilik sembahyang (prayer rooms) for the
Muslims is inadequate. There is also a shortage of housing units
for the teaching and general staff. The location of the science
laboratories on the third floor is an unsafe feature especially in
the event of accidents or fires. Furthermore, the siting of the
volleyball courts next to the gymnasium is problematic. Glass
windows have often been broken by the volleyballs thrown in the
direction of the gymnasium although this has been remedied by the
installation of grill*. There are inadequate facilities for
recreation and private study in the hostels.
(C) Concern was expressed at the SERCs about the lack or inadequate size
of certain types of rooms. A hall for large meetings is needed as
are additional lecture and seminar rooms to cope with the large
numbers attending courses and other activities. The size of the two
industrial arts workshops is inadequate for the heavy machines and
ventilation is poor. There is also a shortage of storerooms, hostel
accommodation and associated facilities, and staff quarters. Among
other design weaknesses reported, an especially serious one is the
location of the switch room in the main block directly below toilets
on the first floor. The weakness became an actual problem when, in
Kedah in June 1983, leaks developed in the toilet piping, flooding
the switch room and causing a short circuit.
(d) At the ITIs, workshops of a standard design were constructed without
taking into consideration the type of machinery and equipment that
would be installed. Space in the workshops is insufficient to meet
the needs of instructors and trainees or the increasing demands of
the curriculum.   At the ITI, Kuala Trengganu, the layout of the
workshops in terms of minimizing dust and noise is poor. The ITI in
Johore Bahru reported poor acoustics in the multipurpose hall. The
ceiling of the dining hall at the ITI, Labuan, was found to be lower
than at the other ITIs and this contributes to ineffective
ventilation, especially when a majority of the trainees are present
for their meals.
Construction
4.07      As shown in Annex 6, all project components experienced a time
overrun ranging from 1 years (ITI, Prai) to 5½ years (SERC, Trengganu).
Construction problems, however, were only one of the factors which caused
delays in the implementation of the project. Other factors were selection and



- 12 -
acquisition of land, preparation of the sites, processing and approval of
plans, the monsoon seasons and the remoteness of some areas particularly in
Sabah and Sarawak. Generally, total constructed areas exceeded appraisal
estimates, the exception being the ITIs (Annex 7). Some defects in construc-
tion were observed and the quality of work was not always satisfactory. There
was a need fer closer supervision of contractors by the PWD. A summary by
project component follows:
(a) Compared with the proposed implementation schedule, the completion
of the primary school component was delayed by up to five years.
The delay was due partly to the long processes involved in the
determination of site suitability and land acquisition for the new
schools. Citizens wishes and education criteria used in locating
schools had to be takeninto account, decisions on suitability had to
work their way through several government agencies at both state and
national levels, landowners had to be paid, sometimes after long
negotiations, and customary land had to be acquired. Problems
experienced in the construction program which caused further delays
were mainly related to supervision of construction and the quality
of work of the contractors. Close supervision of construction was
not always possible due to shortages of skilled staff in the PWDs
and the fact that some PWDs were not adequately organized to take on
the extra workload caused by the project. The quality of the
materials and workmanship was generally below the expectations of
the State Education Departments (SEDs). Contractors also had
difficulty acquiring building materials and equipment and once
acquired they could not always transport them to the more remote
sites. Some contractors abandoned their projects.
(b) There was an overrun in time of about 3½ years in relation to the
appraisal schedule for the completion of the STTC, Miri. This was
due to the decision to increase its capacity from 480 to 720,
coupled with delays in site selection, land acquisition and con-
struction. Assuming a full ehrollrment of 720 trainees, the areas
per student provided for academic and communal facilities exceeded
those estimated at appraisal by 3.8%. However, the area per student
for boarding was less than that envisaged at appraisal by 2.1%.
Generally, the finishing and paintwork at the STTC are poor.
(c) Given that the SERC, Trengganu, the last to be completed, was
occupied in December 1984, the actuai implementation period for
construction of the SERCs was 7½ years, representing some 5½ years
of delay in completion when compared with appraisal estimates. The
main causes of the time overrun were changes in the SERC design to
emphasize its role as a resource center, delayL in construction,
particularly in Trengganu where the first contractor's lack of
experience of large projects and financial difficulties caused the
termination of his contract, and delays in provision of essential
services like electricity. Several defects in relation to the
quality of workmanship have been observed, these being roof leaks,
cracked glass, floor cracks and poor paintwork and plastering.
Although most of these defects have been rectified, the time taken



- 13 -
has usually been considerable with delays by both PWD and the
contractors. Overall, the total constructed area of the SERCs
exceeded that of appraisal estimates by about 99%.
(d)  Taking the ITI project as a whole, the estimated completion date of
September 1979 was extended to as late as July 1984, about a five-
year delay. Implementation and completion of all institutions were
delayed, due mainly to delays in civil works construction. The
total constructed area falls short of appraisal estimates by
about 4X.
Furniture and Equipment
4.08      Proc-urement of furniture and equipment, done in accordance with Bank
and Treasury guidelines, was centrally controlled by the DSD of MOF and the DU
of MOLM. Overall, a higher proportion of furniture than equipment has been
supplied to the project institutions. Furthermore, furniture supplied is
generally found to be satisfactory in terms of both quantity and quality.
However, this expression of satisfaction was not always extended to the
procurement and supply of equipment as summarized below:
(a)  The furniture supplied to project primary schools was based on a
standard list prepared by the DSD for all primary schools in the
country. Over the implementation period, the standard list of
equipment was revised and updated in response to the requirements
and stages of development of the project schools in the seven
scates. This helped to reduce unnecessary purchases. In general,
furniture and equipment were delivered following the completion of
the schools. With the exception of a few schools which were yet to
receive some items, all the project schools, staff quarters and
hostels had been supplied with the standard furniture and equipment
at the time of the review. Furniture and equipment in Peninsular
Malaysia was procured between April 1977 and December 1984. When
compared with the proposed schedule, this was a delay of six
years. The overrun in time was due to delays in construction.
(b)  According to the principal and staff of the STTC, Miri, the quantity
of furniture was adequate for the enrollment at the time of the
review. However, the quality of the furniture could be improved.
Equipment was supplied by the PWD, the DSD, the Malaysian
Administrative Modernization and Manpower Planning Unit in Sarawak
as well as the Sarawak SED. As a result of delays in civil works,
procurement and delivery of furniture and equipment were delayed by
about five years.
(c)  The SERCs, except Trengganut had received all their furniture by the
end of June 1984 and the items supplied appeared to be quite
satisfactory. No complaints were received with respect to quality,
quantity and suitability. On the other hand, equipment purchased
for the SERCs from excess funds under the Second Education Project
(Loan 810-MA) and supplied in 1980 could not be utilized until at
least two years later since all SERCs were in the early stages of



- 14 -
construction at that time and furthermore, were not staffed until
1982. The premature purchasing resulted in some deterioration in
quality of the equipment before it could be used. Of the equipment
purchased under this project, supply began in 1983 and has continued
to the time of the review. Although delivery of equipment and
materials for the hostels, science laboratories, industrial art
workshops an; printing faci'lities was generally complete or nearly
so, there were problems with audio-visual aids, including media
software and library books. All centers had received very little to
stock the media libraries. Media software such as educational films
and tapes was difficult to obtain since much of it came from
overseas. Library books of a fairly specialized nature were not
easily available. In the meanwhile, the lack of these resources, in
particular the media software and books in Bahasa Malaysia, had
affected significantly the SERC's role as a resource center. In
addition, the provision of equipment to the SERCs, a long and
complex responsibility, was attended by several problems. Apart
from the difficulty of preparing specifications for certain audio-
visual equipment, the Supplies Unit of the DSD also reported the
following matters: the problem of determining what constituted
standard items for supply to the SERCs because they were a com-
pletely new development; lateness in the delivery of some items
because they were supplied from outside the country or, in the case
of the off-set machine, because there was a deliberate postponement
until the 3-phase wiring for it was completed and doors nad been
widened by breaking down adjacent walls to allow it to enter; and
difficulty in getting companies to tender for the software for the
printing machines. The services of a suitable educational tech-
nology specialist, conversant with what equipment was available,
would have been invaluable in this matter. Indeed, such a
specialist could have been employed to advise and assist in a number
of other areas as well during the project, and this recommendation
was in fact made by a Review Mission from the World Bank in June
1979. The recommendation was not adopted but, in retrospect, it is
clear that a coordinator could have helped to overcome some of these
problems and shorten delays considerably. Moreover, a suggestion by
the PCR team for the SERCs that a review of the operation of the
Supplies Unit from the viewpoint of staffing and procurement
procedures is, perhaps, in order.
(d) As a result of delays in civil works at the ITIs, procurement and
delivery of furniture and equipment were also delayed since not all
types of furniture could be procured and delivered until the
extensions and the new ITIs were almost completed. By December
1984, almost 100% of the furniture had been delivered to the ITIs
but the supply of equipment was still in progress. About a third of
the equipment required had to be retendered partly because some of
the items did not receive any bids at the time that the tenders were
called. According to the SAR, procurement of furniture and equip-
ment was to have been completed by September 1979. Thus the delay
in the procurement and supply of furniture and equipment exceeded
five years.

Costs
Appraisal and Actual Costs
5.01      A comparative analysis by categories of expenditure (civil works
which includes site development, construction and professional services,
furniture and equipment, and technical assistance) of appraisal estimates and
actual costs is shown in Annex 8. All categories of expenditure show cost
underruns when compared with appraisal estimates in spite of the fact that
severat of the project components exceeded appraisal areas and had considera-
ble cast overruns in both the civil works and equipment and furniture
categories (Annex 9). Because slightly less than expected was spent on the
large primary school component, the project overall cost about 6% less than
estimated. Some of the other components experienced cost overruns. The
reasons for these overruns are given below:
(a) At the STTC, Miri, the cost overrun is about 45% all of which is
from civil works. The overall actual unit cost per student exceeds
the appraisal unit cost by 48%, given the enrollment of 474 in
1984. At full enrollment, unit costs will be slightly below
appraisal unit costs. The total recurrent expenditure of the STTC
for 1984 is about US$1.4 million. Based on the current enrollment
of 474, the unit recurrent cost works out to be about US$2,950 per
student. The overall actual gross cost per square foot of built-up
area for the STTC is US$26.00. This compares well with the cost of
the four other teacher training colleges constructed under the Third
Education Project at a cost of US$36.00 per square foot.
(b) The actual cost of the SERCs amounted to US$5.7 million compared
with the SAR estimate of US$2.4 million. This reoresents a cost
overrun of about 140%. The increase in costs was due largely to
changes in design together with inflation resulting from a number of
delays in project implementation. Unit recurrent cost, based on the
budgeted total expenditure of US$0.4 million for 1984 and a student
population of about 550 for all states, was about US$725 per
student.
(c) With the ITIs, the cost overrun is about 52%, which is due to both
civil works and equipment and furniture. The increase in costs is
due partly to underestimation at appraisal of the cost of furniture
and equipment and to inflation due to delays in construction caused
by the considerable gestation period needed for plans to be approved
prior to commencement of civil works. The overall actual unit cost
per student exceeds the appraisal unit cost by 52%, given the
enrollment of 2,233 in June 1984. The total recurrent expenditure
for the five ITIs in 1984 was about US$1.78 million. The unit
recurrent cost is about US$800 per student.

Disbursements
5.02      The appraisal and actual schedule of disbursements from the loan by
fiscal year is shown in Annex 10. While the MOE made its first withdrawal
from the loan in the second half of FY78, the MOLM only commenced its
withdrawals in the first half of FY82.  This was partly due to understaffing
of the DU, staff turnover and delays in project implementation. However, the
full loan was disbursed by March 8, 1985, taking over three years longer than
the five years originally estimated.
Educational Outcomes
Overview
6.01      As shown by the findings of the PCR team, the Fourth Education
Project has assisted the Government to achieve some of its educational
objectives. The implementation of the project has succeeded in improving the
quality of primary schooling in seven disadvantaged states, increasing the
output of trained teachers in Sarawak, providing resource centers in four
states to enhance the process of learning and teaching, and increasing the
supply of trained manpower required for industrial development. In addition,
it has strengthened the planning mechanisms for better allocation of educa-
tional resources. The project helped to establish within the MOE and the SEDs
the systematic procedures required for school mapping and implementation of
school construction. The SEDs were responsible for locating suitable sites to
be acquired by the MOE for new schools; preparing development budgets for sub-
mission to the MOE; preparing project briefs; suggesting criteria for selec-
tion of project schools such as the needs of the communities, population
increases and the emergence of new settlements; assisting the PWD in the
tender process; monitoring the physical development of project schools; and
submitting quarterly progress reports to the MOE.
Primary Schools
6.02      The primary schools component was to assist the Government in
implementing the five-year primary school construction program of the Third
Malaysia Plan 1976-80. Eight hundred forty-eight primary schools were to be
established, expanded or replaced in seven disadvantaged states, Kedah,
Kelantan, Pahang, Trengganu, Perak, Sabah and Sarawak. The component was
designed to redress the imbalance in the provision of educational opportuni-
ties and resources for primary education in these states, particularly in the
rural areas. Towards this end, it was to have assisted in developing a more
efficient system of allocating educational resources according to needs, not
only among the different states but also within the states themselves.
6.03      Location.  On the whole, the project has been successful in
providing primary schools in rural areas which needed the facilities. Based
on the data gathered in the survey, it was found that about 651 of the project
schools were built in rural areas, 19% in very rural areas, 10% in suburban
areas and 6% in the towns (Annex 11). Despite the rural location of the
majority of the schools, about 81% of them could be reached by regular



- 17 -
vehicles. In Peninsular Malaysia, about 99% of the project schools were sited
in locations which were accessible by regular vehicles while in Sabah and
Sarawak, the percentage was 70. Among the seven states, Sarawtk had a large
proportion (62%) of -.s project schools located in the interior and coastal
areas which were accessible only by boat and/or by foot. In this respect, the
project has succeeded in building primary schools in areas which are not
generally accessible.
6.04      Enrollment.  By the end of 1983, 194,000 pupils enrolled in the 782
project schools that responded to the questionnaire were directly or
indirectly benefiting from the project facilities. Data from the survey
showed that enrollment at 367 of the schools (47%) had increased and that
about 75% of these were in rural and very rural areas. Therefore, it can be
concluded that the project schools have helped to meet the increased demand
for places and accelerated the provision of primary school education for rural
children.
6.05      Double-Session Schools.  Another educational effect of the project
has been the reduction of double-session schools. The number of double-
session schools was reduced from 117 (16% of those responding in the question-
naire) at the beginning of the project to 78 (10% of those responding in the
questionnaire) at completion. Correspondingly, the number of single-session
schools increased from 634 (84%) to 699 (90%).
6.06      Pupil Achievement.  The average pass percentage in the Standard Five
Assessment Examination  SFAE) in the project schools was about 29% from 1977
to 1983. At those project schools showing an improvement in achievement, the
average pass percentage increase was about 1.2 during the same period.
However, it was noted that there were wide fluctuations from year to year in
the SFAE pass percentages for almost half the project schools.
6.07      Facilities.  A major contribution of the project was the improvement
of the physical facilities in the existing primary schools. About 84% of the
project schools were built either as replacements of old buildings with inade-
quate classrooms or as extensions to existing achools so as to meet new
enrollment demands and hence ease overcrowding. Only about 16% of the project
schools were new schools on new sites and most of these were built in
Peninsular Malaysia. Due to the fact that a large number of the project
schools were replacement or extension schools and sited in rural areas with a
small population, the schools were generally small in size. About 58% were
sub-sized schools with one to five classrooms. Only 42% were full-sized
schools with six classrooms or more. In Sabah and Sarawak, 68% of the schools
had only one to three classrooms.
6.08      Teachers.  Of the 8,393 teachers in 1983 in the 786 project schools
for which data is available, 7,199 (86%) u're trained, 101 (1%) were under-
going training and 1,093 (13%) were untrained or part-time teachers. The
untrained teachers were found to be serving in 509 project schools, of which
437 (86%) were rural schools and 72 (14%) were urban and suburban schools. Of
the 1,093 untrained teachers, 935 (86%) were serving in rural schools and only
158 (14%) in urban and suburban schools. On the whole, the rural schools had
a higher ratio of untrained teachers.

6.09      Perception of Principals.  The majority of the school principals in
the opinion survey were satisfied with the new school buildings and furniture
provided by the project. Over 90X of the principals were very positive
regarding the benefits which could be obtained from the new school build-
ings. However, a minority of the principals were not satisfied and the
reasons given by them related mainly to either low quality materials or poor
workmanship. As regards equipment, the majority of the principals expressed
satisfaction with the equipment provided by the project.
6.10      In relation to subject difficulty, Bahasa Malaysia was perceived by
the principals to be least difficult and English was the most difficult for
the pupils. Science and history/geography were considered to be of 'average'
difficulty and mathematics was of 'average' to 'above average' difficulty.
6.11      Technical Assistance.  Through the technical assistance program, 30
education officers received training equivalent to 10 man-years in three types
of overseas training programs from October 1978 to July 1981. Only 13 of the
19 officers trained in educational planning/school mapping are, at this time,
dircctly involved in school mapping and planning in education departments. It
was also noted that the professional inDuts of the trained officers to the
mapping of primary schools in the project was minimal as planning for the
project had already been completed on their return. However, the technical
assistance program increased the capacities of the staff of the MOE to plan
the construction of primary schools.
6.12      Aside from strengthening the staff of the development divisions of
the MOE and SEDs as well as the education sections of the PWDs, the project
helped to establish within these institutions the systematic procedures
required for school mapping and implementation of school construction.
However, in view of the traditional identification of institutional responsi-
bilities, the management procedures had, in most cases, generated difficulties
for the maintenance of close collaboration and cooperation among all the state
institutions involved in the implementation of the project, particularly in
the control of the quality of buildings and furniture to the satisfaction of
the SEDs and school principals. From the viewpoint of central administration
at the MOE, the involvement of the large number of divisions, departments and
units at state/division/district levels in the project created a rather
complex situation which hindered its efficiency in monitoring the progress of
the projects and in riaintaining an up-to-date record of project costs.
Sarawak q'eacher's Training College, Miri
6.13      Teachers for primary and lower secondary schools are trained in a
three-year program (extended from a two-year course in 1982) in teacher
training colleges under the MOE. The output of these colleges has been
adequate to meet primary teacher requirements in most st.ates, except in
Sarawak where an annual shortage of about 170 teachers was projected over the
period 1976 to 1983. To meet this projected shortage, the Fourth Education
Project proposed the establishment of a teacher training college at Miri in
Sarawak to replace an existing TTC at Sibu which was producing 70 graduates
per year but was housed in inadequate facilities.



- 19 -
6.14      Training Program.  The STTC offers a three-year teacher training
program which trains teachers in two types of courses, Primary School
Education (PSE) and Secondary School Education (SSE). Teacher trainees have
to undergo training in one of the areas of specialization - Malay, English or
Chinese studies for the PSE and Malay studies and history or Malay studies and
geography for the SSE. Besides their particular areas of specialization, the
trainees are also exposed to common core courses, school subjects such as
science and mathematics, and self-enrichment programs such as home science and
agricultural science. Evaluation of the trainees is based on their
performance in course work, teaching practice and co-curricular activities
such as clubs, games, community work and sports. The program appears to be
comprehensive and in line with the needs of teacher education in the state.
6.15      Teacher Trainees.  There is a balance in terms of numbers (among
those responding to the questionnaire) between male (208) and female (232)
trainees. Distribution according to state and ethnicity reflects the objec-
tive of having a higher proportion of teacher trainees from Sarawak rather
than Peninsular Malaysia. Intake policies appears to favor those from the low
socio-economic group and rural areas. The educational attainment of the
majority of trainees is generally low - 70% of them obtained only a Grade III
in the Malaysiar Certificate of Education examination. Besides this, almost
half the trainees received their secondary education in English and they are
currently experiencing language problems in the STTC since Bahasa Malaysia is
the medium of instruction. However, efforts are being made by the STTC to
assist the trainees concerned to overcome some of their language difficulties.
6.16      Enrollment and Output.  Enrollment at the STTC in 1984 was 474
(Annex 12). This reflects closely the enrollment of 480 envisaged in the
SAR. For 1985, the projected enrollment is 643 and this would be approaching
the target of 720 trainees as planned by the MOE. The change from a two-year
to a three-year training program in 1982 has not only delayed output by a year
but also reduced the expected output considerably. For example, the output in
1984 will only be about 100 as against the estimated total of 240. However,
the output will rise as intake increases over the next few years. The 1984
output was of teachers for the primary schools. In 1985, however, about 73%
of the output of teachers will be for the primary schools and about 27% for
the lower secondary schools.
6.17      Perception of Courses.  Trainees find subjects which are directly
related to work in the classroom such as teaching practice, teaching methods
(including content) and education courses to be more useful to their training
than the co-curricular and self-enrichment courses. Some worthwhile
experiences mentioned by the trainees were orientation week, the opportunities
provided for trainees of different races to live and work together and
learning to be independent. They perceived that during the course of their
training, values like patience, honesty, willingness to work hard and respect
for others are being inculcated.
6.18      Facilities.  Most of the teaching staff and third-year trainees who
have used the facilities at both the colleges in Miri and Sibu are of the
opinion that practically all the facilities provided in the STTC at Miri are,
on the whole, better than those that were available in Sibu. Generally,



- 20 -
special subject rooms pertaining to needlework, home science and language
laboratories are under-utilized as compared to recreation and tutorial rooms,
the library and gymnasium. A review could be made reoarding the utilization
of some of the special subject rooms which are used infrequently by staff and
trainees.
6.19      Teaching Staff.  About half of the 31 lecturers at the College are
university graduates. Professionally, more than half of the staff possess
teacher training certificates and the rest are mainly Diploma in Education
holders. The wcorkload of the staff appears reasonable except in some of the
specialized areas such as the library and technical services units where more
personnel are needed. A majority of the staff are experienced teachers who
have taught for more than five years in schools. Almost half the staff have
lectured at teacher training colleges for over five years.
6.20      Staff activities are centered around the teaching of languages,
education courses, school subjects and areas of specialization. The staff are
also involved in co-curricular activities and some of the lecturers serve as
counsellors to the trainees or act as wardens of the hostels. Opportunities
are provided for staff to attend in-service courses particularly in their own
areas of specialization.
6.21      Some of the main problems experienced by the teaching staff are
related to the quality of the trainees (para. 6.15), accommodations, general
facilities, staffing shortages and the cost of living. To minimize these
problems, efforts could be made to increase the library collection, provide
more science apparatus and equipment, make available opportunities for
lecturers to be trained in the use of audio-visual materials, improve and
increase the number of staff quarters, enlarge the audio-visual room for
teaching purposes and employ more staff for some of the specialized areas.
6.22      Technical Assistance.  Of the eight officers who were sent overseas
for training, only one of them returned to serve the STTC. Efforts should
have been made to retain the other officers to serve specifically the STTC
rather than to deploy them to other sections of the SED. This is particularly
pertinent in view of the fact that the STTC is experiencing a shortage of
staff.
6.23      School Posting Preferences.  Trainees' preferences for school
posting indicate that, if given a choice, a small proportion of them would not
want to serve in their home state. Generally, where the choice is between
urban or rural areas, trainees have expressed preferences to teach in the
small towns and urban centers rather than the kampung (villages) in the rural
areas. With regard to a choice of profession, about two-thirds of the
trainees indicated that they would continue to teach even if alternative
employment opportunities were available.
State Education Resource Centers
6.24      Within the broader aim of raising the quality of primary education,
the objective of the SERCs was to expand and strengthen in-service training.
There would be courses to upgrade untrained or poorly qualified teachers and



- 21 -
courses to familiarize all teachers with the new curricula, teaching tech-
n!ques and instructional resources being developed by CDC and EMS. The selec-
tion of sites in four of the seven less developed states involved in the
project was intended to reduce regional inequalities.
6.25      In-Service Training.  In terms of in-service training, the SAR
estimated that each year 2,000 teachers would undertake a course of one week's
duration at the SERC and another 2,000 would be given equivalent training at
schools in the state. In practice, one-week courses have been comparatively
rare. Many in-service programs are only for a day or two, typically in the
form of workshops. To make a comparison of actual training figures with
appraisal targets, the equivalent number of days of training given in each
program was computed and five days of training were set equal to one student
unit. In 1983, which was also the first full year of operation for the Kedah
and Kelantan SERCs, figures for actual student units trained were all very
low, the highest being for Kelantan with 11% of the appraisal target of 4,000
(Annex 13). In the first half of 1984, all states except Trengganu exceeded
the numbers for the whole of 1983 albeit these were still low with Kelantan
now reaching 15% of the appraisal target. The results reflect the early stage
of development of all the SERCs, the lack of funds and szaff to provide more
courses and the fact that in-service training is neither the only nor the main
priority of the SERCs. Although the SAR proposed that the SERCs would both
upgrade untrained or poorly qualified teachers and acquaint all teachers with
new developments, the centers have concentrated so far only on the latter
responsibility, partly because MOE's Teacher Education Division provides ten-
week in-service training courses for teachers, and SERC staff so far are not
themselves qualified in-service educators. The programs that have been given
have been generally well-regarded by participating principals and teachers
across the four states and ratings of good and very good were given by 70% or
more with respect to organization, clarity of objectives and usefulness.
Almost all of the remaining participants rated the three aspects as average.
6.26      Other Purposes.  It is clear that almost from the time the project
was first discussed, other purposes and functions than that of the in-service
training mentioned in the SAR were also intended for the SERCs by MOE
officers. A paper prepared by a team of key planners from the Educational
Planning and Research Division (EPRD) of the MOE following a study tour of
four countries in 1978 was crucial in expanding the role of the SERCs
considerably. In addition to being an in-service training institution, an
SERC is to function in the following ways: (a) as a resource center providing
a variety of services for teachers; (j) as a teachers' center where teachers
can feel free to engage in many activities such as designing and producing
curricular materials, exchanging ideas and socializing; (c) to carry out
research, especially at the local classroom level; (d) to decentralize MOE
educational activities especially in matters related to curriculum; and (e) to
provide innovative professional leadership and coordinate professional
activities in the state.
6.27      Activities.  Of the other planned purposes, the SERC's function as a
resource center is the one which has developed most so far. Services offered
include giving advice, providing resources and facilities, disseminating
ir.formation and providing a loan service for educational materials. High



- 22 -
percentages of school personneJ indicated in the questionnaires their aware-
ness of these SERC activities taking place. The SERC's purpose as a teachers'
center is also known to many teachers although it has experienced less devel-
opment, particularly in terms of being a social center. In investigating
conditions and identifying problems in schools, all SERCs have carried out
studies but Kelantan has progressed most with respect to the funcion of the
centers to do research, culminating in its Adopted Child Project.          The
objective of setting up the SERCs to decentralize educational activities from
the federal level to the state level and on down to the school level has been
an unqualified success, with the local studies in schools just referred to a
good example of the benefit of decentralization. As for the purpose of
providing innovative professional leadership and coordinating professional
activities in the state, the SERC achieves this to a certain extent through
its Management Committee of which the Principal Coordinating Officer (PCO),
the head of the SERC, is secretary. Nevertheless, the authority to lead, the
freedom to innovate and the opportunity to coordinate vary from state to
state, depending on the status and recognition accorded to the SERC. In this
matter, the Kelantan SERC has achieved the most due in no small measure to the
support of the State Director of Education.
6.28      Although their purposes and functions are common, the states have
had different approaches to development as reflected in their activities. In
Kedah, a major thrust of the SERC has been the launching in early 1984 of two
in-service schemes, the Basic Skills Training Program and the Basic Program in
Educational Technology, with the focus on the teacher and his felt needs and
interests. The good response so far appears to indicate the value of the
courses in meeting teachers' needs.   Kedah has also been active in helping
districts and schools to establish and manage resource centers, and providing
training and consultancy services for several teacher activity centers set up
in the latter half of 1984. In Pahang SERC, the establishment and management
of resource centers at the district and school levels have been the main focus
of attention in the short period of its existence (about a year). Its
strategy has included the holding of several subdistrict workshops to motivate
teachers to set up school resource centers. A successful two-day education
exhibition and seminar was held in November 1984. As it was housed
temporarily in two rooms in a school until January 1985, Trengganu SERC has
only been able to offer limited resource center services such as duplicating
and equipment loan services. However, a major project known as the Multiple
18/ A total of 85 Standard Five pupils from 23 rural primary schools were
'adopted' by the SERC and brought to the Center for 10 days during the
second-term vacation (July - August 1933). Pupils were inducted into
hostel life and given intensive assistance with their studies. The
results for the Standard Five Assessment Examination (1983) were
impressive. Fifteen of the adopted pupils scored 'A' grades in all five
subjects examined and schools generally achieved significant improvements
with six of them obtaining from 30% to 48% passes compared with zero
percentage before. The Project has been repeated yearly since 1983 and
was extended in 1985 to include secondary students.



- 23 -
Class Teaching Project 191 was launched in early 1985. Although the project
will be addressing a different p,-oblem, it has many similarities with the
Adopted Child Project in Kelantan and promises similar benefits if successful.
6.29      Professional Staff.  At appraisal, it was proposed to have 68
professional staff for the four SERCs (17 for each center). Partly because of
the early stage of development of the SERCs, especially in Trengganu but more
because of severe financial constraints due to the slowdown in the economy,
only 21 professional posts had been approved at the time of the review. Of
this number, 13 had been filled and, including 9 officers seconded to the
Centers, the total number of professional staff was 22 as of June 1984. The
nature of their work, to provide innovative educational leadership to teachers
and education officers, requires staff to be of high professional caliber.
Their expertise can be developed through appropriate professional training. A
proposed combination of study tours for short-term exposure and internships
and award-granting programs for longer-term training appears to give a good
balance in what is needed by staff. Because of the shortage of staff and for
other reasons, SERC professional personnel have undertaken responsibilities
adeitional to those for their particular posts. They appear to have done so
readily enough and generally possess strong professional commitment and a
lively interest in their work.
6.30      Technical Assistance.  Sixteen fellows were trained under the
technical assistance program, 12 in the first group and 4 in the second
program approved subsequent to appraisal. Only four of the original group of
12 fellows eventually joined the SERCs because of the delays in construction
of the Centers and the fact that, apart from the PCOs, most of the others
became too senior for positions in the SERCs. Three of the four fellows in
the second group are now working in the Centers, making a total of 7 out of 16
who received training. Thus, there has certainly been a loss of professional
expertise at the crucial beginning of the Centers' programs as well as a
partial failure to achieve the objective of technical assistance.
6.31      Position of SERCs.  The question of where the SERC as an innovative
educational institution should be located within the organizational structure
at federal and state levels is one of considerable importance that has not yet
been decided. The EPRD document (para. 6.27) provided broad guidelines in the
matter but more specific policies and decisions are now the responsibility of
the SERC Advisory Committee and the EPRD both at the federal level and the
SERC Management Committees at the state level. The key )oints at issue are:
(a) the SERCs need a reasonable degree of autonomy in order to achieve their
19/ Almost 25% of Llhe primary schools in Trengganu have an enrollment of
fewer than 120 pupils. In these schools, a teacher may find him or
herself responsible for two or three classes at the same time. In an
attempt to alleviate the problem, the aim of the Multiple Class Teaching
Project is to prepare teaching-learning kits for individualized learning
initially for mathematics and Malay language from Standard Four to
Standard Six in 20 schools. The kits would be prepared by the teachers
concerned in the 20 schools with the assistance of SERC staff.



- 24 -
purposes effectively; (b) the SERCs should be responsible to the Director of
Education, the highest education authority in the state; (c) the role of the
SERCs as innovative leaders and coordinators of professional activities in the
states needs clarification; and (d) the relationships between SERC and SED
professional units in terms of their respective roles and functions also needs
clarification.
Industrial Training Institutes
6.32      It was envisaged that the three new and two expanded ITIs would
provide industrial training for the young and in-service training and re-
training for adults. These two face-s of a single strategy were aimed at
upgrading the skill level of the labor force to meet the requirements of
industrial development.
6.33      Training Program.  In terms of the curriculum, about 22 trades are
offered by the ITIs and these have been classified under 4 categories, namely,
mechanical, electrical, building and printing trades. The ITIs and the four
categories of trades which they offer are given below:
ITIs                                       Trades
Kuala Lumpur                      Mechanical, electrical, building and printing
Prai                              Mechanical and electrical
Kuala Trengganu                   Mechaniical, electrical and building
Johore Bahru                      Mechanical, electrical and building
Labuan                            Mechanical, electrical and building
6.34      A total of five types of training courses for the above four
categories of trades are provided at the ITI, Kuala Lumpur. They are:
(a) national apprenticeship scheme course (NAS-3 years); (b) preparatory trade
course (PTC-2 years); (c) skill up-grading course (variable lengths);
(d) instructional techniques course (1 year); and (e) trade instructor
training course Cl year). However, the instructional techniques course will
eventually be given by CIAST. The ITI, Prai, offers three courses, the
apprenticeship, PTC and skill up-grading courses. However, the ITIs in Kuala
Trengganu, Johore Bahru and Labuan provide only the PTC.
6.35      Trainees.  A large majority of the PTC and NAS trainees in the ITIs
are male and a high proportion are from families of low socio-economic
status. Most of those responding to the questionnaire found the courses which
they followed 'very useful'. Having pursued the courses, a majority of them
in fact became more interested in the trades than when they first enrolled at
the ITIs.
6.36      Enrollment and Output.  From the figures in Annex 14 which indicate
the appraisal target and the actual enrollment in 1984 for the five ITIs, it
can be seen that the ITIs had achieved 76% of the target envisaged in the
SAR. This achievement is commendable in view of the fact that construction
delays caused a time overrun of between 1½ and 4½ years for the commencement
of courses provided at the institutes.



- 25 -
6.37      As for the ITIs in Kuala Lumpur and Prai which were established in
1964 and 1973 respectively, an attempt was made to collect enrollment figures
for the past five years -- from 1979 to 1983. Although enrollment data were
available for the ITI, Prai, from 1979 to 1983 (Annex 15), those for the ITI,
Kuala Lumpur, were for the years 1981 to 1983 only (Annex 16). For the two
ITIs concerned, the enrollment data suggest that the distribution pattern of
trainees by trades, courses and sex has hardly changed over the years 1979 to
1983. A majority of the trainees were registered with the mechanical trades
and enrolled in PTC courses. Furthermore, the proportion of male trainees far
exceeds th. of female trainees. It was observed that the enrollment of
trainees in 1984 at the ITIs in Kuala Lumpur and Prai reflected a similar
distribution pattern in terms of trades (Annex 17), courses and sex of
students.
6.38      The total output of graduates from the two ITIs in Piai (Annex 18)
and Kuala Lumpur (Annex 19) was 1,643 (1979 to 1983) and 3,314 (1981 to 1983),
respectively. A majority of these graduates were trained in mechanical as
compared to electrical, building and printing trades. Furthermore, a higher
proportion of graduates were from the pre-service (PTC) than the in-service
courses (NAS and skill up-grading). Since the courses in the other three ITIs
commenced only in July 1984, the first output of trainees from these
institutes would be in 1985.
6.39      Facilities.  On the whole, both instructors and trainees were fairly
satisfied with most of the existing facilities at the ITIs. However, instruc-
tors were least satisfied with library facilities, in particular the provision
of books and periodicals. A majority of the instructors considered the staff
room and its facilities to be inadequate. Dissatisfaction was also expressed
with regard to the design of laboratories and the provision of equipment. A
major proportion of the trainees found hostel life and facilities to be satis-
factory. Recreation rooms and facilities, however, were inadequate to meet
the needs and interests of the trainees.
6.40      Instructors.  The number of instructors in the five ITIs is 178
which is about 65% of the appraisal estimate. Presently, the instructor-
student ratio works out to be, on the average, about 1:13. At full capacity,
the average instructor:student ratio would be 1:11.
6.41      More than half the number of instructors (56%) are in the mechanical
trades, while 27% of the instructors provide instruction in the electrical
trades, and 14% are involved in the building trades. The printing trades have
the lowest number of instructors (3%). Almost all of the instructors are
male. Only two of the instructors are female and they provide instruction in
bookbinding in the printing trades course.
6.42      Based on the responses of 71% of the instructors, about 63% possess
the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (Malaysian Certificate of Education-grade 12).
The Sijil Rendah Pelajaran (Lower Certificate of Education-grade 9) was held
by 12% of the instructors. On the other end of the continuum, 2% and 13% of
the instructors were diploma and degree holders. Thus the educational
attainment of slightly more than three-quarters of the instructors was at the
lower and upper secondary school level.



- 26 -
6.43      In relation to professional qualifications, 80% of the instructors
were ITI graduates. About 20% of the remaining instructors were successful
candidates in the National Industrial Training and Trade Certification Board
examinations at the basic as well as intermediate grades. Slightly more than
three-quarters of the instructors (77%) had less than six years of teaching
experience.
6.44      The responses to the questionnaire also highlighted a number of
issues related to the learning and teaching process. In the established ITIs
in Kuala Lumpur and Prai, the respondents expressed the opinion that space in
the workshops was limited. There was a shortage of teaching aids and facili-
ties such as reference materials, particularly in Bahasa Malaysia, laboratory
apparatus including instruments, equipment and laboratory attendants and tech-
nicians. A reduction in class size where the student population was large and
an increase in the provision of in-service training opportunities would
enhance the quality of teaching.
6.45      Technical Assistance.  Under the specialist service program, the
services of four specialists have been obtained (for a total of 22.5 months).
Two of the specialists were responsible for drawing up the list of equipment
for the ITIs while the remaining two served as consultants in the area of
equipment evaluation.
6.46      From 1981 to 1983, 21 instructors were selected for training
overseas under the technical assistance program. Of these, 19 have returned
to teach in the ITIs. One has been transferred from the ITI to the MOLM and
is presently involved in another industrial training project, and one has
resigned. The turnover of staff is generally low in the ITIs.
6.47      Perception of Employers.  Based on the responses of 39 employers,
more than a third of them indicated that both the pre-service and in-service
courses were relevant to industrials needs. However, some of them would
prefer a curriculum that gave more emphasis to practical work than theory.
Suggestions were also made that the NAS courses be reduced from a duration of
three to two years. The NAS program, originally of five years duration, had
in fact been reduced to four years prior to being further shortened to three
years beginning in 1982. It appears that the employers are feeling the
economic strain of sponsoring their employees for a three-year NAS program.
Furthermore, the employers seemed to Jive more emphasis to the importance of
acquiring knowledge and work experience through on-the-job training than a
systematized program in institutions like the ITIs. Thus some of the
employers suggested a longer period of on-the-job training and a shorter stay
at the institutes for the NAS trainees.
6.48      It was suggested that work ethics and their development could also
be included in the training program of the Ills. Its inclusion would enable
trainees to develop a sense of dedication and loyalty, work initiative and
appreciation, and inter-personal skills. Presently, aspects of work ethics
are touched upon only during orientation week.
6.49      A majority of the employers were satisfied with the ITI graduates in
relation to the traits which were assessed, such as cooperation and team

spirit, productivity, competency, responsibility and reliability. However,
less satisfaction was expressed with regard to the initiative shown by the
graduates.
6.50      Employment of Graduates.  In the tracer study, the rate of returns
(34%) to the questionnaires was rather disappointing and the data collected
would not lend themselves to generalizations concerning the total output of
the ITIs in Kuala Lumpur and Prai from 1978 to 1983. Nevertheless, some
patterns of graduate employment and unemployment could be drawn from the
responses.
6.51      Given the fact that the NAS graduates were employed by their
sponsors prior to admission into the ITIs, they were more readily absorbed
into gainful employment relative to the PTC graduates. Among the NAS
graduates, 88% were employed and only 9% were seeking employment. On the
other hand, about 36% of the PTC graduates were employed and 62% were recent
graduates still looking for jobs. Only 2% indicated that they were continuing
with further studies.
6.52      For both the PTC and NAS graduates who were employed, a majority of
them were working in the public sector (which requires less experience to
begin) as compared with the private sector. The waiting period prior to
employment for the PTC graduates was within one to three months (34%), between
four and six months (41%), from seven to eleven months (16%) and for more than
a year (9%).
6.53      In terms of salaries, about 15% of the PTC graduates earned between
M$200 and M$300 per month.  However, a majority of them (67%) received
salaries ranging from M$301 to M$400 which is realistic for employees with
these qualifications. Eleven 1>arcent of the PTC graduates obtained wages of
between M$401 and M$500, and 1% of them earned between M$501 and M$600. The
salaries received by NAS graduates were generally higher than those obtained
bv the PTC graduates. They ranged from M$301 and M$400 per month (26%) to
above M$1,000 (11%).
Conclusions
7.01      It appears that in spite of delays in the implementation and
completion of the four project components in the Fourth Education Project, the
objectives envisaged in the SAR have been substantially fulfilled. The
educational outcomes of the project are mainly positive: it has strengthened
the planning mechanisms for better allocation of educational resources,
improved the quality of primary schooling in seven disadvantaged states,
helped to meet the needs for primary school teachers particularly in Sarawak
through increasing pre-service training opportunities, expanded and streng-
thened in-service training with the establishment of education resource
centers, and increased the supply of skilled manpower necessary for industrial
development. However, there are important lessons to be learned for the
implementation of future education projects in Malaysia.



- 28 -
7.02      One of the most salient features of the Fourth Education Project's
implementation has been the considerable length of time taken to complete the
project components. Time overrun for the project items ranged from 18 months
for the ITI in Prai to 66 months for the SERC in Trengganu. Although the
project commenced in January 1976, many of the institutions within the project
components - Kampong Nanka Primary School, Trengganu, ITIs, Labuan and Kuala
Trengganut and SERC, Trengganu - were fully operational only between 1984 and
1985, representing a delay of over five years from the appraisal schedule.
7.03      The delays in implementation occurred at all stages - in land
acquisition, site development, construction and procurement and supply of
furniture and equipment. One of the main problems in construction was the
award of contracts to contractors who lacked the necessary skills, experience
and resources to complete the project. Another problem was the lack of close
supervision of contractors and their work by the staff of the PWD. This is
clearly seen in the construction program of primary schools. Due to the large
number of schools to be constructed, both under this project and through
direct funding, and the remoteness of school locations, close supervision of
contractors by the PWDs was not always possible. This resulted in poor
quality workmanship, use of low quality materials, and delays in completion of
construction. Upon occupying the premises of the primary schools, the STTC,
Miri! the SERrs or the ITIs! complaints made by the clientele included roof
leakage, plumbing problems, cracked walls and floors, rusting window frames,
breakdown of equipment and gadgets, poor turfing, waterlogged playing fields,
and poor electrical installations. Furthermore, time taken to rectify these
defects was usually considerable with delays by both PWD and the contractors.
7.04      These delays have produced adverse effects.  In particular,
inflation has increased costs for some project components substantially.
Commitment charges on the loan were also substantial. In educational terms,
the delays also slowed down the capacity of the project institutions in
relation to enrollment and out.ut targets envisaged in the SAR. With regard
to educational outcomes, assessment at a stage when the project items have
only been fully operational between 1984 and 1985 must necessarily be fairly
limited in scope.
7.05      There is generally the need to maintain closer collaboration and
cooperation among all the state institutions involved in the implementation of
the project. From the viewpoint of central administration - more at che MOE
than the MOLM - the involvement of the considerable number of divisions,
departments and units at the state, division and district levels in the
project created a rather complex situation which, at times, hindered its effi-
ciency in monitoring the progress of the project and in maintaining an up-to-
date record of project costs.
7e06      This lack of close collaboration among state institutions and
cooperation among these bodies and the central administration, together with
the manual system of information storage and retrieval at the DSD and DU, have
contributed largely to the difficulties experienced by the PCR team in piecing
together information about the implementation of the project components in
their early stages and the analysis and finalization of project costs.



- 29 -
7.07      The positive effects of the technical assistance program can be
further enhanced. It is not only necessary to ensure that officers are sent
for overseas courses and training which are relevant to the needs of the
project items but also that these courses are scheduled at appropriate times
so that skills learned can be applied immediately in the planning and imple-
mentation of education projects. The deployment of staff trained under this
program to other units, even if these are within the MOE and MOLM, will only
reduce the potentialities and impact of technical assistance programs.
7.08      Generally, there is a need to ensure that furniture and equipment
procured and supplied will meet the criteria of adequacy in terms of numbers
and quality, and suitability as well. Furthermore, there is a need to
establish adequate library collections if institutions within the project are
to contribute effectively towards quality education and training programs.
Lessons Learned
7.09      Delays in implementation resulted in escalated costs, some being
more than d,ubled compared with appr.isal estimates. This calls for efforts
on the part ot L.e relevant authorities to solve the problem of delays in the
implementation and completion of education and training projects of this kind
so as to reduce costs and achieve greater cost effectiveness.
7.10      There is the need to maintain close consultation and coordination
among officers of the PWDs, MOE and MOLM and the institutions within the
project so that defects and shortcomings in building designs, construction and
the supply of furniture and equipment are minimized. The computerization of
the information storage and retrieval system within the DSD and the DU should
ensure greater effectiveness in the allocation and use of funds, together with
better monitoring of the physical and financial progress of project components.
7.11      Efforts are to be made to ensure that fellows are deployed to work
in the areas in which they received training under the technical assistance
program.
7.12      It is to be emphasized that being aware of the lessons learned from
a report of this nature merely represents a first step. The next step
requires the dissemination of the lessons learned and, more importantly, the
implementation of decisions arising from a review of the PCR with the aim of
improving management and monitoring processes, and enhancing the outcomes of
education and training projects in the future.
OBSERVATIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED BY THE BANK
Observations
8.01      The project in general achieved its overall objectives, albeit
slowly. Certainly more and better facilities have been provided for primary
school children and it is particularly gratifying that the Government at all
levels made an effort to reach those children in the more remote areas, as was
intended. Serious overcrowding at the primary level has also begun to be



- 30 -
relieved under the project. The PCR also claims that the project helped to
establisn in the MOE and the SEDs systematic procedures for school mapping and
implementation of school construction (para. 6.01). This, in fact, is the
case as evidenced by the quality of the preparataion work done for the
proposed Primary and Secondary Education Sector Project which will be the
Bank's eighth education project in Malaysia and is similar to this project.
There, all school locations have been identified by the MOE and SEDs long
before the scheduled date of negotiations, and site acquisition commenced
early so that construction can begin ev a before Loan signing.
8.02      The STTC at Miri is swinging into full operation and has a complete
program set up for training primary and lower secondary teachers although the
latter was not anticipated at appraisal. Similarly, the ITIs are well
underway and are beginning to train skilled workers in the numbers envisaged.
8.03      The SERCs are also on their way to becoming a success although here
they have taken on a different orientation from that envisaged. Originally
they were planned only to provide in-service teacher training, mainly for
primary teachers in the states in which they are located. Now their role has
expanded to include, along with limited in-service training, the provision of
a variety of services for teachers, carrying out research, their acting as a
vehicle for decentralizing MOE educational activities and coordination of
professional activities for the teachers in the state. This reorientation
apparently came about because their purpose was not clearly thought out at
appraisal and the fact that by the time they became functional, in-service
teacher upgrading of the type planned to be given by them was already
available elsewhere in the system. They seem to be responding, however, to
previously unidentified needs of the teachers and even of the students.
8.04      Of course, as pointed out in the PCR, there were long delays in
implementation of this project, mostly due to its scattered nature with
several government agencies in all states and hundreds of small contractors
involved. The original schedule drawn up at appraisal wai obviously not very
realistic.
8.05      That total project costs did not escalate accordingly is unusual and
was due to the fact that the primary school component, by far the largest,
came in slightly below appraisal estimates. All the other components showed
cost increases. Due to the peculiar nature of the primary school component,
involving as it did 850 new or extended ptimary schools, costs would have been
difficult to determine and were evidently overestimated at appraisal. The
design and construction faulLS mentioned can probably be laid partly at PWD's
door, where lack of skilled staff led to poor design in some cases and to
limited supervision of the construction, and at the doors of the small local
contractors who in many cases were relatively inexperienced.
8.06      Equipment and furniture procurement problems can be attributed
largely to staff turnovers, lack of staff knowledgeable in the types of equip-
ment needed for the project institutions and lack of organization in the
Supplies Unit of the DSD and in the DU. Perhaps early in the project, Bank
missions explained the Bank's procurement procedures to the Supplies Unit and
the DU but by completion this knowledge had been badly distorted or completely



- 31 -
lost due to continual staff turnover. In another instance, when an accountant
was finally appointed to the DU, no one explained to him for two years of the
need to submit withdrawal applications to the Bank.
8.07      In fact, staff shortages in general plagued both the DSD and the DU
early in the project and the DU was never really fully staffed during the
project implementation period with professionals who could devote their full
attention to the project.
8.08      Another problem was the badly timned fellowship program with fellows
returning from their training to find that ao job was awaiting them, due to
the lengthy implementation delays. Naturally, they sought out or were shunted
into other positions where they could be of use. A developing country cannot
afford to let trained personnel sit around and wait.
Lessons Learned by the Bank
8.09      Several branches of the Government and the Bank learned lessons from
this project and all have acted on them in the projects that have followed
this one. As mentioned above (para. 8.01), the process of site selection and
acquisition are commencing well ahead of recent project processing and the DSD
is maintaining a firm hand in this process. PWDs at all levels are also
trying to implement the projects in a more orderly fashion. The Bank is
taking care to review building schedules of accomniodation and designs and
equipment lists and specifications to help in spotting defects.
8.10      The Bank has also insisted that sufficient skilled staff be
appointed to implement the projects, in a recent case (the Second Industrial
Training Project, Loan 2601-MA) even making it a condition of effectiveness,
and has taken pains to go over procurement procedures with the staff
involved. The latter process should be repeated at least yearly over the life
of the project with involved staff in all ministries. The Government in turn
is making an effort to assign returned fellowship holders to the jobs for
which they were trained.
8.11      Another lesson learned that has not arisen recently in projects is
the need to do a more thorough analysis of their purposes when setting up new
types of institutions. A thorough analysis was not done for the SERCs in tlhis
project, and while the outcome was fortunate in this case, in future if not
done, it could lead to a serious waste of the Government's scarce resources.
