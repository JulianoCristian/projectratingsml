It is\n            impossible to rate the project since some activities have\n            not been completed because of the sanctions imposed on\n            Yugoslavia by the United Nations Security Council. The\n            project components in Vojvodina were financed separately by\n            a loan in the amount of US$35.0 million. Of this amount,\n            US$2.6 million was cancelled in 1992 while US$32.4 million\n            had been disbursed. After mid-1991, some project components\n            became progressively delayed due to hostilities between the\n            Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia\n            so that not all the objectives of the project were reached.\n            The composition of the project remained very much as\n            designed at appraisal. All amendments prompted by technical\n            reasons were made in full agreement between the Bank and the\n            Borrower. However, contacts with the Borrower became\n            sporadic after 1990 as a result of sanctions. Following the\n            United Nations sanctions against Yugoslavia, the\n            Borrower's special project account was blocked,\n            delaying final payments for essential material."}, "docdt": "1997-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
