activities in the Socialist Republics of Croatia and\n            Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Socialist Autonomous Province\n            of Vojvodina. Its objective is to assist in the development\n            of indigenous energy resources, thereby reducing\n            Yugoslavia's dependence on imported energy. The project\n            comprises support for a time slice of the gas exploration\n            programs for INA-Naftaplin, Nafta-Gas and EXPL through: (i)\n            the expansion of exploration activities to the more complex\n            and deeper areas that hold the potential for increasing the\n            country's future recoverable reserves of hydrocarbons;\n            (ii) the acceleration of exploration activity in Yugoslavia\n            by promoting to international petroleum companies\n            exploration areas that are prospective but are\n            insufficiently explored due to the inadequate resources of\n            the local companies; (iii) the strengthening of the\n            technical capabilities of Yugoslav petroleum companies to\n            develop gas reserves under high pressure and temperature,\n            and containing corrosive gases; and (iv) the introduction of\n            an underground gas storage system to reduce problems related\n            to seasonal demand for gas."}, "docdt": "1985-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
