project are:\n            (a) to strengthen and reform the student loan program; (b)\n            to improve the level of professional, technical and\n            managerial skills in both the private and public sectors;\n            and (c) to strengthen the policy research on human capital\n            and higher education issues in order to provide a solid base\n            for future reforms in higher education finance management.\n            Within the student loan component, the project will finance\n            institutionally-sponsored student loans to support\n            management development in key institutions, covering higher\n            level human resource development for both the public and\n            private sectors.  Another component is to promote and\n            support the development of high caliber professionals for\n            Venezuela's socio-economic development.  The project\n            will also support operational and policy studies that will\n            feed into the dialogue on improving the finance and\n            efficiency of higher education."}, "docdt": "1992-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
