The project did achieve many of its targets, but\n            failed to meet its overall development objectives. Poor\n            quality at entry, including weak project rationale, poor\n            potential impact assessment, no counterfactual\n            consideration, decisions made due to poor or contradictory\n            data, not addressing incongruent policies, unrealistic risk\n            assessment, poor matching of resources to tasks, as well as\n            poor resource allocation among components, led to the\n            unsatisfactory rating. Lessons learned include: carefully\n            weigh rationale for undertaking project against other\n            alternatives; draw on previous country and sector experience\n            as well as similar projects; propose realistic objectives\n            and components; substantiate project objectives by baseline\n            economic data; use long-term impact performance indicators;\n            contemplate various scenarios in project funding; improve\n            financial management and reporting prior to lending for\n            student loan projects; include a financial specialist;\n            carefully evaluate and monitor project risks; be flexible to\n            adjustments in components and legal agreements; scrutinize\n            institutional structure to maximize performance; and that\n            lack of continuity in management leads to a loss of\n            institutional memory and in turn affects implementation,\n            outputs, and outcomes."}, "docdt": "2000-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
