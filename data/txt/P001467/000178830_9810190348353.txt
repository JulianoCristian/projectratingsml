i.        The Government of the Malagasy Republic has asked IDA to help
finance the completion of National Road No. 4, (602 km.) linking Tananarive,
the capital, to Majunga, the country's second port.
ii.       T'he project consists of the reconstruction and asphalt paving of
two road sections presently totaling 1L60 km.; these sections are narrow,
gravel paved, have sharp curves and s-teep grades.  Virtually all other sec-
tions of the road have already been imaproved or reconstructed and asphalt
paved. The project; also includes the final engineering, including a review
of the economic justification, of a 13 km. road section as an alternative to
28 km of existing roads.
iii.      The cost of the proiect is estimated at about US$12.8 million
equivalent., including engineering and contingencies. The construction cost
estimate is based on the final engineering of the nroiect.   The foreign ex-
change component is estimated in the range of 68 to 78 percent depending
on whether a foreign contractor or a .10CJ11 qifhqilary of' a foreign firm gets
the award. The Government is financing from its own funds about one-third
of the i964-68 total highway praoorn-m sinc-e thiss    hee v  burden on the
national budget, it is recommended that IDA finance 78 percent (US$10 million
equiivalent) o-f the to+al        ^^a+ cos+.  rrfl Grm'nmyna  should be able to
cover the remaining 22 percent from its own budget.
iv.       The fina:L design of the road has been prepared by the Highway
A-1 - is -a t ion s t affIt -a,unde-r the1-I I ~ULY  UJL_ ;V ViiX  of Publi  Wok, assisted by engi--
neer-ing consultants.  All contracts for construction will be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding.   Execution of the proJect wLll
be the res-ponsibility of the Ministry of Public Works. Supervision of con-
struction will be performed by the Highway Administration with the assit-
ance of consultants if necessary. The final engineering of the 13 km a:Lter-
nate roaUd section will be carried out by Con5Uitan U      sa  i UUaLty tU IDA.
v.       .'dlignway inaintenance is adequately staiied, but insuIlicilent 1fuuds
are devoted to maintenance purposes. The Government has agreed to increase
appropriations for road maintenance in the light of the recommendations of
a study recently being carried out by consultants.
vi.       The project has high priority in the Government's highway program.
Reconstruction of the road wrill sharply reduce transport costs.  The ra:te o17
economic return on the investment from savings in transport and maintenance
costs is about 11 :percent, which is satisfactory.  Developmental benefits
are also expected from the project.
vii.      The project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit in the
amount of US$10 million equivalent.

APPRAISAL OF A HIGWEAY RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        The Government of the Malagasy Republic submitted in 1964 an applica-
tion to IDA to help finance (1) the reconstruction of two sections of the
Tananarive-Majunga road and (2) additional projects related to this road
(pavement repairs, access roads, a wharf). The Government's application,
supported by a feasibility study, was prepared in accordance with the recom-
mendations of a Bank/IDA economic mission which visited Madagascar in July
1964. An IDA appraisal mission visited Madagascar in January-February 1965
and found the reconstruction nroiect of' the two sections of the Tananarive-
Majunga road ready for appraisal and suitable for financing.   However, in
order to confirm the cost estimatpe anc'l also to avoid an unnecessary lapse
of time between the signature of the loan and the start of construction,
it was agresd to hn-vp finRl engineerino dlesigrn compnletprl hpf'orp nr'vlit re.0n-
tiations. The final design was completed in November 1965.
2.        This appraisal report is based on the engineering and economic
studies of the pronect carried ou+ by the Highway Administration staff^ unrer
the Ministry of Public Works, assisted by engineering consultants, and on
the finrdings  f +the IDA appraisal misson consisting of Messrs. Soges and
Park.
3.        This would be the first lending operation by the Bank or IDA in
M111a dagasca.
I. _LBACKGRCVUu'ND
A. 'eneLa'
4.        Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, 250 miles off the
southeast coast of Africa.  It is the fourth largest island in the world,
with an area of 228,000 square miles (592,000 square kilometers), as large
as France and the Benelux countries combined. It has a population of six
million, wnich is growing rapidly at an. average rate of 2.6 percent per
year.
5.        The last survey, made by the Government in 1962, estimated Mada-
gascarts gross domestic product at FNG 147 billion (US$595 million equi-
valent). There has 'been little increase in the real gross domestic pro-
duct in recent years. The transport sector accounted for about 6 percent
of Madagascar's gross domestic product in 1953; this rate has been increas-
ing slowly, and it is presently about 9 percent, which indicates that the
transport system is expanding but from a low level. The per capita income
is about US$105 equivalent per year.



6.        The geographical configuration of Madagascar shows four distinct
regions:  the Western coastal plains, the high plateau in the center of
the island, the escarpment of the eastern shore, and the isolated northern
area. The climate is semi-tropical with heavy rainfall aggravated periodi-
cally by cyclones. The whole island offers rugged terrain, crossed by many
flooding rivers and streams. Natural road construction materials are scarce.
All these f'eatures make construction and maintenance of a road network diffi--
cult and expensive and thus have hindered the country's economic develop-
ment.
B. Transport in Madagascar
7.        M'adagascar has four railway lines totaling 860 km. in length,
all concentrated in the middle part of' the island between the central pla-
teau and the eastern coast. The railways are government-owned and operated
by the "Regie Nationale des Chemins de Fer Malgachesf?, a public corpora-
tion. The most important line, which carries about three-auarters of the
railway traffic is between the capital. city of Tananarive and Tamatave on
the east coast, the countrv's largest and most important port.  The lines
serve only a limited area of Madagascar and contribute little to the in-
ternal exehange between the variolus rePi onns of the island (see map).
8.        The si 7.e of the conuntrv nnd the isolation Of vari ous regions result-
ing f'rom the lack cf a good integrated highway network make passenger air
transport important.  The internal air servrice is primarily provi:ded bhv
Air Madagascar which operates DC4 and smaller airplanes. Fifty-two communi-

cyclones which prevent the use of small ships and make coastal navigaticin
more UfLiIcult. Co,astdal ntavrigatiOn aUCCUUlts L  Uforoe-tirdU of Uth UtIrafic
of the ports, the rest being foreign trade.
10.       E[ighway transport has expandled rapidly in the last ten years but
is still relatively undeveloped. The motor vehicle fleet has more than
doubled between 19'55 and 1964 which represents an increase of about 9 per-
cent per year (see Table 1). Most of the trucks are diesel-powered and
since diesel fuel consumption expande(d even more rapidly (see Table 2),
the rate of growth of freight volume was presumably also higher.   Of the
vehicle fleet, more than 40 percent are trucks and 4 percent are buses.
The trend toward the use of heavier trucks is limited only by present road
conditions. M4any of the heavier trucks are new, and the general condition
of the fleet is good.



1:L.      Only about one-fifth of the commercial vehicles are owned by public
carrier c0mpanies; the rest of the industry is made up by small oner=opera=
tors who seldom have more than one vehicle. The issuing of public trans-
port licenses i4s not re stric --- -te .  .Lost _     .P the   Jls directed toward
the central plateau, resulting in an umbalanced load factor. The Govern-
ment plans to enrhance transport by enrouraging tle grouping of small carriers
into more efficient units, the use of larger vehicles, and the institution
of a proper tariLf sysemL.
12.       Trhe Government is also studying the ways and means to ensure proper
coordination between sea-going ships and coastal ships, between coastal
ships and road and rail, and between road and rail. For instance, Tana-
narive and the impcortant port of Tamatave on the eastern shore are linked
by a railroad and a low standard grave!l road. Instead of improving the
road to make it suitable for large trucks, the Government has restricted
since 1961 the weight of vehicles to 2.5T on this road, recognizing that
presently the railway can more economically meet traffic needs on this route.
Also, the Government is studying the feasibility of reducing the number
of international sea-ports, since some of them are inadequate and costly
to operate; these ports would be maintained for coastal navigation and the
available funds would be concentrated for the development of the four major
international seapcrts at Tamatave, Majunga, Tulear and Diego-Suarez.
C. T'he Highway System
13.       T'he present basic road network already existed in 1950. As shown
belowr, it comprises about 30,000 km. of roads of which only about 12,300
km. are all-weather type. The primary roads connect major towns, and link
the central plateau with the coastal lands; the secondary and tertiary roads
connect remote villages to the primary roads.

are not connected with the rest of the island by all-weather roads.  Align-
ment, pavement (where it exists) and structures are often obsolete, and
the design standards and the load capacity of structures are rarely uni-
form from one part of a road to another. In general, the present road system
is inadequate to provide economic trarnsportation and to cope with increas-
ing traffic: needs.
D. Administration of Highways
15.       General administration of the highway system comes under the
Ministry of Public Works and Transporlt; (Ministere de l'Equipement et des
Transports). Within the Ministry, services in charge of highway construc-
tion and maintenance are under the Director General of Public Works and Aero-
nautics. FHighway administration services under the Director General comprise
the Service! of Economic and Financial Studies, the Central Technical Service,
the Directorate of National Highways, the Public Works Service and the Public
Works Laboratory. The functions of thiese services are described in the follow-
ing paragraph. The organization chart; of the Highway Administration is shown
in the Annex.
16.       E'on.^mie qtmdi-q for transport. investment, coordinartion end
operation are the task of the Service of Economic and Financial Studies.
The Servief! works in close coration wi.th the Planning Council, on
inter-ministerial planning body which prepares the long-term national
programs for economic development. The C'entral Technical Service, assisted
by the Publ.ic Works Laboratory, carries out engineering studies and design,
adminirsters bidding; and awarding, and superv-.-s constructlon of 1,igh.!a
projects. The Directorate of National Highways is in charge of the mainte-

posts are increasingly being Illed by nationals as they acq-uire education
and experience. Fcor higher education., nationals enroll at foreign univer-
sities. Intermediate level professionial education is provided in Tanan.rive;
operators and other skilled labor are also trained in the country.
18.       The present technical staff is competent and able to perform eLde-
quately all. the fun,ctions necessary to the planning, execution and adminis-
tration of an efficient highway systera. Under the present scheme, the staff
has prepared the final design of a part of the project road, and consult-
ants have been engaged to help prepare the rest; the staff should be able
to carry otut adequately the awarding and the supervision of construction.
Expatriate staff is now provided umder French Technical Assistance and there



is no sign that this would be discontinued in the foreseeable future.
Nevertheless, during negotiations the Government agreed that consultants
satisfactory to IDA will be engaged for^ the supervision of construction
in case it should appear that the Highway Administration cannot continue
to perform this duty to the satisfaction of IDA until the completion of
the project.
19.       Contractors are generally used for construction and for periodic
maintenance of roads. Contracts are usual'y awarded on the basis of compet-
itive bidding. Work; specifications arie precisely defined, and administrative
procedures are well established.  Standard snenifications for bridges and,
road construction were recently revised in the light of the latest tech-
nical develonments. Road Regulations (Gode de la Route) are detailed and.
are effectively enforced by the highway police. Drivers' education was
found to be exe-ellent

in level terrain), with comparati-vely high load capacity of the pavement
and structures. These design standards are deemed to be adequate for the
two decades to come which cover the economic life of the investments now
being made.
F. Road Construction Industry
21.       In 1963 the turnover of road contractors was FM4G 1.7 billion (lJS$7
million equivalent).  The principal contractors are subsidiaries of large
European firms; their number has increased in recent years. The Govern-
ment anticipates that road construction activity will rise to about FiVG
6.2 billion (US$25 million equivalent) in 1968. No difficulty is antici-
pated in getting appropriate contractors to carry out such a program.
G. Highway Maintenance
22.       MTaintenance of the primary roads is the responsibility of the
Directorate of National Highways, under the Ministry of Public Works. The
Directorate has central offices in Tananarive, and regional services compris-
ing six districts further subdivided into 26 subdivisions. The activity
of the Directorate is limited primarily to routine maintenance. Resurfacing
of roads and other major repairs are usually carried out by contractors
under the supervision of the Central Technical Service. The provincial
and municipal roads are maintained by the local administrative authorities
assisted by the Public Works Service.



23.       Road maintenance is partially mechanized.   Forty mechanized mainte-
nance units are in operation; the Directorate plans to increase their number
to 90. The central equipment shop and warehouse facilities, located in
Tananarive, are efficiently managed. Equipment maintenance and repair facil-
ities also exist outside Tananarive. Major repairs sometimes are let to
private shops. The inventory of the equipment is estimated at FMG 800 mil-
lion; however, allocations in recent years for renewal amounted only to
FMG 80 million, which is not sufficient.
24.       Consultants are carrying out under French aid (FAC) a comprehensive
highway maintenance study to advise on maintenance methods, equipment andi
management and to determine maintenance costs. In the framework of the
study, pilot maintenance districts are being organized.   The first conclil-
sions of the study are expected to be available by the end of 1966.
25.       The Highway Administration is adequately staffed for highway mainte-
nance. However- maintenancn iR 6till unqatfsfraetorv due to insufficient
budgetary appropriations. The average amount allocated to and spent on
the nrimarv roads in rerent years was FMr. Q95000 or !ess per km. and ner
year (US$380 equivalent, see Table 3). This is barely sufficient, parti-
clilnr1v since physical nn1 nnei nlimnt1i- eo ndi tions make regular road mainte-
nance expensive and exceptional repairs are required -or cyclones. As a
resul+t, earth and gravel roads are losing  at+erial, nnd bitulmrinous surfaces
are deteriorating. The Ministry of Public Works is advocating that prior-

by cons-ultants and Ut u istent with the extension of the highway systemU and
with *the growth of traffic.
H.  Highway Expenditures and Road User Taxes
26.       As shown in Table 3, annual highway expenditures have been stead-
ily inureasing in the past 15 years, irom an estimated FMvG 80 million in
1950 to about FMG 5,000 million in 1964. This is equivalent to an aver-
age increase of 7 percent per year, after adjustment for general price in-
creases. New construction accounts for about two-thirds of the expendi-
tures; slightly more than half of new construction was financed from for-
eign loans and grants. Highway expenditures have been equivalent recently
to about 16 percent of the national budget which appears high and reflects
the fact that highway construction and modernization started only recently
on a larger scale.
27.       The receipts from road users are made up of numerous duties and
taxes placed on motor vehicle ownership and operation. Taxes are lower
on commercial vehicles than on vehicles for private use. The tax on diesel



- I -
fuel, which is mostly used by trucks and buses, is only FMG 11.30 per liter
as compared with FM;G 22.6 per liter of gasoline for passenger cars. A
study has shown that in 1963 revenues from highway user charges covered
about 60 percent of the highway expenditures (administration, maintenance
and capital outlay).  While this is on the low side, it is still not unrea-
sonable, considering the relatively small fleet compared to the length of
the highway network, and the fact that in this early stage of expansion
of the highway system annual highway investments exceed annual highway costs
as measured by depreciation and interest on total highway investments. The
Government is studying taxation schemes *to better balance revenues from
road users with highway expenditures.
I.  Plan of Year 2000 and the Five-Year Development Plan
28.       A comprehensive transportation study was carried out in 1961 by
consultants in close cooperation with the Commissary General of the Plan
and the Highway Administration in order to formulate a long-term highway
investment plan. The program, called also "Plan of Year 2000", is derilved
from the need to connect production and development zones, and population
centers, through an integrated highway system.   Under this program, the
length of the primary road network would be increased to 12,400 km. (or

About three-quarters of the program (about FMG 17.9 billion) is expected
to be completed during the period and FMG 5.3 billion wi-l have to be carried
out after 1968. On the other hand, some of the works started previously
and not achieved by 1964 are now being executed. The actual volume of works
to be carried out during 1964-1968 is, therefore, estimated as follows (in
FMG billion):

31.       The part of highway expendit.ures to be financed by the Govern-
ment will accrue from the receipt of fuel taxes earmarked to the "Fonds
d'Investissements Routiers" (FIR), which is a sub-item of the FNDE, as well
as from other funds appropriated in the FNDE. A large part of foreign fi-
nance has elreadv been secured and the bs.lance, including the IDA contri-
bution, is expected. to be obtained.
32.       T'he above program, prepared before 1964, was discussed with the
Government. The cost of the individual projects appears to be generally
underestimated.  If roads were constructed or improved to standards ade-
quate to ser,re the present and future traffic economically, the actual cost
of the program would be substantially higher than estimated in the plan.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Description
33.       T'he project consists of:  (:L) the reconstruction and asphalt pav-
ing of two sections between kilometer point 165 and Andramy, presently tiotal-
ing 1.60 km.., of the National Road No. 4 (602 km.), linking Tananarive (popula-
tion 250,0()O), capital city, to Majunga (population 35,000), the largest
town on the westerrL coast of the island, and also the country's second largest
port and principal coastal trade port, ald (2) the final engineering, irn-
eluding a review of the economic justification, of the presently abandoned
alternate section of 13 km. of the same road between Andramy and Boinakely
and of the bridge over the Betsiboka River at Boinakely. The project road
sections w.ill also be part of the planned arterial highway from Tananarive



- Q) 
to Diego-Suarez on the northern end of the island (see map). No compet-
ing modes of transportation exist or can be anticipated along the project
road sections.
34.       The Tananarive-Majunga road was originally built before 1914 and
since then it has been gradually improved. Since World War II, all the
road, except the cc,nstruction project sections and 10 km. of the present
road from Amdramy toward the BetsibokEa River, has been asphalt paved. Sev-
eral structures on the project sections are now being reconstructed under
a grant by the Fond Europeen de Developpement (for about US$0.57 million
equivalent)l/.  Directly related to the project road is also   the current
construction of the branch road from the Kamoro River to Port Berge, esti-
mated at DIMl 34 million (US$8.5 million equivalent), of which DM 32 million
is financed by a loan from the Federal Republic of Germany (see map).
35.       T'he sections of the road included in the construction project
are present1y narrow. winding. gravel naved. with sharp curves and steep
gradients.  Many structures are obsolete and dangerous.   Slides and ero-
sions often bar the road.  These roa-. seetions will be reconstructed as
a two-lane asphalt paved modern highway. Numerous realignments and relo-
cations wi:Ll reduce the length off the ronmtritinn proett seetions froni
160 in. to 145 km. The alternate section, for which the detailed engineering
and +he reiew of tihe economic ustiflcatlon is included in the proripf-t-
would reduce by 15 km. the distance between Andramy and Boinakely, which
is neor 28 k.nn  The crossing o  t-he Be+tsiboka  River by the present route
is an old bridge which was seriously damaged by a cyclone; two large spans
on the app-roaches have been replaced by Bailey trusse-   The shor=cu   would
require th(e construction of a large new bridge, which still requires a fur-

37.       The construction project generally follows the design standards
recently adopted by the Ministry of Public Works for the primary road system.
The standards are satisfactory (see Table 4). Design speeds range from
40 km/h in mountainous terrain to 65 km/h in rolling terrain. The maxi-
mum grades will be 8 percent.   The pavement, ai asphalt carpet with an aggre-
gate base on a stabilized soil foundation, is designed for heavy trucks
in a country subject to heavy tropical rains and cyclones.   Because of thae
large size of the trucks being or to be used, the pavement width in the
project was increased from 5.50 m., which was initially envisaged by the
Ministry, to 6.00 m. Bridges and other structures are designed in accord-
ance with the "Cahier des Prescriptions Communes" based on the French General
Specifications and adopted for the whcole primary road system in Madagascar.
On the basis of traffic forecasts discussed in paragraph 50, the road will
have adequate geometric design to acccmmodate future traffic for more than
20 years after its completion.
C. Execlution
38.       Execution of the project will be the responsibility of the Minis-
try of Public Works. The Central Technical Service, assisted by the Public
Works Laboratoryr, will be in charge of administering the pro4ect and super-
vising construction. Construction will be carried out under unit price
contracts awtarded on the basis of international compettve biddilng.   Con-
sultants satisfactory to IDA will be employed for the final design and the
review- of the ec-_onomi_.J c 4ustificOation o±f th'Ile 1,-3X  x ai. alternate road sectiorl.
between Andramy and Boinakely, including the bridge over the Betsiboka River

39 *      Blds for construction can be called for immediately- after the
signature of the credit agreement, and it is anticipated that constrUctiorn
would start in 1966 and be completed in 1969.
40.       Construction work will have to be mechanized to a large extent.
The completion schedules and the quality standards of the work make neces-
sar-y the extensive use of heavy equipment. Unemployment is not a problemn
in Madagascar, and the road crosses areas where population is relatively
scarce and where, during some periods of the year, even the recruitment
of the minimum labor force is difficult.
D. Cost Estimate and Financing
41.       The cost estimate of the project is summarized as follows:

3,170          12.80
The construction cost estimates include a built-in allowance of 10 percent
for quantity contingencies.  An additional contingency of about 1f.5 per-
cent has been included for possible price increases over the four year period
of execution.
42.       The quantity estimates are based on final design.  Unit prices
were developed from applicable prices on similar works recently carried
out in Madagascar and also from cost analyses. Unit prices were determined
on the assimption that no taxes and custom duties will be applied on equip-
ment and oni the principal imported materials incorporated into the proj-.
ect (bitumen, steel, cement, explosives). This is common practice in Mada-
gascar and will be applied to the project. The foreign component in the
project cost is estimated to renge between 68 and 78% depending on whether
a foreign contractcor or a local subsidliary of a foreign firm gets the award.
The foreigna exchange component includes depreciation of equipment, imported
materials, fuels, and spare parts, and foreign personnel and overhead. The
local cost component includes mainly labor, and about 10 percent of the
total cost for taxes other than income tax (import duties on fuel, sales
taxes, etc.).
43.       In the pteriod 1964-68, the Government is financing from its owTn
funds about one-third of the total highway program, that is to say, about
FMG 7.4 billion (US$30 million equivalent). Since this is a heavy drain
on the national bud.get, it is recommended that IDA finance 78 percent of
the total :proJect cost in which case IDA participation would amount to IJS$10
million. During negotiations assurance was obtained that the Government
will cover the remaining 22 nercent of the total nroiect cost from its own
budget.

IV.  ECONOMIC JUSvTIFICATIONT
A. General
44.       The 602 In. National Road No. 4 linking Tananarive to Majunga
is one of the most important trunk roads in Madagascar. The Port of Ma-
junga handles about; 250,000 tons oL cargc) a year and a large part of the
cargo is distributed to the interior of the country. For this traffic,
National Road No. 4 is the only access to the interior. The river trans-
port, practiced until about 1950 over the Ikopa River up to Maevatanana,
has become impossible because of the shallow depth of the river due to silta-
tion.
45.       The road traverses important agricultural regions with an area
of 45.000 km2 and e population of 380.000.    The zone of influence of the
road extends to Port Berge and Antisohihy to the north by National Road
No. 6 which branches out from the road at the Kamoro River. Including the
area served indirectly by Road No. 6, the land area within the zone of influ-
ence of the! rnad is rover 75,000 km27 with a popunation of ahout a half mil-
lion. About a quarter of a million people in Tananarive and the surround-
ina high ralntpaii are als o __rrv-l hyr tfhi vr)d.  Rice, grouind nuts- tobacco
and sugar are the main agricultural products from the region.
46.       The development of agriculture in the area, however, would re-
q___ provision of feeder    od,arc+rleteso                 evcs       ria
tion and flood control, etc. While the need for these investments for agri-
Cul 1t u1r _a d.evlp n  is robvious, the -extent  owihteG-vrmn          ol
have to carry out developmental investments for the area cannot be deter-

47.     The deteriorated condifon c,f the 10=.proj'ec' sectin'        r
a bottleneck for the through traffic between Tananarive and Majunga. Al-
though the other sections of the NfatinEal Road vo. 4L are IL1 satisfac -ory
condition as a result of the improvements undertaken in the past, traffic
inrterruption occurs frequently on tne project section, particularly dur-
ing the rainy season, and because of this the use of trucks larger than
5-ton carrying capacity is impractical at the present time although a consid-
erable part of the goods moved over the road are bulk commodities such as
cement and refined sugar wnicn can be carried more economically by larger
vehicles.
48.       The immediate benefits from the improvement of the project sec-
tion, therefore, would be the reduced costs of vehicle operation on the
project section and the additional reduction in freight transport costs
resulting from the iexpected introduction of larger goods-carrying vehicles.



- 1:3 -
Needless to say, the latter type of benefit would be obtained on the total
distEnce of trip covered by the long-distance through traffic on the high-
way, and not merely on the project section only.
49.       A detailed study made by the Government showed that the present
cost of operating EL 5-ton truck is about FMG 53 (US$0.215) per km.  After
the improvement, the cost would be rediuced by nearly 40 percent to FMG ^-2
(US$0.130).  Moreover, it is conservatively estimated that in five years
after the completion of the project, about 20 percent of the freight traf-
fic, mainly cement and refined sugar, will be carried by 20-ton trailer-
trucks and 30 percent by 8-ton trucks., leaving only one-half of the total
volume to 5-ton trucks.
50.       Recent traffic counts conducted by the Government show a rel'a-
tively small traffic volume on the project sections:   30 trucks and 50 pas-
senger cars a day.  In contrast, there is a relatively high volume of traf-
fic, at present mainly local, on the impDroved road sections on either side
of the project section; it is thus clear that the bad condition of the uroj-
ect sections constitute a bottleneck for potential through traffic. How-
ever, even the 80 Nehicles a day on thle project section is four times the
1950 traffic volume; the main nart of the! increase has taken place since
the mid-1950's, when improvement of the National Road No. 4 was initiated.
It is therefore reasonable to a--iime that the traffie volume will continue
to increase (mainly by growth of local traffic) at about 10 percent per
annum until 1Q75; thereafter, the ra orf n inc        is msslm  toc taper off
to about 3 percent per annum toward 1990, the end of the assumed economic
life nf' the proposed investmen.t.  In addition to this norral trend of cri.roth,
the improvement of the project section will induce additional traffic by
facilitatFing A4rect transport between Tmnanar-lve and the coas+al plai-s
This induced traffic has been conserveatively assumed.to represent an addi-
+ion 1 15- percen.t per annua inres   -.4- 4the traffic4 or, 4the    --Jtsctlon
over a period of five years after completion.
51.       On the basis of the unit savings estimated on the traffic volume
assumed, the savings in vehicle operat;ing costs in the project section in
1970, the first year of operation of the improved project section, would
b.as flos

-  i 1  -
52.       I'he savings due to the introduction of larger vehicles may be
calculated by comparing the costs of carrying the estimated annual tonnage
of freight after the completion of' the improvement project by using 5-ton
trucks only and thcse by using larger capacity vehicles in tne proportion
indicated in paragraph 49. The calculation shown in Table 5 indicates an
annual saving of FIvIG 52.8 million for the year 1970.
53.       T'he improvement of the project road sections will produce sav-
ings in road maintenance costs. With the present traffic, costs necessEry
to properly maintain the existing unimproved road would exceed the esti-
mated maintenance costs for an improved road. The difference between the
maintenance costs f'or the unimproved road and the improved road would in-
crease with the expected growth of the traffic.   These savings, however,
represent only about 5 percent of the total berefits from the improvement.
54.       Applying these estimated annual savings in transportation costs
and road maintenance costs throughout the economic life of the project (20
years), the annual economic rate of return on the investment is about 11
percent.  In this estimate, the savingzs due to the introduction of larger
vehicles are taken into consideration starting five years after the comple-
tion of the prolect to allow for the time required for the changeover of
the vehicle fleet although there wouldl be some savings even during the transi-
tional period.  As indicated above; this estimate has been prepared on a
conserv&tive basis and the actual economic return should be somewhat higher.
C. Other Benefits
55.       [n addition, there will be other benefits which are not includled
in the Ahnvp cale:!aio-i+h in b   thycannnot b rliph eadptily hr  e  in mnne-
tary terms. The most important ones include savings in time for both pas-
senaers anric freight  The=        +"4-    +4-.l trip oc road  ctions t
about 4 1/2 hours for a passenger car, while on the rebuilt road this will
be reduced to abou-t 3 hours. The travel time for trucks over the pro-ect
section will be reduced from about 6-7 hours to only about 4 hours, which
will enable a truck to make the +   ietwreen T-narive and Ma4"-a easily
in one day, instead of necessitating a night stop as at present. The -trip
will~- bs be mu c1h. c mr e cofral,and the travel much more reliab-le.

V. CONCLUSIONS PAND _ECOM1ENDATIONS
57.       The project will greatly improve the conditions of road trans-
port on one of the most important highways in Madagascar. It is well plan-
ned, technically feasible and sound and will yield a satisfactory economic
return on the investment from lower transport costs alone. The Highway
Administration under the Ministry of Public Works will be able to execute
the project, with the help of consultants if necessary.
58.       The project constitutes a sui-table basis for an IDA credit in
a totnl amrouint of rtS$ 10 millior equivalent.
