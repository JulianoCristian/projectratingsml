MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Brazil
CHESF-FURNAS Power Transmission Project (Loan 2564-BR)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on the Brazil - CHESF-FURNAS Power
Transmission Project (Loan 2564-BR) prepared by the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional
Office. Part H contributed by the Borrower highlights the physical achievements of Brazil's growing
power sector and the positive performance of implementing agencies within the contraints of a
difficult policy environment.
This project was the last of a series of Bank loans made from the mid-1970s to 1985 to the
power sector in Brazil which emphasized financial rehabilitation and the funding of transmission and
distribution systems. The US$400 million loan approved on June 4, 1985, financed primarily the
increased transmission capacity in the areas served by two utilities, CHESF and FURNAS.
Additionally the project aimed at achieving fuel economies and higher system efficiency in the above
areas. A total of US$154.2 million was cancelled, a high percentage (38.6%) of the original loan
amount, although project cost increased 26.3% due to multiple revisions of scope.
Construction will continue through 1996; at loan closing about 60% of the physical
components were fully implemented after multiple changes, substitutions and delays. The key
objective of institution building was missed due to the failure by the government to carry out the
Financial Rehabilitation Plan. Due to the lack of timely tariff increases the rates of return on
operating assets are negative for both utilities. Optimistic assumptions on sales forecasts and project
ratings during supervision also contributed to the disappointing outcome. Most of the loan covenants
were not met.
Overail, the project outcome is rated as unsatisfactory; its sustainability is rated as unlikely
and its institutional impact as negligible.
The PCR is satisfactory. The project wiUl be audited together with Electrobras Power
Distribution I and II and Southeast Power Distribution Projects (Loans 2138, 2364 and 2565,
respectively).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
CENTRAIS ELETRICAS BRASILEIRAS, S.A. (ELETROBRAS)
CHESF-FURNAS POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
LOAN 2564-BR
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the CHESF-FURNAS Power
Transmission Project, for which Loan 2564-BR in the amount of US$400.0 million,
was approved on June 4, 1985. The loan closed on December 31, 1992, a year later
than expected. Total disbursements amounted to US$245.8 million.   The last
disbursement was on May 10, 1993. A total of US$154.2 million was cancelled.
Starting in December 1993, the Energy and Industry Operations Division,
Country Department I (Brasil, Venezuela, and Peru) of the Latin America and
Caribbean Regional Office prepared Parts I and III of the PCR. The PCR is based,
inter alia, on data supplied by the beneficiaries and various Bank documents--the
Staff Appraisal and President's Reports; the Loan, Guarantee and Project
Agreements; internal memos; supervision reports; project progress reports; and
correspondence files.
The Government, the borrower, and the beneficiaries were sent drafts of Parts
I and III.   Their responses have been incorporated into the PCR, either as
corrections of fact (Parts I and III) or as commentary on such subjects as the
future role of the Bank and the usefulness of international competitive bidding
(Part II).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
CENTRAIS ELETRICAS BRASILEIRAS, S.A. (ELETROBRAS)
CHESF-FURNAS POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
LOAN 2564-BR
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Preliminary Comment and Other Loans. Although some of the transmission
works of the project will not be completed until 1996 (or later), this project
completion report (PCR) assesses actual results as of the date of loan closing:
December 31, 1992, i.e., when Bank financing for the project terminated. To wait
until construction of all works is complete would unduly delay the usefulness of
this assessment, especially with respect to the roles of the Bank, the
Government,  and the borrower.   This PCR uses some of the information and
judgments set forth in PCRs on other Brazil power loans which share a common
background with Loan 2564-BR (paras. 1.01-1.02).
Obiectives. The primary project objective was to improve the quality of
service and the reliability of supply by increasing the transmission capacity to
industrialized cities in the areas served by Comphania Hidro Eletrica do Sao
Francisco, S.A. (CHESF) and Furnas Centrais Eletricas, S.A. (FURNAS).  Other
project objectives were to achieve fuel economies and higher system efficiency
by interconnecting some isolated systems (fuel consuming) and improving
management's technical and administrative capabilities through consulting
services and training.   The financial objective of the operation was the
rehabilitation of the power sector. This was to be achieved by implementation
of a Government-approved investment and financing plan.   This plan had been
developed, with Bank assistance, by the sector planning agency, Centrais
Eletricas Brasileiras. S.A. (ELETROBRAS). A later version of the plan (dated May
1986), the Power Sector Rehabilitation Plan (PSRP), was the basis for a sector
adjustment loan (2720-BR; US$500 million; 1986) (paras. 3.02).
Prolect Description & Timetable. At appraisal, the project consisted of:
1730 km. of transmission lines (TLs); 6600 MVA of transformer capacity and 1780
MVAr of compensating equipment (capacitors, reactors, and ancillary equipment);
and training. The project was expected to cost US$684.7 million; commissioning
of works was expected to be completed in 1990 (para. 3.03).
Variances
Implementation Dates. Due to disagreement by CHESF and FURNAS with the
Bank on the language of the bidding documents, the actual start-up date for the
project was May 1986, about a year behind schedule. Later, Government-imposed
ceilings on expenditures, lower-than-expected market growth, and lack of counter-
part funds delayed project execution. The Bank extended the loan closing date
from December 31, 1991 to December 31, 1992, but refused to extend the closing
date further in view of the non-compliance with financial covenants on the part
of CHESF and FURNAS. Construction of some works will continue through 1996. A
handful of FURNAS units will be completed after 1996 (para. 5.04).



iii
Project Revisions and Training. CHESF and FURNAS obtained Bank agreement
to multiple project revisions (additions and deletions of substations--SSs--and
TLs), plus financing for additional items: the civil works of the Paulo Afonso-
Messias TL (CHESF) and microwave and related equipment to reinforce the national
load-dispatch network. When construction is completed, the scope of the revised
project will be larger than that expected at appraisal: about 9% more kilometers
of TLs, 0.4% less transformation capacity, and about 19% less reactive capacity.
As of loan closing date, CHESF had completed about 50% of its sub-project;
FURNAS, about 68%  With respect to training, FURNAS carried out most of its
program. The same was not true with respect to CHESF (paras. 5.06-5.08).
Cost.   Due to the increase in the scope of the revised project, its
expected cost--US$864.9 million--is not comparable with the appraisal forecast--
US$684.7 million (stated in current prices and excluding IDC).   Sources of
financing for the revised project are: World Bank, US$245.8 million and
CHESF/FURNAS/ELETROBRAS, US$619.1 million.  The appraisal data for sources of
financing is: World Bank, US$319.5 million; CHESF/FURNAS/ELETROBRAS, US$365.2
million.   The revised CHESF sub-project is expected to cost US$234.2 million;
expenditures as of June 30, 1993 amounted to about 45% of the sub-project cost.
The revised FURNAS sub-project is expected to cost US$630.8 million; expenditures
as of December 31, 1992 amounted to about 63% of the sub-project cost. Actual
cost data supplied by CHESF and FURNAS on some commissioned TLs show lower-than-
expected unit costs. These data tend to confirm the opinion of Bank staff that
for the project as a whole unit costs were lower than expected because of
international competitive bidding (ICB) (paras. 5.09-5.10).
Results
Financial Rehabilitation.   The Government did not implement the PSRP
covering the years 1986-1989 and did not implement the successor plan negotiated
in connection with Loan 3227-BR (1990). The consequences were devastating to
sector finances.  This inadequate performance is one reason why the Bank has
withdrawn its support for the sector in Brazil (para. 6.01).
Project Benefits.  Even though any judgement on the sustainability of
benefits resulting from the additional transmission facilities will be
provisional until the completion and commissioning of those works under
construction, there is every reason to believe that the completed project will
meet its original objectives--meeting the power needs of the cities served by
FURNAS and CHESF and achieving fuel economies and higher system efficiency.
Further, ordinary maintenance and sound operating procedures should assure that
these benefits continue until the works are retired or replaced. Based on actual
investment costs, marginal sales, marginal operating costs and tariff levels
prevailing in 1992, the internal rates of return of the investment programs of
CHESF and FURNAS were negative (paras. 7.01-7.02).
Efficiency. Where they were able to exercise initiative, the managements
of CHESF and FURNAS performed well, as measured by reduced numbers of staff and
improved ratios of sales to staff even when actual sales were well below expected
sales. For example, in comparison to appraisal targets for 1992, CHESF reduced
staff by almost 35% while increasing its ratio of sales to staff by 13.5% These
gains materialized despite lower-than-expected sales (-26%). The performance of



iv
FURNAS also exceeded appraisal targets for 1992: staff levels were 52% lower than
expected and the sales-to-staff ratio was 70.2% higher than expected.   These
gains were generated despite a lower-than-expected level of sales (-18.4%).
Primary beneficiaries of these efficiency gains were the employees: average labor
and material expenses in 1992 were substantially higher in real terms than
expected (CHESF: 21.1%; FURNAS, 88.2%). FURNAS improved its loss ratio (5.0% in
1992 vs. 5.1% in 1985), but this improvement was less than expected (3.9%). At
CHESF, the loss ratio showed some deterioration: 6.7% in 1992 vs. 5.8% in 1985
(para. 7.04).
Institutional Performance
The Bank. During the decade of the 1980s, the involvement of the Bank
with the sector took place in the wider context of assistance in the restoration
of the international credit standing of Brazil (1983), support for the Cruzado
Plan (1986), and continuation of the dialogue with the Government on improving
sector finances while taking due account of overall relations with Brazil (1987-
1992). Between 1981 and 1986, the Bank and the Government agreed on a series of
plans for rehabilitating sector finances.   The plans failed to achieve their
objective because the Government, due mainly to political and short-term
inflationary considerations, did not support the sector with adequate tariff
adjustments. This situation also reflected an institutional shortcoming which
the Bank should have addressed--the absence of an autonomous regulatory body with
sufficient authority to enforce prevailing tariff legislation and to shield the
sector from short-term policy shifts. It is not certain how the Government would
have responded to an effort by the Bank to establish an autonomous regulatory
body (para. 8.01).
From 1987 to 1992, for the sake of flexibility, maintaining the dialogue
with the Government, and country considerations, the Bank continued to disburse
from its power loans, but did not complete the processing of new power loans due
to macroeconomic, tariff, and other factors. Given the inherent contradiction
of this approach, the Bank did not send a clear and consistent message to the
Government; hence, this tended to undermine the Bank's efforts to influence
sector policy.  The governing criterion, it appears, for continuing and then
terminating Bank support (December 1992) was country grounds; and indeed the Bank
did succeed in maintaining good country relations, even though sector performance
kept deteriorating. (para. 8.02).
Bank staff prepared and appraised the project efficiently. The level of
supervision, including visits to beneficiaries, was adequate and the measures
recommended appropriate.  If staff had a fault, it was erring on the side of
optimism in their assessments of project, company and sector developments. For
example, in 1990 and 1991, CHESF and FURNAS experienced declining levels of
average revenue; but staff, in anticipation of improved project progress based
on recovering company (and sector) finances, upgraded the overall project status
to "2" (moderate problems) from "3" (severe problems).  Recovering sector and
company finacnes depended on the future implementation of a sector-wide tariff
adjustment scheme agreed in connection with Loan 3227-BR--a scheme which was not
implemented.  In 1992, staff reduced the project status to "3" to reflect the
Bank's decision to withdraw Loan 3227-BR.   Another example of staff's erring on
the side of optimism was accepting sector, regional, and company sales forecasts



v
(in connection with Loans 2720-BR and 2564-BR)  which reflected an "up-beat"
approach to future market developments. However, macroeconomic events did not
confirm these expectations (para. 8.03).
Government.   The deteriorated  state of sector  finances  appears to
indicate a declining sense of "ownership" on the part of the Government both with
respect to the sector and the project (para. 5.05). In spite of the importance
of the electric power sector to the development of Brazil, both the military and
civilian regimes subordinated the financial rehabilitation of the sector to
short-run political and macroeconomic goals, especially fighting inflation, or
other strategic objectives. Such subordination devastated sector finances and
has led to a pattern of underinvestment which may result in serious constraints
on the economy. That the sector still provides a reasonable level of service to
current customers has led political decision makers to underestimate the risk of
having electric power shortages (para. 8.04).
Beneficiaries and Borrower. CHESF and FURNAS managed their affairs and
the partial execution of their respective sub-projects as well as could be
expected within the context of slowing market growth and deteriorating financial
conditions--circumstances which were beyond their control. ELETROBRAS success-
fully reloaned the proceeds of Loan 2564-BR to CHESF and FURNAS, as expected.
However, lack of Government support eroded the overall position of ELETROBRAS.
The Government did not implement the tariff increases recommended by ELETROBRAS
and, to avoid the political controversy with state governments or their agencies,
the Government did not support ELETROBRAS in other ways.   For example,  an
objective of Loans 2138-BR (USS 182.7 million; 1982) and 2364-BR (US$ 250.6
million; 1983), which helped finance the ELETROBRAS I and II Power Distribution
Projects, was the development of the capacity of ELETROBRAS to function as a
development  finance  company  (DFC).    Besides  supplying  advice,  technical
resources, and managerial talent, DFCs discipline borrowers by withholding, if
necessary, financial resources. The DFC objective, which was not contemplated
in connection with Loan 2564-BR, did not materialize, as it became politically
unfeasible for ELETROBRAS, a Federal agency, to withhold funding from a state
power company.   The state power companies were aware of their political
advantage, and they were prepared to use them. Also undermining the authority
of ELETROBRAS was the worsening state of sector finances--the result of poor
tariff regulation by SEST (paras. 8.05- 8.06).
Lessons Learned
Project.   There are two project lessons: one relating to optimistic
assessments of project, company and sector developments, including market
forecasts, and one relating to procurement. By 1992, it was clear that the "up-
beat" character of the earlier project ratings and the sales forecasts had not
been validated by events. In the case of the market forecasts, given the risks
of oversized loans and extra interest costs resulting from sales shortfalls,
project delays, and disbursement lags, it is important that at appraisal Bank
staff always carefully scrutinize sales forecasts. On a broader level, staff
will be on firmer ground if they assess situations (such as a project status)
based on how matters actually stand rather than on how they will stand in the
event that future developments materialize. As for procurement, as shown by the
lower unit costs for commissioned TLs, ICB again proved its worth (para. 9.01).



vi
Sector. The sector lessons relate to the proper regulatory regime and
Bank lending. Since the existence of an autonomous regulatory agency might have
shielded the sector from the impact of short-term political, macroeconomic policy
changes, the Government should now take steps leading to the establishment of a
truly autonomous regulatory agency--DNAEE or a new agency--with the power to
enforce tariff levels in line with the marginal cost of supply and to protect the
sector from short-run policy shifts.   Further,  in order to prevent future
domination of the regulators by the regulated, the regulatory agency should
include, in addition to representatives of the Government, representatives of
various consumer groups (para. 9.02).
There is another, seemingly contradictory, lesson concerning the proper
circumstances for Bank lending: continuing to lend despite a record of unkept
plans for financial rehabilitation undermined the credibility of the Bank and led
to expectations on the part of the Government that the Bank would not insist on
adherence to either covenants or plans. This message undoubtedly detracted from
implementation of the plans. It seems clear that lending in circumstances of
continuing financial deterioration sends the borrower the wrong message and leads
to a significant risk that agreed plans for financial rehabilitation will not be
observed. However, the decision to suspend disbursements does not depend on
project and sector developments taken in isolation from the overall state of
country relations.   Country considerations may,  for a while,  lead to the
displacement of all other criteria, and, as was the case with Brazil, may lead
the Bank to pursue a contradictory course to advance the important goal of
avoiding a crisis with the borrower (para. 9.03).

1.01        Preliminary Comunent.  Although some of the transmission works of the
project will not be completed until 1996 (or later), this project completion
report (PCR) assesses actual results as of the date of loan closing December 31,
1992, i.e., when Bank financing for the project terminated.   To wait until
construction of all works is complete would unduly delay the usefulness of this
assessment, especially with respect to the roles of the Bank, the Government, and
the borrower.
1.02        Other Loans.  This PCR uses some of the information and judgments set
forth in the PCRs (or equivalent) covering other Brazil power loans sharing a
common background with Loan 2564-BR.   These loans included: 2565-BR (US$312
million, 1985), which helped to finance the Southeast Distribution Project, a
companion project to the CHESF-FURNAS Power Distribution Project; 2720-BR (US$500
million, 1986), which supported the Power Sector Loan, a sector adjustment
operation, and 3227-BR (US$385 million, 1990), a sector investment loan, which
was withdrawn by the Bank in 1992--the loan having remained unsigned during the
22 months following its approval.   Reference is also made to Loans 2138-BR
(US$182.7 million, 1982) and 2364-BR (US$250.6 million, 1983), which supported
the ELETROBRAS I & II Power Distribution Projects.
2. Background
The Power Sector
2.01        Development Objectives.  During the years when the Bank helped to
plan and finance the CHESF-FURNAS Power Transmission Project (1985-1992), the
stated objectives of Brazilian energy policy were: (a) conservation and rational
energy use; and (b) exploitation of and substitution of domestic energy sources
for imported sources. It was expected that a least-cost power sector expansion



2
plan, supported by an appropriate policy mix, especially with respect to tariffs
and finances, would make an important contribution to reaching the above
objectives. A version of the expansion plan (dated May 1986), the Power Sector
Rehabilitation Plan (PSRP), served as the basis for Loan 2720-BR (para. 1.02).
2.02        Organization. The sector consists primarily of state- and Federally-
owned utilities responsible for, respectively, distribution and generation/trans-
mission.  For example, the power companies executing the above project--bulk
suppliers of electricity--were Centrais Eletricas Furnas, S.A. (FURNAS) and
Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco, S.A. (CHESF). Both companies were
(and remain) operating subsidiaries of Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, S.A., a
mixed-economy Federal holding company with sector-wide financing and planning
responsibilities (para. 2.03).  CHESF serves eight states of the Northeast, a
semi-arid agricultural region.   FURNAS serves the southeastern and central
western regions, the most developed in Brazil.  In 1984, CHESF's    installed
capacity amounted to 6,076 MW; sales, 24,269 GWh (almost 100% of the electricity
consumed in its region); operating revenues, US$351 million; and return on
remunerable assets, 3.3%. In the same year, FURNAS's installed capacity amounted
to 7,466 MW; sales, 33,375 MWh (about 32% of the electricity consumed in its
region); operating revenues, US$819 million; and return on remunerable assets,
5.0%.
2.03        Federal Authority and Legal Structure.  During the years 1984-1992,
the authority of the Federal Government to supervise sector decision-making was
paramount.   Further,  the legal structure of the sector was such that the
individual power companies were strongly linked to one another and to the Federal
Government through centrally coordinated planning, operations, tariffs, and
finances.   For example,  in addition to its duties as a holding company,
investment banker, and sector planning agency, ELETROBRAS operated a system-wide
load dispatch facility.  To ensure that sector policies on tariffs, finances and
expenditures were consistent with the Government's macroeconomic policies, the
Secretaria de Controle de Empresas Estatais (SEST), a planning body, reviewed the
decisions of the tariff agency, set global ceilings for borrowing and investment,
and approved the availability of financing for each utility. Also linking the
companies to one another financially were tariff-equalization and revenue-sharing
regimes--that is, bulk tariffs were equalized nationally; and the Global
Guarantee Fund (RGG) transferred financial resources from companies with a rate
of remuneration higher than the sector average to companies with a rate of
remuneration lower than the sector average.  The impact of Federal policy on
sector affairs was so important that Bank staff focused on Government tariff
policy and sector financial performance as the first step to understanding the
financial performance of individual utilities.
2.04        Regulation.  Beginning in 1979, the Government reduced the autonomy
of sector regulatory and planning agencies by subjecting the tariff decisions of
the Departamento Nacional de Aquas e Energia Eletrica (DNAEE), a regulatory body,
and the  sector expansion plans  of ELETROBRAS  to review by SEST.   DNAEE
concentrated on approving the operating costs of the individual utilities and
establishing contributions to and allocations of RGG funds. During the 1980s,
the Government set tariffs on the basis of financial rehabilitation plans which,
in addition to ignoring legislative standards (10% on remunerable assets),
reflected short-term macroeconomic objectives.

Economic, Institutional and Political Context
2.05        Between 1985 and 1992, while civilian, elected government became the
norm in Brazil, the economy experienced irregular and declining rates of growth,
high levels of inflation, public sector deficits, and periodic debt-service
problems.   During this period, disputes as to the respective powers of the
President, the Congress and the states delayed policy formulation, thereby
complicating an already difficult economic situation.
2.06        Due to political weakness, the Sarney Administration (1985-1990)
tried to curb inflation with schemes entailing minimum sacrifice by major
political groups.  The Cruzado Plan (1986), the Bresser Plan (1987), and the
Summer Plan (1989) included deindexation and price controls (which applied to
electricity tariffs), but, having no significant fiscal/monetary measures, these
plans did not succeed in curbing inflation and promoting stable growth. The next
Administration--that of President Collor (1990-1992)--instituted (in March 1990)
a stabilization plan based primarily on a "freeze" of liquid assets. This plan
reduced inflation temporarily, slowed economic growth, and improved public-sector
finances, but did not stabilize the economy.
2.07        The project, consisting of transmission works and training, was part
of a sector-wide investment program which, in turn, was part of a larger public
sector investment program.   During and after project preparation,  it was
understood that, given the need for public sector investment to be consistent
with the monetary and fiscal targets of the Government,   the power sector
investment plan, including the project, might be reduced.
Bank Lending to the Sector
2.08        Investment Lending.  From the mid 1970s to 1985, Bank lending for
power, including Loan 2564-BR, emphasized the financing of transmission and
distribution systems. A series of power loans continued through the first half
of the 1980s even as the macroeconomic (and sector) problems became more complex.
In 1982-1983, the prospect of default by Brazil and other Latin American
countries posed a threat to the stability of the banking systems of the United
States, Europe, and elsewhere. Calming these fears by demonstrating continued
faith in the creditworthiness of Brazil was an explicit part of Bank lending
strategy during the period leading up to the processing of Loan 2564-BR.
2.09        Sector Adjustment Lending (SECAL).  In 1986, the Bank designed Loan
2720-BR (para. 1.02) to be a quick-disbursing sector adjustment loan (SECAL)
based on a comprehensive sector investment program and corresponding financing
plan--the  PSRP.   The  loan aimed at encouraging  financial  rehabilitation,
conservation,  and environmental/social  safeguards  in the sector.   It also
supported the Cruzado Plan (para. 2.06).  During the next three years (1987-
1989), the Bank and the Government, due to macroeconomic, tariff, and other
factors, did not agree on a revised PSRP or the terms of a second SECAL.
2.10        Continuing the Dialogue.   In 1990, the Bank processed a sector
investment loan to support a proposed transmission and conservation project
(3227-BR; US$385 million). The Bank conditioned effectiveness on implementation



4
of an agreed program of sector-wide tariff increases, the "Rate Adjustment Plan"
(RAP), and appraised a companion distribution loan for US$300 million. During
the 22 months after approval, Loan 3227-BR remained unsigned and the financial
condition of the sector deteriorated. On April 20, 1992, the Bank, taking into
account the financial deterioration of the sector, the uncertain prospects for
the implementation of the RAP, and the overall state of country relations,
withdrew Loan 3227-BR.
2.11        Closing of Loan 2564-BR.  The decision to withdraw had implications
for Loan 2564-BR since its beneficiaries were not in compliance with their
respective revenue covenants. Since 1981, the Bank had refrained from enforcing
the revenue covenants of its power loans as long as the Government appeared to
be trying to implement an agreed plan for sector financial rehabilitation. The
decision to withdraw Loan 3227-BR meant that the Bank was no longer acting on
these premises. Accordingly, the Bank did not extend the closing date of Loan
2564-BR beyond December 31, 1992.
3. Proiect Origin. Obiectives and Description
3.01        Origin.  In January 1984, the Government asked for Bank assistance
in the formulation, financing, and implementation of a plan to address long-
standing sector investment and financial difficulties. This request led to the
drafting of an early or preliminary version of the PSRP, of which the project was
a part, and an expression of interest by the Government in Bank financing for the
project.   At the same time, the Government also expressed interest in Bank
financing for what later became the Southeast Power Distribution Project (Loan
2565-BR--para. 1.02).
3.02        Obiectives.  The first project objective was to improve the quality
of service and the reliability of supply by increasing the transmission capacity
to industrialized cities in the areas served by CHESF and FURNAS. Other project
objectives were to achieve fuel economies and higher system efficiency by
interconnecting some isolated systems (currently fuel consuming) and to improve
management's technical and administrative capabilities through consulting
services and training.   It was expected that the financial objectives of the
operation--improving sector finances--would be satisfied by implementation of the
PSRP.
3.03        Project Description. Timetable. and Cost.  The project consisted of
transmission works of CHESF and FURNAS. The components were: construction of
1730 km of transmission lines (TLs) at voltage levels ranging from 500 kV to
230kV; installation of 6600 MVA of transformer capacity and 1780 MVAr of
compensating equipment (capacitors, reactors, and ancillary equipment) at eight
new and sixteen expanded substations (SSs); and training (TR). It was expected
that the activities constituting implementation--issuing bidding documents,
contract awards, construction and/or manufacture, and commissioning--would begin
in May 1985 and end in December 1990. The project was expected to cost US$684.7
million (FURNAS sub-project, US$459.0 million, and CHESF sub-project, US$225.7
million).
3.04        Borrower. Beneficiaries, and Guarantor.   The Loan Agreement (LA)
provided for a loan of US$400 million to ELETROBRAS, which was a long-time



5
borrower (Part III, Table 1). ELETROBRAS was to relend US$113.2 million to CHESF
and US$286.8 million to FURNAS, the beneficiaries, to carry out the project, as
provided by their respective Proiect Agreements (PA).  The Government was the
guarantor.
4. Prolect Design and Organization
4.01        Design.  With respect to project design, the underlying concept or
approach was sectoral--that is, since the interconnected utilities were strongly
linked to one another operationally and financially (paras. 2.02-2.03), it made
sense to design a program, the PSRP (para. 3.01), which took such factors into
account, and to base the project on the high-priority CHESF/FURNAS transmission
works included in the PSRP. Since the Bank and ELETROBRAS had, for many years,
collaborated in planning and executing projects in the light of sector investment
needs, there was little new in this approach. What was new was the conditioning
of disbursements from a Bank power loan to the implementation of an annually
updated, Bank-approved PSRP, to which the Government was formally and directly
committed.
4.02        Project Preparation. Project preparation and appraisal were executed
promptly between August and December 1984. Loan negotiations were completed by
the beginning of May 1985; and the Executive Directors approved the loan on June
4, 1985 (Part III, Table 2). Thereafter, efforts to comply with conditions of
effectiveness slowed, as the new Sarney Administration wished to assure itself
that the PSRP, which was the basis for the project, was consistent with its
national macroeconomic program.
4.03        Ownership. With respect to its origin, the project clearly reflected
initiative on the part of the Government.   With respect to its content, the
project reflected agreement and acceptance by all parties.
4.04        Roles and Responsibilities.   At the time of loan approval (June
1985), it appeared that the roles and responsibilities of the Government,
ELETROBRAS, CHESF, and FURNAS were clearly understood.   The Government was
expected to establish and maintain financial conditions beneficial for
implementation of the PSRP based on the financial planning and recommendations
of ELETROBRAS.   The project role of ELETROBRAS was limited to relending the
proceeds of Loan 2564-BR to CHESF and FURNAS, who would carry out the project.
5. Implementation
Sector Policy Context
5.01        Effectiveness.  In November 1985, to comply with a special condition
of effectiveness, the Government submitted a satisfactory PSRP for Bank approval
and implemented the 1985 component of the tariff adjustment program.   This
November 1985 version of the PSRP still needed modifications and the tariff
increases led to a projected sector return of 3.4% on remunerable assets for 1985
instead of the 6% agreed in connection with the financial rehabilitation plan of
1983. However, the Bank considered that the measures taken, together with the
implementation of the agreements reached in 1985, would place the sector on the



6
path of financial recovery, and justified declaring Loan 2564-BR effective on
January 29, 1986.
5.02        Cruzado Plan & the SECAL (Loan 2720-BR).  In March 1986, faced with
accelerating inflation--16% in January and 14% in February--the Government
introduced the Cruzado Plan to stabilize the economy (para. 2.05).  It also
reformulated the PSRP to achieve consistency with the stabilization plan by
adopting somewhat lower targets of financial recovery than those contemplated in
the draft of November 1985. The Government made plain that only modest tariff
increases were contemplated in 1986, but that in subsequent years (by 1989)
financial recovery of the sector would materialize through expected tariff
increases  and other measures.    As had been the case with earlier  (and
unsuccessful) plans of financial rehabilitation 1, the Bank relied on the
assurances of the Government, accepted the revised PSRP (May 1986), and completed
the processing of the SECAL (2720-BR), which was fully disbursed by December 23,
1986.
Implementation Variances
5.03        General.   Because of a variety of factors--procurement delays,
Government-imposed expenditure ceilings on public-sector investment, financial
constraints, and market changes--major variances for both sub-projects
materialized with respect to project implementation dates, ownership, capacity,
components, and cost.
5.04        Implementation Dates.  The actual start-up date for the project was
May 1986, about a year behind the original schedule. This date corresponds with
the issuance of bidding documents by CHESF and FURNAS for equipment and civil
works contracts. This delay was due to disagreement by CHESF and FURNAS with the
Bank on the language of the bidding documents. In 1986, the Government mandated
an expenditure limitation on the public-sector investment program, causing the
executing agencies to reschedule many of the planned SSs and TLs. These delays
impacted on "down-stream" implementation activities--award of contracts,
constructing works and manufacturing equipment, etc. Later, lower-than-expected
market growth complicated by severe financial constraint further delayed project
execution, leading the Bank to extend the loan closing date from December 31,
1991 to December 31, 1992.  As of the loan closing date, CHESF had completed
about 50% of its sub-project; FURNAS, about 68% of its sub-project. Construction
of some works will continue through 1996. A handful of units under execution by
FURNAS will be completed after 1996.
5.05        Ownership.  The continuing financial constraint experienced by the
sector, FURNAS, and CHESF appears to reflect a decline or displacement of the
Government's sense of "ownership" both in the sector and the project.
Notwithstanding its expressed commitment, the Government, when it had to choose,
opted for objectives other than the financial rehabilitation of the power sector.
1 PLans for financial restoration of the sector were formuLated in 1980, 1981, and 1983 in connection
with Loans 1824-BR (1980: USS114.0 million), 2138-BR (1982: USS182.7 miLLion), and 2364-BR (1983: USS250.6
miLLion).



7
This lack of commitment impacted adversely on the capacity of the sector,
including the beneficiaries, to generate counterpart financing.
5.06        Revisions and Completions.  CHESF and FURNAS obtained Bank agreement
to multiple revisions (additions and deletions of SSs and TLs), plus financing
of additional items (para. 5.07).   These revisions reflect changes in the
location and rate of market growth. By December 31, 1992, the date of the loan
closing, of the TLs contemplated at appraisal, CHESF had commissioned three,
deleted three, and is executing the remaining three. Of the SSs contemplated at
appraisal, CHESF deleted nine of ten and added five, all of which are being
executed.  By December 31 1992, of the TLs contemplated at appraisal, FURNAS
completed four, deleted one, and added six, two of which are completed.  The
balance are being executed.  Of the thirteen SSs contemplated at appraisal,
FURNAS commissioned five, deleted two, and is executing the rest. FURNAS added
thirteen SSs, two of which have been commissioned.   The balance are being
executed. Additional items financed by the Bank are the civil works of the Paulo
Afonso-Messias TL (CHESF) and microwave and related equipment to reinforce the
national load-dispatch network.   The Bank had initially helped finance this
network with Loan 1939-BR (1980, US$54 million).
5.07        Capacity Changes.  At completion, the revised project is expected to
include about 9% more kilometers of transmission lines than anticipated at
appraisal (1853 km vs. 1730 km at voltage levels ranging from 500kV to 138kV),
0.4% less transformation capacity (6571 MVA vs. 6600 MVA), and about 19% less
reactive capacity (1445 MVAr vs. 1780 MVAr).   Schedule 5.1 below compares
actual/revised capacity to forecast capacity additions.

5.08        Trainincg Program.   The training program was expected to upgrade
professional skills in the areas of administration, engineering, and operation
of the power system. In spite of repeated urgings from the Bank, CHESF carried
out only a small part of the program. Disbursements from Loan 2564-BR for CHESF
training amounted to just under US$0.3 million, including about US$70,000 for the
contracting of training specialists and the balance (US$220,000) for fellow-
ships.  FURNAS made a more complete effort to implement the training program
agreed with the Bank, including the purchase of laboratory equipment, foreign
training for selected staff, and local training. Disbursements from Loan 2564-BR
amounted to USS4.7 million, of which about US$660,000 million was used for
contracting training specialists, US$1.16 million for laboratory equipment, and
the balance (US$2.89 million) for fellowships.
5.09        Cost and Sources of Financing.   When completed, the project, as
revised, is expected to cost about US$864.9 million as compared with the
appraisal forecast of US$684.7 million (stated in current prices and excluding
IDC). Due to increased scope, the cost of the revised project is not directly
comparable with the appraisal forecast.  The cost of the revised CHESF sub-
project is expected to amount to US$234.2 million as compared to the appraisal
forecast of US$225.7 million. The corresponding sources of financing are: the
Bank, US$69.4 million, and CHESF/ELETROBRAS, US$164.8 million. As of June 1993,
expenditures on the CHESF sub-project amounted to about 45% of the total sub-
project cost.  The FURNAS sub-project, as revised, is expected to cost about
US$630.8 million as compared with the appraisal forecast of US$459.0 million.
The corresponding sources of financing for the revised FURNAS sub-project are:
the Bank, US$143.1 million, and FURNAS/ELETROBRAS, US$487.7 million.   As of
December 1992, expenditures on the FURNAS sub-project amounted to about 63% of
total sub-project cost. The table below summarizes expected and forecast costs
by component (Part III, Table 5).

5.10        Unit Prices and ICB. Available unit data demonstrate the usefulness
of international competitive bidding (ICB). For example, in the case of FURNAS,
the actual average per-km. cost of a commissioned TL at 345 kV (Sao Roque-
Guarulhos: 144 km.) was lower than expected: US$221,000 vs. US$349,000 (or
-36.5%); and the average per-km. cost of three commissioned TLs at 500 kV with
a combined length of 324 km. (Campinae-Sao Roque, Tijuco Preto-Cachoiera
Paulista, and Adrianopolis-Grajan) was US$258,000 vs. the expected cost of
US$310,000 (or -16.9%). In the case of CHESF, the actual average per-km. cost
of two commissioned TLs at 500 kV (Angelem-Itaparica-Olinda:   70 km.) was
US$99,000, or 53% less than expected (US$212,000). Such reductions did not occur
in every case. The actual average per-km. cost of the Paulo Afonso-Messias TL
(277 km.) at 500 kV was US$238,000 vs. the expected value of US$205,000 (or
+16.1%). It was the opinion of Bank staff that, due to ICB, unit prices were,
on average, below expected levels.
6. Financial Performance: Sector and Beneficiaries
6.01       Sector.   Given the primary decision-making role of the Federal
Government with respect to the sector, the financial performance of CHESF and
FURNAS can only be judged within the sector context. Due to the importance of
Government decision-making, the Bank concentrated its efforts on helping to
formulate and implement sector-wide financial rehabilitation plans. As already
stated, the Bank and the Government did not agree on revisions to the PSRP (para.
2.08) with the result that, in circumstances of inadequate tariff levels and
slowing market growth, the sector operating performance in 1987-1989 was well
below what had been anticipated in connection with Loan 2720-BR. For example,
by 1989, actual sector sales were 15% below the forecast level, and average
revenue per kWh sold had declined by 28% compared with the level of the prior
year and as compared with a forecast increase of 17%.  The ratios for debt
service coverage and self-financing for the years 1986-1988 were also well below
target levels. Schedule 6.1 below compares actual and forecast sector data.

CHESF and FURNAS
6.02          Revised Financial Targets. To comply with a special condition of
effectiveness for Loan 2720-BR, the Government established individual
rehabilitation plans (RPs) for CHESF and FURNAS in line with the May 1986 version
of the PSRP. The new financial targets, which covered the years 1986-1989, were
lower than and superseded those established at appraisal.   Given that the
Government and the Bank were in serious dialogue on the crafting and implementing
of new recovery plans during the years 1986-1991, the Bank decided not to enforce
the financial covenants of Loan 2564-BR (Part III, Table 10).
6.03          Financial Indicators, 1986-1989.  The operating performances of
CHESF and FURNAS paralleled that of the sector. For example, by 1989, when sector
sales were 15% below the PSRP forecast, those of CHESF and FURNAS were 13% and
7% below the appraisal forecast, respectively. In 1989, sector average revenue
per kWh sold had declined 28% as compared with the actual level of the previous
year.   The corresponding declines  for CHESF and FURNAS were 24% and 22%
respectively as compared with expected (appraisal) increases of, respectively,
5% and 4%. The respective RPs showed increases of 9% and 16%.
6.04          Financial Indicators, 1990-1992.  By 1992, sales growth for CHESF
and FURNAS was about four years behind schedule. Average tariff levels, while
about 20-22% above those of the previous year, remained low. The appearance of
improvement with respect to debt-service and borrowing ratios did not indicate
increased levels of internal cash generation. The improvement was due to the
elimination of "roll-over" borrowing from the calculation of levels of debt
service and net borrowing for investment. More indicative of their financial
performances are tariff levels, which were well below forecast levels, and
operating ratios, which were well above forecast levels.   In 1991 and 1992,
FURNAS's revenues just covered operating expenses (including depreciation);
during the same years, CHESF's revenues did not cover operating expenses.
Schedule 6.2 on the following page compares actual, appraisal, and revised (as
per the RPs) annual data for sales, average revenue per kWh sold, and financial
ratios.

C:CHESF; F:FURNAS
* As caLcuLated by beneficiaries.
1/ FURNAS noted that above RP data did not match its version of RP. If FURNAS was referring to average
revenue per kWh sold, the difference between vaLues shown above and the FURNAS data is probabty due to the
restatement of the above RP data in prices of December 1984.
2/ Probably because it did not note that average revenues were stated in constant prices of December 1984,
CHESF furnished the following values (stated in US cents) refLecting current prices: 1986: 1.54; 1988-89:
2.20; 1990: 2.39; 1991: 1.89; and 1992: 2.23.
3/ Defined as the ratio of long-term debt, including current maturities, to the sun of equity plus long-term
debt.
6.05              Summarized Investment Expenditure and Financing.  Actual summarized
investment  and  financing  data  covering  the  years  1985-1990--the  project
implementation period expected at appraisal--reflects the adverse impact of
Government tariff policy. CHESF and FURNAS financed no part of their investment
programs with net internal cash generation. As shown below (Schedule 6.3), CHESF
financed the modest increase to its investment program (US$189 million) and its
shortfall for net internal cash generation (US$1,376 million) with additional
contributions (US$106 million), long-term borrowing (US$592 million), and short-
term borrowing and net inflows from other sources (US$868 million).  For FURNAS,



12
the shortfall of investment expenditure (US$1,755 million) and the increase in
short-term borrowing and other net sources (US$349 million) were matched by
shortfalls with respect to net internal cash generation (US$1,287 million), long-
term  borrowing  (US$692  million),  and  contributions  (US$126  million).    In
circumstances of reduced market growth, both companies made large reductions in
spending for transmission.

7. Results
The Proiect
7.01        Benefits  and  Objectives.       Even  though  any  judgement  on  the
sustainability of benefits resulting from the addition of transmission facilities
to the CHESF and FURNAS systems will be provisional until the completion and
commissioning of those works under construction, there is every reason to believe
that the completed project will meet its original objectives--meeting the power
needs of the cities served by FURNAS and CHESF and achieving fuel economies and
higher system efficiency.  Further, ordinary maintenance should assure that these
benefits continue until the works are retired or replaced.
7.02        Internal Rate of Return.  In addition to being least-cost solutions,
the sub-projects were justified as being part of investment programs with
satisfactory economic rates of return: CHESF,  11.3% and FURNAS,  10.9%.   The
underlying assumptions of these returns was the implementation of sector-wide
plans for financial rehabilitation. As such rehabilitation has not materialized,
based on actual tariffs, the economic returns of the investment programs of CHESF
and FURNAS for the years 1985-1992 were below zero: CHESF: -12%; FURNAS: -3%
(Part III, Table 10).



13
7.03        Financial  Rehabilitation.    As  already  stated  (para.  6.01),  the
Government did not implement the PSRP covering the years 1986-1989 and did not
implement the successor plan negotiated in connection with Loan 3227-BR (1990).
The objective of restoring sector finances was not achieved. This inadequate
performance is one reason why the Bank has withdrawn its support for the sector
in Brazil.
7.04       Efficiency.   Where they were able to exercise some autonomy,  the
managements of CHESF and FURNAS performed well, as measured by several efficiency
indicators (Schedule 7.1). By 1992, actual numbers of staff had declined well
below target levels (CHESF: -35%; FURNAS: -52%). Ratios of sales to staff also
showed improvement (CHESF: 13.5%; FURNAS: 70.2%), notwithstanding lower-than-
expected sales. The primary beneficiaries of these efficiency improvements were
the employees: average labor and material expenses in 1992 were substantially
higher than expected (CHESF: 21.1%; FURNAS, 88.2%). FURNAS improved its loss
ratio (5.0% in 1992 vs. 5.1 in 1985), but this improvement was less than expected
(3.9%). At CHESF, the loss ratio showed some deterioration: 6.7% in 1992 vs.
5.8% in 1985. The lower-than-expected investment in transmission facilities is
a major reason why the reduction in losses was less than expected.

values, actual and forecast, materialize: 1985, 5.4% and 5.3%; and 1992: 5.0% and 4.0%.
7.05        Sales Growth.   By 1992,  CHESF and FURNAS  sales were well below
expected levels: CHESF, -26.0% and FURNAS, -18.4% (See schedule 7.1 above). For
both companies, actual and forecast residential sales in 1992 were close,
commercial sales were one to two-years behind schedule, but industrial sales had
been almost flat since 1987.   The impact of the Collor Plan on the economy
explains part of the shortfall in demand by industrial and commercial customers.

8. Institutional Performance
The Bank
8.01        Policy Context and Institutional Shortcomings.  During the decade of
the 1980s, the involvement of the Bank with the sector took place in the wider
context of helping to restore the international credit standing of Brazil (1983),
supporting the Cruzado Plan (1986), and continuing the dialogue with the
Government on improving sector finances (1987-1990). Between 1981 and 1986, the
Bank, taking account of the complex economic, financial, and political problems
of Brazil, made a series of investment loans and one sector adjustment loan based
on the understanding that the Government would implement a series of plans
negotiated between 1981 and 1986 for rehabilitating sector finances. The plans
failed to achieve their objective because the Government, in its effort to combat
inflation and due to political considerations plus other factors (including
deficiencies inherent to the plans), did not support the sector with adequate
tariff levels. This situation also reflected an institutional shortcoming which
the Bank should have addressed--the absence of an autonomous regulatory body with
sufficient authority to enforce prevailing tariff legislation and to shield the
sector from short-term policy shifts. It is not certain how the Government would
have responded to an effort by the Bank urging the establishment of an autonomous
regulatory body.
8.02        Contradictions.  From 1987 to 1992, for the sake of flexibility and
continued dialogue with the Government, and country considerations, the Bank
continued to disburse from its power loans, but did not complete the processing
of new power loans due to macroeconomic, tariff and other factors. Given the
inherent contradiction of this approach, the Bank did not send a clear and
consistent message to the Federal Government; hence, this tended to undermine the
Bank's efforts to influence sector policy. The governing criterion, it appears,
for continuing and then terminating Bank support (December 1992) was country
grounds; and, indeed, the Bank did succeed in maintaining good country relations
even though sector performance kept deteriorating.
8.03        Project.  Bank staff prepared and appraised the project efficiently.
The level of supervision, including visits to beneficiaries, was adequate and the
measures recommended appropriate.  If staff had a fault, it was erring on the
side of optimism in their assessments of project, company and sector perform-
ances.  For example, in 1990 and 1991, FURNAS and CHESF experienced declining
levels of average revenue per kWh sold (see Schedule 6.2); but staff upgraded the
overall project status to "2" (moderate problems)  from "3" (severe problems)
(Part III, Table 10) in anticipation of improved sector and company finances
resulting from the future implementation of the RAP  (para. 2.10).  In 1992,
staff reduced the project status to "3" to reflect the Bank's decision to
withdraw Loan 3227-BR.    Another example of staff's erring on the side of
optimism was accepting sector, regional, and company sales fore-casts (in
connection with Loans 2720-BR and 2564-BR) which reflected an "up-beat" approach
to future market developments. However, as shown on the following page, these
"up-beat" forecasts were not validated by events.

* FURNAS is a major buLk supplier to the Southeast-Central Western Regions. During this period 1984-1989,
its sales growth was related to agreements requiring state distribution companies to purchase power
generated by the Itaipu bi-national entity.
**  High growth rate reflected sales to neighboring power conpany which did not continue following

8.04    Government.  In spite of the importance of the electric power sector to
the development of Brazil, both the military and civilian regimes subordinated
the financial rehabilitation of the sector to short-run political, macroeconomic
goals, especially fighting inflation, or other strategic objectives.   Such
Bubordination devastated sector finances and led to a pattern of underinvestment
which may result in serious constraints on the economy. It also caused the Bank
to withhold its financial support from the sector; the Bank has no active loans
supporting the electric power sector.   That the sector still provides a
reasonable level of service to current customers has led political decision
makers to underestimate the risk of having electric power shortages.
8.05    The Borrower.  ELETROBRAS successfully reloaned the proceeds of Loan
2564-BR to CHESF and FURNAS. However, the efforts of ELETROBRAS to design and
implement an effective sector financial rehabilitation plan were undermined by
the Government's choice of other strategic objectives.   Further, to avoid
political controversy with state governments and their agencies, the Government
did not support ELETROBRAS in other ways. For example, in connection with Loans
2138-BR and 2364-BR, which helped finance, respectively, the ELETROBRAS I & II
Power Distribution Projects (para. 1.02), the Bank tried to help ELETROBRAS
become a development finance company (DFC)--the objective being to improve the
operations of the smaller, weaker state-owned distribution utilities through
transfers of advice, resources, and managerial talent.   Inherent in the DFC
concept is the power to discipline borrowers by witholding, if necessary,
financial resources. The DFC objective, which was not contemplated in connection
with Loan 2564-BR--CHESF and FURNAS were already subject to the direct control
and ownership of ELETROBRAS--did not succeed, as it became politically unfeasible
for ELETROBRAS, a Federal agency, to withhold funding from a state power company.
The state power companies were aware of their political advantage, and they were
prepared to use it.  Also undermining the authority of ELETROBRAS were the
greater authority of SEST as final arbiter of sector finances and planning and



16
the reduced resources available to ELETROBRAS for guiding the sector.
8.06     Beneficiaries.  CHESF and FURNAS managed their affairs and the partial
execution of their respective sub-projects as well as could be expected within
the context of slowing market growth and deteriorating financial conditions --
circumstances which were beyond their control.
9. Lessons to be Learned
9.01     Project Lessons.  There are two project lessons, which are not new: one
relating to optimistic assessments of project, company and sector developments,
including market forecasts, and one relating to procurement. In 1992, it was
clear that the earlier optimism which had characterized staff assessments of
project status and company sales were no longer justifed. Given the withdrawal
of Loan 3227-BR, Bank staff downgraded the project from "2" to "3".  Also in
1992, the sales of CHESF and FURNAS had only reached the levels expected for
1989, mostly because of shortfalls with respect to industrialized sales.
Clearly, the "up-beat" character of the earlier project ratings and the sales
forecasts had not been validated by events (para. 8.03).  In the case of the
market forecasts, given the risks of oversized loans and extra interest costs
resulting from sales shortfalls, implementation delays, and disbursement lags,
it is important that during appraisal Bank staff always carefully scrutinize
sales forecasts.  On a broader level, staff will be on firmer ground if they
assess situations (such as a project status) based on how matters actually stand
rather than how they will stand in the event that future developments
materialize. As for procurement, as demonstrated by the lower unit costs for
commissioned TLs (para. 5.10), ICB again proved its worth.
Sector Lessons
9.02     Regulation.  The sector lessons relate to the regulatory regime and Bank
lending.   In the 1980s the Government ignored legislation relating to power
tariffs and the regulatory authority of DNAEE in favor of sector financial
rehabilitation plans and review by planning agencies. The substitution of these
plans for the norms of tariff legislation started the sector on a downhill path
which allowed for the subordination of the long-term financial needs of the
sector to short-run political and macroeconomic objectives. Since the existence
of an autonomous regulatory agency might have avoided this situation, the
Government should begin to take steps leading to the establishment of a truly
autonomous regulatory agency--DNAEE or a new agency--with the power to enforce
tariff levels in line with the marginal cost of supply and to protect the sector
from short-run policy shifts on the part of the Government. Further, in order
to prevent future domination of the regulators by the regulated, the regulatory
agency should include, in addition to representatives of the Government,
representatives of various consumer groups.
9.03     Circumstances  for  Bank  Lending.       There  is  another,  seemingly
contradictory, lesson to be learned about the proper circumstances for Bank
lending: continuing to lend despite a record of unkept plans for financial
rehabilitation undermined the credibility of the Bank and led to the expectations
on the part of the Government that the Bank would not insist on adherence to
either financial covenants or plans. This message undoubtedly detracted from



17
implementation of the plans. It seems clear that lending in circumstances of
continuing financial deterioration sends the borrower the wrong message and leads
to a significant risk that agreed plans for financial rehabilitation will not be
observed.  However, the decision to suspend disbursements does not depend on
project and sector developments taken in isolation from the overall state of
country relations.   Country considerations may, for a while,  lead to the
displacement of all other criteria, and, as was the case with Brazil, may lead
the Bank to pursue a contradictory course to advance the important goal of
avoiding a crisis with the borrower.

PART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BRAZILIAN PERSPECTIVE
Note:   ELETROBRAS sent the Bank a package of materials on the draft PCR,
including: (1) its letter which was addressed to Mr. Stephen J. Ettinger, Chief,
Energy and Infrastructure Division, Department 1, Latin America and Caribbean
Region; and (2-3) memos of the beneficiaries addressed to ELETROBRAS and
containing corrections as to facts and comments on issues. Corrections as to
fact have been incorporated into Parts I and III. Translations of the ELETROBRAS
letter and of the comments of the beneficiaries are set forth below.
1. Letter of ELETROBRAS
May 30, 1994
Dear Sir,
We refer to the Project Completion Report (PCR), concerning which the
Bank has solicited the comments of ELETROBAS, as required by Loan 25464-BR.
As mentioned in the PCR, lack of counterpart resources delayed execution
of the Southeast Distribution Project. The lack of resources was due to factors
exogenous to the power sector--factors such as investment ceilings imposed by the
Federal Government, a rate of economic growth lower than that which had been
foreseen, and inadequate tariff levels. (It is worth stating that in the period
1987 and 1988, the Federal Government authorized significant tariff increases,
which were not sufficient for the definitive recovery of the sector.)
We recognize, however, that the sector departed from the basic premise
for other sector loans which, in addition to Loan 2720-BR, would have been
provided by the Bank and which would have been complemented by parallel co-
financing to be obtained from private foreign commercial banks.
Concerning the financial recovery of the sector, the withdrawal of Bank
support for the sector due to the non-fulfillment of the financial goals
established under Loan 2720-BR--the sector adjustment loan--ELETROBRAS has
expressed its position in earlier documents. It is usual to consider the meeting
of fulfillment of goals established during the appraisal phase of a project as
the basic parameter for judging the execution and development of a project or
operation. However, in the case of the sector adjustment loan, we judge it more
appropriate to consider all of the actions taken by the sector. As for project
financing, this ought to be based on the project itself, on the real
possibilities of success, and on the capacity of the executing agency to carry
out the project. We believe that macroeconomic conditionalities tied to such
financing retard the execution of the project, as they subject the project to
external factors.



19
Despite unfavorable sector conditions, the following shows the evolution
of the sector during the years 1985-1992, when Loan 2565-BR was approved and
disbursed:
1985       1992      % Increase
Installed Generating Capacity (MW)       41,992      58,140          39
Consumption of Electric Energy (GWh)  163,277    218,636             34
Number of Consumers (000)                24,099      33,498          39
Tariff in US$/MWh                         27.91       49.73          78
Investments (in US$ millions)             6,812       3,769         -45
At the end of 1993--the year after the last disbursement from the loan--
the sector achieved the following: installed capacity, + 1.6%; consumption of
electric energy, + 3.9%; and number of customers, + 5.0%. Further, the average
tariff stated in US dollars amounted to US$54.75/MWh--an increase of 10.1% as
compared with (the level of) the prior year.
Concerning institution changes, it is relevant to state that whatever
happens will be conditioned by the Constitution of 1989. Meanwhile, as agreed in
connection with Loan 2720-BR, the Institutional Revision of the Sector (REVISE)
was established and its evolution was reported to the Bank.
We are also mending the comments of CHESF and FURNAS for inclusion in
Part II of the PCR.
Yours sincerely,
Jose Luiz Alqueres, President
2. Comments of FURNAS
Note: The document set forth below was attached to a cover letter (dated May 26,
1994) addressed to Dr. Marcos Jose Marques, Director of Corporate Budget and
Finance, ELETROBRAS. The cover letter was signed by Mr. Carlos Eduardo de Silva
Bessa, Financial Director, FURNAS. The format of the original document has been
altered to take the form of a letter.
May 20, 1994
Dear Sir,
Re the Bank:
The main point to be observed in the performance of the Bank is related
to its perception and understanding of Brazil's institutional problems which
affected directly the Brazilian electric power sector as a whole. This position
led to a flexibility by the Bank, allowing the project to be carried despite the
failing of the sector plans to achieve its objectives.



20
Concerning the implementation of the project, we understand that the
Bank worked with an efficient operational structure that allowed an adequate
disbursement procedure as well as changes in the scope and commissioning dates.
As lessons learned for the future, we would like to emphasize the real
need to have the Bank acting not only as a financing agency but also and mainly
as a true partner to the Brazilian electrical sector, recognizing its
peculiarities and trying to sensitize the government, as (was) done during the
implementation of the project
Finally we would like to mention the efficiency of the International
Competitive Bidding--ICB--as an instrument of cost reduction.
Re FURNAS:
We believe that notwithstanding the severe constraints imposed on the
sector during the period of utilization of the loan, such as low tariff levels,
limitations on borrowing and investments, FURNAS had a good performance.
It is also important to point out the efforts made by the remaining
staff specifically related to the project in maintaining the level of performance
normal to FURNAS standards vis-a-vis the dismissal of high-qualified technical
personnel due to the administrative reform as from 1990.
In the future, it would be very much desirable that the sector could
have a greater autonomy so that we would be able to execute the sector plans
previously discussed and approved, independently as far as possible, from
constraints eventually imposed by macroeconomic governmental policies.
Re Relations Between the Bank and FURNAS:
The effectiveness of the relationship between the Bank and FURNAS has
to be assessed taking into consideration all the circumstances already considered
above. In that context of difficulties, only a high quality relationship allowed
the project to be carried out as far as it did go.  As an example, we would
mention the successful Bank's (sic) missions to FURNAS, which enable(d) (us) to
informally establish procedures and solve problems.
Yours sincerely,
Fernando Coelho Pinheiro,
Chief, Financing Advisory Staff

3. Comments of CHESF
Note: The CHESF memo was addressed to Dr. Roberto Benavides, Department of
Financial Resources Mobilization, ELETROBRAS. The format of the original memo
has been altered to take the form of a letter.
May 27, 1994
Dear Sir,
In principle, Loan 2564-BR met a large part of its objective which was
to increase and improve the supply of electric energy to the industrialized
cities served by CHESF and FURNAS.
It is necessary, however, to comment on some aspects of the preparation
and execution of the project financed by Loan 2564-BR.
Such comments are: a) during preparation and appraisal, a profound
analysis of the real economic and financial situation of the country should have
been carried out, including an analysis of the sector; b) CHESF, one of the
executors of the project, assumed contractual commitments, which, due to the
economic and financial situation of the time, it had difficulty meeting--
commitments such as assuring adequate levels of tariffs, counterpart funds and
borrowings; and c) in the course of supervision by various missions, the Bank did
not give CHESF sufficient flexibility to adjust the project in order to use fully
the proceeds of the Loan for priority works.
If this practice had been used, CHESF would not have cancelled the
unused balance of US$39.7 million and would have avoided the unnecessary payment
of commitment fees.
Yours sincerely,
Jose Antonio Muniz Lopes,
Financial Director

1 The project was part of the 1984-1988 sector expansion program consisting of generation and transmission
works considered to be the minimun required to generate and transfer energy at acceptable levels of reliability.
Local power officials and staff of the World Bank and the InterAmerican DeveLopment Bank began to collaborate
on the definition of this program in January 1984.
2 Some of the transmission works of this project will not be completed until 1986 (or later).  This project
completion report assess actual results as of the date of loan closing:  December 31, 1992, i.e., when Bank
financing for the project terminated. To wait until construction of all works is complete would unduly delay
the usefulness of this assessment, especially with respect to the roles of the Bank, the Government, and the
Borrower.

out PSRP, as provided by Loan
2720-BR (SAL). In years
1987-1989, Bank and
Government did not agree on
revised PSRP and terms for
second SAL. In 1990, Bank
approved Loan 3227-BR (a
sector investment loan) based
on related Rate Adjustment
Plan (RAP); however, loan
agreement remained unsigned
for 22 months and financial
situation of the power sector
deteriorated. As prospects for
implementing RAP were dim,
Bank withdrew Loan 3227-BR
on April 20, 1992 and did not
extend closing date of Loan
2564-BR beyond December 31,
1992.

* The improved rating indicated the Bank's optimistic assessment with respect to
imptementation of the Rate Adjustment Plan (RAP) agreed in connection with Loan 3227-BR
(USS385 million; 1990). That is, the RAP was expected to lead to Improving the sector
and company finances and accelerating pace of project impLementation. The subsequent
"3" rating refLects the Bank's decision to withdraw Loan 3227-BR (04.20.92).
