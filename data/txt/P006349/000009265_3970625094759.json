It is a priority\n            project within the Government's 1984-88 Sector\n            Development Plan which the Bank has analyzed and approved\n            (para. 44).  The  loan will finance the construction of\n            transmission facilities included in the 1985-1992\n            transmission expansion programs of CHESF and FURNAS.  It\n            will provide for the construction of about 1,730\n            circuit-kilometers of high voltage (HV) transmission lines;\n            construction of eight new substations including the\n            installation of about 5,400 MVA of transformer capacity and\n            about 520 MVAR of reactor and capacitor banks.  It will,\n            furthermore, finance expansion of sixteen existing\n            substations adding about 1200 MVA of transformer capacity\n            and about 1,260 MVAR of reactor and capacitor banks.  The\n            project will also include training programs for CHESF and FURNAS."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
