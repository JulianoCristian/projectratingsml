The program supports measures to\n            consolidate and reinforce the tax reform efforts implemented\n            in 1996-97, and to launch a medium term effort to improve\n            the efficiency and equity of public spending. The first\n            tranche will be released upon effectiveness of the proposed\n            credit, subject to continuing satisfactory performance on\n            the macroeconomic front. A second tranche would be released\n            contingent upon. (i) presentation to the Parliament of a\n            draft 1999 budget; (ii) settlement of domestic arrears; and\n            (iii) completion of the verification and validation of all\n            its internal arrears not yet verified and validated and\n            presentation to IDA of a settlement plan.
