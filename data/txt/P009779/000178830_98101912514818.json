comprises four subprojects. The main subproject covers a\n            three-year time slice, from fiscal year 1981 to 1983, of the\n            P&T Telecommunications Branch's investment program.\n            It involves expansion of the present telecommunications\n            network through the provision of additional local telephone\n            switching and direct exchange lines, long-distance public\n            call offices and rural telephone exchanges, and trunk and\n            telex facilities. The subproject also includes the provision\n            of equipment and raw materials for P&T's\n            telecommunications workshops; equipment for P&T's\n            Telecommunications Research Center and its Technical and\n            Development Circle; transmission equipment; and computing\n            equipment for the four major metropolitan districts. The\n            three remaining subprojects comprise the upgrading and\n            modernization of the production facilities of the three\n            major Government-owned telecommunications equipment\n            manufacturers and the construction of a new factory for\n            each. The upgrading and modernization activities involve the\n            replacement of machinery in the production and tool-making\n            units, and the addition of modern testing and measuring\n            equipment to replace and supplement obsolete existing equipment."}, "docdt": "1981-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
