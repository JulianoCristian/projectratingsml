by the Government's Mahaweli Master Plan. The Project\n            builds on experience gained from ongoing\n            irrigation/settlement works in the area, as well as previous\n            schemes elsewhere in Sri Lanka, and is designed with the\n            view to replication in the future. It provides for\n            irrigation works and land development, agricultural\n            production support, and social infrastructure required for\n            completing Stage II of the Government's Plan. The\n            project includes major components for: irrigation\n            infrastructure; on-farm development; equipment, vehicles,\n            and facilities; agricultural extension and research; farm\n            equipment; storage, marketing, and processing; market roads;\n            schools, medical, and community facilities; village and\n            roads, settler assistance; and technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1977-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
