The only\n            significant delay experienced and the aspect of the project\n            where improvement could have been made was in identifying\n            and carrying out other studies/investigations in support of\n            the Accelerated Mahwell Program (AMP). However, the fact\n            that such assistance was not requested is evidence that this\n            project component was not particularly needed. The principle\n            lesson learned from this project is that the two years\n            provided for project implementation was not realistic. A\n            five-year implementation period for future technical\n            assistance credits is believed to be more appropriate,\n            particularly where studies of development alternatives are\n            involved which usually require further detailed review of\n            various options or plans to fully delineate the most viable\n            option or desirable use of a limited natural resource."}, "docdt": "1988-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
