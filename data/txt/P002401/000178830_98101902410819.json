improve the quality of primary education through support\n            for primary teacher training and provision of textbooks; and\n            (ii) increase access to primary education in rural areas\n            through the construction of primary schools. It also\n            provides assistance for the government's efforts to\n            strengthen educational planning, administration, management,\n            evaluation, and project implementation. Over a six-year\n            period, the project will construct and equip classrooms for\n            about 22,500 primary school students, staff housing, a new\n            teacher training college in Freetown, and facilities for a\n            textbook distribution service. It will also provide over one\n            million textbooks and teachers' guides. All primary\n            school children will benefit from the quality improvements\n            supported by the project. The project will provide increased\n            opportunities to attend school in the Northern area, which\n            is the least developed part of the country and where only 20\n            percent of school-age children currently attend school."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
