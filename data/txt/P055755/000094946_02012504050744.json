of the outcome\n            somewhat problematical. The World Bank adapted the various\n            project components to accommodate the frequent changes and\n            urgent needs that could not be financed through the\n            government's budget due to unavailability of funds. It\n            was under extraordinary circumstances--the mounting crisis,\n            riots on the streets, the deep political and policy changes,\n            the lack of budgetary resources for urgent technical\n            assistance, and the coordination challenges within and among\n            international financial institutions--that the objectives\n            and components of the project were designed and implemented;\n            and under which their outcome should be assessed. In this\n            context, the project outcome was unsatisfactory and the\n            project unsustainable. Although both Bank and Borrower\n            performances were rated as unsatisfactory, this simply\n            stated conclusion belies the extraordinary efforts\n            undertaken by both parties who were overwhelmed by a severe\n            financial crisis and a rapidly deteriorating political\n            situation. Lessons learned were several, including: For\n            crisis response lending, flexible design and rapid or timely\n            delivery are critical. Although a team specializing in\n            financial crisis management (the SFO team) was created to\n            deal with the East Asian crisis, this type of operation has\n            proven to be unsustainable within the Bank's\n            organizational structure and procedure."}, "docdt": "2001-11-28T00:00:00Z"}
