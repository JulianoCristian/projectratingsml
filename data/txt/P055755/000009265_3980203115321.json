Project\n            aims to restore market confidence by maintaining prudent\n            macroeconomic policies, addressing weaknesses in the\n            financial sector, and undertaking wide-ranging structural\n            reforms to improve economic efficiency and transparency. It\n            is one element in a larger package of external financial\n            assistance to help the government implement a comprehensive\n            policy package comprising three parts: a strong\n            macroeconomic framework, a strategy to reform the financial\n            sector with special emphasis on the banking system; and a\n            broad range of structural measures to sharpen\n            competitiveness and improve guidance. Staffs of the World\n            Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Asian\n            Development Bank are jointly assisting the government in\n            implementing the program by emphasizing different\n            components. The WB project components consist of 1)\n            technical assistance by foreign experts for portfolio,\n            financial, and system audits, particularly the evaluation of\n            rehabilitation plans for private banks; 2) the restructuring\n            of state banks with the resolution of bad debts of merged\n            banks; 3) strengthening the examination, supervision, and\n            regulatory functions of Bank Indonesia; and 4) a diagnostic\n            review of the legal and institutional infrastructure for\n            financial sector development."}, "docdt": "1997-11-20T00:00:00Z"}
