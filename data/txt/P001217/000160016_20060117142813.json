Two major lessons may be\n            drawn from the experience of this project: 1) Uncertainty\n            must be removed from core components before implementation\n            begins. The fact that in this case the program for\n            relocating those willing to move from the reserve was not\n            agreed before the project became effective handicapped the\n            implementation of the whole community development component.\n            Unless local communities believe that their interests are\n            central to project design, they are unlikely to actively\n            support implementation. 2) When a relatively small,\n            stand-alone objective, such as conserving the unique\n            biodiversity of the Tana River Primate National Reserve, is\n            considered as the basis for a project, the design must look\n            beyond the immediate area linked to project operations, and\n            must take into account those conditions in the wider region\n            that can have a crucial impact on its success or failure."}, "docdt": "2005-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
