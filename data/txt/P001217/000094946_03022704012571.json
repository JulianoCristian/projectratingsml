Sustainability of the modest project\n            achievement, of relative stability of the primate\n            populations, and (perhaps) a reduction in the rate of\n            habitat destruction and degradation within the project zone,\n            is unlikely, following an abrupt closure of the project in\n            the absence of further intervention. Both the World\n            Bank's and Borrower's performances received an\n            unsatisfactory rating. Lessons learned were several: 1)\n            Unless communities believe that their interests are at the\n            heart of project design, they are unlikely to actively\n            support project implementation. Making the improvement of\n            local livelihoods a secondary objective, merely to reduce\n            pressure on biodiversity, may be counterproductive. 2) A\n            four-year time horizon is insufficient to achieve\n            significant community participation, change livelihood\n            strategies, and complete a voluntary relocation exercise, in\n            a situation where community support for the project at the\n            outset is at best shaky and divided, especially when the\n            executing agency has little prior experience in managing\n            such activities. 3) The eligibility of expenditures, to\n            promote sustainable economic development as a strategy for\n            achieving sustainable global beenfits for biodiversity\n            conservation, must be agreed upon prior to project approval,\n            and realistic cost estimates for such expenditures must be\n            included in the project document. 4) This project\n            demonstrated that even in situations where there is a lack\n            of trust, it is possible to have dialoguw with community\n            members, and better participation by communities in reserve\n            managmeent can be achieved. 5) Complex and conflicting\n            management and reporting lines for project staff operating\n            in the context of a larger institution, can cause delays in\n            decision-making and project implementation. 6)\n            Administrative capacity of the implementing agency and major\n            collaborating institutions, in carrying out procurement,\n            financial management and reporting, must be considered very\n            carefully when establishing project disbursement schedules.\n            7) The government and other stakeholders considered the\n            resettlement package expensive, and raised concerns about\n            precendents being set, which would be impossible to follow\n            in future non-Bank-funded activities. A less comprehensive\n            compensation package might not have raised the same concern\n            about the project having shifted all its emphasis and\n            resources onto resettlement activities. 8)When significant\n            activities in the critical path, such as research and\n            monitoring, are to be carried out by a cooperating\n            institution, rather than directly by the executing agency,\n            it is essential to ensure that the operational linkages for\n            this collaboration are clear and workable. A functional\n            Project Steering Committee will then be all the more\n            important to ensure performance of all partners. 9) Conflict\n            can arise when the Bank as implementing agency must follow\n            its internal operational policies and procedures when it\n            comes to issues like resettlement, and GEF, as the source of\n            funding, clooses not to finance the implementation\n            activities necessary for compliance with Bank policies."}, "docdt": "2003-01-10T00:00:00Z"}
