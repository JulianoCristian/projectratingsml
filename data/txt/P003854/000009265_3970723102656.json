are to: (a)\n            strengthen Indonesia's research and development\n            capacity by developing a nucleus of a well-trained\n            Indonesian scientific and technical manpower through\n            programs of study in science and technical fields; (b)\n            develop effective policies and procedures for the\n            implementation and monitoring of overseas fellowship\n            programs; and (c) develop and strengthen collaborative\n            relationships between Indonesian and foreign universities\n            and research institutions. The project would focus on six\n            key government research institutes in science and\n            technology, which would provide a pool of qualified\n            candidates for advanced training. The project would provide\n            overseas and local training and technical assistance in\n            establishing a management system and graduate reintegration\n            program. The main benefit of the project would be the\n            improved technical and managerial competence of the project\n            institutes' staff and an increase in the country's\n            stock of well-trained scientific and technical manpower. The\n            project would also have a long-term impact on the university\n            system. The major risk arises from the complexities of\n            managing such a sizable and diverse overseas fellowship\n            program. The technical assistance to support the\n            establishment of a management system should reduce this risk."}, "docdt": "1985-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
