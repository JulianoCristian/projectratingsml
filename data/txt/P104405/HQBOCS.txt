            Dear Mr. Boahene,

                            Pre-paid Health Scheme Pilot in Nigeria Project, (P104405)
                             Amendment to the GPOBA Grant Agreement (TF092182)

                    We refer to the Global Program on Output Based Aid ("GPOBA") GrAnt Agreement
            ("Agreement") for the above-mentioned Project, dated October 23, 2008, between the
            Stichting Health Insurance Fund ("Recipient") and the International Development Association
            ("IDA") acting as an administrator of the Global Program on Output Based Aid. We also
            refer to a letter dated April 27 2012 from Stichting Health Insurance Fund (HIF), requesting
            the Bank to consider a proposal to amend the Grant Agreement on the following restructuring
            terms: a) an extension of 10 months from June 30, 2013 to April 30, 2014; b) a reallocation of
            funds between grant categories.

                   Therefore, we propose to amend the Agreement in respect of the provisions below:

                     1. The table set forth in Section IV. A. 2 of Schedule 2 to the Agreement shall be
                        deleted in its entirety and replaced with the table set forth in Annex I to this
                        Amendment.

                    2.   Section IV.Bh in Schedule 2 is amended to read as follows:

                             "6.      The Closing Date is April 30, 2014."

                 All other provisions of the Agreement, except as herein amended, shall remain in full
            force and effect.

                    Please indicate agreement to the foregoing, on behalf of the Recipient, by
            countersigning and dating the form of confirmation on the two original copies of this letter
            provided and returning one original, as countersigned, to us. Upon receipt by the World Bank
            of the copy of this letter countersigned by the Recipient, this amendment shall become
            effective as of the date of its countersignature.

                                          Sincerely,
