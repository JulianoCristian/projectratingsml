                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main goals of the project are as follows:
                          1.      Encouraging low-income Nigerian families to enroll in pre-paid health insurance plans as a way to access affordable primary and maternal care, as well as
                         treatment for prevalent diseases;
                          2.      Increasing the utilization and efficiency of idle private sector capacity to meet the country#s healthcare needs, instead of constructing new public facilities;
                          3.      Establishing and strictly enforcing standards of care in the private health sector, thereby restoring confidence among insurance beneficiaries; and,
                          4.      Demonstrating the viability and long-term sustainability of community health plans to encourage other HMOs to offer affordable and appropriately designed
                         health insurance plans to low-income populations.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         a.       Enrollment
                         The project began with considerable delay (project signing date October 2007, and actual start date August 2009), because it took longer than anticipated to effectively reach out to
                         the beneficiary population through grass-root activities, and overcome initial mistrust against this novel scheme that resulted from a fraudulent scheme that operated in the market in
                         2006 as well as a general the lack of understanding of the insurance concept.
                         Out of a project objective of enrolling 22,500 people, 13,473 persons were insured in January 2012, thanks to additional marketing and capacity building efforts supported by the
                         release of unallocated funds under the project. However, after exhaustion the extra marketing budget for enrollment and re-enrollment, associated to the “co-payment” increase by

                         72% (from 1,450 to 2,500 Naira, as per the original design of the project), enrollment figures are currently at 8,862 beneficiaries as of May 2013, well below the target of 22,500.

                         b.        Quality standards
                         The progress of compliance with standards and performance improvement is monitored throughout the program. To achieve this, quality improvement plans (also called Upgrade
                         Plans) are developed for individual facilities and the implementation of the quality improvement activities is monitored. Upgrade plans for the period October 2011 to December 2012,
                         were developed following baseline assessments conducted between May and July 2011 for all the primary care provider facilities in the Health Insurance Fund (HIF) program
                         implemented by Hygeia Community Health Care (HCHC) in Nigeria. A monitoring visit was paid to the 10 facilities in the program, and 80% (8 out of 10) of the facilities assessed
                         attained and exceeded the target set for them for this round of assessments.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project began with considerable delay (project signing date October 2007, and actual start date August 2009), because it took longer than anticipated to effectively reach out to
                         the beneficiary population through grass-root activities, and overcome initial mistrust against this novel scheme that resulted from a fraudulent scheme that operated in the market in
                         2006 as well as a general the lack of understanding of the insurance concept. The original closing date was June 30, 2013, and a 10 months extension has been approved so as to
                         properly close the project.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
                         There are no related projects.
