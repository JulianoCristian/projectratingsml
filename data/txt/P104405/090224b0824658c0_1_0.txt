                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main goals of the project are as follows:
                          1.      Encouraging low-income Nigerian families to enroll in pre-paid health insurance plans as a way to access affordable primary and maternal care, as well as
                         treatment for prevalent diseases;
                          2.      Increasing the utilization and efficiency of idle private sector capacity to meet the country#s healthcare needs, instead of constructing new public facilities;
                          3.      Establishing and strictly enforcing standards of care in the private health sector, thereby restoring confidence among insurance beneficiaries; and,
                          4.      Demonstrating the viability and long-term sustainability of community health plans to encourage other HMOs to offer affordable and appropriately designed
                         health insurance plans to low-income populations.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                            Yes            No

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         a.        Enrollment
                         The project began with considerable delay (project signing date October 2007, and actual start date August 2009), because it took longer than anticipated to effectively reach out to
                         the beneficiary population through grass-root activities, and overcome initial mistrust against this novel scheme that resulted from a fraudulent scheme that operated in the market in
                         2006 as well as a general lack of understanding of the insurance concept.
                         Out of a project objective of enrolling 22,500 people, 13,473 persons were insured in January 2012, thanks to additional marketing and capacity building efforts supported by the
                         release of unallocated funds under the project. However, after exhausting the extra marketing budget for enrollment and re-enrollment, and largely due to the “co-payment” increase

                         by 72% (from 1,450 to 2,500 Naira, as per the original design of the project), enrollment figures dropped to 8,862 beneficiaries as of May 2013, and continued to decline steadily
                         afterwards, reaching 6,629 as at November 2013 and 4,884 at the end of January 2014. An additionally important factor behind the declining enrollments since mid-2013 was the
                         decision to close the project by April 30, 2014, a decision which was badly received by the beneficiaries and their leaders despite the assurances of other arrangements for a
                         transition to a non-subsidized scheme.

                         b.       Quality standards
                         The progress of compliance with standards and performance improvement is monitored throughout the program. To achieve this, quality improvement plans (also called Upgrade
                         Plans) are developed for individual facilities and the implementation of the quality improvement activities is monitored. At the end of 2013, based on all the quality improvement
                         measures achieved, five out of the fifteen Lagos providers had attained SafeCare Level 3, one provider SafeCare Level 2 with the other providers on SafeCare Level 1 though with
                         the exception of 3 providers, all had improved annual scores at the quality assessments compared with the previous year. Worthy of note is that it is possible to improve annual
                         assessment scores and not move up SafeCare Levels as the progression to the next level is based on an algorithm that ensures the different criteria assigned to each level are
                         achieved.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project began with considerable delay (project signing date October 2007, and actual start date August 2009), because it took longer than anticipated to effectively reach out to
                         the beneficiary population through grass-root activities, and overcome initial mistrust against this novel scheme that resulted from a fraudulent scheme that operated in the market in
                         2006 as well as a general the lack of understanding of the insurance concept. The original closing date was June 30, 2013, and a 10 months extension has been approved so as to
                         properly close the project.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
