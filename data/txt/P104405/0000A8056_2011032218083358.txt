                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main goals of the project are as follows:
                          1.       Encouraging low-income Nigerian families to enroll in pre-paid health insurance plans as a way to access affordable primary and maternal care, as well
                         as treatment for prevalent diseases;
                          2.       Increasing the utilization and efficiency of idle private sector capacity to meet the country#s healthcare needs, instead of constructing new public
                         facilities;
                          3.       Establishing and strictly enforcing standards of care in the private health sector, thereby restoring confidence among insurance beneficiaries; and,
                          4.       Demonstrating the viability and long-term sustainability of community health plans to encourage other HMOs to offer affordable and appropriately
                         designed health insurance plans to low-income populations.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As of January 2011, 9,700 members had been enrolled into the scheme. After a slow take up period for the program, targeted consumer education workshops and a better
                         enrollment infrastructure has enabled the project to be on track with its development objectives. The 8 hospitals available in the network is set to be increased to 10 in order to
                         increase proximity to CAPDAN members residential areas. The last evaluation of the quality of care of the hospitals in the network is satisfactory.
