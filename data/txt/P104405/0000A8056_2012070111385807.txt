                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main goals of the project are as follows:
                          1.      Encouraging low-income Nigerian families to enroll in pre-paid health insurance plans as a way to access affordable primary and maternal care, as well as
                         treatment for prevalent diseases;
                          2.      Increasing the utilization and efficiency of idle private sector capacity to meet the country#s healthcare needs, instead of constructing new public facilities;
                          3.      Establishing and strictly enforcing standards of care in the private health sector, thereby restoring confidence among insurance beneficiaries; and,
                          4.      Demonstrating the viability and long-term sustainability of community health plans to encourage other HMOs to offer affordable and appropriately designed
                         health insurance plans to low-income populations.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         At the time when this ISR was due, a supervision mission was being conducted in order to review operational fiduciary compliance issues. Also, as discussed in the previous ISR,
                         additional data and lessons from project design and implementation were being collected in order to better inform the project restructuring proposal to be presented to Management.
                         Lastly, the project team was awaiting from the funding unit GPOBA additional clearances on the scope of the restructuring, clearance which has been received.
                         Another ISR which will include the full BTOR will be submitted upon completion of the review. Only partial information are presented here.

                         January 2012: 13,473; March 2012: 12,133
                         By the beginning of January 2012, 13,473 were enrolled in the program. In January, a new co-payment of 2,500 Naira was introduced (as per the GPOBA policies), which is about
                         72% increase of the previous co-payment (1,450 Naira). The introduction of a new co-payment coupled with limited marketing and outreach activities has contributed to a significant
                         drop in enrollment to 12,133 in March 2012. The reduction in enrollment in relation to the introduction of new co-payment is in line with the forecast of the Price Sensitivity Study in
                         performed 2011.
                         The lessons learned from this project show that additional marketing budget is needed for successful enrollment, re-enrollment and the introduction of co-payment increase. Due to
                         migration, continuous education and mobilization of the target population for enrollment is crucial. Due to these reasons, the Health Insurance Fund have been discussing with the
                         GPOBA and World Bank for changes in the CAPDAN contract, including increased marketing budget since July 2011. The potential negative consequences of delay in deciding on
                         the CAPDAN restructuring were communicated to the GPOBA.
                         2. Utilization: verified utilization figures will be available in the next ISR
                         3. Quality of service standards: A total of ten (10) facilities were assessed in Lagos, all of which provide service to the CAPDAN enrollees. Ninety percent of the providers achieved

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. Based on the delay in the project start up of approximately one year (mainly reaching the appropriate project enrollment level), the team proposes a one-year extension of the
                         project duration to July 2014.
                         2. Based on the PSS and following the Output Based Aid requirements as set in the Operations Manual (OM), the team proposes to increase the premium co-payment gradually to
                         reach a level that is still affordable by the community, and that comes near to the co-payment target set out in the OM.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
                         There are no related projects.
