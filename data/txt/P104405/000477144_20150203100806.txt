1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1       Context at Appraisal

Country and sector background
1.      Nigeria is the largest oil exporter, has the largest economy, and is the most populous country (174
million) in the Africa region. It is ethnically diverse and has more than 400 linguistic groups in 36
decentralized states in the federal republic. Lagos state, with a population of over 9 million, is the second
largest populous state after Kano state. Nigeria, a lower middle-income country, has had a strong economic
growth rate at about 6 to 8 percent annually in the last decade. However, 46 percent of the population live
below the poverty line and 67 percent live on less than US$1.25 a day. The life expectancy at birth is 52
years.

2.      Nigeria is not on track to achieve the health Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Nigeria
accounts for 13 percent of all under-five deaths worldwide and the under-five mortality rate in 2013 was
117 deaths per 1,000 live births, which is far higher than the MDG 4 target of 71 in 2015. The maternal
mortality ratio has decreased from 1,200 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 560 in 2013
but the average annual percentage decline is below the expected 5.5 percent needed to achieve MDG 5.
According to the 2013 Demographic and Health Survey, while 61 percent of pregnant women had at least
one antenatal care (ANC) visit (51 percent had the recommended 4 or more visits, slightly higher than 45
percent in 2008), only 36 percent delivered in a health facility (35 percent in 2008) and a mere 11 percent
of women use modern contraceptives (same in 2008). Further, only 25 percent of children age 12-23
months are fully immunized (23 percent in 2008) and 25 percent of children under-five are underweight
(23 percent in 2008). The HIV prevalence among adults aged 15 to 49 years is 3.2 percent and 19.8 percent
of eligible children and adults are receiving antiretroviral treatment.

3.      Health expenditure per capita is US$94 and out-of-pocket health expenditure (percent of total
expenditure on health) is high at 66 percent 1. The private and public health expenditures account for 4.2
percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, of gross domestic product. In 1999, the Nigeria Government
established the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), a social healthcare scheme. It was officially
launched in 2005 but had only 1.2 million beneficiaries (almost all civil servants) in 2009. Health
insurance remains rare among the poor and those in the informal sector.

Rationale for Bank assistance and link to Country Assistance Strategy
4.       This project was to provide health insurance coverage to a low-income group in the private sector
(that is not covered by the NHIS) who were not necessarily the poorest and could afford pay co-premium,
thereby contributing to reducing out-of-pocket expenditure. The project was to contribute to Nigeria’s
higher-level objectives such as the MDGs, commitment to establishing pro-poor financial protection
systems including a Community-Based Social Health Insurance schemes (CBHIS) as outlined in the 2010
– 2015 National Strategic Health Development Plan (NSHDP) and the 2004 revised National Health
Policy.

5.      The project was consistent with the World Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). Easy
access to health insurance for all Nigerians was one of the key activities to be addressed in the 2010-2013
CPS pillar II: sustained improvement in access to, quality and utilization of human development services.

Nigeria Pre-Paid Health Scheme Project
6.      The project subsidized the insurance premium for low-income employees and their families of
small businesses in CAPDAN in Ikeja, Lagos. New enrollments were on a monthly basis and the enrollees
were provided an identification card after payment of the co-premium for a full year. Apart from the
annual co-premiums, the enrollees did not make any payment at the point of service (see Table 1 for
benefits package). Each enrollee selected a preferred primary care provider among the Service Provider
Network (SPN) and was eligible to access the provider after a maximum 30-day wait period.

7.      The three main implementing agencies were Stichting Health Insurance Fund (HIF), PharmAccess
Foundation (PAF), and Hygeia Community Health Care (HCHC). The International Development
Association, acting as administrator of the Global Partnership on Output-based Aid (GPOBA), signed a
grant agreement with HIF 2 on October 23, 2008 to: manage the flow of funds from GPOBA for the project;
submit semi-annual withdrawal requests to GPOBA; provide scheme oversight through its board of
directors; publicize the project and lobby donors to fund further replication; select an external auditor to
review the use of GPOBA funds; and enter into an implementation, monitoring and evaluation agreement
with PAF.

8.     The main functions of PAF 3 (agreement signed on May 15, 2009) were: manage project
implementation; independently verify outputs that will trigger disbursements to HCHC (bi-monthly audits
of enrollment levels and co-payments; and semi-annual service provider quality assessment); conduct
medical due diligence to determine upgrading needs for service providers and quality targets; work with
HCHC to create and approve upgrading plans for providers; provide oversight for the upgrading of
providers; facilitate the upgrading process by supporting training for service providers; financial
management of project including regular reporting to HIF; manage payment to HCHC; manage reporting
process with HCHC; and provide financial and operational reporting to HIF.

9.      HCHC is part of Hygeia Nigeria Limited, the largest private health care provider in Nigeria. The
main functions of HCHC, contracted by PAF on May 15, 2009, were: manage all aspects of the health
insurance scheme, including enrollment, co-payment collection, claim processing, payments to providers,
and data collection; draft upgrading plan for providers; manage provider upgrades (with oversight from
PAF) and procure required goods and works; market the project to the target population; implement the
project’s anti-fraud mechanisms including providing ID cards to all plan participants; work to prevent
fraud by analyzing beneficiary utilization data; divulge all necessary information that PAF and HIF may
need to verify revenues, costs and profits associated with this project.

 HIF is a Dutch non-profit organization which provides targeted subsidies to stimulate demand for pre-paid health insurance
schemes in Africa using donor funding and an output based aid approach. In 2006 it received 100 million euros from the
Netherlands Ministry of Development Cooperation to implement health insurance scheme in four African countries, with
Nigeria being the first.

 PAF, founded in 2000, is also a Dutch non-profit organization with local offices in Nigeria and other countries. Its core
functions include designing and implementing health insurance schemes and improving quality of care.

1.2       Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

10.    The PDO (as stated in the Grant Agreement) was to establish a community health scheme that
would provide affordable pre-paid health insurance plans to low-income employees (and their families)
of small businesses in CAPDAN of the lkeja computer village in Lagos.

11.     In the operations manual, the PDO is stated as: to increase access to quality basic health care in
Nigeria by providing pre-paid health insurance plans to low-income small business employers (whose
annual income is below 300,000 NGN) and their households and employees and their households whose
businesses belong to the Computer and Allied Products Association (CAPDAN) in Lagos. The Grant
Agreement PDO referred to only low-income employees but the operations manual indicated both
employees and employers. Considering the Grant Agreement stipulated that “in the event that any
provision of the operations manual shall be in conflict with any provision of this agreement, the provisions
of this agreement shall prevail”, the ICR employed the PDO in the grant agreement in the assessment of
the achievement of PDO (efficacy) (described in section 3.2).

12.       The project commitment paper 4 had no overall objective but had four specific objectives:
  I.      Encouraging low-income Nigerian families to enroll in pre-paid health insurance plan as a way to
          access affordable primary and maternal care, as well as treatment for prevalent diseases;
    II.   Increasing the utilization and efficiency of idle private sector capacity to meet the country’s
          healthcare needs, instead of constructing new public facilities;
III.      Establishing and strictly enforcing standards of care in the private health sector, thereby restoring
          confidence among insurance beneficiaries; and,
IV.       Demonstrating the viability and long-term sustainability of community health plans to encourage
          other HMOs to offer affordable and appropriately designed health insurance plans to low-income
          populations.

13.     The key PDO indicator (in the operations manual 5 and project commitment paper) was number of
enrollees in the pre-paid health insurance scheme (target value of 22,500 beneficiaries).

1.3       Revised PDO and Key Indicators

14.       The PDO and key indicators were not revised.

1.4       Main Beneficiaries

15.    The main beneficiaries are the low-income small business employers and their families (whose
annual income is below 300,000 Nigerian Naira [NGN] and whose businesses belong to the CAPDAN6

  This is the equivalent of the WBG project appraisal document.

  The Grant agreement indicated that April 2009 operations manual would outline the “project performance indicators and
the procedures for the monitoring and evaluation of the Project”. There was no key outcome indicator in the grant
agreement.
6
  CAPDAN is a well-organized group that is registered with the Nigerian Government and represented by an elected
secretariat. It represents approximately 2,000 registered small business owners who operate kiosks selling mobile phones,
computer accessories and other electronic hardware. The average enterprise employs 3-6 people and has annual sales of about
US$75,000. The median income for employees and employers in 2008 were US$1,019 (NGN120,000) and US$4,077
(NGN480,000), respectively, with a combined median of US$1,529 (NGN180,000).

in Lagos) together with their employees and their families. Of the estimated CAPDAN target population
of 27,500, the project was expected to provide funding to subsidize access to the pre-paid health insurance
plan service for 22,500 people. The insurance packages would provide the beneficiaries coverage for
primary care, maternal care and treatment for high-risk diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and
tuberculosis through a SPN of clinics and hospitals.

1.5      Original Components

The project had the following components:
   a) Insurance Premium, Marketing and Upgrading Subsidies (total cost - US$4,574,000)
       Insurance Premium subsidies (US$4,143,000): Project was expected to subsidize health insurance
       premiums of enrollees from 85 percent in year 1 to 42.8 percent in the final year.
       Marketing subsidies (US$197,000): HCHC Limited, the implementing agency, was to be paid
       US$8.14 per new beneficiary enrolled to cover the education of the enrollees about the scheme,
       principles of insurances, the insurance package as well as extensive information, education and
       communication (IEC) outreach to the target population.
       Upgrading subsidies (US$234,000): HCHC had an established SPN of 10 primary care providers
       and 3 referral providers. However, two new medical service providers needed to be upgraded (to
       replace outdated medical equipment, improve physical infrastructure, install essential
       administrative systems, and training of health and administrative personnel) to join the SPN to
       expand access to care to CAPDAN enrollees.

      b) Monitoring and evaluation (total cost - US$953,000)
         Stichting HIF, the GPOBA grant recipient, was to establish an implementation, monitoring and
         evaluation agreement with PAF to ensure a) accuracy of the financial and medical reports
         submitted by HCHC, and b) quality assurance (minimum standards of care at the provider level).

      c) Project Management (total cost - US$261,000)
         Funding of the operating costs associated with project management by HIF.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design, and Quality

18.   Project preparation: An existing Lagos community health insurance program for Low-income
market women (in 10 markets), which had been established by HIF, PAF and HCHC (the same




                                                    5
implementing agencies) informed the project design 7. Consequently, the same SPN which had two years
of previous experience with the Lagos market women scheme was enlisted in this project, and two new
service providers were added and upgraded to expand access to health care for CAPDAN enrollees.
Similarly, previously tested independent verification and monitoring processes were employed in this
project.

19.      HCHC undertook a market survey to identify 12 potential target groups for the project including
the Lagos State Taxi Drivers Association, the Nigerian Association of Hairdressers and Cosmetologists,
the Nigerian Union of Tailors, the Performing Musicians Association of Nigeria, and CAPDAN. The latter
was selected as the target group for the project based on two key criteria: a) sustainability (ability to pay
the full premiums when the subsidy ends based on their incomes and willingness of the employers to share
the cost of the insurance premium), and b) geographic concentration (which was expected to facilitate
marketing, enrollment, collections and customer satisfaction monitoring). Additionally, the findings of a
target population study informed the project design. 8

20.     Project design: The project design was reportedly consistent with the six core concepts of Output-
Based Aid (OBA) (described in detailed in section 3.1 on relevance of design). According to the project
commitment paper, the annual premium of US$68.06 in the first year was comparable to those of similar
schemes that the NHIS regulates. It was expected to increase gradually to $92.92 in the final year of the
project (Table 3). To ensure sustainability of the project, the co-premiums of enrollees were expected to
increase from 15 percent in year 1 to 57 percent in year 5. Although CAPDAN employers and employees
indicated a willingness to pay NGN2,000 (US$15) per annum per individual with a gradual increase in
the co-premium to cover the total insurance premium within ten years, HCHC and PAF thought that was
not affordable. Instead they recommended an initial co-premium of NGN1,200 (US$9), or 15 percent of
the total first year premium cost of US$60, to motivate enrollment of entire families.

21.     HCHC was expected to pay 80 percent of the premiums (premium subsidies from GPOBA and co-
premiums from enrollees) to services providers and retain the remaining 20 percent to cover its costs and
profit. Considering that at project design, HCHC’s operating costs were higher at 26 percent, HCHC was
expected to be more efficient in curtailing its operating costs.

22.     Of the 80 percent of premiums that HCHC paid to service providers, 70 percent were capitation
fees (fixed up-front monthly payments to cover primary care) and 30 percent were fee-for-service (for
more complicated services which needed prior authorization of HCHC and after which the HCHC would
reimburse the provider based on an invoice). Thus, the service providers were to bear the risk of the cost
of primary care delivery exceeding the capitation payment while HCHC were to bear the risk of excess
fee-for-service claims.



7
  In January 2007, HCHC, PAF and HIF partnered to implement donor subsidized community health insurance schemes for
low income Nigerian populations. This was to promote access to healthcare for low income groups and strengthening the
capacity of enlisted public and private healthcare providers to deliver quality healthcare services. The Lagos market women
program was financed by the Dutch Government. Apart from the Lagos market women program, the three agencies also run a
community health insurance scheme for farmers in Kwara state.

23.     In the project design enrollment was to be stopped in December 2012, 6 months before the original
closing date of June 2013. Considering that in the project commitment paper a follow-on Phase II project
was envisaged, setting a pre-determined date for stopping enrollment during Phase I would reduce the
number of enrollees at project closure. 9 As described in the section on achievement of project development
objectives, this adversely contributed to the project not meeting the enrollment target.

24.     Assessment of risks and mitigation measure: Some critical risks were identified during appraisal
and remedial measures put in place, as described in Table 4 in Annex 2. Notably, the willingness to pay
for increasing co-premiums by the enrollees was underestimated.

25.     There was no formal quality at entry review for this project.

2.2     Implementation

26.    Enrollment and registration started in June 2009 and enrollees started accessing care in July 2009.
PAF regularly submitted semi-annual progress (verification) reports to HIF and noted any implementation
constraints and recommended corrective actions. Additionally, the World Bank team produced
Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) which provided an update on implementation progress.
A midterm review was undertaken in December 2012 and the project was restructured in June 2013.

Level II restructuring-delay in approval of extension of project closing date
27.     The World Bank approved a Level II restructuring on June 25, 2013, which entailed: a) extension
of closing date from June 30, 2013 to April 30, 2014 and b) reallocation of funds between grant categories
(noted above). HIF put in a formal request on April 27, 2012 for the amendment of the grant agreement
(but discussions started in June 2011 and HIF recommendations for restructuring were noted in the 2011
semi-annual progress) and on May 25 2012, a GPOBA Panel of Experts endorsed the proposal for
restructuring and emphasized that the lessons learned in the initial phase of the project should be
incorporated in the restructuring paper. This was discussed further during the midterm review in
December 2012 and the restructuring was approved 6 months later. The long deliberative discussions
focused on the viability and sustainability of the scheme, and the reputational risks in abruptly closing the
project. Nevertheless, this delay created some uncertainty, and may have modestly affected the
achievement of the target enrollment.

Joint review missions and midterm review
28.     The WBG team and the implementing agencies (HIF PAF, and HCHC) undertook joint review
missions. The findings were presented in Aide Memoires and 7 ISRs. The December 4-6, 2012 midterm
review assessed implementation status, the pros and cons of the extension of the project closing date, and
lessons learned. Key elements affecting implementation are described below.

Increased co-premium and decreased enrollment
29.    The co-premium was expected to increase steadily from US$10.21 in 2009 to US$53.16 in 2013
(Table 3). During project implementation, the co-premiums were increased twice: in February 2011 from
US$10.16 to US$11.33 and in January 2012 from US$11.33 to US$19.53. Although these were modest
increases compared to the planned increases, the increase by US$8.20 in January 2012 negatively affected

9
 In the project commitment paper, the scheme was designed as a 10-year program divided into two phases and enrollees
were expected to be able to afford the full premium at the end of the 10 years.


                                                           7
enrolment with a downward trend until project closing (Figure 1). In addition to the increase in the co-
premium, other measures implemented in 2012 to reduce costs (such as exclusion of meals from the
package for inpatients, and reduction in HCHC enrolment staff) further contributed to the decline in new
enrolments in 2012 (see Figure 1).

Discontinuing enrollment
30.      A decision was made to discontinue enrollment from April 30, 2013, which contributed to the
continuing downward trend in number of enrollees which began in January 2012 (see Figure 1 in section
3.2). As result of the delay in the decision to extend the closing date, HCHC limited its marketing and IEC
activities to new enrollments. The number of HCHC enrolment staff 10 was reduced by over 80 percent.
The remaining enrolment staff catered to re-enrolment via text messages and phone calls. Additionally,
monthly performance reviews of enrolment staff was curtailed to quarterly reviews.

Overutilization capacity of service providers
31.     Maintaining optimum capacity utilization of the service providers was imperative to improve
efficiency. A utilization capacity assessment in June/July 2012 revealed overutilization at Crystal
Specialist Hospital (more than the recommended 85 percent utilization capacity), HCHC suspended new
enrollments at the hospital and identified a new service provider in the vicinity to cater to new enrollees.
Besides, Crystal hospital undertook an extension of the hospital to cater to the expanded CAPDAN
enrollees.

Inadequate marketing subsidies
32.     HCHC undertook extensive marketing outreach, which was costly and quickly exhausted the funds
allocated to marketing subsidizes (details in Annex 2). These subsidies were output-based with a fixed
amount (US$8.14) paid for each new enrollee. Some marketing activities was necessary to stimulate
demand prior to enrollment, though. There were high fixed costs such as salaries of canvassers, which had
to be paid irrespective of the number of enrollees. Instead of salaries, paying commissions to the insurance
sales personnel would have reduced the marketing cost.

Excess medical payments
33.     The medical payments for both capitation and fee-for-service exceeded the budget and a request
for reallocation of expenditure categories was made to the WBG. The payment for fee-for-service were in
excess 11 due to the increased utilization of services (particularly maternity services and hypertension
treatment). The list of fee-for-services is in annex 2. In 2012, HCHC realized the payment for the treatment
of hypertension was higher than the actual cost of treatment and accordingly reduced the fee for
hypertension and instituted a new hypertension treatment protocol. It is possible that the high fee for
hypertension motivated service providers to unduly treat hypertensive cases. Besides, the high proportion
of females of reproductive age in the target population contributed to the increased payment for maternity
services. Nevertheless, some service providers experienced increased cost over and above the capitation
payments. 12 For instance, two Lagoon hospitals which reportedly experienced steep losses dropped out of




10
   There were 20 full-time canvassers and 1 enrollment officer in 2011
11
   Excess medial payments per enrollee increased from about US$6 per enrollee in 2010 to about US$30 per enrollee in 2013.
12
   The capitation rates were: N425 in 2009, N425 in 2010, N475 in 2011, N525 in 2012, N525 in 2013 and N525 in 2014.


                                                            8
the provider network since the capitation fees were much lower that the regular fees that were charged to
non-CAPDAN patients. 13

Service providers that joined and exited
34.     Eighteen service providers participated in the project. A map showing the location of the facilities
is in Annex 10. Shortly after implementation commenced there were 10 service providers but three left
the network (Lagoon Hospital Ikeja, Lagoon Hospital VI, and Topaz Clinic) mainly because of non-
profitability. Eight new providers joined (see Table 11 in Annex 2). No service providers had to leave the
network as a result of poor quality of care.

Training on family planning
35.      Given the high fertility rate in Nigeria, service providers expressed concern that family planning
services were not part of the benefits package. Accordingly, in November 2012 PAF and HCHC conducted
a 1-day training for service providers on family planning counselling and referral of enrollees to public
facilities where family planning commodities were free or subsidized.

Studies that informed implementation
36.     A number of studies were carried out which informed implementation including; a) the project
financed Market Research Consultancy (MRC) to conduct a Price Sensitivity Study (PSS) in 2011 which
recommended a maximum co-premium of NGN4,000; b) HIF with funding from the Dutch Ministry of
Foreign Affairs organized Choosing Health Plans All Together (CHAT) sessions in November and
December 2011 to solicit the views of market traders on the benefit package – primary health care and
maternity care were high priority; and c) a consultancy firm Milliman (from the Netherlands, India and
New York) was contracted to carry out a costing study in 2011 which informed the decision to increase
capitation fees from 475 Naira to 525 Naira effective January 1, 2012.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
37.     M&E Design. As noted in section 1.2, the PDO was to provide affordable pre-paid health
insurance plans to low-income employees in CAPDAN. The four specific objectives (in the June 2007
project commitment paper 14) and corresponding indicators (in the operations manual 15) are shown in
Table 2. Instead of the overall PDO (in the grant agreement) and 4 specific objectives (in the project
commitment paper), the PDO could have been better formulated as follows: to improve access to and
quality of primary health care services among poor CAPDAN employees and families by increasing
enrollment in pre-paid insurance scheme. Of the four specific objectives, measurable PDO indicators were
specified in the operations manual for two of the objectives but the remaining two had no associated PDO
indicators. Some more appropriate outcome indicators for this project are percentage of poor people who
have received essential Health, Nutrition and Population services, percentage of people experiencing
impoverishment due to out-of-pocket health care expenditures and percentage of people experiencing
catastrophic health expenditures but these were not measured or data was not available.




13
   The Lagoon Hospital Group, which is of part of the Hygeia Nigeria Limited, is pioneer of advanced medical care in
Nigeria and caters to rich clients. Lagoon hospital is closest of the CAPDAN village and had the highest enrollees.
14
   The project commitment paper is the equivalent of the WBG project appraisal document
15
   The operations manual has a number of indicators in its annex A that were to be reported in the semi-annual progress
reports.


                                                              9
38.    For objective 1, the indicator 1) total number of people enrolled in pre-paid health insurance
scheme is appropriate and has a baseline value of zero and a target of 22,500 people. The other relevant
intermediate results indicators that were tracked in the semiannual reports (or project administrative data
when available) but not in the ISRs were 16 : 2) total number of visits to health facilities; 3) number of
pregnant women who received ANC services; 4) number of deliveries in health facilities; 5) average
number of visits per enrollee per month; and 6) client satisfaction rate.

39.      Regarding objective 2, no indicator was provided in the operations manual. However, special
studies were carried out to provide data on two indicators: 7) provider utilization capacity (ability of
individual service providers to adequately cater to current enrollee population demands); and 8) network
utilization capacity (ability of the entire HCHC network to adequately cater to the needs of current and
projected enrollee population demands). For objective 3, there were two indicators in the operations
manual but they were not consistently tracked: 9) number of service providers in compliance with the
service quality standards specified by PAF (with a target of at least 14 of the 15 service providers meeting
the pre-defined quality standards) and 10) number of service providers removed from the network for not
complying with quality standards. The intermediate results indicator that was tracked was 11) annual
average (and individual service providers) SafeCare quality assessment scores. While there was no
indicator for objective 4 in the operations manual the l2) monthly re-enrollment (or renewal) rates was
tracked in the semiannual reports.

40.    The operations manual appropriately indicated that all the indicators were to be monitored in the
semiannual progress report. The baseline values were zero for most of the indicators except for the annual
average SafeCare quality assessment scores. Targets values were set for only two indicators: enrollment
numbers and number of service providers in compliance with the service quality standards specified by
PAF. Considering this was a pilot project, the absence of an impact evaluation in the project design is a
missed opportunity as it would have provided concrete evidence, which would have contributed to the
body of evidence on the efficacy and efficiency of community insurance programs.

 3. Establishing and strictly enforcing standards of care        Number of service providers in compliance with the
 in the private health sector                                    service quality standards specified by PAF
                                                                 Number of service providers removed from the
                                                                 network
 4. Demonstrating the viability and long-term                    No indicator
 sustainability of community health plans


41.     M&E implementation. HCHC regularly produced bi-monthly progress reports, which were
verified by PAF. These fed into the semi-annual progress reports that PAF regularly submitted to HIF

16
     There indicators have been included in this ICR in assessing the achievement of the PDO.


                                                              10
within two months of the closing date for the respective period. This conformed to the report format
specified in the operations manual and covered the indicators numbered 1, 2, 5, 11, and 12 above while
the remaining seven indicators were either presented in some of the reports or were in project
administrative records. Further, each report had sections on implementation constraints and
recommendations. The World Bank team also produced seven ISRs during project implementation (which
was adequate for the duration of the project) and included sections on issues for management actions.
However, the ISRs only monitored the following indicators: enrollment numbers, number of service
providers in compliance with the service quality standards specified by PAF, annual average SafeCare
quality assessment scores, re-enrollment rates, and number of health facilities constructed, renovated, and
or/equipped. The latter is a World Bank core sector indicator. Two other core sectors that should have
been tracked were: number of deliveries and number of pregnant women who received ANC.

42.      M&E utilization. Based on the semiannual reports and findings from supervision visits, HCHC
and PAF periodically provided feedback to the service providers as well as CAPDAN executives and
employees. Nevertheless, the reports were not shared with the Lagos State Government, a major
stakeholder regarding the sustainability of the project. The reports provided timely information, which
informed the implementation of the project. The project produced a wealth of community health insurance
data (including enrollment, co-payment collection, claim processing, payments to providers, and
utilization data) which will be useful to the Government in its plan to expand health insurance coverage
in Nigeria. It also informed the follow-on project designed by HCHC and PAF.

The overall quality of M&E is rated as modest.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance:

43.      Procurement
The project components entailed minimal procurement activities such as the upgrading of two health
facilities (minor renovations and equipment) and the recruitment of an external auditor. Nevertheless,
initially HCHC had low procurement capacity (there was no dedicated procurement officer), it was not
familiar with the World Bank procurement guidelines, and procurement filing was poor. However, it
improved over time. HCHC staff worked very closely with the Bank’s fiduciary team, and made constant
and regular recourse to the team to clarify procurement issues. Additionally, the World Bank procurement
officer provided hands-on training, which enabled the HCHC project staff to substantially implement the
procurement activities successfully up to project closure as reflected in the reports of Post Procurement
Reviews carried out on the project.

44.    Financial                                                                              management
HIF regularly submitted interim financial reports along with the semiannual progress reports. Annual
external audits were carried out, as per the grant agreement, and all the external auditor’s opinions were
unqualified. For most years, there were no serious internal control and accountability issues identified but
there were a few administrative issues identified in the last two years; these were however addressed by
November 2014, after project closure. The issues were non-provision of other supporting documents (apart
from the semi-annual progress reports) for Categories 1 and 2 in line with the Disbursement Letter and
non-replenishment of the Designated Account balance to agreed ceiling. This resulted in the Client using
its own fund to pre-finance project activities.




                                                    11
45.     Safeguards
According to the project commitment paper and Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet, the project was
classified as category C (i.e. minimal or no adverse environmental impact), but this classification was not
appropriate. The project should have been properly classified as category B (potentially adverse
environmental impacts) due to the healthcare waste generated from the increased utilization of services in
the health facilities that participated in the insurance scheme. Nevertheless, during implementation
safeguards issues were appropriately addressed. 17

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
46.     HCHC has designed a follow-on unsubsidized project Hygeia Better Life (HBL) Scheme without
financial contribution from HIF or the World Bank. 18 It was designed based on lessons learned from this
project as well as the one for the Lagos market women (LMW). HBL is unsubsidized and is open not only
to CAPDAN and LMW but also to other urban poor groups, markets and communities. It has a reduced
benefits package. Unlike this project which was marketed to individuals, HBL mainly offers a family
package with a maximum of two adults and 6 children. The premium for a family of 1, 2 or 3 is
NGN23,000 per annum as opposed to the NGN2,500 per individual in the previous project. There is a co-
payment of NGN100 per visit. Service providers receive only capitation payments with no fee-for-service
payments and there is a longer waiting period. The established HCHC administrative structures will be
used for running the HBL. For instance, two Quality Managers and one Project Accountant previous
project are involved in HBL.

47.    The key performance indicators that can be used to monitor the implementation of HBL are total
number of people enrolled in pre-paid health insurance scheme, re-enrollment rates, and annual average
SafeCare quality assessment scores. A rigorous impact evaluation should be incorporated in the HBL
design and implementation to capture evidence for the NHIS.

3.    Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives and Design

48.     Relevance of objectives. The project’s overall objective of providing affordable pre-paid health
insurance plans to low-income employees and their families in CAPDAN was highly relevant at project
design and at the time of project closure. It was consistent with Nigeria’s health sector priorities and with
the World Bank Group’s current country and sector strategies. The 2010 – 2015 NSHDP which is to
contribute to financial protection from catastrophic expenditures, mentioned CBHIS being implemented
jointly by HIF, PAF, and HCHC. The Presidential Summit on UHC in Nigeria on March 10, 2014 strongly
recommended all levels of Government to make progress towards UHC 19. Additionally, in the 2014-2017
World Bank Group CPS, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) proposed to support at least 2 states
with CBHIS in the engagement area coverage and quality of health services for the second strategic cluster
quality, effectiveness and efficiency of social service delivery at state level for greater social inclusion.
17
   During an implementation support mission, the World Bank team visited three service providers (Blue Cross Hospital,
Osuntuyi Medical Centre [Obanikoro], and St. Mary's Hospital) and noted that two had appropriately put in place some basic
healthcare waste management processes such as a) sharp disposal boxes in areas of the hospital in which they are used;
b) color coded mops; c) color coded waste bins; and d) posters indicating the basic cleanliness processes.
18
   As noted earlier, a two-phase 10 year program was envisaged in the project commitment paper but during implementation
it was realized that the scheme was not sustainable.
19
   Almost a decade after launching the NHIS, financial risk protection is 4 percent of the population.


                                                           12
Further, enabling countries to achieve UHC is the main mechanism that the World Bank HNP Global
Practice uses to achieve its goal of helping countries to end preventable deaths and disability through
Universal Health Coverage. .

49.     Relevance of design. Lessons learned in the implementation of CBHIS for LMW and in Kwara
state for poor farmers informed the project design such as identifying an experienced local insurer,
independent verification, and ensuring the provision of quality of care. The project design was in line with
the six core concepts of OBA:
   I.   providing insurance premium subsidies to low income employees and their families (the median
        income for employees in 2008 was US$1,019 [NGN120,000];
  II.   accountability for results (HCHC and service providers were to take performance and finance
        risks; this did not fully materialize since during implementation some service providers were
        reimbursed as a result of overutilization of services and HCHC was reimbursed for high marketing
        and administrative cost after restructuring. Thus, the risk was eventually transferred to the
        GPOBA);
 III.   encouraging innovation and efficiency (hospitals had special desks for CAPDAN enrollees and
        the SafeCare initiative was launched);
 IV.    using incentives to serve the poor (providers used the premium and upgrading subsidies to provide
        quality services to the poor);
  V.    conducting output verification and monitoring of results (payment of subsidies to HCHC were
        contingent on verification of outputs by PAF); and
 VI.    fostering sustainability (users were to pay lower monthly payments in line with affordability but
        as described later it turned out that the premium were only affordable up to US$11.33 despite
        careful selection of the target group; also the project experienced adverse selection with a high
        proportion of pregnant women and clients with chronic illnesses).

50.     However, there were some drawbacks to the design. This was one of the initial health projects
financed by the GPOBA when the World Bank HNP technical team 20 were not involved with project
preparation and may account for some of the foreseeable design drawbacks. A major flaw in the project
design was limited consultation with the Lagos State Government which was necessary for the long term
sustainability of the project. The first year premium subsidy of US$57.85 was 78% higher than the per
capita public health expenditure (US$32.53) in 2008 21 indicating the government could not afford the
scheme and raising the issue of sustainability from the outset 22. Another factor which contributed to the
low enrollment at project closure was the expectation that CAPDAN enrollees and employers and their
families would afford US$53.16 in the final year of the project when the median income for CAPDAN
employees was US$1,019. Additionally, enrollees were expected to pay increasingly higher co-premiums
without a concomitant expansion of the benefits package. Having comprehensive benefits package at the
outset guaranteed resistance from enrollees when the co-premiums were increased and indeed the increase
in co-premium from US$11.33 to US$19.53 (a 72 percent increase) in January 2012 led to a precipitous
drop in enrollment.

   In 2012, the actual premium subsidy was US$39.76, which was higher than the 2012 per capital public health expenditure
US$29.38

51.     Regarding the results framework, the objective of the project was clear but the enrollment target
was unrealistic given the drawbacks in the design noted above. 23 The three subsidies (insurance premium,
marketing and upgrading) in the project components were appropriate in achieving the project objective
but the amount allocated to the marketing subsidies should have been higher given that the concept of
health insurance was new to CAPDAN. The rating of the relevance of design is modest.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives (efficacy)
52.     Although both the project commitment paper and the operations manual had no structured results
framework, based on the project documents the ICR team developed the causal chain in Table 5 (Annex
2) and elaborated on the performance indicators in section 2.3 on the M&E design.

53.     As noted earlier in section 1.2, the PDO in the grant agreement (to establish a community health
scheme that would provide affordable pre-paid health insurance plans to low-income employees and their
families of small businesses in CAPDAN) was the basis for assessing efficacy. However, no PDO
indicator or target was mentioned in the grant agreement, which deferred to the operations manual. The
key target in the operations manual and the project commitment paper is 22,500 enrollees at project
closing. Thus, the ICR team considered the project’s achievement of this enrollment target and the
affordability of the pre-paid health insurance plans to low-income employees and their families as the
basis for the efficacy rating. Additionally to provide a fuller picture of the project’s achievements, the
assessment of the three other specific objectives in the project commitment paper are described and rated
separately below.

Enrollment in affordable pre-paid insurance plans and access to care
54.   The achievement of this objective is rated modest.

Enrollment
55.     Of the enrollment target of 22,500, only 4,884 (21.7 percent) was achieved at project closing.
However, the total number of beneficiaries (i.e. cumulative number enrolled at one time or the other during
the project period) was higher at 21,963. The number of enrollees increased steadily from 134 in July
2009 to a peak of 13,473 in December 2011 and then gradually decreased to a low of 4,884 in December
2013 (see Figure 1). The annual highest percentage of the planned target achieved was in 2011 when 81.7
percent of the target was achieved (13,473/16,500) (see Figure 2, Annex 2). The decline in enrollment
began when the co-premium was increased from N1,450 to N2,500. A smaller increase, in February 2011,
when the co-premium increased from N1,300 to N1,450 had no effect on the enrollment numbers. Given
that enrolment was discontinued from April 30, 2013 (section 2.2), one could make the case that the ICR
should use this date as the cut-off for assessment of the enrollment target. If so, 8,682 (38.6%) was
achieved in April 2013. Thus, with either cut-off dates, the project only partly achieved the enrollment
target.

Affordability of insurance Premium subsidies
56.    The project appropriately targeted low-income employees of CAPDAN (the median income for
employees in 2008 was US$1,019 [NGN120,000]) but employers with a median income of US$4,077
[NGN480,000] also enrolled in the scheme. 24 The enrollees were expected to afford co-premium amount

of NGN6,803 (57.2 percent of the total premium) in the final year of the project (Table 3). Despite the
fact that CAPDAN was selected from the list of potential poor target groups based on its relatively higher
income bracket, enrollment dropped precipitously when the co-premium was increased from NGN1,450
to NGN2,500 in January 2012. Thus, the annual planned co-premiums from 2011 (Table 3) were not
affordable and the effort to optimize both enrolment and co-premium payments was not realized.

Utilization of services
57.     The enrollees had access to and readily utilized health services. The average number of visits per
enrollee per month from August 2009 to February 2014 was 0.26, which is about 3.1 visits per enrollee


                                                                                                                                15
per year. There was an initial high use of services (0.43 per enrollee per month) which then dipped to 0.16
in March 2010, and finally picked up again and was generally above 0.20 (2.4 visits per enrollee per year)
for the remaining period (Figure 3, Annex 2).

58.     As shown in Table 6 in Annex 2, there were a total of 112,827 visits to the health facilities in 2009-
2013 (outpatient attendance constituted 97 percent). The most frequent illness treated was malaria
(42,848) followed by upper respiratory tract infection (17,561) and hypertension (10,341). The least
treated cases were tuberculosis (64) and HIV (38) presumably because there were public sector health
programs that specifically addressed these diseases. A study carried out in 2013 by Microinsurance
Learning and Knowledge (MILK) Project (financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) revealed
that enrollees utilized hypertensive services twice more than the uninsured and enrollees were four times
more likely to participate in hypertension educational sessions. 25 This indicates that enrollment in the
insurance scheme might have contributed to the increased access to services.

59.    Similarly, use of maternity services was appreciable. There were 4,218 registered pregnancies for
a cumulative number of 21,963 enrollees. This implies that 19 percent of the enrollees used maternity
services (although it is possible that some women were pregnant two or more times during the project
period). Considering that ANC, delivery and Cesarean deliveries are among the list of services for which
providers are paid fee-for-service (Annex 2), the high use of maternity services might have contributed to
excess medical payouts noted earlier. There was an average of 4.8 ANC visits per pregnancy (Figure 4,
Annex 2) which meets the WHO stipulated minimum of 4 visits per pregnancy.

60.     The 44.7 percent of deliveries 26 is higher than the 36 percent of institutional deliveries in Nigeria
overall but lower than the 77.3 percent for Lagos; however, the Cesarean delivery rate of 26.2 percent
(much higher than the WHO optimum range of 5-15 percent) is 13 times the reported national rate of 2
percent and higher than the 6.5 percent for Lagos. In some selected health facilities in the service provider
network, Cesarean delivery rates for non-enrollees were over 20 percent indicating that the rates for
enrollees and non-enrollees were similar and that these service providers have a higher propensity for
Cesarean delivery. 27

Utilization of private sector capacity
61.     The achievement of this objective is rated substantial.
The project sought to increase utilization and efficiency of provider capacity, that is, ensuring optimum
capacity utilization and preventing overcrowding among the service providers in the network. The
HCHC strived to maintain a sufficient balance between provider capacity and demand for services from
enrollees thereby curtailing underutilization or overutilization of provider capacity and minimizing
inefficiencies 28.

   Osuntyi Medical Center (25%), Orilele Agege Generla Hospital (23%), Crystal Hospital (21%), and Subol (25%).

   There is a school of thought that public resources should not be used to subside under-utilized capacity in the private sector
but this section is referring to optimizing capacity among the provider network that have signed service agreement with
HCHC.


                                                               16
62.    In July 2011, HCHC undertook a study of capacity utilization of 15 health facilities. Both provider
capacity evaluation 29 (ability of individual providers to adequately cater to current enrollee population
demands) and network capacity evaluation (ability of the entire HCHC network to adequately cater to the
needs of current and projected enrollee population demands) were assessed.

63.    Of the 15 health care providers, 9 were determined to be of optimum utilization capacity (60
percent), 2 (13 percent) were underutilized (below capacity utilization in relation to the provider’s ability
to accommodate more enrollees), and 4 (27 percent) were over utilized (Table 7, Annex 2). The results
were better than those of Kwara state where only 3 out of 8 (37.5 percent) were of optimum capacity. 30
Based on the findings, a ceiling of 3,000 enrollees was recommended for service providers in the project.
In June/July 2012, a capacity evaluation exercise indicated that Crystal Specialist Hospital again had
exceeded the recommended 85 percent utilization capacity.

64.    Regarding network capacity in the Lagos service provider network 31, the expected number of
service providers is 11. Since there were 15 service provides in July 2011, the network capacity was
deemed adequate.

Establishing and enforcing standards of care
65.      The achievement of this objective is rated high.
The quality of care of the service providers improved considerably over time. At project closing, all
service providers were in compliance with the service quality standards specified by PAF (the target was
at least 14 of the 15 service providers).

Quality of care assessment
66.      In 2009 and 2010, quality of care was monitored by the progress made against an agreed upgrading
plan per service provider. Subsequently, PAF launched SafeCare 32 in 2011 to improve the quality and
safety of healthcare services in low-resource settings by rating and benchmarking across healthcare
facilities, provider networks and countries. Service providers are rated based on an elaborate scoring
system presented in Annex 2.

67.    For the service providers that were assessed more than once by PAF, the SafeCare quality
assessment scores for 2013 were higher than those for 2012 except for the May clinic where the 2013
score was lower (Table 8 in Annex 2). The three most improved service elements were information
management, risk management, and diagnostic imaging while the three least improved service elements
were primary healthcare, laboratory, and support services. The Lagoon Clinic, VI and Lagoon Hospital,
Ikeja were accredited by the JCI in May 2011 (the first such accreditations in sub-Saharan Africa).


29
   The assessment employed three proxies for capacity utilization or adequacy: a) burden of enrollee utilization (utilization
per enrollee; proportion of total hospital utilization), slack capacity available, and waiting time complaints
30
   The insurance scheme in Kwara state was for rural farmers whereas CAPDAN catered to urban vendors
31
   The methodology used assumed that all providers have the same propensity to attract enrollees and brand perceptions are at
par among the providers within the network; all providers enlisted into the network are able to provide quality health care
services; 3,000 maximum enrollee benchmark and a target population of 32,575 (for both CAPDAN and market women)
were employed in the computation,
32
   SafeCare was initially jointly launched in 2010 in Amsterdam by the Joint Commission International (JCI) of the U.S, the
PharmAccess Foundation of the Netherlands and the Council for Health Service Accreditation of Southern Africa
(COHSASA).


                                                             17
68.      HCHC routinely carried out a semiannual quality assessment of all service providers and agreed
on a quality improvement plan and subsequently followed up with its implementation. Service providers
that made improvements in quality of care were awarded certificates of recognition. Further, a HCHC
Community Relations Officer on a weekly basis obtained feedback from enrollees on the quality of care
and shared this with the service providers. Moreover, PAF conducted trainings to build the capacities of
HCHC and service providers. Some of the trainings were on: quality management for hospitals,
management of common conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, pediatric and obstetric cases for
doctors and nurses, family planning counseling, laboratory training, and customer service for front office
staff of health facilities.

69.    HCHC and PAF also periodically carried out Medical Due Diligence (MDD) to engage new
service providers to take off some caseload from service providers experiencing overcapacity. For
instance, in August 2012 MDD was carried out in six health facilities and two new service providers
(Krown Hospital and Promise Hospital) were selected to join the network in December 2012. Similar
exercises were carried throughout implementation.

70.     As shown in Figure 5 (Annex 2), the assessment scores for the CAPDAN health facilities increased
by 24 points from 55 in 2011 to 79 in 2013, which is much higher than the 13 percent improvement for
other facilities in Nigeria.

Sustainability of community health plans
71.    The achievement of this objective is rated modest.
The indicator employed to assess the sustainability of the insurance scheme was the re-enrollment or
renewal rate. As noted earlier, enrollees were unable to afford the planned higher co-premiums.

Re-enrollment or renewal rates
72.     The insurance renewal rate gives an indication of the satisfaction of the enrollees with the
insurance scheme and its continuous use and hence the sustainability of the scheme. Available data show
that renewal rates increased from 48 percent in September 2011 to 58 percent in October 2013 (Figure 6)
indicating that enrollees valued the product even during the time that the new enrollment had ceased and
the project was winding down. Factoring in an estimated outmigration rate of 24 percent, the adjusted
renewal rate in October 2013 was 77 percent. Apparently, adverse selection played a role here with
pregnant women and enrollees with chronic illnesses more likely to re-enroll. For instance, the prevalence
of hypertension among enrollees increased from less than 10 percent in 2009 to nearly 40 percent in 2013.

Other sustainability factors
73.     Involvement of the Lagos State Government and the NHIS in the project design and
implementation would have ensured sustainability of the scheme. Nevertheless, the Dutch Government
through HIF financed the LMW insurance scheme and the existing healthcare and administrative
structures benefited this project. HIF was to lobby and raise additional funds for a follow-on Phase II
project for CAPDAN but did not materialized. HIF attributed this to the delay in the approval of the project
restructuring. Nevertheless, the project produced an enormous database on community health insurance
that informed the design of the follow-on CAPDAN project HBL Scheme which is unsubsidized, the
expansion of the scheme in Kwara state and the new community insurance scheme in Ogun state.

Additional inputs and outputs that contributed to development objective
74.    Other inputs and outputs that also contributed to the development objectives such as marketing
subsidies, upgrading subsidies and claims processing are described in Annex 2.

75.    Efficacy rating
76.    The ratings for the four specific objectives in the project commitment paper are: enrollment and
affordability is modest; utilization of private sector capacity is substantial; establishing and enforcing
standards of care is high; and sustainability of community health plans is modest. As explained above,
enrollment and affordability was the basis for assessing the efficacy. Thus, the efficacy is rate modest.

3.3     Efficiency

77.      Administrative and operational efficiency. Available aggregate expenditure categories shows that
of the total grant amount of US$6,015,164, 35 percent was undisbursed at the end of project. The insurance
premium subsidy constituted the largest share at 78 percent of the total undisbursed amount followed by
monitoring and evaluation at 9 percent. Although there was a cost underrun for the insurance premium
subsidy, as noted above there was excess payments for capitation 33 and fee-for-service payments 34 for
those enrolled as a result of adverse selection and there was US$83,077.97 cost overrun of the marketing
subsidies.

78.      Despite the above, project interventions increased efficiency in the areas of service quality and
utilization capacity of service providers, as noted earlier. The project also leveraged other resources such
as previously established service provider network and monitoring and evaluation processes. Additionally,
ILO provided US$250,000 to improve the claims processing and managements system.

79.     A cost benefits analysis resulted in a negative Net present value (NPV) of NGN100 million
(US$781,250) and Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) of 10 percent. The negative NPV came as a
result of excess medical payouts by the HCHC, which resulted in significant net loss to the HCHC over
the entire project period. Similar analysis was conducted at appraisal, which generated an 11 percent FIRR.
However, NPV was not calculated at appraisal. This ex post analysis shows both NPV and FIRR, which
provide a clear picture of the financial strength of the HCHC (see annex 3 for a detailed explanation of
the analysis).

80.     Efficiency is rated modest.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

81.     The outcome rating (a measure of the project’s overall performance) is derived from the ratings
for the relevance of objectives and design, efficacy (extent of achievement of the project’s objective), and
efficiency. As noted above, the efficacy and efficiency were both modest. However, there were split sub-
ratings within relevance: the relevance of the objective is high but the relevance of the design was modest.

33
  The capitation rates were: N425 in 2009, N425 in 2010, N475 in 2011, N525 in 2012, N525 in 2013 and N525 in 2014.
34
  It was envisaged that 70 percent of the payment to service providers would be capitation fees and 30 percent fee-for-
service.


                                                            19
Aggregate relevance was judged to be ‘substantial’ given the combination of high and modest ratings.
Therefore, given two modest ratings for efficacy and efficiency and ‘substantial’ for relevance, the overall
project rating for outcome is moderately unsatisfactory.



3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
82.    The project provided financial protection to some poor CAPDAN employees who would otherwise
not have been able to afford the services they received. 35 On the other hand, some well-off CAPDAN
employers also unduly gained from the scheme although they were not the target beneficiaries.

Institutional Strengthening
83.      The capacity of service providers was improved through the various trainings that PAF and HCHC
provided. Further, the launch and successful implementation of SafeCare improved the quality of health
services. This is likely to have restored some trust among enrollees of the healthcare system. A SafeCare
Quality Workshop organized by HCHC, PAF and the IFC in June 2014 highlighted its success and was
widely covered by the news media also raised public awareness of the insurance scheme. 36 The Lagos
State Ministry of Health expressed interest its scale-up in Lagos. Similarly, the Ogun State Minister who
was in attendance, mentioned that the state was in the process of finalizing the design of a similar
community health insurance scheme. Although PAF and HCHC had been in partnership prior to the
initiation of this project, this project provided further opportunity for PAF to build the local capacity of
HCHC. HCHC also benefited from procurement training from the World Bank team.

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):
84.    The huge actuarial and utilization data generated in the implementation of the project will be
invaluable to the NHIS in the design of programs geared towards achieving universal health coverage.

3.6      Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops:

85.     The methodology and findings of the beneficiary survey is presented in Annex 5. It had a small
sample size of 10 beneficiaries who generally expressed favorable views on the project but were unwilling
to pay higher co-premium. Further, summary notes on the stakeholder workshop held in April 2014 are in
Annex 6. The findings of the borrower ICR were discussed including lessons learned. The buy-in from
the Lagos State Government was considered critical to the sustainability of the new HBL scheme.




35
   For instance, in one of the participating hospitals, the regular registration fee to see a doctor is NGN3,000 which is higher
than the co-premium for NGN2,500 that enrollees paid for a whole year. Similarly, maternity services particularly caesarean
deliveries would have been unaffordable for some enrollees.
36
   It was attended by over 50 people including administrators of health facilities, representatives from Shell, the Federal
Ministry of Health (MOH), Lagos State MOH, Ogun State, IFC and the World Bank.


                                                               20
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

86.    Although the objective of the project remained highly relevant at project closure, there is
substantial risk that development outcomes will not be maintained.

Follow-on project
87.     In the project commitment paper, the project was designed as a two-phase 10-year program with
the GPOBA/World Bank financing the Phase I and HIF seeking additional sources of funds (public and
private) for Phase II. However, the Phase II did not materialize as noted earlier.

Co-premiums and enrollment numbers
88.    As described in detail in section 3.2, following the increase in co-premium from N1,450 to N2,500
in January 2012, enrollment declined steadily till project closing.

Quality of care
89.     The launching of SafeCare during project implementation contributed to improved quality of care
and the Lagos State government has requested PharmAccess to perform SafeCare assessments, train
quality teams and develop Quality Improvement Plans for three healthcare facilities, namely General
Hospital Epe, General Hospital Alimosho and General Hospital Apapa, as well as assist in the
development of a Quality Policy for Public Sector Healthcare Facilities under the Lagos State Ministry of
Health. Additionally, the implementation of HBL will entail enforcing standards of care.

Sustainability of community health plans
90.     While re-enrollment figures were high during project implementation, this might not be maintained
in the HBL scheme given that it is unsubsidized and therefore unaffordable to poor employees and their
families. 37 The limited consultation with the Lagos State Government in the design and implementation
of the CAPDAN also contributed to the limited sustainability. Further, the huge marketing costs incurred
in the CAPDAN project may even be higher for the HBL.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

Quality at entry:
91.    The project was consistent with Nigeria’s development priorities in the health sector and the
Nigeria CPS. The project appropriately targeted low-income CAPDAN employees and their families but

37
  For instance, where a family of 3 will pay a premium of NGN20,000 ($156 using an exchange rate of N128=US$1) in the
HBL scheme which is three times the NGN7,500 co-premium in the CAPDAN project. The former may not be affordable
given that that the median income for CAPDAN employees is about $1,019. HCHC may want to partner with the Lagos State
Government to provide some subsidy to the HBL scheme.


                                                         21
some CAPDAN employers (who were non-poor) also benefited. The project leveraged resources that the
Dutch government had invested in an existing service provider network for the LMW program. It also
employed a previously tested independent verification and monitoring process, which had been
established by HCHC, PAF and HIF for the LMW program. Appropriate fiduciary (financial management
and procurement) procedures were incorporated in the project design. Regarding safeguards it was
classified as C instead of category B which would have allowed more appropriate measures to be put in
place for healthcare waste management, but during implementation safeguards were proactively
addressed. Regarding M&E design, there were no PDO indicators for some of the specific objectives and
a rigorous impact evaluation should have been incorporated in the project design. Two flaws in the design
were the planned increasingly high co-premiums (which was unaffordable) over the project period
(without a concomitant expansion of the benefits package) and the unrealistically high endline target.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

Quality of supervision
92.     The World Bank-GPOBA team undertook joint review missions with the implementing agencies
and submitted 7 ISRs, at least one per year. The ratings in the ISRs were largely appropriate. The World
Bank ensured that during its last implementation support mission, a stakeholder workshop was held to
disseminate the findings of the borrower ICR. The team also provided technical support for the costing
and price sensitivity studies. Hands-on procurement was provided to HCHC staff and this contributed to
resolution of procurement issues by project closure. In the annual external audits, the external auditor’s
opinions were unqualified. However, there were shortcomings. For instance, outstanding financial
management issues were only resolved in November 2014. It took over a year and half to approve the HIF
request to extend the closing date, albeit, as noted earlier this was carefully discussed over a period.
Nevertheless, this delay created some uncertainty and adversely affected the achievement of the target
enrollment. A short deliberative period could have improved the rating for efficacy. When the project was
restructured, the number of target enrollees could have been reduced. The limited consultation with the
Lagos State Government in the design and implementation of the CAPDAN contributed to the limited
sustainability.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

93.     Given that both the rating for quality at entry and quality of supervision are both moderately
unsatisfactory, the rating for overall Bank performance is moderately unsatisfactory.




                                                   22
5.2    Borrower Performance
94.    The Government was not involved in the execution of the project and was therefore not assessed.
The three main implementing agencies assessed were: Stichting HIF, as the grant recipient; PAF, as the
monitoring agent; and HCHC as the local insurer.

(a) Implementing Agency Performance: HCHC

Rating: Moderately satisfactory
95.     HCHC duly signed service agreements with each service provider and appropriately supervised
and trained them. It adequately developed the upgrading plans, procured the required good and works for
two service providers. Its staff had limited procurement capacity but eventually with training from World
Bank procurement staff were able to fulfill the procurement responsibilities. Together with PAF, it
appropriately supervised the service providers in ensuring they provided good quality care to enrollees
and proactively monitored service provider capacity. However, the fee-for-service payments were high.
HCHC selected CAPDAN as the target group following a market survey of 12 potential target groups. It
carried out extensive marketing and IEC to enroll CAPDAN employees and their families but ended up
overrunning the budget allocated to marketing subsidies. Although the target enrollment was not achieved,
it must be pointed out that during project preparation, HCHC appropriately cautioned against the high co-
premiums and together with PAF recommended for project extension in 2011. It reduced its staff,
particularly the marketing staff, when the project closing date was in a limbo. It duly registered enrollees
and provided them with ID cards. The service providers also maintained photos of the beneficiaries,
crosschecked prior to providing services and reported impersonation to HCHC. HCHC then investigated
and delisted the culprits accordingly. Claims processing was initially manual but with funding from ILO,
automated claims processing for 5 service providers became possible. On time claims processing
increased from 3 percent in 2010 to 52 percent in 2013. HCHC undertook studies and ably coordinated its
work with PAF, but did not adequately coordinate with the NHIS and Lagos Sate Government during
implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance: PAF

Rating: Satisfactory

96.      PAF regularly submitted semi-annual progress reports to HIF within two months of the closing
date for the respective period and the reports conformed to the report format specified in the operations
manual. The reports specified whether the quality standards of each service provider met the upgrading
plans for each service provider, enrollment levels, status of implementation, enumerated constraints and
recommended follow-on actions. PAF verified the enrolment levels and co-premiums more frequently
than stipulated (monthly instead of bi-monthly) and reported verified number of first time enrollees (to
trigger Marketing Subsidy) and people enrolled (to trigger insurance premium subsidy). PAF paid regular
visits to HCHC, CAPDAN market and service providers to follow-up on implementation and to provide
feedback. PAF together with HCHC determined the upgrading needs and service quality standards for
each service provider, monitored the adherence and regularly trained both the service providers and
HCHC. PAF launched and implemented Safecare in Lagos which contributed to the hallmark achievement
of this project: the provision of high quality of care in the private sector. However, as noted above on
HCHC performance, the major drawback was that only a fifth of the enrollment target of 22,500 was
achieved. In its 2011 semi-annual reports, PAF appropriately highlighted and recommended extension of



                                                    23
project closing date. Similarly, during project preparation PAF cautioned against high co-premiums which
as noted earlier contributed to the low enrollment levels. PAF ably coordinated its work with HCHC but
did not adequately coordinate with the NHIS and Lagos Sate Government during implementation.

(c) Implementing Agency Performance: HIF

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

97.     HIF provided inputs into the project design, which drew on the existing LMW program, which had
been established by HIF. This allowed the project to leverage resources that the Dutch government had
invested in the same service provider network. Additionally, HIF managed to engage the Dutch
Government pay for the high expenditure on marketing in 2012. HIF ensured a number of studies were
carried out which informed implementation. Further, semi-annual reports together with interim financial
reports were timely submitted to the World Bank. The procurement issues identified earlier during
implementation were largely resolved at project closure. Annual external auditors’ opinions were
unqualified but there were still outstanding financial management issues which were only resolved in
November 2014. Regarding M&E design, there were no PDO indicators for some of the specific objectives
and a rigorous impact evaluation should have been incorporated in the project design. HIF followed up its
request to the World Bank to restructure but the process took longer. Nevertheless, the restructuring
request did not include a reduction in the number of target enrollees despite evidence that it was
unattainable. HIF clarified that in the July-December 2011 semiannual report, it recommended a revision
of the target and discussed this with the WBG project team. The limited consultation with the Lagos State
Government in the design and implementation of the CAPDAN contributed to the limited sustainability.
Besides, HIF was to lobby and raise additional funds for follow-on Phase II project for CAPDAN but at
project closing this had not materialized. This led to HCHC designing an unsubsidized follow-on scheme.
Nevertheless, HIF clarified that the delay in approval of the extension of the closing date “created great
uncertainty for the implementing agencies and affected the lobbying process for mobilizing resources”.

(d) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

98.     Given that the ratings for HCHC and PAF are in the satisfactory range while the rating for HIF is
moderately unsatisfactory, the overall borrower performance is moderately unsatisfactory when the
overall outcome rating is considered.


6. Lessons Learned

    •    Integrating impact evaluation in the design of an innovative pilot project is critical for
         documenting lessons learned.
        If an impact evaluation had been carried out, it would have helped in understanding the
        counterfactual (i.e. what would have happened in the absence of the project), and particular
        questions, such as what premium level and benefit package could support the required outcomes,
        or whether the insurance scheme impacted health outcomes among the beneficiary population.
        This could contribute to the body of evidence on the efficacy and efficiency of community
        insurance schemes, and inform NHIS efforts on achieving universal health coverage.


                                                   24
•   Coordination with multi-levels of Government in the design and implementation of community-
    based health insurance scheme is key to ownership and financial sustainability.
    In this project, the Lagos State Government and the NHIS were not involved in the design and
    implementation, which limited the opportunity for the government to participate in the follow-on
    project or scale up. In contrast, the Kwara state insurance program has been expanded since the
    Government was part of the process. Further, the involvement of government and other relevant
    stakeholder groups in decision-making around the insurance scheme could have been tracked to
    monitor participation.

•   In-depth target group analysis during project preparation is necessary to inform the project
    design, including establishing the co-premium, selecting the appropriate target group, and
    minimizing adverse selection, moral hazard and other insurance risks.
    Although a target population study informed the project design, it was limited in scope. If extent
    covered by the 2011 price sensitivity study had also been carried out during project preparation it
    would have helped in the proper setting of the premium, co-premium, and informed the benefits
    package. The premium in the first year was twice the per capita public expenditure indicating the
    project was not sustainable from the outset.

•   Reviewing the acceptability of premium rates and benefit packages for enrollment by low-income
    employees (and their family members) at design and during implementation is critical to
    increasing enrollment and renewal rates.
    The small increase in co-premium in February 2011 did not affect enrollment but the large increase
    in co-premium in January 2012 did adversely reduce enrollment in the scheme, compromising
    targeted outcomes. Expecting enrollment numbers to rise while continually increasing premium
    levels without any perceived additional benefits by the enrollees was not realistic.

•   Rating service providers in the health insurance scheme network and monitoring progress against
    quality improvement plans, contributes to enhanced compliance with the service quality standards.
    The launch of the SafeCare initiative immensely contributed to the improvement in quality of care
    at both public and private health facilities in the service provider network. This was one of the
    main successes of this project. Service providers received targeted training in areas identified in a
    quality improvement plan. They were assessed on a semiannual basis and awarded certificates of
    recognition and two hospitals were accredited by the Joint Commission International (the first such
    accreditations in sub-Saharan Africa).

•   Engaging expensive private hospitals for community based health insurance scheme can lead to
    excess payments by the health care management organization or lead to providers prematurely
    dropping out of the scheme.
    Two high-end hospitals which initially participated in the CBHIS had to drop out when they made
    huge loses but they were reimbursed with funds from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. .

•   Developing a low cost behavior change campaign and marketing strategy stimulates enrollment
    and re-enrollment.
    Investment in marketing by a properly trained dedicated team was critical for sharing knowledge
    with the enrollees about the insurance scheme. The project supported an extensive Information,


                                                 25
       Education and Communication campaign that quickly exhausted the resources available, and made
       a request to re-allocate additional project funds to marketing subsidies. Such campaigns also
       require monitoring instruments to ensure they are effective in influencing community behaviors.


7.     Comments on Issues Raised by Implementing Agencies

99.     The full text of the comments by the implementing agencies is in Annex 7. The borrower ICR is
also attached.

100. The implementing agencies; a) acknowledged that the design should have incorporated impact
evaluation; b) clarified that they would have preferred a two-year extension of the project instead of 1
year; c) explained that the delay in approving the request for restructuring by the World Bank contributed
to the low enrollment numbers; d) disagreed that the they had not adequately engaged with the Lagos State
Government (the ICR author together with representatives of the implementing agencies visited the Lagos
state Government in June 2014 and it was clear that prior engagement had been minimal); e) pointed out
that the draft ICR report had incorrectly compared the total premium with the public health expenditure
(this was rectified in the final ICR with the latter having have compared with the premium subsidies.
However, the conclusion remained the same that the premium subsidies were unaffordable by the
government); f) clarified the issues regarding discontinuing enrollment and Phase II extension.; and g)
were concerned about the disbursement issues raised in the draft ICR (these issues were resolved in
November 2014).

Table 4. Risks and Mitigation measures
 Risk                         Mitigation
 In-depth target group study A target population study which was carried out in May-June 2008 to inform the
 to inform the project design design (report was released In October 2008 around the time the grant agreement
                              was signed) and contingency budget was also allocated to cater to subsequent
                              changes in the design
 Affordability/Willingness    CAPDAN employers/employees have a slightly higher income than the LMW so
 to pay by the enrollees.     were expected to be able to pay higher co-premium.
                              Besides, HCHC advised that instead of reduction in subsidy to zero at the end
                              the 5-year period (as proposed in the concept note), a two-phase declining
                              subsidy program would allow for a more gradual decline in the subsidy over a
                              10-year period. It was envisaged that HIF would find an alternative donor in
                              Phase II.
 Market Uncertainty           Should adjustments be necessary as a result of uncertain response of the target
                              group, HIF was to submit a proposal to GPOBA detailing the changes.
 Low Enrollment or re- Extending marketing and education along with quality of care should stimulate
 enrollment                   enrollment. PAF and HCHC would modify the product pricing and benefits
                              semiannually based on consumption data.
 Relatively New Product       Both PAF and HCHC had previous experience, and PAF was to continuously
                              monitor implementation and advise on appropriate corrective action.
 Fraud                        Rigorous monitoring by PAF and external audits were to mitigate the risk.
 Sustainability               To mitigate the risk of beneficiaries’ inability to pay, the two-phase approach
                              over a 10-year period noted above would give beneficiaries sufficient time to
                              realize the long-term benefits of pre-paid insurance and inculcate willingness to
                              pay the full premium. Regarding funding of phase two, HIF had a strong
                              network of donors that would be lobbied during phase one.

The four key dimensions for assessment are: a) management (management and leadership; human
resource management; patient and family rights and access to care; management of information; and risk
management), b) clinical (primary health care services; inpatient care; and operating theatre and
anesthetic services), c) clinical support (laboratory services; diagnostic imaging service; and medication
management) and d) technology (facility management services; and support services).

Additional inputs and outputs that contributed to development objective
Other inputs and outputs that also contributed to the development objectives such as marketing
subsidies, upgrading subsidies and claims processing are described in Annex 2.

Marketing subsidies
The allocated marketing subsidies of US$197,000 (US$8.14 per new beneficiary enrolled) proved to be
insufficient to sustain the extensive IEC outreach and marketing activities to enroll and re-enroll the
CAPDAN employers/employees in the scheme. These activities include a) sensitization of community
members (such as distribution of posters, flyers and brochures, billboards), b) community marketing
(community members as well as CAPDAN executives were involved in reaching out to those who had
not enrolled as well as their families), c) telemarketing campaign (SMS notification and telephone calls
to all enrollees that were due for renewal at the beginning of each month), d) medical outreach (including
free blood pressure checks, screening for diabetes and referral, and health education), e) stakeholder
meetings (with CAPDAN executives and Medical Directors of the service providers to update them on
progress and to respond to questions and encourage them to do their part to encourage enrolment or re-
enrollment) and f) enrollee forum to increase customer care (enrollees meet with HCHC staff and service
providers). Additionally, HCHC undertook monthly (and later quarterly) performance reviews for all
enrollment staff (review of past enrollment and re-enrolment figures, successes and challenges, and
appropriate corrective action). It turned out that outreach for enrolment was more costly than re-enrollment
which mainly entailed sending text messages and phone call reminders. In 2010, the Dutch government
agreed to pay HCHC $50,000 to cover administrative cost in addition to the amount allocated to this
project.

Upgrading subsidies
A total of 16 health facilities were constructed, renovated, and or/equipped. Of the US$234,000
allocated for the upgrading of two new health facilities to join the service provider network,
US$155,954 was spent in 2012 to upgrade Adefemi Hospital and Blue Cross Hospital (Table 9).
Additionally, the 14 other health facilities that were renovated without project funds either through HIF
fundraising or service providers using their own funds (presumably form profits made) are: Aniyun
Hospital, Crystal Specialist Hospital, Hillstar Clinic, Krown Hospital, Lagoon Hospital (in Ikeja),
Lagoon Hospital VI, Longing Medical Centre, May Clinics, Orile Agege General Hospital, Osuntuyi
Medical Centre (in Iju), Osuntuyi Medical Centre (in Obanikoro), Promise Medical Centre, Subol
Hospital, and Surulere General Hospital. The two lagoon hospitals together with Crystal hospital
specifically constructed annexes to cater to the CAPDAN enrollees.

Claims processing
During the project period, an electronic claims processing and managements system was introduced. A
retrospective review conducted by PAF and HCHC in 2012 recommended continued improvement of
medical filing and patient data management.

The percentage of claims paid on time to the service providers (less than 90 days between submission
and date claim processed by HCHC data management department) increased steadily over the project
period: from 3 percent in 2010, to 28 percent in 2011, to 34 percent in 2012, and to 52 percent in 2013.
HCHC received a grant of US$250,000 from the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) micro-
insurance innovation facility in 2010 to augment the use of ICT in the claims processing and
management system. The proposed solutions and the achievement are shown in Table 10. Five service
providers (Crystal Hospital, Osuntuyi Hospital, St. Mary Hospital, Osuntuyi Hospital, and May
Hospital) were selected for the initial rollout of the automation of claims processing and its
implementation continued after the closing of the project.

                                                 A similar system is currently under-going testing,
                                                 customization and modifications for scale up to Kwara State.

the processing and turnaround time for        the system did not suit HCHC’s unique business requirements
claims payment.                               due to its non-flexibility. HCHC is currently testing new
                                              systems based on the lessons learned. The new systems are
                                              being customized to suit HCHC’s peculiar business
                                              requirements and as to be piloted in 2014.

Annex 3.         Economic and Financial Analysis (including assumptions in the analysis)

The PDO was to establish a community health scheme that would provide affordable pre-paid health
insurance plans to low-income employees (and their families) of small businesses in CAPDAN of the
lkeja computer village in Lagos. To this end, the project interventions aimed at making the scheme
financially viable and sustainable. This analysis focuses on the costs efficiency of the project, and it
includes: (i) an analysis of operational and administrative efficiency, including analysis of cost
overruns/underruns (ii) a cost-benefit analysis to ascertain the financial and economic viability of the
scheme.

Administrative and operational efficiency. The project experienced seven months delay after the signing
of the grant agreement to meet effectiveness conditions, and the over one and half year delay in the
approval of the project closing date led to significant cost underruns at project closure. Available
aggregate expenditure categories shows that of the total grant amount of US$6,015,164, 35 percent was
undisbursed at the end of project. The insurance premium subsidy constituted the largest share at 78
percent of the total undisbursed amount followed by monitoring and evaluation at 9 percent. Although
there was a cost underrun for the insurance premium subsidy, as noted above there was excess payments
for capitation 38 and fee-for-service payments 39 for those enrolled as a result of adverse selection. Service
providers experienced increased cost over and above the capitation payments 40 due to increased utilization
of primary care services (particularly maternity services and hypertension treatment) 41. The medical
payments for both capitation and fee-for-service exceeded the budget and a request for reallocation of
expenditure categories was made to the Bank on June 25, 2013. On the other hand, there was
US$83,077.97 cost overrun of the marketing subsidies. Various financial management supervision reports
showed that project management did not provide detailed breakdown of expenditures incurred and at
project closing there was inadequate documentation to support such expenditures. Tables 12 and 13
provide a summary of project the analysis of costs overruns and underruns.

   The capitation rates were: N425 in 2009, N425 in 2010, N475 in 2011, N525 in 2012, N525 in 2013 and N525 in 2014.

   It was envisaged that 70 percent of the payment to service providers would be capitation fees and 30 percent fee-for-
service.

Despite the above, project interventions increased efficiency in the areas of service quality and utilization
capacity of service providers. As noted in section 3.2, the project implemented a number of measures that


                                                                       40
improved service quality and utilization. For instance, the routine semiannual quality assessment of all
service providers with issuance of certificates of recognition to service providers improved the quality of
their services. Also, PAF carried out a number of capacity building interventions for HCHC and service
providers. These trainings include quality management for hospitals, management of common conditions
such as hypertension diabetes, pediatric and obstetric cases for doctors and nurses, family planning
counseling, laboratory training, and customer service for front office staff of health facilities. In addition,
utilization capacity of private service providers significantly increased. The project sought to increase
utilization and efficiency of provider capacity and that ensured optimum capacity utilization, and also
limited overcrowding in the participating facilities. The HCHC maintained sufficient balance between
provider capacity and demand for services from enrollees thereby curtailing underutilization or
overutilization of provider capacity and minimizing inefficiencies. The project also leveraged other
resources such as previously established service provider network and monitoring and evaluation
processes. Additionally, ILO provided $250,000 to improve the claims processing and managements
system.

Cost-benefit Analysis. To estimate the economic and financial returns to the project, a cost-benefit
analysis for a range of interventions was performed at appraisal. For that reason, the ICR team also
performed similar analysis in order to determine the project’s financial viability and to compare with the
appraisal estimate. The appraisal analysis was based on the project investments consisting of upgrading
the providers’ facilities, marketing the insurance program, and maintaining equipment and building, and
excluded interventions that were deemed to be difficult to quantify.

Methodology and key assumptions. (i) Costs: Project costs data, including procurement reports, financial
management reports, monitoring and evaluation reports and physical progress reports produced by the
project team were reviewed. The reviewed noted that.insurance co-payments per enrollee, administrative
expenses, capitation fees, entitlement fees, and medical payouts were the main costs incurred by HCHC.
These items form the basis for ascertaining projects costs, and were included in the analysis. For the
purposes of this analysis, monitoring evaluation, audit and unallocated expenses were included in the HIF
management costs category. Initial costs for running the scheme were assumed to be about 9 percent of
total project costs (ii) Benefits: The analysis assumed that the benefit streams were cash inflows
(revenues) accrued to HCHC, and considered insurance premium (co-premiums, and premium subsidy)as
the revenues inflows to HCHC. Using an excel spreadsheet, a cash flow to the HCHC was derived, and
was discounted at 12 percent rate. The discount rate was considered as a proxy for average opportunity
cost of capital, based on the average bank lending rate in Nigeria. The discounted cash flow was sum up
to ascertain the net present value (NPV) and financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the project. The
analysis covered the five-year period for the program services.

Results. Upon the basis of the above assumptions, the project generated a negative NPV of NGN100
million (minus $781,250) and FIRR of minus 10 percent. The negative NPV came as a result of the excess
medical payouts by HCHC, which resulted in significant net loss to HCHC over the entire project period.
As noted above, similar analysis was conducted at appraisal, which generated an 11 percent FIRR.
However an NPV was not calculated at appraisal but the reasons for the exclusion of NPV from the
analysis was not indicated in the project commitment document. This ex post analysis shows both NPV
and IRR, which provide a clear picture of the financial strength of HCHC. Table 14 summarizes the
results of the analysis and compare it to the appraisal estimate.

Annex 5.       Beneficiary Survey Results

Findings from beneficiaries assessment, April 2014

Introduction and Methodology
A survey was carried out to assess the perception of the beneficiaries of a health pre-paid scheme
implemented between 2009 and 2013 in April, 2014. The beneficiaries of the scheme were members of
the CAPDAN and their families. The survey was carried out as part of the ICR of the project.

The study area comprised the computer village, Ikeja and health facilities located in Akowonjo, Ojodu,
Ogba and Ikeja area of Lagos State. The beneficiary survey was done on a predetermined, small sample
size of 10 enrollees stratified into two sets. The first consist of those enrollees that were only registered
under the original HYGEIA CAPDAN Scheme while the second set is made up of enrollees that were
registered on the HYGEIA CAPDAN scheme but have transited into enrollees under the HBL Scheme. A
total of ten enrollees registered under five of the health facilities under the scheme were interviewed.
Theses health facilities include; Blue Cross Hospital, Crystal Specialist Hospital, St. Mary Specialist
Hospital, Krown Hospital and Longing Medical Center.

The beneficiary questionnaire was administered on the 10 enrollees to elicit information on beneficiaries’
socio-demographic characteristics, respondents’ experience of HYGEIA scheme and perception of co-
payment and premium for the scheme. Other information elicited includes beneficiaries’ perception on
the quality services from their respective health facilities and beneficiaries’ satisfaction with the transition
from subsidized product to a non-subsidized product.

Analysis of responses
Socio-demographic characteristics of beneficiaries interviewed and their household
A total of 10 questionnaires were analyzed. The respondents were four men and six women. All the
respondents were Christian and were monogamously married with 9 being educated to the tertiary level.
Nine of the 10 respondents originally sold computers and allied products in computer village; two have
subsequently changed their line of business. One of the respondents was related to the person selling
computers and allied products. Five respondents disclosed their monthly income and expenditure. On the
average, the monthly income stood between N60,000 and N70,000. However, a respondent reported a
monthly income of about N500,000.

Experience with HYGEIA Scheme
It was found that most of the 10 respondents registered for the HYGEIA CAPDAN scheme in 2011 (3
respondents) and 2012 (4 respondents). One respondent claimed to have been registered in 2009 while 2
respondents originally registered in 2010. Nine beneficiaries renewed their enrollment but a respondent
did not renew in a particular year for what he termed inconsistency of services. Eight respondents have
other household members enrolled (mostly spouses and children).

Knowledge of co-payment
Eight respondents that registered between 2011 and 2012 remembered the actual co-payment made
correctly. The other respondents could not correctly disclose the amount of co-payment made for their
first enrollment but the amount paid for more recent renewal and the amount paid for the HBL scheme.




                                                      45
All respondents that were registered before 2011 were aware that the co-payment amount was increased
except for a particular enrollee that claimed she paid N2,500 from 2011 until 2013. All 10 respondents
were happy with the amount of co-payments for the HYGEIA-CAPDAN scheme. Though no respondent
was aware of the actual cost of premium of the product, 8 respondents knew the product was subsidized.
Knowledge of the subsidy source varied among respondents with 9 respondents claiming it was the World
Bank or some foreign aid, while one particular respondent believed it was Lagos State government.

Awareness of HBL Scheme
Out of 6 respondents that were aware of the HBL scheme, only 3 agreed to encourage their friends and or
households to enroll under the HBL scheme. The key reason given was the price increment for the HBL
product without corresponding increase in the scope of services.

Services from Health Facilities
When asked about the frequency of respondents’ attendance at their various health facilities in 2013, 6
respondents were able to remember and offered approximates. The highest attendance stood at 6 visits
while the lowest was 1 visit in that year. Most of the visits to the health facilities were for basic healthcare
and maternity care (family planning, ANC and post natal care). Only 2 out of the 10 respondents reported
having cases that were not covered by the HYGEIA scheme, such as dental services and hormonal profile
tests.

Quality of services
Seven out of 10 respondents were happy with the waiting time at the health facilities. The dissatisfied
clients linked the long waiting time to the high patronage recorded their health facilities. Three respondents
(each attending a different hospital) claimed they were given negative treatment because they were under
the HYGEIA-CAPDAN scheme at their health facilities. One respondent disagreed with being satisfied
citing poor attitude of staff in a particular hospital. The complaint was about the poor attitude of staff (with
the exception of the doctors and nurses) that did not show adequate care about HYGEIA scheme patients.
Another respondent complained about the low quality of drugs given to HYGEIA scheme patients in some
of the health facilities.

Beneficiaries’ satisfaction with the transition from subsidized product to a non-subsidized product
HYGEIA-CAPDAN only enrollees
None of the 5 HYGEIA CAPDAN-only patients was completely willing to pay more to enjoy the current
services being enjoyed in their health facilities. All of the enrollees considered the cost of the new family
package arrangement for HBL as being high.

HBL enrollees
Only 1 enrollee out of 5 claimed that he was properly briefed or got adequate information on the HBL.
All the other 4 HBL enrollees said they were not properly briefed but were only told the new fees to pay
for the new product. Aside the difference in price that was obvious to most respondents, they were
oblivious to other information on the new product. Despite the fact that HCHC had an information sharing
mechanism through which the market leaders would inform their constituents, the survey showed that not
all beneficiaries received the required information.

Enrollee’s suggestions on the improvement of the Scheme
   1. More information should be shared with enrollees on all products



                                                      46
2. The quality of services rendered under the scheme, especially the quality of drugs should be
   improved
3. The current price of HBL should be reviewed downwards to N5,000
4. Enrollees should be allowed to see more experienced doctors during consultation
5. The scope of the services of the HBL scheme should be increased
6. Private admission services should be included in scheme for enrollees able and willing to pay
7. The hospital admission allowed under the scheme should be increased to twice a year.

Findings from provider assessment, April 2014

Introduction and Methodology
A survey was carried out to assess the perception of the service providers (health facilities) of a health
pre-paid scheme implemented between 2009 and 2013 in April, 2014. The respondents were top staff of
the 15-member provider network approved to provide health services for the members of the CAPDAN.
The survey was carried out as part of the ICR of the project.

Five HYGEIA pre-paid health insurance scheme providers were located in Dopemu, Ikeja, Ojodu and
Ogba areas of Lagos State respectively. The providers’ survey was done on a predetermined sample size
of five HYGEIA pre-paid health insurance scheme with the highest number of enrollees. The provider
questionnaire was administered on the 5 services providers to elicit providers’ general information and
their perception and views on the pre-paid health insurance scheme. Information was also collected on
payment, the impact of the HYGEIA scheme on the providers, the administration and management and
providers’ perception of the transition from subsidized product to a non-subsidized product.

Analysis of Responses

General
The respondents were either the provider’s Medical Director or Hospital Administrator. All were men.
Three of the 5 health facilities were listed as service providers for the HYGEIA-Lagos Women Market
Association/CAPDAN pre-paid health insurance scheme in 2012. The other 2 were listed in 2009 and
2011 respectively.

Providers’ perception and views on pre-paid health insurance scheme
All the facility managers saw the HYGEIA CAPDAN scheme as a good concept. One provider did not
report an increase in out-patients attendance in the health facility since the HYGEIA scheme enrollment.
This is because it built a separate facility to take care of community pre-paid clients. The increase in
enrollees for the 4 other facilities ranged from 15 percent to 400 percent during the reporting period. The
providers agreed that patients under the scheme accessed health services at every visit to the facilities.
Two of the respondents gave instances when patients paid for procedures not covered by the scheme, such
as fibroid surgery. Four respondents reported abuse of the health insurance scheme by CAPDAN clients.
The two main areas of abuse by enrollees were frequent facility visits for minor ailments and collection
of drugs for relatives not enrolled in the scheme.

One of the providers saw a rapid increase in HCHC clients, albeit most of them came from the LMW
program. Other providers enumerated the following as benefits of the scheme: (a) increased service
utilization; (b) improved capacity; (c) infrastructure upgrade; (d) improved quality of care; and (e)
increased financial benefits. There were systems in place to guide procedures such as Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs) & Policies after the advent of CAPDAN. Quarterly inspection from HYGEIA with the
support of the Lagos State Hospital Management Board (HMB) has improved operational performance.
All respondents averred that HYGEIA CAPDAN clients were not treated differently from others.

Reimbursement
The respondents affirmed that all facilities were reimbursed monthly for capitation and Fee-For-Service
(FFS) by HCHC. The reimbursements for capitation were in line with the agreements reached with the



                                                    48
service providers. One of the providers insisted that there were delays in the reimbursement for FFS
occasionally. However, the provider confirmed that it was eventually paid.

Premium Payment and Capitation
All the providers were of the view that CAPDAN enrollees were able to make the co-payment premium
of N2,500. Two providers responded that its enrollees may be persuaded to pay the new premium. Three
providers were of the opinion that enrollees may not be able to afford services when subsidy is removed.

The capitation to providers by HYGEIA CAPDAN was generally considered unsatisfactory while opinion
was split on the tariff for FFS. Three of the 5 providers considered the FFS fee for services paid
unsatisfactory, while the remaining 2 considered it satisfactory.

Impact of HYGEIA CAPDAN Scheme on Providers
None of the providers interviewed had designated clinic days for CAPDAN enrollees; clients could visit
the provider at any time. They affirmed that the SafeCare intervention and HYGEIA Care Coordinators
have contributed tremendously to improved quality of services in their facilities. The HYGEIA Care
Coordinators have contributed by: (a) explaining policy and providing leadership directions; (b)
conducting on-the-job training; (c) monitoring the services and auditing of case notes; and (d) reducing
waiting time and ensuring quality improvement. Four of the 5 providers agreed that the scheme’s
partnership with local health authorities such as the Lagos Health Facility Monitoring and Accreditation
Agency (LHFMAA) have also contributed to improved regulation, monitoring & accreditation.

Administration and Management
Courtesy of the scheme, all the providers had approved 2012 and 2013 work plans. They also had registers
for cases handled & services provided. The providers conducted clinical staff internal performance
assessments; however, the periodicity varied from one to four times in the last 12 months. Providers
reported that Health Workers (HWs) performance was assessed externally by SafeCare. Additionally,
there was a review of HWs credentials in 2012 and 2013. The scheme provided training for HWs in the
facilities under its jurisdiction. The HWs in these facilities were trained in ANC, HIV/AIDS, diabetes care
and customer care and relations. Other training on post-natal care, institutional delivery, immunization,
family planning, infections prevention & control, hypertension care, medication management and record
keeping were conducted for HWs.

All the service providers reported having clinical guidelines and pathways used by the health workers in
these facilities. They had complaint boxes or registers and designated staff handling complaints from
enrollees. Complaints were actually lodged by CAPDAN clients in 3 of the 5 service providers. The main
complaints were poor staff attitude and waiting time for clients. The periodicity and number of providers
at staff meetings varied from one facility to the other in the last 12 months, from twice every month
through once a month to once in 3 months. All the providers reported that they reviewed patients’ opinions
and complaints in the staff meetings. Similarly, the providers held quality of care management meetings
but the periodicity varied from one to the other.

Transition from Subsidized Product to a Non-Subsidized Product
All the service providers indicated that they received adequate information on the Hygeia Better Life
(HBL) scheme and that they knew the difference between Hygeia CAPDAN and HBL. The differences
between Hygeia CAPDAN and HBL mentioned were that: (i) the enrolment fee for CAPDAN was per



                                                    49
head but HBL was a family package; (ii) capitation for CAPDAN was higher when compared to that of
HBL; (iii) CAPDAN premium was highly subsidized but HBL premium was not subsidized; and (iv)
CAPDAN was restricted to computer village but HBL was for urban poor people.

Providers’ suggestions on the improvement of the Scheme
   • Improvement on the quality of services provided under the scheme, especially with the drugs
   • Proper information dissemination among enrollees especially on all products
   • Aggressive marketing to increase coverage
   • HBL registration should be individualized
   • The scope of services of the HBL scheme be increased

Objective of Meeting:
Presentation and Discussion of the HYGEIA CAPDAN Pre-paid Health Insurance Scheme draft ICR.
Business:
The meeting was chaired and declared open by Dr. Peju Adenusi (HCHC) at 11am

   1. Introduction: Self introduction was done by all participants.

   2. Introduction of the World Bank Group: Dr. Chris Atim of the World Bank gave a brief of the World
      Bank group involvement on the CAPDAN project. He gave a brief on the design, expectations and
      implementation as well as the implementing partners. He specifically noted that original target enrolees
      (low income earners) which was revised during the implementation from 24,000 to 22,500. The outputs
      were related to the key performance indicators of the project. The borrower’s ICR shall feed into the
      Bank’s ICR which shall be completed within 6 months. He informed that the Bank’s ICR shall have
      additional or more pronounced sections on efficacy, efficiency, lessons learnt and sustainability.

Daniel Coila (GPOBA) briefed the meeting on the importance of the output-based grant for the CAPDAN
project and the interest of GPOBA on its implementation. GPOBA is particularly interested in the replicability,
the accountability of the implementing partners, the achievement of targets, M&E and the sustainability of the
project. He identified the distinction between the Bank’s rating of a project and that of GPOBA; GPOBA’s
emphasis is on the replicability of the project in the other parts of the nation and Africa at large through focus
on the lessons learnt during the implementation of the project.

   3. A short recap on CAPDAN project was presented by Marissa Popma (PAF), Dare Ogundipe (HCHC)
      and Dr. Dupe Oludipe (SafeCare). The presentation highlighted CAPDAN overview & objectives,
      implementing partners, product, funding mechanisms, achievements, introduction of the new Hygeia
      Better Life product, quality of care, risks and mitigation. Though the project is shutting down by the
      end of April, 2014, the already registered enrolees will continue to enjoy services till their contract
      ends.

Achievements – the achievements highlighted include number of low income families enrolled with a peak in
the number of enrolment towards the end of 2011; renewal rates was shown to be above 60 percent throughout
the project years; utilization increased as shown by the number of visits per enrolee. Another key achievement
highlighted during the presentation is improved healthcare quality. The improved healthcare quality was linked
to the multidisciplinary approach of the SafeCare methodology used to achieve the healthcare facility standards
in all the facilities in the network. The improved healthcare quality led to zero maternal death in all the
CAPDAN health facilities from inception of the project till June 2013 despite the over 1,698 deliveries were
recorded. Other achievements highlighted in the presentation are improved patient experience (as revealed by
MyCare assessment); capacity building of providers and equipment upgrade of two providers (it was
emphasized that some of the other service providers on the scheme enjoyed upgrade from other funding sources
outside of the current CAPDAN pre-paid health insurance project funding).

Risks and mitigation: a major highlight was on the excess medical payout experienced during the
implementation of the project. Mitigation includes the introduction of biometric solutions which was pilot
tested in three health facilities. Other mitigating factors include the introduction of waiting period for maternity
cases, family pricing for the new product and setting of limits for the services. On the delay in bill settling
noticed at the early stage of the project, the capacity building for the HMOs was seen to have led to
improvement in bill settlement by HCHC.

Discussions on the short recap of CAPDAN project:
          • From November 2013 to March 2014, over 1,000 enrolees were registered on the unsubsidized
              product Hygeia Better Life (HBL)
          • Quality improvement assessment would have benefited from a ‘before’ and ‘after’ comparison
          • The trend in enrolment juxtaposed against increase in co-payment over time could be one of the
              lessons learnt during the implementation of the scheme. Discussions suggested that (a) slight
              increase in co-payment made no difference to increased enrolment. However, a marked increase
              affected enrolment negatively. A small surge post price increase was explained by increased
              enrolment arising from the systematic transition from CAPDAN to HBL
          • Adverse selection: mitigation factors employed by the project reduced adverse selection.
          • Rural-urban equity was discussed in the context of the data from the scheme
          • A key lesson may be the effectiveness of technology on the operations of the project to increase
              efficiency and reduce costs. Examples were given of biometrics solutions piloted with 3
              providers and an automated process for processing of claims

   4. Findings of ICR assessment: Segun Oguntoyinbo (Consultant)

ICR draft presentation: The focus of the presentation of the draft ICR was on the lessons learnt during the
project implementation and the exit strategy – transition from a subsidized to an unsubsidized product. The
lessons learnt were discussed in 3 parts: (a) those that informed project design, (b) those that influenced project


                                                        52
implementation, and (c) those that can impact on the design of future project. These include: state support at
onset, design of unsubsidized product yyyand evaluation. The presentation also emphasized the role of the
World Bank in project oversight, proposed arrangements for future operations of project; migration strategy
for migration to new product; migration marketing and sales approach, etc.

Discussions on the ICR draft presentation (responses in italics):
          • Although the CAPDAN project shall formally end in April 2014, all enrolee contracts shall be
              fulfilled till expiration
          • Though a dip in income for providers is foreseen as a result of a lag phase in new product uptake,
              there is no contractual agreement on compensation of providers. The dip is expected to be made
              up when adequate number of enrolees come on board
          • Capitated product will be introduced soon.
          • Dr Olumide Okunola (IFC) informed that the WB shall spend about $1billion buying results.
              Attention shall focus on the CAPDAN ICR and those of other output-based projects
          • Dr. Chris Atim of the World Bank requested that the ICR detail more of the lessons learnt.
          • The non-inclusion of Impact Evaluation in project design was a missed opportunity.
          • The buy-in of the State government from the inception was considered pertinent for a new
              project.
          • Benefit package calibration if considered will introduce ‘value for money’ to the beneficiaries.
          • The World Bank wants clarification on the reasons behind the set targets for enrolees and the
              actual.

    5. Findings of Beneficiaries and Providers Perception of project (Gbenga Adedayo):
Perception of beneficiaries/providers presentation: The presentation was made in two parts; perception of
beneficiaries on the scheme and perception of providers on the scheme. The presentation focused on the
findings from the analysis from the key variables for both beneficiaries and providers.

Discussion on beneficiaries/providers presentation:
            • Data from the beneficiaries and providers assessment should be anonymized in the ICR.
            • A small number of enrolees were interviewed as this was a dip-stick survey. Besides, a similar
                in-depth by care with 600 respondents has been carried out
            • Collaboration of the State government on the technical level should be emphasized in the ICR.
            • The unsatisfactory nature of the responses of providers on capitation and fee for service was
                clarified by the contributions from HCHC
            • Dare Ogundipe (HCHC) suggested that for the community based projects like this, there is need
                to find providers with similar cost profile that will match the target population.
                101.
CAPDAN executives thanked all stakeholders for the CAPDAN project and expressed interest in the HBL
product. Dr Adenusi wrapped up this session by explaining the complexity of the business and stated that it is
a delicate balancing act keeping all scheme stakeholders happy.


   6. Next Steps:
         • The World Bank is proposing a ‘lessons learnt’ workshop for the first week of November in
             Abuja, in partnership with the NHIS.



                                                     53
       •   Similarly, a quality workshop is proposed for June in Lagos to coincide with the Bank’s ICR.

7. Closing: The meeting came to a close with lunch at 2.30pm.

Annex 7.       Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


Comments from Implementing agencies on draft World Bank ICR report
October 17th, 2014

1. Impact evaluation
The report states that the program would have greatly benefited from rigorous impact evaluation. We
agree with this conclusion. This evidence based approach was and is in line with our practice in other
health insurance programs in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa and included in our initial discussions.
Unfortunately, the final design that was agreed between the World Bank and the implementing partners
could not include such an Impact Evaluation. The GPOBA Commitment Paper of June 2007 only refers
to impact and feasibility analysis without being specific about the objectives and methodology for the
study or the party or parties responsible for commissioning and carrying out such a study.

2. Project redesign
The CAPDAN program was an innovative and experimental one (as mentioned several times in the
GPOBA Commitment Paper of June 2007). During the course of the program’s implementation, design
flaws and imperfections were identified and addressed. During a meeting of parties in Lagos on 4-7 July
2011 (see attached minutes of the meeting), a major redesign was discussed, including reallocation of
funding, program extension and revised enrollment targets. At the time, the World Bank made it clear
that no such redesign would be possible and that the project should retain its original design and targets
(even though this is explicitly stated in the Commitment Paper as a risk mitigation measure). An
extension of the program for one year only was deemed acceptable at the time (rather than the requested
two years). It is a fair question whether a learning mission such as the CAPDAN program should have
been held so rigidly to its original design and targets, rather than to allow further experimentation that
could have provided additional learnings.

3. Enrollment
One of the main indicators for the project, as discussed in the report, is the enrollment into the CAPDAN
program. The World Bank focuses on the actual achieved enrollment upon completion of the project,
which it concludes was adversely affected by the uncertainties surrounding the World Bank’s postponed
decision about extension. Discussions between the parties about extension were commenced in July of
2011 and the final decision was only communicated by the World Bank in June of 2013. At that time, a
year before the end of the extension that was granted, enrollment and re-enrollment into the CAPDAN
program had already been stopped in order to limit the financial exposure of the implementing parties.
As stated in the ICR report, the uncertainties surrounding the extension had led the implementing parties
to curtail marketing and sales efforts.
The ICR report takes the enrollment at the end of January 2014 as its measure of achievement, while it
would be fair to use the enrollment figure at the moment that enrollment and re-enrollment were




                                                    55
stopped at the end of April 2013 (enrollment: 9,001) as this is the actual close-out date of the CAPDAN
program. Enrollees only remained eligible for services for one year after enrollment ended.
At its peak, enrollment into the CAPDAN program was close to 70% of the entire target group. This is
an exceptionally high level of enrolment in a voluntary health insurance scheme, especially in the
Nigerian context. The report also points to the fact that, at the program’s peak, re-enrollment rates were
high (77% adjusted for migration). This points to a high demand for health insurance, demand that was
severely affected by growing uncertainties surrounding the program’s future from year three of
implementation onwards.

4. Co-premium
An issue that is connected to enrollment is the increase in co-premium paid by the enrollees. In the
original design it was envisaged that enrollees would bear more than half of the cost of premium by the
end of the first phase in 2013. As the program progressed it became increasingly clear that such a goal
was not realistic given the ability and willingness to pay for health insurance by the majority of the
target group, despite the gradual increase in co-premium over a period of 10 years. The report cites
studies commissioned by the implementing partners in 2011 into pricing and package composition to get
a better understanding of the balance between coverage and contributions. Despite pressure to adhere to
the original design, the World Bank and the implementing partners agreed to limit the co-premium
increases to maintain affordability. An analysis conducted by PharmAccess in 2011 (see attached
powerpoint presentation) indicated that, due to attrition and migration, the enrollment within the
CAPDAN group would decline anyway because of the group’s limited size. It can be argued that
enrollment had reached near saturation levels by 2011.

5. Government engagement
The ICR report criticizes the implementing partners for not engaging the government in the design and
monitoring of the program. The GPOBA Commitment Paper of June 2007 aims at sustainability being
achieved through an increased contribution to the premium by the enrollees in the program. The idea
being that this particular target group, being somewhat better off than other poor groups, would be able
to afford the full cost of the premium after a period of ten years.
The document contains an endorsement letter from the Federal Ministry of Health for the CAPDAN
project dated 19th of February 2007. In addition, the document states that the CAPDAN target group
was not likely to benefit from NHIS initiatives any time soon. The only mention of proposed
government engagement is one proposed by the World Bank to explore with Government of Nigeria the
possibilities of establishing an equalization fund for cross-subsidizing health insurance premiums for the
poor. No mention is made of engagements with NHIS or the Lagos State Government. It would appear
that such a requirement has been added post-hoc to the ICR.
Over the years, the implementing partners have actually engaged with Lagos State Government and the
NHIS on multiple occasions to discuss our health insurance programs. The approach taken has not been
significantly different from the successful engagements with Kwara and Ogun State governments.
Engagement with Lagos government and NHIS has taken considerable time to achieve, but
unfortunately did not during the program lead to a co-financing partnership . Currently, the relationship
with Lagos State Government is good and joint initiatives in areas of healthcare quality (SafeCare) are
being discussed. PharmAccess regularly attends the Lagos State Health Insurance Implementation
Committee. PharmAccess and HCHC have also participated in constructive engagements with NHIS
and State Governments organized by the World Bank Group.




                                                    56
6. Sustainability
The original design of the CAPDAN program was for sustainability to be achieved over a 10-year period
as enrollees would take on an ever greater proportion of the premium payments until they were able to
finance the entire premium. This was an innovative and experimental approach to sustainability for
Community Based Health Insurance. During the implementation, it became clear that this approach
would not work for the majority of the target group (see section on co-premium).
The report mentions that the first year’s premium of $68.06 was slightly more than twice the per capita
public expenditure ($32.53) in 2008 (please mention the source) indicating the government could not
afford the scheme. To compare the Total Premium with Government Health Expenditure is incorrect.
When comparing, it should be Premium Subsidy compared with Government Health Expenditure. To
evaluate the design, it should be taken into account that over the course of the program the premium
subsidy would become close to the available State Government Expenditure. Mainly due to continuation
of excess medical expenses on fee for services this was not achieved. This also was true for the other
Lagos Health Insurance Schemes which showed even higher excess medical expenses, which
demonstrate that sustainable financing of health expenditure in urban settings like Lagos poses a great
financial risk. In rural settings however we have seen that sustainable financing of health expenditure is
likely. Actually, CAPDAN was the financially best performing urban scheme showing the lowest rates
of excess medical expenses. This was shared with the Lagos State Government Health Commissioner.

7. Medical expenditure
The ICR report points to fact that the cost of medical services outstripped the allocation for these costs
within the premium. To calculate such an allocation, data is required for the costs and usage of care by a
specific target group, which were unavailable at the start of the project. At the time of proposal writing,
such calculations had to be done within clear limitations. The surplus payments within the CAPDAN
program were quite limited to start with and only increased substantially as enrollment dropped and
adverse selection increased, limiting and skewing the risk pool. The report points to measure taken by
HCHC to curtail medical costs, especially for chronic ailments. The report states that ‘excess’ (a
judgmental term where we assume it is should be ’excess’) capitation and fee-for-service payments were
done by HCHC. By their very nature, capitation fees cannot lead to excess medical payouts, as they are
fixed reimbursements per member for a given period (e.g. monthly). Actuarial analysis conducted by
Miliman (an international firm of actuaries) actually led to (slight) increases of the capitation fees so as
to fairly reimburse healthcare providers in the program for their primary care services.




                                                    57
8. Discontinuing enrollment and phase-out strategy
The ICR report states that the discontinuation of enrollment may have led to mistrust of the scheme
among the target group. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that this has actually happened. The
exit plan that was developed was aimed at avoiding reputational damage to all partners. This was
achieved through stakeholder meetings (e.g. CAPDAN executives, Medical Directors, enrollee forums).
The ICR report talks of a poorly executed phase-out strategy. It remains unclear on what evidence this
classification is based. HCHC, PAF and the World Bank agreed upon an exit plan, which included
engaging the stakeholders (CAPDAN executives, Medical Directors, enrollee representatives) and
developing a migration phase program (to HBL). These plans were executed as agreed and stakeholders
were engaged and carried along. Whereas potential negative publicity could have taken place after the
announcement of the end of the program the opposite was the case. In our view the phase out was
managed very well by all partners including the World Bank.
The ICR criticizes HIF for delaying for about 8 months (after PAF had indicated the need for change)
before submitting such a request to the World Bank. This observation is not correct. Based on lessons
learned from implementation, the HIF (in collaboration with PharmAccess and HCHC) started a
discussion with the World Bank (Fatou Assah, TTL CAPDAN) about a review of the CAPDAN project.
On 4-7 July 2011 (not August 2011), at the Supervisory Mission in Lagos, the HIF presented these
changes that it thought were crucial to ensure effective implementation. On Monday, September 12,
revised changes (based on the outcome of the Supervision Mission in July 2011) were sent to the TTL
CAPDAN. The approval process by the World Bank took one year and nine months, which disrupted an
effective implementation and phase-out strategy of the program.

9. Phase II extension
The report criticizes HIF for not recruiting additional donors to fund the second phase of the CAPDAN
program. Clearly, this would lead to enhanced sustainability of the program. However, due to the
uncertainties surrounding phase one due in large part to the long delay by the World Bank in approving
the revised program and the refusal to accept revised enrollment targets as well as the effects on
enrollment (as discussed in the section on enrollment), it is not reasonable to assign this solely to HIF as
there were too many uncertain project outcomes and no foreseeable partnership with the Lagos State
Government.

10. Finances
The ICR report is based on figures for disbursed funding (cash advances) only, while relevant figures
are those for realized expenditure. Please see attached overview of expenditures.
On page 42 it is mentioned that various financial management supervision reports and audit reports
showed that project management did not provide detailed breakdown of expenditures incurred We
assume that the above refers to World Bank project management, financial management supervision
reports and internal audit reports not available to us.
and at project closing there was inadequate documentation to support such expenditures. In case this
reflects to us please provide us more detail when and how this occurred.
We would like to state that HIF, PAF and HCHC have always provided the requested information and
reporting during the entire program. No notice of any breach was provided by the World Bank to us. As
agreed in the action plan of late September 2014 we are preparing the supporting documents of
Categories 3-7 for the final due diligence audit by the FM at project closing.

Comments on draft World Bank ICR report by Consultants who prepared the borrower ICR
October 17th, 2014
It is a complicated task to comment on the Bank’s ICR which scores Bank and Implementing Agency’s
performance as ‘Moderately Unsatisfactory’ respectively. The justification for Bank’s assessment is
detailed clearly. I think what is important are the lessons learned going forward. Again these are clearly
detailed in the report.
For us, three of these stand out: (a) the project design ought to have aligned reduced subsidies (increased
premiums) to increased services; (b) M&E design should have included impact evaluation (clear and
documented development & intermediate objectives and the indicators to measure them in the approved
project documents), establishing baseline levels and setting performance milestones; and (c) slow
restructuring of project against an announced freeze of new enrollment (project closure). This is all
water under the bridge now.
Opportunity lies in using the lessons learned from this project implementation to bear on the design and
implementation of the new product.
Nevertheless, unless there has been further reconciliation of figures between the Bank and the Project,
some slight inconsistencies in the Project ICR and Bank’s ICR data. These are detailed below:

Page 9/72: IO Indicator 4: This ICR report gives an average of 2.4 visits per enrollee but project ICR
has a different utilization figures recorded for this: 3.1 visits per enrollee in 2011 increased to about 4
visits per enrollee in the first half of 2013
Page 9/72: PDO Indicator 3 figure should be 14 and not 15. There were 15 service providers in the
project as at the end of 2013 but only 14 were in compliance with the service quality standards specified
by PAI (OnTrack Assessment) (please see ‘ Table 9 – Summary of Finding from Project Monitoring
Indicators’ in CAPDAN ICR Report submitted). This was based on the reported data/information in the
semiannual progress reports.
Page 28/72: ‘Figure 2: Actual and planned enrollment’ figures in the graph is different from what we
found during the preparation of the CAPDAN ICR report.

Comments from Implementing agencies on draft World Bank ICR report
January 13, 2015

ICR reviewer
Samuel Mills
Senior Health Specialist

Amsterdam, 13 January 2015

Subject: Response to CAPDAN ICR draft report dated December 18 2014, Pre-Paid Health Scheme
Project TF 092182

Dear Samuel,
Thank your for sharing the 2nd ICR draft report and giving PAI and HIF the opportunity to respond. You
have done a massive job in providing this extensive report on such a comprehensive program with so



                                                    59
many levels of input, output, outcomes and impact. We are very appreciative of your support, time and
collaboration during this process.
After reviewing carefully the second ICR draft report we acknowledge that all data corrections have been
adopted but also feel there are still some fundamental outstanding concerns and we would kindly request
to take these comments into consideration for the final draft.
We will first discuss the six most important factual observations and conclude this letter with a description
of the broader outcomes of the Pre-Paid Health Scheme plus our main conclusions.

1. Finances On page 22/23 it is mentioned for both PAF (5.2(b)) as well as HIF (5.2(c)) that “further,
outstanding disbursement issues were only resolved in November 2014 (6 months after project closing)
due to inadequate financial documentation”. This does not reflect the sequence of events. HIF and PAF
did report on expenses in a timely manner during the full project period. Reports and withdrawal
applications were approved, no comments were given. Not until Q3 2013 was a first question raised: could
HIF (and PAF) report on cash transfers instead of realized expenses. PAF, supported by Deloitte
Accountants, argued that the way PAF prepared the financial documentation for this program was the
proper way to do this for such an insurance orientated program (with prepayments). The FM of the World
Bank argued that it did not match the World Bank policies. On September 29 2014, we agreed on an action
plan to resolve these differences. According to this action plan HIF (and PAF) delivered on their part of
the action plan in 7 separate ‘responses’ which were only reviewed and approved by the FM Saidou Diop
during his visit to Amsterdam from 13-17th November 2014.
On a yearly basis HIF (and PAF) submitted subsidy statements. Annual external auditor’s (Deloitte)
opinions on these statements were unqualified. After the closing date of the program (April 30, 2014)
Deloitte performed the last audit on the program. Policies within the World Bank did not allow
reimbursement of all costs concerning this audit. Therefore the final audit fees and personnel charges of
HIF, PharmAccess and HCHC after April 30, 2014 related to the closure of the program were not
reimbursed (due to the several layers of reporting HIF/PAF could not report earlier)
The PAF scoring has been downgraded from satisfactory to moderately satisfactory because of above
mentioned delay of the financial review. Something for which PAF nor HIF nor HCHC can be held
accountable for.
2. Project redesign and enrollment targets The report states that the restructuring request did not include
a reduction in the number of target enrollees despite the evidence that it was unattainable (page 23). The
CAPDAN program was an innovative and experimental one (as mentioned several times in the GPOBA
Commitment Paper of June 2007). During the course of the program’s implementation, design flaws and
imperfections were identified and addressed. During a meeting of parties in Lagos on 4-7 July 2011 (see
minutes of the meeting), a major redesign was discussed, including reallocation of funding, program
extension and revised enrollment targets. At the time, the World Bank made it clear that no such redesign
would be possible and that the project should retain its original design and targets (even though this is
explicitly stated in the Commitment Paper as a risk mitigation measure). An extension of the program for
one year only was deemed acceptable at the time (rather than the requested two years) but revised
enrollment targets was a taboo. Hence we didn’t include revised enrollment targets in the amended
agreement (restructuring proposal) in April 2012. It is a fair question whether an innovative pilot program
as the CAPDAN program should have been held rigid to its original design and targets, rather than to
allow adjustment of the design and testing models that could have provided additional learnings. The
enrollment indicator is the main indicator of this program and carries more weight and the rigid attitude
regarding enrollment target has influenced the end scoring of both HIF and PAF.




                                                     60
3. Impact evaluation The 2nd draft ICR report still states that the program would have greatly benefited
from rigorous impact evaluation. We agree with this conclusion and this evidence based approach was
and is in line with our practice in other health insurance programs in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa and
included in our initial discussions. Unfortunately, the final design that was agreed between the World
Bank and the implementing partners could not include such a long term impact evaluation parallel to the
implementation of the program. The GPOBA Commitment Paper of June 2007 only refers to impact and
feasibility analysis without being specific about the objectives and methodology for the study or the party
or parties responsible for commissioning and carrying out such a study and to include a budget header for
this research.
We would appreciate if the report is adjusted to reflect that at the start the GPOBA Commitment Paper
could not include a rigorous impact evaluation as is the case in other HIF/PAF programs.
4. Enrollment One of the main indicators for the project, as discussed in the report, is the enrollment
into the CAPDAN program. The World Bank focuses on the actual achieved enrollment upon
completion of the project, which it concludes was adversely affected by the uncertainties surrounding
the World Bank’s postponed decision about extension and the fact that we were not allowed to change
the enrollment target. Discussions between the parties about extension were commenced in July of 2011
and the final decision was only communicated by the World Bank in June of 2013. At that time, a year
before the end of the extension that was granted, enrollment and re-enrollment into the CAPDAN
program had already been stopped in order to limit the financial exposure of the implementing parties,
which is necessary because of the financial commitment to policyholders and clinics that any insurance
program needs to take into account. And also to manage expectations at target group level.
As stated in the ICR report, the uncertainties surrounding the extension had led the implementing parties
to curtail marketing and sales efforts.
The ICR report takes the enrollment at the end of January 2014 as its measure of achievement, while it
would be fair to use the enrollment figure at the moment that enrollment and re-enrollment were stopped
at the end of April 2013 (enrollment: 9,001) as this is the actual close-out date of the CAPDAN program
when the marketing program was stopped. Enrollees remained eligible for services for one year after
enrollment ended.
At its peak, enrollment into the CAPDAN program was close to 70% of the entire target group. This is an
exceptionally high level of enrolment in a voluntary health insurance scheme, especially in the Nigerian
context. The report also points to the fact that, at the program’s peak, re-enrollment rates were high (77%
adjusted for migration). This points to a high demand for health insurance, demand that was severely
affected by growing uncertainties surrounding the program’s future from year three of implementation
onwards. Notot mention the client satisfaction rate of 72%.
Finally it is important to mention that we started the phase out strategy (April 2013) to avoid reputational
damage for World Bank. HCHC and PharmAccess. In a face to face meeting with Mrs. Marie Francoise
Marie-Nelly (Country Director World Bank Nigeria, September 2013), she made very explicit that she
was happy the program extension now facilitated the adequate and professionally executed risk mitigation
measures at the final stage of the program in order to protect the interests of beneficiaries, continuity of
clinics and local partners and reduce potential reputational risk. Phasing out a project is a delicate process,
especially in the business of health insurance. Insurance is a business of trust and this trust could be broken
if the scheme, that the low income groups in the Computer Village of Lagos have learned to appreciate,
would close abruptly. Moreover, this group of people will then no longer be protected against health risks
which pose a great threat to their lives and livelihoods. Therefore, the project implementers have been
developing a phase-out strategy to mitigate the above mentioned risks. This phase-out strategy was mainly
focused on replacing the scheme’s dependence on subsidies with a new feasible, sustainable and low-cost



                                                      61
insurance product of which the cost will be fully borne by its enrollees. By offering the target population
the possibility to transition from the World Bank supported program into a new affordable insurance
program the risk of loss of trust amongst the target population will be reduced and the risk of reputational
damage mitigated. It is logical that, as the result of a transition phase, the enrollment numbers have
declined. Hence, we strongly advise not to rely only on the end reference date (January 2014).
5. Government engagement The ICR report criticizes the implementing partners for not engaging the
government in the design and monitoring of the program. The GPOBA Commitment Paper of June 2007
aims at sustainability being achieved through an increased contribution to the premium by the enrollees
in the program. The idea being that this particular target group, being somewhat better off than other
poor groups, would be able to afford the full cost of the premium after a period of ten years.
The document contains an endorsement letter from the Federal Ministry of Health for the CAPDAN
project dated 19th of February 2007. In addition, the document states that the CAPDAN target group was
not likely to benefit from NHIS initiatives any time soon. The only mention of proposed government
engagement is one proposed by the World Bank to explore with Government of Nigeria the possibilities
of establishing an equalization fund for cross-subsidizing health insurance premiums for the poor. No
mention is made of engagements with NHIS or the Lagos State Government. It would appear that such a
requirement has been added post-hoc to the ICR.
However with hindsight, we agree that it would have been good to have engaged more with the Lagos
State Government at an earlier stage. However the situation in Lagos State at the time was not comparable
with the situation in Kwara as mentioned in the report. In Kwara State the governor was one of the initators
from the onset together with of the HCHC which led after 8 years to a full agreement to finance the
premium subsidies and was selected as a top 10 winner of the 2014 OECD “Taking development
innovations to scale” award.
Over the years, the implementing partners have actually engaged with Lagos State Government and the
NHIS on multiple occasions to discuss our health insurance programs. The approach taken has not been
significantly different from the successful engagements with Kwara and Ogun State governments.
Engagement with Lagos government and NHIS has taken considerable time to achieve, but unfortunately
did not during the program lead to a co-financing partnership. Currently, the relationship with Lagos State
Government is good and joint initiatives in areas of healthcare quality are developed. Lagos State has
requested and has already funded PharmAccess to perform SafeCare assessments, train quality teams and
develop Quality Improvement Plans for three healthcare facilities, namely General Hospital Epe, General
Hospital Alimosho and General Hospital Apapa, as well as assist in the development of a Quality Policy
for Public Sector Healthcare Facilities under Lagos State Ministry of Health (LSMOH). A MoU between
PharmAccess-SafeCare and Lagos State will be signed in the coming weeks.
PharmAccess regularly attends the Lagos State Health Insurance Implementation Committee.
PharmAccess and HCHC have also participated in constructive engagements with NHIS and State
Governments organized by the World Bank Group.
6. Phase II extension The report criticizes HIF for not recruiting additional donors to fund the second
phase of the CAPDAN program. Clearly, this would lead to enhanced sustainability of the program.
However, due to the short duration of the Phase I, the local policy uncertainties since the start of phase
one, in combination with the difficulty for the World Bank in approving any program redesigns, we feel
it is not reasonable to assign this solely to HIF as there were too many uncertain project outcomes and no
foreseeable partnership with the Lagos State Government.
And in general this type of program requires a longer term commitment, in order to develop appropriate
policies, allow for development of adequate structures, adopt new strategies, and build trust in these new
institutions.

7. Broader outcomes of the Pre-Paid Health Scheme and conclusions The Pre-Paid Health Scheme
Project CAPDAN has a couple of important broader outcomes which unfortunately didn't fall within the
scope of the ICR:
    1. The established financial leverage through investments in the participating private clinics in Lagos
    2. The continuous and measurable quality improvement in the clinics which is an important return
        on the investment
    3. The contribution to policy development and capacity building for access to quality healthcare in
        combination with health insurance to NHIS, Lagos State and state wide insurance schemes by
        using the lessons learned and data we have collected over the years. This has led to deepening of
        understanding and contributed to the acceleration of developments in Nigeria to the introduction
        of the UHC Declaration in March 2014.
In addition the CAPDAN Pre-Paid Health Scheme was highly appreciated by beneficiaries, HCHC, and
providers and most importantly also NHIS and Lagos State, which has recently announced its policy
change into the direction of State -wide supported Health Insurance.
A survey was carried out to assess the perception of the beneficiaries of the pre-paid health scheme
implemented between 2009 and 2013 in April, 2014 and the beneficiary rating was satisfactory and
beneficiaries had good experiences in using the product. In the overall ICR rating this appreciation is not
reflected.
Moreover the overall quality of the health care system in the neighborhood has improved dramatically.
Experiences with the new non-subsidized scheme of Hygeia are still rather recent. However we are quite
confident that this non subsidized product could be very appropriate. When time comes such a
commercially viable product for low income working class may be complemented with subsidized
products supported by the Nigerian federal and state governments.
Last but not least, we believe GPOBA and World Bank Group have been – together with the Dutch
Government - instrumental in a very early stage of development, where health insurance for the informal
sector was completely unknown and untested in Nigeria, in laying the foundation for the current
developments towards UHC in Nigeria. Substantial credit is given by Nigerian public and private
stakeholders to this initiative. We believe this 2nd draft ICR report is too modest in this respect and could
give a higher appreciation to the teams from World Bank Group, GPOBA and its partners for achieving
this contribution and recognition.
Taking all our comments into account, please be assured that we are impressed of the diligence and quality
of the work provided in the ICR. We would like to thank you for this.
