Agricultural Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project supports the second phase of\n            implementation of the Government's medium-term\n            agricultural sector adjustment program.  The essential\n            objectives of the sector adjustment program are to foster\n            efficient agricultural growth and to contribute to the\n            reduction of budgetary and current account deficits to\n            manageable levels, while minimizing the social costs of\n            adjustment.  This second sector adjustment loan seeks to (a)\n            liberalize the agricultural and food pricing, marketing and\n            trade regimes, while encouraging productivity increase, and\n            ensuring adequate protection to low income groups; (b)\n            complete the short-term restructuring and the design of\n            medium-term priorities for the public expenditure program;\n            and (c) continue the streamlining of essential governmental\n            support services and the transfer of commercially viable\n            ones to the private and cooperative sectors.  It also aims\n            to (d) encourage agro-industrial exports; (e) improve the\n            management of natural resources (land, forests); and (f)\n            further strengthen institutional capacity for sector policy\n            analysis, formulation and performance monitoring. The\n            foreign exchange provided by the loan is to be used to\n            finance an agreed program of imports of inputs needed for\n            stimulating agricultural production."}, "docdt": "1987-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
