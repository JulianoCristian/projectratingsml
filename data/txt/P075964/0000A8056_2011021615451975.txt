                         and accountability of the Cameroon education sector.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was restructured in April 2010 to improve the coherence in project design and better align the PDO and Project indicators with planned activities. The Project Coordination
                         Unit (PCU) was able to build on the momentum created by the restructuring, and appropriate steps have been taken to launch a number of important activities. Within the project,
                         priority has now to be given to activities with high value added either because i) they will support the update of the sector strategy (Component 1), or ii) they will have an immediate
                         impact on population, in particular in the most disadvantaged schools (Component 4).

                         With less than 2 years to implement remaining activities, it is crucial to maintain, and in some cases increase, the pace of implementation, which requires that the PCU is adequately

                         staffed and its governance is preserved. There is room to further improve the decision-making process at all levels so that activities can be prepared and delivered in a timely and
                         satisfactory manner.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Component 1: The PCU needs to monitor closely progress in all the necessary procurement steps so that activities can start by Q1 2011 as currently planned.

                         Component 4: all stakeholders need to give more attention to i) the recruitment of Consultants to which the renovation of classrooms will be delegated, ii) the design of
                         communication and awareness activities around the sector strategy and the involvement of communities in education matters.

                         Project management and monitoring: appropriate actions will be taken to resolve staffing issues at the PCU in a timely manner, and ensure that compliance with IDA rules is met.
                         Monitoring and Evaluation will be strengthened to better capture progress and achievements by the Project.
