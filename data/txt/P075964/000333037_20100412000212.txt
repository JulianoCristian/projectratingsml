                                        Proposed Changes

a. What are the proposed changes, as applicable, in the project's development objectives,
   outcomes, design, and/or scope?

Change in Project Development Objective (PDO)

The revised PDO reads as follows: "To develop and apply management and learning tools for
use by government and communities to improve efficiency and accountability of the Cameroon
education sector."

The new PDO focuses on those strategies and actions of the Education Sector Strategy (ESS) that
aim to reinforce management of the education system. The ESS was established by the
government in 2006 and has four objectives: (i) access and equity, (ii) quality and efficiency; (iii)
private sector and partnership; and (iv) management and governance. The ESS aims to reach this
fourth goal through improved strategic management, evaluation capacity and planning of the
education system. The restructured project is expected to contribute to this last objective.

More specifically, the restructured project will provide tools, training and other forms of support
to education authorities, communities and the general public to: (i) continually hone the strategic
vision for the education system through analysis, knowledge sharing and dissemination; (ii)
improve the education information system to ensure greater accountability and better decision
making; (iii) improve sector monitoring by education authorities, the government and the public;
and (iv) provide opportunities for greater participation of beneficiaries in education decision
making, thus increasing accountability.

Change in Components

The restructured project will include four components that target four key areas of education
planning and management. All existing activities have been reorganized under the restructured
components to facilitate coherence in project design and improve project monitoring. Many of the
project activities are presently in various stages of implementation and some have already been
completed. Activities dependent on the promulgation of legal decisions that have yet to be taken
have been removed.

Component 1 (US$3.2 million): Develop and update the strategic vision for the education
sector

The objective for Component 1 is: "to create capacity for continuous development of Cameroon's
Education Sector Strategy by supporting knowledge exchange and the production of relevant
studies."

The activities planned under Component 1 include: (i) the preparation of studies relevant to the
improvement of the education sector's strategic vision; (ii) capacity building activities for the
sector; and (iii) establishment of the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) and the
Inter-University Resource Documentation Centers (Centre Inter-Universitaire des Ressources
Documentaires, CIRD). The intended outcome of these activities is the capacity to continuously
update the education sector strategy, based on the most recent qualitative and quantitative data
and enhanced by international knowledge sharing.



                                                 6
Component 2 (US$1.4 million):         Strengthening the education information system and
planning capacity

The objective of Component 2 is: "to improve management of the education system at all levels
by reinforcing the information systems and planning capacity for the production of timely and
accurate statistical data and the production of sector action plans."

The activities under Component 2 include the development of management information systems
that improve the collection, compilation, analysis and dissemination of statistics to support
decision making and accountability of the primary, secondary and higher education levels of the
education system. This includes the acquisition of equipment and training in relevant technical
areas. The intended outcomes are the improvement in the efficiency of the education sector's
information system, production of education monitoring tools of current education status, and a
school health map to inform the preparation of a new school health policy.

Component 3 (US$1.5 million): Reinforcing sector monitoring

The objective of Component 3 is: "to reinforce sector norms, improve capacity to monitor
compliance with norms and regulations and to improve education resource management at the
primary and secondary levels."

This component includes activities that reinforce the capacity to evaluate management reforms.
They include training, workshops, and technical assistance. The component will also provide
tools and instruments in the form of technical support to improve the implementation of the new
private education law.

Component 4 (US$3.7 million): Improving public participation

The objective of Component 4 is: "to increase the public accountability of the education system."

This component includes (i) public awareness campaigns and governance workshops to increase
public accountability of the education system; and (ii) a school rehabilitation program in the
Priority Education Areas (ZEP, Zones d'Education prioritaires) regions aims to increase
accountability of government financed actions to beneficiary communities. Together with
beneficiary communities in the ZEP, the government has identified 86 sites where schools require
rehabilitation and equipment. Communities will provide oversight of these school projects and
will receive final deliverables. The intended outcomes are improved awareness of ZEP
communities of new rules and policies of the education system; an increase in the level of
beneficiary participation in the functioning of the school and of school accountability to
beneficiaries.

The restructured project will have the following new outcome indicators: (i) preparation of
budgets based on statistical analysis at every level of the education system; (ii) improved
efficiency and equity in teachers' allocation; (iii) biennial update of the ESS on the basis of
analytical studies; (iv) increased beneficiary participation in school functioning and school
accountability in 86 selected schools in the ZEP.

b. What are the other complementary changes, as applicable:

Institutional arrangements                                               X Yes ___No

Streamlining and strengthening of the coordination structures

Two changes were made in the institutional arrangements of the project to improve the
coordination between ministries and the Project Coordination Unit (PCU). First, a representative
of the Presidency has been added to the Project Steering Committee. Second, the membership of
the Operational Monitoring Unit (OMU) in each ministry has been streamlined. There will no
longer be focal points for sub-components and their responsibilities will be transferred to
component managers, who have a more technical oversight role. Furthermore, a member of the
PCU will also be part of the OMU. Finally, a new monitoring and evaluation specialist has been
recruited.

New implementation arrangements for School projects under Component 4

School projects under Component 4 will be implemented through a delegated management
arrangement (Maitrise d'Ouvrage Délégué ­ MOD) in form and substance satisfactory to the
Bank. The project will recruit a consultant (e.g. NGO) which will be responsible, inter alia, for
ensuring the execution of preliminary site studies, the hiring of contractors for rehabilitation and
other works, contracting with suppliers for needed purchases, supervision of works and delivery
and ensuring that final products are delivered to the government according to contract
stipulations. The delegated management contract will describe, inter alia, the functions to be
undertaken by such consultant, setting forth dated objectives to be attained and performance
indicators, and requiring the consultant to comply with disbursement, financial management,
procurement requirements and environmental and social safeguards, all in accordance with the
Project Accounting, Financial and Administrative Manual (PAFAM), the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA), the Environmental Mitigation Plan (EMP) and any additional instruments
pursuant to the terms of the EMP. For example, the contracts with the delegated management
arrangement will stipulate that each rehabilitation project needs to complete the environmental
and social screening form and all small projects will include measures to improve sanitary
conditions (e.g., latrines). In addition, the consultant will adopt approaches to involve
beneficiaries served by the school in the oversight and delivery of the school project.

In addition, going forward, the project will be submitted to the provisions of the new Anti-
corruption guidelines ("Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in
Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants", dated October 15, 2006).

Financing mechanism/Conduit                                               ___Yes     X No
If, yes, please explain:


Outputs                                                                   X Yes ___No
If, yes, please explain:

The original project design anticipated the signature into law of the 1998 education law within the
first year of implementation. This law would have restructured Cameroon's pre-university
education system, but has still not been promulgated. Consequently, certain activities, such as the
reform of the secondary school curriculum, could not be carried out. Activities that depend on the
1998 law have now been removed from the project, particularly those related to changing the
secondary education curriculum. Resources that were allocated to the relevant activities (training,
study tours, and workshops) have been reallocated to other activities, such as information
campaigns that are included under Component 4. Analytical work on secondary education will be
conducted under Component 1, thus providing the basis for consideration of future secondary
education reform.

                                                 8
Project Costs and financing plan (include summary tables)       X Yes ___No
If, yes, please explain:

The overall cost of the project remains unchanged at US$22.2 million, consisting of US$ 18.2
million of IDA financing, and US$4 million financed by the Government. Almost all existing
activities will be retained under the restructured project (albeit under the new components).
However, as mentioned above, certain activities linked to legal decisions that have not been made
have been removed from the project. The associated funds will be used for remaining activities
under the restructured project. Estimated costs by components under the restructured project are
presented below.

Financial management                                                    X Yes ___No
If, yes, please explain:

In order to improve financial management unit and address identified shortcoming, the PCU
implemented several changes. The last supervision mission carried out in November 2009
assessed project implementation and concluded that all main elements have been addressed for
the restructuring to go forward:
     New procedures were adopted for the payment of workshop trainees;
     Recruitment of an administrative and finance specialist into the PCU;
     Recruitment of an internal auditor;
     The audit plan is comprehensive and detailed and is being executed.
     No prior audit, ineligible expenses, or FM accountability issues are outstanding.


Disbursement arrangements                                       X Yes ____No
If, yes, please explain:

The proposed changes entail a reallocation of funds by spending category as detailed in the table
below. The main impact of the restructuring on resource allocation is to increase the share of
consultant services and to decrease that of training, study tours and workshops. In addition, the

                                               9
category "works" has been reduced from US$300,000 to US$100,000 to take into account a

If, yes, please explain:

An intensive Post Procurement Review (PPR) was conducted in May 2009 (results made
available in July 2009) alongside a supervision mission to determine what needed to change in
terms of procurement practice to process the government's request for restructuring. In October
2009 an assessment mission concluded that all major recommendations had been implemented,
except for the recruitment of a new procurement specialist. The said recruitment of the specialist
was completed in January 2010. The key changes that were made to improve procurement
include:
     Better and more transparent processes for requesting price quotations from potential
         suppliers;
     Regular publication of the results of bidding processes;
     Implementation of a system for receiving and validating reports produced by consultants;
     Recruitment of an internal auditor;
     Acceleration of payment of overdue bills;
     Better filing of documents, particularly with regards to cross filing of procurement and
         financial management documents.

Furthermore, the government has drafted a new procurement plan, which has been approved by
the task team.

If, yes, please explain:

The proposed changes to project design necessitates that the closing date of PASE be extended
until September 1, 2012 to allow time for the remaining activities to be implemented.

Implementation schedule                                                  X Yes ___No
If, yes, please explain:

Activities under Component 4 have suffered significant delays and no funds have been disbursed
for this activity since the beginning of the project. This component represents approximately 1/3
of overall project costs. It is expected that the new implementation arrangements for school
projects under Component 4, including the delegated management arrangement (MOD) will help
increase the pace of implementation.
