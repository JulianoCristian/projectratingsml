MEXICO
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE SECTOR PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN)
Guarantor:          United Mexican States
Executina           Comisi6n Nacional del Agua (CNA)
Agencyt
Amount:             US$400 Million equivalent
Terms:              Repayment in 17 years, including 5 years of grace at the
standard variable rate
Beneficiaries:      The program is estimated to benefit some 425,000 farmers,
of which about 50 percent have currentl7 an income of
less than the minimum wage. Additionally, some 100,000
people will benefit from river control works.
Proiect Ob1ectivas: The project would help the Government to:  (a) sustain
the irrigation and drainage sector through adequate
levels of investments selected on the basis of rigorous
economic and technical criteria, procured competitively
and implemented efficiently; (b) decentralize irrigation
funding and management through institutional reforms that
would gradually move funding of irrigation an', drainage
investments from a centrally managed system of Government
grants towards a system based on regional and local
public utilities which would help to recover costs
through user charges and collection instruments, and thus
help sustain the investments by the beneficiaries;
(c) fully utilize existing irrigation schemes by
finishing uncompleted works, upgrading deteriorated
infrastructure, and rehabilitating irrigated land
affected by water logging, salinity problems and lack of
maintenance; (d) improve water use efficiency by
natroducings better water management techniques, the
conjunctive use of surface and ground water, volumetric
measurement of water, providing more adaptive research
results, and training of technicians and farmers in
better operation and maintenance of the irrigation
infrastructures; (e) strengthen the institutional
capacity of CNA and user organizations to implement
policy programs, investments and maintenance; (f) monitor
and help prevent environmental and natural resource



-v -
degradation; and (g) optimize the use of land and water
resources in the Irrigation Districts and Units.
PErSo ew             The project would be the Government's investment
Descriptiont         program for irrigation, and drainage, covering FY 1991
th,ough 1994, totalling about US$1.2 billion. It would
include rehabO,itation and modernization and transfer to
users of 21 Irrigation Districts representing about 60
percent of total irrigated Districts, deferred
maintenance of the remaining 56 Districts, repair and
acquisition of maintenance equipment, completion of 23
on-going investments and construction of 3 new
investments. In support of these investments the project
also includes environmental studies and actions,
institutional development assistance for CNA and User
Organizations, and other studies and designs.
Project Benefits:   The proposed investment program is expected to
incorporat^, by the end of 1994, about 0.3 millio::
hectares new land under irrigation, and nearly 1.0
million hectares currently under irrigation would have
improved their efficiency as a result of the
rehabilitation and modernization projects. Additionally,
investment in drainage and other land improvements would
have brought under production some 0.56 million hectares
of rainfed agriculture. The program is estimated to
benefit some 425,000 farmers of which about 50 percent
have currently an income of less than the minimum wage.
Additionally, some 100,000 people will benefit from river
control works. Finally cost recovery and improved water
pricing is expected to help conserve about 10 percent to
20 percent water use.
Risks:               An inherent risk of a time-slice operation is related to
the Government's comiitments to provide adequate
resources (fiscal counterpart funds plus cash generation
through water charges): (i) for projects which will be
completed after the Closing Date of the proposed time-
slice; and (ii) for maintenance of the uxisting
irrigation infrastructure. A sharp shortfall in any of
these areas could compromise the viability of the
investment program. These risks would be reduced through
increased cost recovery plans supported by the
institutional decentralization and beneficiary
participation in water management. Moreover, the ennual
review of the investment program and budget proposed
under the project will help to size the level of planned
investments and O&M expenditures to the changing
macroeconomic conditions.
Since this is the first time-slice irrigation project in
Mexico there is a risk that the investment selection
criteria will not be strictly adhered to. This risk will
be substantially reduced through training and
institutional capacity strengthening of both CNA and
water Users' Associations and intensive Bank supervision.

I.  THE 8ECTIRQL-A&MT
A. The Agriculturo sector
1. Aariculture in th  Economy
1.1       Agriculture in Mexlco accounts for about 8 percent of GDP and
export., and around 30 percent of the population live. in rural areas. In the
1970s, agricultural GDP grow at an annual average rate of 3.2 percent. During
the 1980., as a result of the debt crisis, the stabilization effort, falling
real international prices and bad weather, and also poor economic and
agricultural policies, agricultural output grew at less than 1 percent per
year. As a result, output per capita declined and the country imported
increasing amounts of food to supply its domeotic consumption. This trend
began to be roversed in 1990 as a result of improved rainfall and the
successful implementation of the stabilization and restructuring programs
which have created the conditions for the recovery of growth.
2. Agricultural DevoloDment Policies
1.2       Since mid-1989 substantial reforms in agricultural price and trade
policy, agricultural input pricing, real interest rates for agricultural
credit and parastatal reform and divestiture have taken place. In price and
trade policy the main thrust of the reforms have been to move towards market
determined prices, to opening domestic production to external competition and
incorporate private agonts in the marketing of agricultural commodities.
These reforms, although far reaching, have not covered all agricultural
products. Maize, beans and milk--which represent around 30-35 percent of
value added in agriculture--are still subject to substantial price and trade
interventions and government marketing through CONASUPO (National Commission
for Nutrition). Agricultural input subsidies, a hallmark of Mexican
agricultural policy, have been reduced by making substantial increases in the
price of fertilizer., electricity end water chargeo. Changes in agricultural
input prices signal the Government'o decision to move towards a system by
which inputs are priced according to lnternational prices, their marginal cost
or their scarcity value to socioty. Input price adjustments, which have been
significant, have reduced but not eliminated subsidies to agricultural
producers. Interest payments for agricultural credit have been effectively
increased ly: (a) abolishing the highly inefficient insurance scheme that
operated through National Agricultural Insurance Agency (ANAGSA) (now closed);
and (b) Improving loan re,overy and granting credit on an individual rather
than on a collective basis in the ejidc system; parastatal divestiture and
reform accompanied price and trads policy reform. Thus, parastatals that
intervened in the tobacco (TABANU)s coffoo (INMECAPE), sugar (AZUCAR), cocoa
(CONADECA) end feedstuffs (ALBKEX) markets have been closed or their size
substantially reduced as divestiture of machinery end equipment has taken
place. Reforms havZ -lso started in CONASUP0, the largest parastatal dealing
with agriculture. The main reforms comprise: (a) withdrawal from the market
of corealo and grains other than maize end beans; (b) -?;ivatization of some
industrial plant.; (c) sale or closure of CONASUPO stores in high income urban
areas; and (d) streamlining of food programs (tortibonoo and social supply of
milk).



B. The IrriRation and Drainage Sub-Sector
1. General Background
Historical DeveloDment
1..3      Irrigation in Mexico plays an important role in agricultural
development.  Currently, although the nearly 6 million hectares21 of land
under irrigation represent only about 30 percent of all lands harvested they
nevertheless contribute around half the value of agricultural production and
provide 65 percent of agrieuittxral exports. In addition, there are about 15
million ha under rainfed agriculture, aringing the country's total area under
agricultural production to 21 million ha, out of the 30 million ha that have
agricultural potential.
1.4       Irrigation development has a long tradition in Mexico; by the
mid-1920s the country had alreQdy over 1.0 million hectares of irrigated land,
which were expanded to over 3.0 million hectares by 1960. The 1960s witnessed
a substantial 4.ncrease in irrigation investment, which added another 1.5
million hectares in irrigated land. This trend continued during the 19708,
particularly during the second half of the decade, and went on to the early
19809 with a further 1.1 million hectares of irrigated land being brought
under production during that period. This brought the total area under
irrigation to 5.3 million hectares by 1982, with nearly half of the expansit.n
that took place during the latter period coming from small irrigation schemes.
Currently the total irrigated area in Mexico is a little over 6.0 million
hectsres.
1.5       Historically, irrigation development, apart from contributing to
expanded agricultural production, had been used as a means of meeting two
long-term political objectives: (a) to create areas suitable for agricultural
production in the arid, northern region to resettle population, and (b) to
redistribute land and increase income of small farmers and e1idatarios. Hence
the emphasis on the expansion of irrigated land rather than on improvement to
the overall efficiency of the irrigation schemes. By the early 1980s, some
420,000 ejidatarios and 150,000 small farmers had benefitted from the
redistribution of about 2.9 million ha of irrigated lands.
1.6       This rapid expansion of irrigated lands, however, came to a near
halt as a consequence of the financial crisis which began in 1982 and the
sharp reduction in public investment that characterized the subsequent
stabilizatior. programs of the Government. Public investment and expenditures
in hydraulic infrastructure, which has represented about three-quarters of
agricultural sector investment, declined from US$3,600 million annually to
US$230 million annually between 1981 and 1990. Although this decline followed
the general trend of total public investment, investment in irrigation
infrastructure was worse hit than other sectors in the economy. In 1988,
investment in irrigation and drainage infrastructure represented less than 3
percent of total public investment compared to nearly 10 percent ten years
earlier. As a result, the rate of expansion Af irrigated land, which had
reached an average of nearly 150,000 ha per annum in 1979-1981, was reduced to
a mere 5,000 ha in 1988. A similar trend can be seen in the areas
rehabilitated each year, which declined from 114,000 ha to less than 6,000 ha
over the same period. Moreover, the economic crisis affected not only new

investments but aluo the resources available for maintaining existing
infrasitructure. Government estimates indicate that about 0.8 million hectares
of irrigated land are lying idle or are badly under-utilized as a result of
the deterioration of the infrastructure due to poo- maintenance, and a further
1.5 million hectares, which although under cultivation, are in need of
rehabilitation to restore them to their original level of efficiency.
1.7       The private sector has developed 1.4 million hectares of irrigated
area, representing about 25 percent of total irrigated area in Mexico.
However, there are still some regulatory and financial constraints for
expanding private irrigation. A Bank sector study for this sub-sector is
planned for PY92 and may provide the basis for a possible project for private
irrigation.
The Irrigation Systems
1.8       The design and size of all irrigation systems vary with the
climate, water resources and arable land distribution. In th&e densely
populated central highlands with moderate rainfall (600 to 900 mm annually),
irrigation serves mainly to supplement the rainy season crop; however, where
groundwater is tapped, second season cropping is also practiced. In the
absence ei large rivers and storage systems, irrigation schemes are small, and
farm size averages only 3 ha for farmers with irrigatad land (See IBRD Map
No. 23178). In the Northwest and North Central Regions, with a more
pronounced arid climate (200 to 500 mm of rainfall annually), cropping, which
would be impossible without irrigation, is confined largely to the winter
season. The country's largest integrated irrigation systems are found in the
Northwestern Region, along river valleys draining from the Sierra Madre
mountain ranges into the Pacific. Farm sizes are also larger than in the
central highlands, averaging between 15 and 20 ha. In the East, along the
Gulf coast, raiufall is moderate to heavy (600 to 1,300 mm annually) and
generally dependable for a wet season crop. The results of irrigation in that
region to date have been mixed, with farmers either cropping in the dry season
only to avoid flooding and drainage problems or, where they prac ice wet
season cropping, taking up dry season cropping much more slo,-1v than expected.
Farm sizes average between 10 and 20 ha.
1.9       Irrigation schemes can be grouped in two main categories: the small
to medium-scale (100 to 3000 ha) and the large-scale (>3000 ha) systems. The
large-scale systems are divided into Irrigation Districts encompassing a total
of 3.2 million ha (or 60 percent of the total irrigated area). These are
irrigated mostly through surface water sources. The small-scale schemes
(usually less than 100 ha) are grouped in some 27,000 Irrigation Units with a
total area of 2.8 million ha, of which 1.5 million ha use surface water and
1.3 million ha use groundwater. About 1.4 million hectares of these
Irrigation Units were developed by private agents. In the Irrigation
Districts, the construction and rehabilitation of the dams and cancl networks
has been done by the Government and financed almost entirely out of budgetary
resources; the works, therefore, remain the property of the Federal
Government. The construction of the networks typically includes large civil
works for regulating, diverting and conveying water; a modern irrigation
distribution system; land consolidation; on-farm development; drainage
networks; and roads.
1.10      Farmers in the Northern Irrigation Districts, irrespective of their
legal status, are largely commercial farmers with an important proportion of
their production -ialue, particularly in the North-West of the country, going
to the export market. The Government is in most cases fully responsible for



the operation and maintenance of the Districts. Farme-s participate in
decisions regarding water w..aagement through their representatives in the
Districts' Management Committees, but have little say in policy or technical
matters. Moreover, the Government has an indirect but usually very strong
influence on farmers' cropping and water allocation decisions. Currently the
Irrigation Districts are under CNA's area of responeibility and the Irrigation
Units are under SARK.
1.11      The infrastructure o, the small-scale schemes usually includes:
construction of water regulation works, including small storage/diversion
dams, deep wells and pumping stations, simple distribution systems and some
on-farm works such as land levelling. Average farm size ranges from 3 ha to 4
ha, with most of the land (65 percent) in the hands of eiidatarios whose
production is mostly for on-farm consumption. A large proportion of the farms
(44 percent) are dependent upon groundwater, 22 percent of the Units divert
water by gravity directly from rivers, and the remaining 34 percent draw water
from a variety of sources including medium and small surface storage
facilities, pumping stations and natural springs. The design and planning of
Irrigation Units were done locally, usually at the request of the potential
beneficiaries, with the Secretariat of Agriculture and Water Resources (SARH)
providing some technical assistance. The construction of these systems is
financed partly by beneficiaries (farmers contribute over 40 percent of total
investment cost, mostly in the form of labor) and the remainder by the
Government. Financing of the government contribution to the construction of
these Irrigation Units is channelled through a special Federal Trust Fund
(FIRCO) for small farmers' activities, which is also responsible for the
preparation of the investment plans and their execution. Nevertheless, the
farmers are considered the owners of the networks, in contrast to the large-
and medium-size irrigation schemes where the infrastructure remains state
property. The Units are operated and maintained by farmers through Users'
Associations# government support to operation and maintenance of these Units
is limited only to some supervision provided by the SAlR.
1.12      The infrastructure currently available to irrigate the areas under
both the Irrigation Districts and the Irrigation Units includes: 1,320 large
and medium-size dams, 2,090 river diversions, 11,000 deep wells, 66,000 tube
wells, 68,000 ka of canals, 47,000 km of drains and 54,000 km of roads.  At
present 45,000 million cubic meters of water are needed every year to
irrigate. Of this, 43 percent is derived from reservoirs, 33 percent directly
from rivers and 24 percent from underground aquifers. In terms of the crops
planted under irrigation, maize represents 21 percent of the total area; wheat
17 percent, sorghum 13 percent; while beans, soybeans and sugarcane account
for 6 percent each, and the 31 percent remaining is under other crops.
1.13      Geographically speaking, about 50 percent of the total land under
irrigation is concentrated in three northern states - Sinaloa and Tamaulipas
(17 percent each) and Sonora (14 percent) - which are considered to be the
best for the development of irrigated agriculture in the country. Favored by
excellent soils and arid climatic conditions, as well as by a favorable
location for access to U.S. markets, investment in irrigation in this pa-t of
the country tends to yield the highest return. Thus, while there is room for
moving progressively to other more humid regions, agroclimatic conditions in
the Northwest are likely to ren6dr the highest returns to ir-igation
investment.



The Drainage and Flood Control Systems
1.14      Drainage and flood control schemes vary greatly according to the
climatic region within Mexico. Salinity and waterlogging problems are often
associated with irrigation developments in coastal or upland plains of
Northern States where the climate is normally arid or semi-arid. The
mountainous and tropical areas usually are not irrigated. Valleys and coastal
plains often require extensive drainage and flood control systems to support
efficient agriculture systems and protect community and industrial
investments. Most of the drainage work in the arid and semi-arid portions of
Mexico involves open channels to remove excess surface water. Some degree of
control is provided from these channels for removal of excess soil salinity
but in most cases this is not adequate and additional channels, tubewells
and/or underground pipe drains are needed to provide the sustained irrigated
agriculture system desired. In the humid and tropical areas, where "temporal"
agriculture dominates, surface drainage, waterlogging and flood control, but
not salinity, are of primary concern. Major efforts have been started to
address these problems under Bank financed projects PRODERITH I and II and
Plan Chiapas, but much work remains to be done. San Fernando Project in the
State of Tamaulipas is a good example of a successful rainfed drainage project
located in semi-arid zone which could be replicable. The main components of
the San Fernando Project included a combination of storm drainage system, road
network, settlements and on-farm development. For a more detailed discussion
of the Bank's experience in arid and humid rainfed projects see para. 3.6.
Effectiveness of the Irrigation and Drainage Systems
1.15      Over 60 percent of the total irrigable area is served by irrigation
systems that were built or rehabilitated after 1940. Irrigation systems in
the Districts are generally well designed in terms of headworks and conveyance
canals and main drains, and the main network convevance efficiency averages
between 60 percent and 75 percent, which compares well with international
standards. In the small Irrigation Units, especially where deep tubewells
have been built in recent times and equipped with prefabricated concrete
canals, conveyance efficiencies are even higher: between 85 percent and 95
percent since they serve only small areas, with consequent minor water losses.
However, for the majority of larger systems, the distribution efficiencv
between the main canal and the farmgate is much lower (50-60 percent). This
is due largely to lack of properly designed and constructed secondary and
tertiary canals, and to the absence of adequate water control and measurement
structures and sufficient farm turnout devices, and deferred maintenance. In
most Irrigation Districts little attention has been paid to minor canals and
structures, water management and land levelling, which has resulted in low
field efficiencies. As a result, overall system efficiencies can be as low as
25 percent to 35 percent. It would seem, therefore, that the low efficiency
of the irrigation systems is largely the result of incomplete networks; when
the main headworks and conveyance systems were built, the secondary and
tertiary canals and on-farm works were either inadequate or not constructed at
all. Similarly, there seems to be insufficient secondary drains to provide
proper drainage outlets to all farm Units. Additionally, the maintenance
equipment and technology are weak, the main drains are silted up, with either
aquatic and aerial weeds, and have deficient structures for the outlet of
secondary drains. As a result about 20 percent of the land in the Irrigation
Districts suffers from water logging and salinity problems. Indications are
that this problem will grow rapidly without special efforts to address the
needed control. In tropical coastal plains drainage and flood control systems
are often the predominant infrastructure facility required for a prosperous
and sustainable agriculture system. Little work has been done to date in this



field, and where protection structures exist they are badly in need of
maintenance.
1.16      SARH's Instituto Mexicano de Technologia del Agua (the Mexican
Institute for Water Technology--IMTA) is in the process of preparing a
detailed evaluation of irrigation and drainage research needs in Mexico. IMTA
is working with the "International Program for Technology Research in
Irrigation and Drainage" (IPTRID) to have an international team of experts
work with them in preparing a report on the most pressing applied or adaptive
research needs. The research effort will be partially funded under this
project and will aim at improving CNA's future irrigation and drainage system
modernization activities, sustainability measures such as effective
waterlogging and salinity control and improved maintenance equipment and
techniques.
Production Performance
1.17      A certain degree of modern technology is applied by most producers
in irrigated agriculture, at least in the Irrigation Districts of the
Northwest as evidenced by the use of fertilizer on 80 percent of the planted
area, mechanization on 90 percent, and improved seeds for 100 percent of
wheat, sorghum, safflower and soybeans and 50 percent for maize.
1.18      Nevertheless, compared to the high public investment in the
irrigation sub-sector the production performance has been rather poor. While
during the 1970-81 period, output from irrigated areas grew at 6.9 percent per
annum, most of this growth was due to area expansion, and very little from
improved crop yields, which grew only at 1.5 percent per year, and nothing
from increased cropping intensities. Cropping intensity is not measured
explicitly by the SARH on a permanent basis, but a Bank mission in 1982
estimated it at about 120 percent in the Irrigation Districts between
1970-1980. There are considerable regional differences and, in general terms,
cropping intensities in the Irrigation Units (small scale) are higher than in
the Irrigation Districts (medium-large scale). Production performance
deteriorated during 1982-1987. The decline in both the yields of most crops
and the annual expansion of irrigated area, together with a total area
harvested that remained more or less constant at around 7.5 million hectares,
resulted in irrigated production declining at an average rate of 1.7 percent
per annum during the 1982-1990 period."'
1.19      Several factors have contributed to the decline in productivity:
(a) some irrigation schemes were put into operation without all works
finished; (b) irrigation was introduced unnecessarily into some extensively
farmed areas with good rainfall (1,100 mm to 1,600 mm mean annual rainfall),
mainly to achieve land reform objectives, and the resultant attempt to change
rainfed and cattle farmers to more costly forms of irrigated agriculture
proved to be a difficult task; (c) public agricultural servicee sxsch as
extension, credit and crop insurance and support prices were specifically
directed to a few basic food crops rather than towards optimizing overall
resource use; and (d) production incentives were depressed by overvalued
exchange rates, the protectionist trade regime and adverse agricultural
pricing policies. This situation was compounded by poor maintenance of the
irrigation schemes especially after the 1982 crisis. These issues are being
addressed in the context of the on-going Agricultural Extension and
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loans and the proposed Agricultural Technology

Loan which is expected to be presented to the Board of Executive Directors in
FY92.
Maintenance of Irrigation and Drainage Works
1.20      Maintenance in most of the irrigation schemes located in the
eastern region tends to be of lower standard than in the rest of the country.
This is largely due to environmental conditions: a rapid growth of weeds, with
only a short period with no rains in which to carry out any repairs and
maintenance work to the irrigation and drainage systems. Although physical
conditions will vary widely from one irrigation scheme to another, generally
weirs and turnouts require structural repairs, a large number of gates need
replacement, most canals suffer from siltation and loss of capacity, and the
tertiary systems are generally inadequate to achieve the full benefits of
irrigation. Drainage and flood control infrastructure in the tropical areas
also show poor maintenance. In these areas without irrigation systems,
actions are necessary to get user groups involved in operation and maintenance
(O&M). Some success has been achieved in larger systems by organizing
Drainage Districts but additional efforts are needed to organize in smaller
groups for some of the minor drainage facilities and systems. CNA is now
creating a branch to address this question.
1.21      As long as they do not participate in the Districts' maintenance
activities, farmers are understandably reluctant to contribute towards O&M
expenses over which they have no control. Government estimates indicate that,
on average, farmers in the Districts contribute less than 30 percent of O&M
costs through the water charges, with some farmers' associations contributing
less than 5 percent of the costs. Thus the bulk of these activities are
financed through government budgetary allocations. During the country's
financial crisis in 1980s budget allocations for O&M were drastically reduced.
In 1989, the budgetary resources earmarked for operat: on and maintenance of
the Irrigation Districts were in real terms only 17 percent of what had been
spent in 1982 for those activities. With work costs soaring, both the quality
and the quantity of maintenance work has declined, calling into question the
sustainability of irrigation development in the Districts. A study by CRA
consultants concludes that, in general, farms would be in a position to pay
significantly higher water charges. Under the rehabilitation and
modernization programs envisaged for these Districts and supported under the
proposed project improved water use efficiency and increased cropping
intensities and yields are expected to result in average net farm income
increases of at least 15 percent to 20 percent. Doubling of water charges to
cover the full O&M cost, although substantial particularly in certain areas of
the NW such as El Carrizo, would not represent more than 8 percent or 9
percent of the farmers's total cost of production, as against the present
average levels of 4.5-5.0 percent (in El Carrizo, because of the existing
exceptionally low levels, it represents only about 1 percent of production
cost).
1.22      By contrast, maintenance of the Irrigation Units is the
responsibility of the Users' Associations, which bear the full cost of these
activities. The level and the quality of maintenance work is better in these
Units than in the Districts but, as some government analysis indicates, there
still remains substantial scope for improvement.
1.23      The lack and improper use of equipment for maintenance of drains
and unlined canals is a problem in the Irrigation Districts. The prevailing
cleaning schedules are insufficient considering Mexican ecological conditions.
The almost exclusive use of draglines disturbs embankment stability and causes



- 8 -
damage in the side slopes, enlarges cross sections, and reduces the width of
side roads. Consequently, sedimentation, weed and vegetation growth are
aggravated in the canals and drains. These result in deficient irrigation
deliveries, vaterlogging and salinity buildup. These necessitate frequent and
expensive rehabilitation.  Modern, lighter, more efficient and appropriate
equipment as well as maintenance technologies are needed in Mexico.  These
problems will be addressed under the proposed project (Annex III).
Environmental Aepects
1.24      As a result of the factors affecting efficiency of irrigation
schemes, several negative environmental impacts are evident. The most
important ones are: over-exploitation of aquifers, waterlogging, soil
salinity, water contamination, and soil erosion.
1.25      Excessive Use of Ground Water.  This is the result of the
combination of poor groundwater management and heavily subsidized water and
electricity charges. These two factors are the main obstacles to improved
irrigation since they encourage farmers to use too much water and to neglect
maintenance and repair of on-farm water distribution systems.
1.26      At the national level about 28 million cubic meters of ground water
are used every year while the natural annual recharge is about 40 million M3.
However, the distribution of recharge is uneven since it is basad on the
volume of rain precipitation and there are parts of the country where recharge
is considerably less than the extraction rate. Nationwide, about 82 percent
of ground water is used for agriculture, 12 percent for urban purposes, and 6
percent for industry.
1.27      Pumping groundwater out faster than the recharge rate has already
become a serious problem in Northern Durango (Comarca Lagunera region)
southern Coahuila, the Costa de Hermosillo area and Western Sonora, the Valle
de Santo Domingo region in Baja California and in Guanajuato the valleys of
Leon and Celaya regions. Some of the problems associated with excessive
groundwater pumping include: falling water tables (at the rate of 1.5 meters
per year in regions like the Comarca Lagunera); collapsing wells; ground sinks
in urban areas (as in Aguascalientes); soil erosion and land abandonment; and
salinization of well water in coastal areas. To limit extraction rates and
installation of new wells some states have established systems of fines equal
to the estimated gross value of water used in excess of assigned quotas.
However, enforcement has not been very successful because users have ways to
tamper with water meters. A Water and Soil Conservation project focusing on
improved management and monitoring of groundwater reservoir operations, and
erosion control is also at an initial stage of preparation/identification
which will address, inter alia, issues outlined above.
1.28      Soil Salinity.  Most irrigation systems in Mexico are in one way or
another incomplete, sometimes by design but mostly as a result of budgetary
constraints. This contributes to the problem of soil salinity since in
general soils affected by salinity are located in areas where drainage works
were never started or were left incomplete. The problem is further compounded
by over-irrigation and use of saline waters.
1.29      SARH's data show that out of the 3.2 million hectares of the
Irrigation Districts about 578,000 (18.4 percent) are affected in different
grades by soil salinity. This represents a 6 percent increase in the last ten
years. Districts suffering predominantly from this problem are: the
Northwest with 357,000 ha, the Lerma-Balsas region 96,000 ha, and the



Southeast with 8,000 ha. It is estimated that agricultural productivity in
these areas affected by salinity has decreased between 30 percent and 50
percent.
1.30      Water Contaminatior..  Surface waters and water from wells in most
of the Irrigation Districts are polluted to some degree. Contamination of
some rivers is severe. The main sources of pollution are: a) industries
discharging effluents with inadequate or no treatment at all directly into
rivers. According to CNA data about 80 percent of con..amination is caused by
this source, mainly by paper and sugar mills, textile plants, and oil
refineries; b) agrochemical run off from fields under crops; and c) urban
sewerage systems which dump raw sewage into bodies of water. The main rivers
affected are the San Juan, Panuco, Lerma Balsas, Blanco, and Coatzacoalcos.
Of the ground water systems the areas more notoriously contaminated are in the
Yucatan Peninsula and in the Lagunera Region.
1.31      The severely damaging effects of using contaminated irrigation
water on human and animal health is well documented. Vegetable and fruit
crops are grown on about 252,000 ha irrigated with untreated residual waters.
Intestinal problems result form eating uncooked food crops contaminated with
E. Coli, Ascaris and Trichuris. Similar problems also result from using water
directly from irrigation canals for domestic purposes. Although the
Government has been taking corrective actions for 17 years, these have fallen
short of expectations. While the level of contamination increased the
resources required to implement mitigating measures fell. The proposed
Environmental Project, currently under advanced preparation, would assist
SEDUE to develop the capacity for monitoring and addressing national
environmental issues, including issues of water quality.
1.32      Soil Erosion.  Recent estimates indicate about 85 percent of
Mexico's land area suffers form some degree of erosion and the main watersheds
in the country are suffering from severe soil erosion. The situation is
exacerbated by pressures of landless farmers to incorporate into cropping land
areas with marginal fertility. In some cases forest land is cleared and after
two or three years abandoned without any ground cover and the main watersheds
in the country are suffering from severe soil erosion. Although practices to
prevent and control soil erosion are widely known, not much has been done to
control this problem. The proposed Soil and Water Conservation Project
referred to in para. 1.27 is expected to address this problem.
2.  Government Irrigation and Drainaae Development Strategv and Policies
Government Strateav
1.33      The 1989-1994 National Development Plan reinforces the global
strategy developed for the agricultural sector during the previous
Administration. Concerning irrigation and drainage, this strategy calls for
an increase in agricultural production mainly by improving the efficiency in
the use of existing irrigation schemes and only on an exceptional basis
through expansion of the irrigated area. This would represent a confirmation
of the change in Government strategy from that pursued during the 1970s and
early 1980. when the emphasis was placed on expanding the area under
irrigation, with little attention to efficiency in the use of resources. This
reversal of priorities has been in response to increasing scarcity of
financial and water resources. The project design supports this strategy.
1.34      The financial constraints under which the Government has operated
during most of 1980s have led to the virtual elimination of those large



- 10 -
projects with doubtful economic viability that were common during the oil boom
of the 1970s, and, more recently, to the adoption of much more rigorous
economic and social criteria for the selection of priority projects in the
irrigation and drainage sector. The present Government has improved the
financial resource allocation mechanism in the sector by developing a
methodology for programming and budgeting of irrigation and drainage
investments which tries to maximize the net present value of all investments
of on-going and new projects within expected investment budget constraints.
The relevant costs and benefits of all projects considered for inclusion in
the investment plan are adjusted each year to allow for changes (para. 4.20).
This is in marked contrast with the past ad-hoc approach to investment and
development in the irrigation sector.
1.35      The objectives that the Government aims to attain in the irrigation
sector with this strategy, are as follows:
a)    to promote the efficient use of existing infrastructure by giving
priority to the rehabilitation, modernization and completion of
existing works;
b)    to promote the adoption of improved irrigation techniques leading
to a more efficient use of land and water resources;
c)    to transfer gradually the responsibility for operation and
maintenance of the Irrigation Districts to water users and
increase the farmers' contribution to 0&M expenses and investment
costs;
d)    to prevent the expansion of irrigated areas in those regions where
water resources are over-exploited, except when expansion is the
result of improved efficiency in water use;
e)    to prevent degradation of water resources by con..rolling the
release of toxic substances into water courses and by avoiding
over-exploitation of the aquifers; and
f)    to allocate investment resources, combining cost-effectiveness
with social and income distribution criteria.
Management of Irrigation Districts
1.36        According to the 1989-1994 National Development Plan, the
Government intends to gradually transfer the responsibility of the management
of the Irrigation Districts to the water users. The process will be spread
over several years according to the organizational and managerial capabilities
of the respective Water Users' Associations. During the 1991-1994 period, CRA
would transfer a minimum of 21 Irrigation Districts covering about 1.98
million ha, or 62 percent of the total land irrigated by the 77 existing
Irrigation Districts. Thoj transfer of the 21 Districts, which would benefit
some 247,000 producers, vwould be done in two stages, the first one would give
producers, organized in Users' Associations, the responsibility for the
operation and maintenance of lateral canals and drains. During the second
phase, these Users' Associations would take over also the operation and
maintenance of the main irrigation and drainage canals as well as of the
machinery and equipment required for O&M activities. Assurances have been
obtained for transfer of 21 Districts to Users' Associations, to be completed
durina the eroposed time-slice operation according to a specific Action Plan
(pra7h A5nd   nexVI.



- 11 -
1.37        Of the 21 Districts, 6 would receive rehabilitation improvements,
6 would receive modernization improvements and 9 where maintenance had been
deferred would receive accelerated maintenance. The program for the transfer
of O&M responsibilities of the remaining 56 Irrigation Districts would be
prepared during the 1991-1994 time-slice period. Assurances have been
obtained that i transfer of Irrigation Districts will be condi.l.onal upon
assumption of full O&M cost recovery, and (ii) CNA will supervise and monitor
performance of the associations (i.e.. transferred Irrigation Districts) and
shall take prompt remedial actions in case of non-compliance by such
associations of the contractual terms with respect to the transfer (para. 7.1
A (6 and 11)).
3. Institutional Framework
Institutional Setting
1.38        CNA was established in January 1989, as a semi-autonomous,
"deconcentrated", organization within SARH. It was created out of the then
Under-Secretariat of Hydraulic Infrastructure of SARH, which until the early
1980s had been the Secretaria de Recursos Hidraulicos (SRH). By the end of
1989, CNA had received complete operational authority for the 77 Irrigation
Districts from SARH, as well as responsibility for water supply and for
aspects of water quality from SEDUE. With the establishment of CNA, SARH
retained its responsibility for development, supervision and technical
assistance to small Irrigation Units and rainfed areas, as well as providing
agriculture-related technical assistance to farmers in the Irrigation
Districts.
1.39        CNA is divided into five Sub-Directorates at the central level:
Planning and Finance, Administration, Hydro-agricultural Infrastructure, Urban
and Industrial Hydraulic Infrastructure, and Administration of Water. The
Sub-Directorate for Hydro-agricultural Infrastructure is responsible for the
development and management of federal hydraulic infrastructure, including
water flood control, development of irrigation systems, and transfer of
irrigation systems operations and maintenance to users' organizations. The
Sub-Directorate for Administration of Water is responsible for planning,
regulating and controlling the use of national waters, including programs to
promote water conservation and quality. The Sub-Directorate for
Administration is responsible for maintaining administrative support systems
and managing recruitment and human resource development programs. The Sub-
Directorate for Planning and Finance is responsible for establishing planning
and budgeting guidelines for the operational units, monitoring adherence to
those guideliTes, conducting evaluations of the organization's operations, and
managing the collection of institutional revenues. The Office of Advisor
Coordination is a staff unit within the office of the Director General, that
provides advice on policy and internal organizational matters.
1.40        The Sub-Directorate for Hydro-agricultural Infrastructure, as the
operational arm of CNA responsible for all irrigation and drainage works, is
structured into five sub-units, or "gerencias," responsible for:
(i) investment studies and planning, (ii) irrigation and drainage design,
(iii) drainage projects for rainfed agriculture, (iv) construction, and
(v) irrigation district operations, including rehabilitation and modernization
projects, and transfer of districts to user organizations.
1.41        CNA has 33 State Offices (one for each state) and Regional
Offices. The State Offices play the central role in irrigation development,
operation and maintenance. They are responsible for the identification of



- 12 -
potential projects, and the construction, operation, maintenance, and transfer
to users of irrigation districts and smaller, irrigation units. Within a
state, responsibility for a given Irrigation District is divided between an
office of the Resident Construction Engineer, responsible for new
construction, rehabilitation and modernization, and an office of the
Irrigation District Manager, responsible for operation and maintenance and the
eventual transfer of the District to a users' organization. To assist
Irrigation District Managers in addressing issues related to the transfer of
Districts and the creation of users' organizations, special units have been
established at the regional and state levels (regional and state Legal Advisor
units, and regional and state Citizen Information and Participation units).
1.42        As part of CNA's policy to decentralize its operations, the size
of the Regional Offices has been increased. Responsibility has also been
delegated to them for contracting and supervising basic studies and completing
the project feasibility analysis, in addition to providing technical
assistance to the states. Because of technical requirements, the central
office Sub-Directorate of Hydro-agricultural Infrastructure has retained its
authority for integrating proposed projects from each region into CNA's
programming model, setting priorities according to that model, and, during
implementation, contracting for designs of large projects and major civil
works.
1.43        As explained above (para. 1.36), the Government's policy is to
transfer the operation and maintenance responsibility for Districts to users'
organizations, starting with 21 Districts. Of these, Users' Associations have
already been established at least three, Rio Mayo, Carrizo, El Grullo, and Rio
Culiac&n. In Rio Mayo, all 16 irrigation modules have organized Users'
Associations, with the next step being the organization of a district-wide
Society.  The Users' Associations and the Societies would be legal entities,
responsible for charging and collecting revenues and operating and maintaining
the irrigation system.  Given the cost recovery requirements for new capital
investments (para. 5.8), in future, these organizations will also participate
in reviewing and agreeing to investment plans.
1.44       IDTA is the organization assigned primary responsibility for
providing training, research and technical assistance in irrigation and
drainage, hydraulic infrastructure, and water supply for Mexico. As CNA, IMTA
is a "deconcentrated" unit of SARH and enters into agreements with CNA to
implement specific projects using CNA funds. IMTA is organized into six
units, four of which are involved in project activities. They are:
(i) Consultivo Tecnico, which provides expert consulting, primarily related to
dams and large hydraulic infrastructures (ii) Tecnologia de Riego y Drenaje,
which conducts adaptive and applied research and technology transfer in all
aspects of irrigation and drainage; (iii) Desarrollo Profesional, which
manages CNA's professional recruitment and training program; and
(iv) Comunicaci6n y Participacion Publica, which assists in the development of
users' organizations. IMTA managers coordinate the activities of their units
with CNA through the Office of Advisor Coordination. In addition, they work
with CNA's regional Professional Development units, in order to coordinate
professional development and recruitment activities with field managers.
1.45        The Instituto Macional de Investigaciones Forestales y
Agropecuarias (INIFAP) is the organization assigned to cover agronomic
research for irrigated agriculture. The INIPAP's research program complements
CNA's investment program for irrigation and drainage as well as the research
into water management issues being conducted by IDTA. Strengthening of INIFAP



- 13 -
is to be provided under the proposed Agricultural Technology Project, which is
at an advanced stage of preparation.
Institutional Capacitv Assessment
1.46        To diagnose the priority institutional development needs of the
sub-sector, an institutional capacity analysis was carried out by CNA during
project preparation. Specifically, project implementation feasibility was
studied from five viewpoints: legislation and regulations; inter-institutional
relationships; organization and distribution of functions; personnel policies;
and the skills and knowledge of CHA staff and water users.
1.47        Major strengths of CNA include a highly skilled ct:re staff, the
use of sound financial management principles and procedures, and significant
progress in the transfer of portions of irrigation districts to users.
Although Users' Associations are relatively new, those in existence have
already demonstrated efficient performance of critical irrigation system
maintenance tasks. In addition, given the technical sophistication of many
farmers in the Districts to be transferred, it is anticipated that they will
have little difficulty assuming control over the technical operation of
sections of the irrigation system.
1.48        Furthermore, CNA's current institutional development program
includes: a professional development and recruiting program designed to
increase staff and staff capacity of State and Regional Offices; efforts to
reorganize, decentralize and clarify internal structure; development of
computerized, integrated administrative and financial systems; and IMTA
training programs promoting user participation and organization. The
proiect's Institutional Development coannonent will support and exi,and on these
activities.  Implementation of the Institutional Development Action Plan
(Annex IV. Attachment I). with annual Rroaress indicators, which was developed
by CNA with assistance of the Bank. was confirmed during negotiations (Raras.
3.32 and 7.1 A (4)).
1.49        The capacity gaps, specifically targeted for improvement under the
project, fall in seven areas. They are described briefly below, with an
indication as to how each will be addressed. (For a more complete description
of the Institutional Development component see also 5.32 - 5.33 and Annex IV.)
a)    Inadeauate anglication of technical and economic criteria for
investment selection. The investment selection process
historically used by CNA, and SARK before it, did not adequately
consider technical and economic criteria. During preparation of
the project, this practice improved considerably. Nevertheless,
given the remaining weaknesses in many feasibility reports, CNA
field staff require continued orientation and training in the
application of the investment selection model. This need will be
addressed by a combination of technical training and team planning
workshops for involved units at regional and state levels.
b)    Overly centralized decision-makina and administrative procedures.
and lack of coordination of the actions of different offices into
a comorehensive anDroach to pro1ect develonment. review and
monitorina.  Most actions requiring the use of significant
resources for Irrigetion Districts continue to be carried out at
the central level, by the specific unit responsible. While
certain levels of centralized control are desirable, this practice
has resulted in poor coordination of activities (e.g. coordination



- 14 -
of irrigation design with operational needs) for a given
Irrigation District. The major project intervention to address
this issue will be the implementation of the Sistema de
Programaci6n y Seguimiento (SPS - Planning and Monitoring System),
which provides a structure and process for creating and monitoring
integrated plans at a District level (see paras. 4.8 - 4.11 for a
description of this system). Technical assistance would be
provided to assist in the implementation of this system, including
District level workshops that would bring together the key offices
and organizations responsible for the District to develop an
integrated plan.
c)    Difficulties in retrenching low level, redundant Personnel and in
hiring professional Rersonnel. CNA has had a successful program
over the past two years of voluntary departure of irrigation
district personnel, whose jobs are becoming redundant with
district transfers, and hiring a limited number of professionals.
It has an agreement with SPP that allows it to hire one
professional for every six individuals retrenched. However, the
incentives offered by Government for voluntary departure have
become less attractive and CNA believes it may have difficulty in
attaining its retrenchment and, therefore, recruitment targets in
the future. The project would address this by requiring that the
achievement of retrenchment and hiring targets be reviewed
annually as part of the yearly review and planning exercise, and
that corrective action be taken if necessary. In addition,
Assurances have been obtained that CNA would maintain at least
adeauate staffing for relevant functions and skills for
implementation and supervision of the nroiect (Rara. 7.1 A (8)).
d)    Lack of certain technical and manazement skills and capacity of
users and users' organizations. Users' organizations that have
been formed to date have been successful in raising funds and
carrying out system maintenance tasks. Nevertheless, they are
untested when it comes to capacity to operate the system and to
collect water tariffs due to CNA. Given the great diversity of
farmers within a given District, and their lack of experience in
working as a coordinated body, substantial assistance, both
training and technical assistance, is planned within the
Institutional Development component. This assistance would be
implemented by IMTA.
e)    Lack of irrigation modernization and rehabilitation approaches and
technologies aRplied and tested in Mexico. The recent IPTRID
review, mentioned earlier, has pointed to a range of needs for
applied and adaptive irrigation research. The project will build
on the existing capacity of ITrA for irrigation research and
provide financing for the equipment and consultants required to
expand its efforts. In addition, financing will be provided to
ensure the dissemination of research results through special
seminars and technical assistance.
f)    Lack of certain technical skills for irrigation rehabilitation.
modernization, transfer. operations and maintenance of CNA field
offices (regional. state and district level). The modernization
and rehabilitation of districts and improvement in operation and
maintenance will present a technical challenge to CNA staff in
applying new practices and approaches used in other areas of the



- 15 -
world. A combination of short term training, foreign study trips,
uee of Expert Review Groups, and technical assistance will help
bring this technology to CNA engineers and other professionals.
In the area of environmental assessment and actions,
organizational restructuring, increased staffing and training will
be used to address this deficit.
g)    Difficulty of implementing legislation regarding cost recoverv.
Despite legislation mandating cost recovery for O&M, this policy
has not been effectively implemented. One major impediment to
cost recovery has been lack of incentives, given that water
tariffs collected have not remained in the Irrigation Districts to
be used directly for system maintenance. With the policy of
District transfer this will change, as Userd' Associations begin
retaining these charges in an account they control.
Agricultural Support Services
1.50        A key element in achieving more efficient use of water and
increased agricultural productivity and production at farm level is an
effective program of technical assistance for producers. This has been
recognized in Mexico as reflected in the on-going reform of institutional
arrangements and agricultural extension methodologies over the past six years.
As part of the process, in 1985, the formerly separate irrigation and rainfed
Districts were merged into 192 Rural Development Districts (DDR) and technical
assistance was provided through a network of some 700 support centers (CADRI)
attached to these Districts.
1.51        With the creation of CNA in early 1989 a division was created in
the way technical Assistance is supplied to farmers. CNA, through its 77
Irrigation District offices, is now responsible for water related aspects of
technical assistance within the respective Districts. The aim is to achieve
more efficient use of water and to enhance the conservation and utilization of
irrigated soils at farm level, as for example, through the adoption of
improved irrigation techniques. On the other hand, the CADRIs retain
responsibility for technical assistance concerned with the agronomic aspects
of irrigated agriculture, such as cultural practices, crop varieties,
fertilizer, and pesticide use. In addition, the CADRIs continue to provide
this type of assis.tance to farmers in rainfed drainage schemes.  Experience
with on-going PROCATI project - Technical Assistance and Research Project
(Loan 2859-ME) has shown that decentralized system managed by the CADRI's is
effective in providing such technical assistance to both rainfed and
irrigation farming areas.
1.52        Private sector extension is increasing in the Irrigation
Districts. Producer groups, particularly in the Northwest, contract directly
for the services of specialists or consultant firms. It is anticipated that
this practice will grow in parallel with the formation of increasing numbers
of Water Users' Associations through the decentralization process. Therefore,
the strength of private extension in the Irrigation Districts justifies the
lack of emphasis on public extension in this project.
1.53        Agricultural research support continues to be provided by INIFAP
through its networks of regional centers and field experiment stations.
Increasingly, and as a matter of policy, research trials are conducted in
fields of farmer cooperators. In addition, the larger scale trials to
validate and demonstrate technology are carried out exclusively in farmers'
fields. IMTA, working with CNA, is responsible for research in water



- 16 -
management and technology in order to improve operation in the irrigation and
drainage systems. A proposed Agricultural Technology project (in advanced
stage of preparation) will reinforce INIFAP's capacity to undertake
agricultural research relevant to the needs of irrigated farming areas.
1.54        Institutional credit is supplied to the sector through two main
channelst the Agricultural Trust Funds in the Bank of Mexico (FIRA) and the
National Rural Credit Bank (BANRURAL). FIRA discounts agricultural loans made
previously by commercial banks. Compared to BANRURAL it is more
production-oriented and its clientele consists mainly of medium-sized private
farmers and the most enterprising of the small-scale farmers and elidatarios.
BANRURAL operates more as a small-scale farmers' bank. It makes many more
smaller loans (long and short term) than the commercial banks, has a clientele
that is generally less technically advanced and which requires more
supervision than that of FIRA, and often has part of its portfolio in "social
loans" as fiscal agent for the Government. Neither the local BANRURAL
technical staff nor the SARH extension personnel have been able to provide the
technical backstopping needed to ensure maximum returns from many of these
BANRURAL on-farm investments. The BANRURAL operations are currently being
reviewed by the Government ane the Bank with the view to preparing an
institutional reform and strengthening program that could be supported under a
possible Rural Financial Sector Credit Operation.
Environmental Protection
1.55        There are two laws and respective sets of regulations under which
CNA operates to enforce environmental protection. They are the Law of Public
Works enacted in December 1980, and the environmental law (Ley General del
Equilibrio Ecologico y la Protecci6n al Ambiente) of January 1988. In
addition CNA's operations are governed by the Decree that created it in
January 1989, SARH a internal Directives of Operation, and by the Water Law
(Ley Federal de Aguas) which dates back to 1972 with several modifications
introduced during the last 18 years.
1.56        It is generally agreed that environmental laws and regulations are
not an issue in Mexico. However, the institutional capacity to enforce
current legislation has never been adequate. According to existing
environmental legislation, any new investment by either the public or private
sector must receive a certificate of approval from the Secretaria de
Desarrollo Urbano y Ecologia (SEDUE) which is Mexico's environmental
regulatory agency. Depending on the type of investment, SEDUE may require an
environmental impact assessment (EIA). However, because of its lack of
experienced tecinlcal staff it is not unecomon for SEDUE to clear EIAs without
adequate analysis, thus, in fact approving execution of investment projects
with questionable environmental merits and inefficient use of resources. To
address this and other institutional problems in the environment sector and
especially within SEDUE, Government and Bank are in an advanced stage of
preparation of the Mexico Environmental Project.
1.57        For investments to be made by CNA, its Gerencia de Calidad de Agua
(GCA) is the unit responsible for the preparation of documentation to satisfy
SEDUE's requirements. However, CNA's capacity to perform this function has
been impaired by lack of the proper organizational structure, and by staffing
constraints. Until recently, the environmental office within GCA did not have
a role in influencing projects during the design phase. Its primary function
was to obtain SEDUE's approval of proposed projects only after feasibility
studies have been completed, and was not able to propose changes in project
concept or scope or veto environmentally undesirable operations. To compound



- 17 -
the prLiblem there were no environmental units at the atate or regional level
to allow CNA to monitor implementation of remedial or mitigating actions.
1.58        To address this problem, CNA's management has established a
Jefatura de Proyectos de Impacto Ambiental (Office of Environmental Impacc
Projects) in each regional office, has elevated the environmental unit at the
central office to the level of a Subgerencia and plans to increase its
staffing to a total of 12 specialist. In addition, a way of increasing
objectivity and efficie--v, local consulting firms are now being contracted to
conduct the EUAs, leaving CNA's staff more free to concentrate on monitoring
and evaluation of the effectiveness of environmental protection measures once
adopted.
1.59        Some 14 firms have registered with CNA, many of them newly formed
as the demand for EIA work in irrigation projects is relatively new. Some 46
environmental studies have already been prepared, through these private firms,
as input to sub-project selection for the 1991-92 investment period. The EIA
reports were reviewed by joint IBRD and IDB missions in a workshop, the first
one of this kind in Mexico, specifically organized by CNA for this purpose in
June 1991. While in general the studies reflected a sound approach to
identify current impacts and to forecast potential negative effects,
recommendations for mitigating measures tended to be rather broad, with little
consideration to costs, and without specifying who would be responsible for
their implementation. As a result of the workshop it was agreed that each EIA
would be updated to incorporate costs and make recommendations more specific.
All EIAs for the 1991-1992 investment program (29) were subsequently revised.
Of the 29. 22 were completed satisfactorily and such costs will be reflected
in the investment oroaram.  EU'. f'r 7 sub-oroiects still require some
clarification before they can be inclMded in the 1991-1992 investment orograi.
If these clarifications are not orovided by November 30. 1991 such sub-
orolects will be transferred for analvsis and possible inclusion in 1992 AIOP.
Only one of these 7 sub-oroiects is under the World Bank Portfolio and
represents only 1 percent of IBRD total oroiect financina.
1.60        In spite of the shortcomings mentioned, the studies showed
considerable success on the part of CNA in integrating the environmental
dimension into its operations. Nevertheless, the workshop also underlined the
continuing need fort i) improving CiA's and SEDUE's internal procedures;
ii) strengthening the role of CNA's environmental unit in project design and
supervision at the regional and central levels; iii) enhancing the technical
skills of their staff; and iv) strengthening coordinating links between the
two institutions. Training for CNA professionals, improved implementation of
internal CNA procedures, clarification of GCA's functions and
responsibilities, and increases in staffing at CNA and SEDUE are all addressed
within the project (Annex IV, Attachment I, Section 3). Moreover, an
operational agreement between CIA and SEDUE is needed to clarify procedural
requ.'rements and guidelines. Accordinalv. an agreement between CNA and SEDUE
satisfactory to the Bank has been concluded (o2ar. 4.16 and Annex I.
Angendix V. pa. 104-110).
II. DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL AND CONSTRAINTS OF THE IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
SECTO
2.1         There are an estimated 9.0 million hectares of agricultural land
in Mexico that have not yet been brought under production. Of these about 1.5
million hectares have satisfactory soil and water resources and could become



- 18 -
irrigated land if the necessary infrastructure is constructed. However,
projects with relatively easy access to water supply sources to expand the
irrigated area have already been exhausted, which, combined with Mexico's
budgetary constraints, will necessarily lead to a slow rate of expansion of
the irrigation frontier. Therefore, future development of the agricultural
sector will not be based so much on expansion of new irrigated lands but on a
better utilization of existing irrigation infrastructure and a stronger
support of rainfed agriculture, including drainage and flood control
infrastructure in the wetter areas of the south-eastern regions. To improve
the utilization of exinting irrigated areas, efforts should be directed
towards increasing water use efficiency, cropping intensity and yields in the
irrigated areas.
2.2         The Irrigation Sub-sector Survey carried out by the Bank in 1982,
estimated that production on existing irrigated lands could be doubled through
a combination of increased area and cropping intensity, improved productivity,
and diversification towards higher-value crops. But to achieve the above
actions would have to be taken to: (a) finish uncompleted works; (b) upgrade
deteriorated infrastructure through rehabilitation and modernization programs,
which would include both the main distribution systems and on-farm works; (c)
upgrade extension and research services; (d) improve operation and maintenance
of irrigation schemes by providing sufficient funds through higher water
charges as well as more active farmer participation; and (e) improve the
incentive structure to stimulate expanded production. These conclusions are
still valid today.
2.j         As a result of the policy dialogue between the Bank and the
Government, some of the main sectoral policy issues began to be addressed in
the context of the first Agricultural ;sctor Loan (AGSAL I, Ln. 2918-ME of
1988).  The policy reforms supported by the AGSAL I sought to move producer
prices closer to international priceb, rsmove export barriers, increase the
amount of targeted food subsidies delitered to the poor, privatize parastatal
entities, reduce the size of SARH and partially restore public investment in
agriculture. These reforms have help-d improve the incentive structure and
create a policy framework conducive to .ncreased private investment and
sustainable growth in the agricultural 4'ector. Further policy reforms are
being supported in AGSAL II (Ln. 3357-h' of 1991). These comprise:
(a) liberalization of trade and prices f)t agricultural commodities and
inputs; (b) separation of food consumptioi: policy from agricultural price
policy; (c) elimination of general price c-bsidies and their replacement by
targeted and semi-targeted food subsidy programs in rural areas through the
subsidized sale of maize flour in DICCONSA Distribuidora CONASUPO (CONASUPO
stores) rural stores; (e) elimination of the system of crop production
targets; and (f) expansion and reallocation of investment expenditures in
agriculture.
2.4         Given that most agricultural sector policy issues have been
addressed, and farmers are receiving the proper market signals to guide their
resource allocation decisions, steps should be taken to overcome the physical
constraints that prevent farmers from making an efficient use of available
land and water resources, and hence to increase production. The
incompleteness of irrigation distribution and drainage nerworks and on-farm
works, is one major constraint to increasing operating efficiency. It has led
to inefficient use of water, thus limiting the irrigable area and favoring low
cropping intensities. The other major constraint to efficient water use has
been the state of deterioration of existing infrastructure as a result of a
long period of poor maintenance due to the sharp decline in funds available
for that activity. Some of the Irrigation Districts cannot be operated



- 19 -
efficiently without undergoing a heavy program of rehabilitation. Other
irritation scltemes, currently operating at acceptable levels of efficiency,
could L9 further improved by modernizing some of their structures and on-farm
works and introducing a volumetric water distribution system as well as
improved operating practices.
2.5         The sustainability of these investments can only be ensured if
adequate resources for O&M are provided and water users become responsible for
the operation and maintenance of their irrigation networks. The Government is
currently in the process of implementing a program to increase water charges
to enable Irrigation Districts to become financially self-sufficient and to
transfer the responsibility for O&M to the beneficiaries. The increased water
charges will enable the Irrigation Districts to recover the full cost of O&M
and also contribute to a more efficient use of water (para. 5.9 and Annex VI).
Low water charges have favored excess irrigation, which has resulted in both
an increase in salinity problems and low yields. Additionally, environmental
problems directly related to irrigation activities would have to be addressed
if the sustainability of the irrigation infrastructure is to be guaranteed.
2.6         Efficient water management is a principal constraint for increased
productivity. As discussed earlier, improved water pricing and institutional
reforms will help to ease this constraint. Moreover, the question of transfer
of technology to farmers in irrigated areas remains a constraint to increased
productivity. Ample technology for achieving increased yields is already
available and in use by the better farmers country-wide, but improvement of
the existing extension serviceu is required to accelerate a wider distribution
of the technological knowledge (paras. 1.51 and 1.53).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Rationale for Bank Involvement
1. Past Experience and Future Assistance Strategy
3.1         In the last 25 years, the Bank has provided 17 loans totalling
US$0.8 billion to support hydraulic infrastructure projects in Mexico, with a
total cost of US$3.4 billion. These projects have increased the irrigsted
area by 0.5 million ha and have rehabilitated 0.9 million ha. Five of the
irrigation projects are located in Mexico's Northwest Region, three in the
north central area, two in the center, one in the East, plus a nation-wide
small-scale irrigation project. Additional irrigation and drainage areas were
brought to production with Bank financing provided under several credit,
rainfed, and regional/rural development projects (FIRA, PIDER, San Fernando,
Chiapas and PRODERITH).
3.2         Most of the irrigation loans in Mexico were made during a period
when the economy was highly protected and when major distortions existed in
internal terms of trade favoring industry. The resulting negative protection
in agriculture provided very weak incentives for the farmers to produce (or
produce more). In the extreme case of rice, for example, the producers
received only half of the international price.  This led to reduced benefits
and low returns ror irrigation investments. It was only after 1985 that, with
the help of the Trade Policy Loans (TPLs; Loan 2745-ME of 1986 and Loan 2777-
ME of 1987), industrial protection began to be dismantled. Further reduction
in discrimination against agriculture was achieved subsequently under AGSAL I



- 20 -
which required, inter alia, to bring the producer prices within a band of 90-
120 percent of the international prices.
3.3         Decision making for hydraulic infrastructure irrigation investment
in Mexico has been highly centralized. The inmestments are contracted,
financed, and managed by the Federal Government. Partly to compensate the
rural sector for the negative protection referred to above and partly because
of the inherent inefficiency of government actions, nearly all irrigation
investments were financed with budgetary resources. There has been no capital
cost recovery and only limited O&M recovery (currently around 38 percent) in
public sector irriga'.ion. While, the Governtent occasionally considered cost
recovery and legislated some recovery provisions from time to time, it was
never serious about it. In fact, no adequate analysis of the cost recovery
issues, institutional arrangements and definition of the instruments of
recovery were made by the Government. Moreover, the Government never knew the
real cost of this policy. In this context, the Bank's reliance only on legal
covenants for O&M cost recovery under various irrigation projects was
unrealistic.
3.4         While the distortions in the pricing system prevented rational
resource allocation, the administrative procedures for investment decision
making were also ineffective. During preparation of the proposed Project the
CMA investment program for 1991-1994 was examined to see whether the proposed
investments meet the criteria and methodology which CNA had developed with the
assistance of the Bank. The examination s1kowed that the investment proposals
(including several on-going investments) satisfied mainly engineering criteria
despite initial attempts to apply improved methodologies. The investment
proposals failed, however, to satisfy the economic, agronomic and
environmental criteria--principally because the investments were not tested
against such criteria, since the capacity for such analysis has been limited.
Evidently, this practice has been in place for decades. For preparation of
the proposed Project CMA was required to carry out a rigorous screening of the
entire investment program in accordance with the agreed criteria and
methodology as a condition for project appraisal.
3.5         Clearly, conventional project lending for irrigation carries major
risks in that resource allocation objectives are largely ignored.  The
projects focus on the technical issues of specific investments without due
regard to the sectoral context. A better lending strategy for irrigation as
supported under the proposed project would have a sectoral approach with a
sharp focus on resource allocation issues such as pricing of water,
beneficiary participation in funding of investment and operation, adequate
institutional arrangements (e.g., moving from centrally micro-managed system
to decentralized type organizations managed by the beneficiaries) and improved
analytical capacity and balanced skill mix where irrigation investment
decisions are made. This can be achieved through sectoral time-slice loans
that from the outset define investment selection criteria and methodology
covering acceptable engineering, economic, agronomic and environmental
standards and requiring that the entire investment program satisfies such
criteria (except a very small portion of the investment program where the
criteria may give a much higher veight to social considerations). Moreover,
the institutional reform process for improved irrigation management and cost
recovery must be substantially in place to ensure that the legal requirements
for cost recovery are implementable. With this strategy the risks of
transmitting national resources into a distorted environment will be minimized
and measurement of investment priorities vill be improved.



- 21 -
3.6         At a more technical level, the Bank's experience has shown that
irrigation projects have been relatively successful in the arid Northwest and
small irrigation in the central region where the farmers are highly skilled
and commercially oriented. However, irrigation projects in the high rainfall
areas have not been successful. Here, the farmers are relatively less
commercially oriented and less technically skilled. Moreover, the incremental
benefits from irrigation in these areas are marginal. The experience has also
shown that drainage and flood control projects have been quite successful for
both semi-arid and humid tropics where investment costs are relatively low and
there are already existing agricultural activities which produce quick
results.
3.7         Finally, Bank experience has shown that there are clear limits as
to how far one can push irrigation investments in the coastal areas. Where
the investments are lying in low elevations and too close to the sea, they
inevitably and persistently suffer from water logging and salinity build-up
which can hardly be prevented, much less corrected once established.
2. Rationale of Pr2osed Time-Slice Proiect
3.8         The Bank's strategy for agriculture includes (a) the removal of
remaining distortions in the pricing and incentives regime through AGSAL II
(FY91); (b) the reform of the rural financial sector to make agricultural
credit institution self-sustaining and provide credit at competitive market
rates; (c) the support of more rapid technology generation and diffusion
through an agricultural technology operation in support of the public
extension and research system; and (d) rehabilitation and expansion of the
hydraulic infrastructure through improved resource allocation to and within
thia sub-sector. The Bank's participation in the proposed project will help
promote transition from an engineering driven centrally managed irrigation
investment program relying mainly on Government grants to a more decentralized
system based on transparent investment selection criteria and greater
participation of beneficiaries in decision making and cost recovery.
3.9         The proposed sub-sector loan is an attempt to move future Bank
lending for hydraulic infrastructure in agriculture away from project-specific
operations toward a sector investment approach. The sector investment loan
would be aimed at supporting policy and institutional reforms in the
agricultural hydraulic sub-sector as well as at financing a percentage of the
total public investment program in irrigation and drainage infrastructure in
the Irrigation Districts and Units that are now under the responsibility of
the National Water Commission. The Government would assume the ultimate
responsibility for the definition of investment priorities and for the
preparation and execution of the various investment proposals in this
sub-sector on the basis of criteria previously agreed between the Bank and the
Government.
3.10        The proposed policy and institutional improvements to be supported
under the proposed operation are aimed mainly at delegating to farmers key
decisions on cropping patterns and adaption of technology and at improving the
O&M of the irrigation schemes. These improvements refer specifically to:
(i) irrigation water pricing and cost recovery; (ii) institutional reforms in
irrigation and drainage management; and (iii) conservation of national
resources and the environment. The main objective of the first two
improvements would be to gradually transfer responsibility for operation and
maintenance of the irrigation schemes to the users, while at the same time
improving the generation of resources through adequate water user charges and
collection instruments. This would shift the funding of O&M expenditure (and



- 22 -
at least part of future investment costs) in irrigation schemes away from the
present centrally managed system, funded through federal budgetary
allocations, to a regional or local public utility type of system managed by
Users' Associations. This *eould not only reduce the call on the Government's
fiscal resources but would also prevent the deterioration of existing
investments during periods of public funding constraints and thus contribute
to sustainable investments in the sub-sector. Other policy changes refer, on
the one hand, to improvements in CNA's capability to prepare and evaluate
investment projects and apply the agreed selection methodology and, on the
other, to reforms in the procurement procedures and practices, that aim at
guaranteeing competitiveness in purchases of equipment and allocation of
construLtion contracts during implementation of all projects and not just in
those financed by the Bank.
B. Prolect Obiectives and DescriRtion
1. Proiect Objectives
3.11        The project would help the Governmer.t to:  (a) sustain the
irrigation and drainage sector through adequate levels of investments selected
on the basis of rigorous economic and technical criteria, procured
competitively and implemented efficiently; (b) decentralize irrigation funding
and management through institutional reforms that would gradually move funding
of irrigation and drainage investments from a centrally managed system of
Government grants towards a system based on regional and local public
utilities which would help to recover costs through user charges and
collection instruments, and thus help sustain the investments by the
beneficiaries; (c) fully utilize existing irrigation schemes by finishing
uncompleted works, upgrading deteriorated infrastructures, and rehabilitating
irrigated land affected by water logging, salinity problems and lack of
maintenance; (d) improve water use efficiency by introducing: better water
management techniques, the conjunctive use of surface and ground water,
volumetric measurement of water, providing more adaptive research results, and
training of technicians and farmers in better operation and maintenance of the
irrigation infrastructures; (e) strengthen the institutional capacity of CNA
and user organizations to implement policy programs, investments and
maintenance; (f) monitor and help prevent environmental and natural resource
degradation; and (g) optimizing the use of land and water resources in the
Irrigation Districts and Units.
2. Project Description
3.12        The project would be the Government's irrigation, drainage and
flood control investment program covering 1991 through 1994 totalling about
US$1.2 billion. This level of investment has been endorsed by SPP and SHCP.
This program will be reviewed once a year during the early stages of the
budgeting cycle in Mexico to confirm agreement on its scope and content,
including any adjustments that may be necessary. The Bank will finance a
time-slice of this program totalling abou:t US$400 million for the four year
period. IDB will finance about US$200 million of the same program, in
parallel with the Bank.
3.13        CNA has prepared, with assistance of the Bank, a comprehensive set
of criteria and methodology for investment selection. This methodology
integrates economic, social, engineering, agronomic and environmental
criteria. For a detailed description see Annex I, Appendix I-B. The number
of projects that have a sufficiently high positive net present value (i.e., a
minimum economic rate of return of 12 percent) and meet the agreed social,



- 23 -
engineering, agronomic and environmental selection criteria are far in excess
of those that can be accommodated within the budgetary constraints to
investment faced by CNA. This project selection issue is being addressed
through an investment programming model which tries to maximize, within the
expected irrigation and drainage investment budget constraints, the net
present value of all on-going and new projects included in the medium-term
investment plan. The new projects considered include both projects with full
feasibility studies and environmental impact assessments and projects in an
advance stage of preparation which are expected to become eligible for
inclusion in the budget in the latter years of the program. The on-going
projects to be executed in 1991-92 which have still over 50 percent of their
investment program to be executed (Annex II, Table 2), had updated their
feasibility studies and designs and completed environmental impact
assessments. In general, modernization and rehabilitation projects would
require a full feasibility study covering the agreed engineering, agronomic,
economic and social criteria, and environmental impact assessment before they
can be considered for the investment program. Given the high priority of
rehabilitation works, the impossibility of CNA preparing a substantial number
of rehabilitation projects before appraisal, and the likely high returns of
this type of investment, it was agreed during appraisal that during the first
year of the time-slice a lump sum would be allocated for urgent rehabilitation
work (deferred maintenance). By the end of the first year of project
implementation CNA will complete the feasibility studies of the rehabilitation
projects that will be executed during the latter 3 years of the time-slice.
The same treatment is to be applied to flood control projects.
3.14        Satisfactory Operating Regulations (Annex I), including, inter
alia, investment selection criteria and methodology, have been adopted by CNA.
Assurances have been obtained that CNA will adhere to the OperatinR
Regulations. which will not be changed without the Bank's prior approval
(para. 7.1 A (1) and (2)). Furthermore, it has been agreed that all
investments and rehabilitation works begun as part of the project will be
completed (para. 7.1 A (12)).
3.15        No investments will be included or subsequently entered into the
1991-1994 investment program without passing the investment criteria in
accordance with the agreed methodology, except a limited number of investments
with exceptionally strong social impact. For the latter only the ecos;omic
efficiency criteria will be relaxed and these projects must meet the following
conditions: (a) not exceed 3 percent of the cost of the investment program,
and (b) not result in a decrease in the total present value of economic
benefits of the 1991-1994 Irrigation and Drainage Investment Program (i.e.,
the income distribution weight n-0.5 in the programming model), greater than
15 percent, as compared to the net present value that would be obtained under
pure economic efficiency criteria. Assurances to this effect have been
obtained (paras. 6.7. 6.8 and 7.1 A(3)).
3.16        CNA will have final designs of all dams, and related structures,
to be constructed under the project reviewed and the construction of such dame
inspected periodically by a panel of experts with qualifications and
experience satisfactory to the Bank. Moreover, should implementation of the
project require displacement or resettlement of population, the Government
will present and implement a resettlement plan satisfactory to the Bank.
Assurances to this effect have been obtained (Rara. 7.1 A (14)).

C. Detailed Proiect Features
3.17        The investment program would comprise completion of unfinished
works, rehabilitation and modernization of existing irrigation and drainage
infrastructure; development of some new irrigation schemes; works to achieve a
more efficient use of existing infrastructure in small irrigation schemes;
improvement of water management, including operation and maintenance; and
river control programs as well as utilization of sewage water for irrigation.
3.18        Specifically, the project would finance: civil works such as dams,
diversion weirs, water control structures and automation, telemetric
equipment, construction of irrigation and drainage networks, lining of
existing canals, deep wells, pumping stations, land reclamation of
salt-affected soils, flood protection infrastructure, and access roads;
improvement of operation and maintenance of works, and purchase of essential
O&M equipment including earthmoving machinery, vehicles and telecommunication
equipment; and on-farm works, such as land leveling, field irrigation, and
open or tile drains.
3.19        Within the investment program the proposed time-slice type loan
would finance the following types of sub-projects which are described in the
Operating Regulations (for a summary see Tables 3.1 and 3.2).
1. Irrization and Drainage Construction Components
a. Construction of Irrigation Districts (US$522 million)
3.20        The proposed project would support the completion of 23 ongoing
projects in irrigation districts comprising some 93,800 new bectares and some
52,200 hectares of rehabilitation. The selection criteria for these projects
include provision for adequate water availability and quality, minimize
environmental concern, adequacy of planning, design and construction
provisions, and technical and ecornemic feasibility. Construction on most of
these projects has proceeded on a piecemeal basis, using annual budget
allocations. Headworks have usually been completed and conveyance and
distribution systems are unde. construction.  In most cases, it is necessary
to revise the planning and design of the schemes, including on farm
development and agronomic data, before continuing with construction. Three
new projects, covering some 1,000 new hectares and some 7,000 hectares of
rehabilitation, would also be constructed. The investments in ongoing and new
projects include civil works like storage dame and diversion dams, hydraulical
control structures, irrigation and drainage networks, canal lining, roads,
tube wells, pumping plants, and reclamation of saline soils. The locations of
the main irrigation areas are shown on the map attached to the report. (See
also Annex II, Tables 1, 3, 4, 7 and 8 for detailed costs by sub-projects.)
b. Construction of Small Irrigation (US$129 million)
3.21        This component includes the completion of 32 minor on-going
irrigation projects (ranging between 100 and 3,000 hectares each), covering
28,500 hectares of new areas, and 7,300 hectares of rehabilitation and 300
hectares of drainage only; and some 34 new projects, covering some 8,800 new
hectares of new irrigation, and some 2,700 hectares of drainage only. The
type of works is similar to that described in the previous component, although
proportionally smaller and loese complex. (Annex II, Tables 9 and 10)



- 25 -
c. Rehabilitation and Modernization of Irrigation Districts (US$258 million)
3.22        The objectives of rehabilitation and modernization of the
irrigation and drainage infrastructure are to promote the efficient use of
water and facilitate the introduction of improved operation and maintenance
(O&M) practices. General procedures for efficient O&M have already been
developed for a number of Districts in the Jtates of Sonora and Sinaloa, but
their application is hampered by lack of up-to-date infrastructure inventories
an? project specific O&M guidelines, system shortcomings, and continuing
organizational and funding constraints. The works required under this
component would include: rehabilitation/completion of the irrigation and
drainage canals system; rehabili:ation of roads; updating of the
infrastructure inventories; increased number of water turnouts not
contemplated in the original design; repairing water control structures and
their regulating mechanisms; repairing, and lining if economically justified,
irrigation and drainage canals; modernizing and improving hydraulic structures
and bridges, cross drains and silt control facilities which need repairs;
rehabilitation of tube wells and related equipment and new facilities required
for subsurface drainage, erosion control and environmental protection. It
would also involve measures related to functional improvements such as
installation of water measuring and control structures where required to
improve water deliveries, distribution and efficiency. (Annexes II Tables 2,
5 and 6 and Annex V)
3.23        On-farm water use efficiency would be enhanced by investing in:
the installation at farm turnouts and '-low measurement structures, land
leveling, and the construction of on-farm collector drains. Water saved from
improved operation and on-farm cifficiencies would be used, first, to satisfy
the optimum crop water requirements and then to expand the second season
irrigation, i.e., increasing the cropping intensity in the Irrigation
Districts.
3.24        Modernization of the irrigation networks is of primary importance.
However, many planners, deeigners and operation personnel need additional
training to learn how to use appropriate new technology to reduce future
operation and maintenance complications and costs. Priority attention will be
given to this training effort for new projects and work on existing projects
under the institutional development program. Specific attention will be given
to assure that adequate modernization will be incorporated in both new and
existing projects. In addition to the existing Panel on Dam Safety and Panel
on Studies, ad hoc Expert Groups will be convened by CNA on a periodic basis
(3-4 times per year) to provide input to specific projects in the areas of
modernization, rehabilitation, operations and maintenance, salinity and
drainage.  (paras. 1.49 e), 3.34 and 3.35 and Annex IV, Attachment I, Section
III).
d. Rehabilitation of Small Irrigation (US$21 million)
3.25        Rohabilitation works will be carried out in an estimated 1,120
small irrigation units, covering 380,000 hectares. These works will be
defined through a process of Diagnosticos Conjuntos (DICOS -- Joint
Diagnosis), in which farmers work with CNA personnel to complete feasibility
studies. The works involved are highly varied, ranging from improvement and
construction of canals and containing walls, to the rehabilitation of wells
and electrical equipment.



- 26 -
e. Deferred Maintenance (US$88 million)
3.26        This component includes the completion of deferred maintenance on
11 irrigation districts9 covering 752,600 hectares, whose studies are still in
progress. These works will be integrated into the economic model beginning in
the calendar year 1993. The type of works is similar to those previously
described for rehabilitation projects, the difference being that this sub-
component includes the implementation, during the first year, of urgent
maintenance actions which have not been possible to implement in the past for
lack of funds.
f.  Oieration and Maintenance Equipment (US$71 million)
3.27        All existing infrastructures should be maintained at a level that
prevents deterioration. The area covered each year by rehabilitation and/or
modernization works would be included for upgraded and efficient operation and
maintenance in the subsequent year. The physical repairs and maintenance
works which would be regularly (once or more times per year) carried out under
efficient O&M would include: weed and vegetation clearing from canals and
embankments, trimming overgrown canal beams, repairing potholes in roads,
damages to structures and leakage through canal banks, lubrication and
repairing of regulation gates, and painting of steel works. Maintenance work
of periodic nature would include: silt clearing of drainage canals, regrading
of canal profiles, and repairs to canal surface roads damaged by heavy rains
and regular traffic. Operation and maintenance expenses are estimated to
average around US$91.0 million per year. The Government will budget these
expenses, mainly to be financed through water charges.
3.28        A new mix of O&M equipment has been designed to facilitate the
improved maintenance efforts (see description in Annex III). It will include
more modern lighter equipment to provide efficient and appropriate
performance. The 21 Irrigation Districts that are being transferred to Users
groups during the time-slice will receive most of the new equipment.
Upgrading and addition of mechanical workshops as well as special training are
also included in the component.
3.29        The efficient O&M procedures to be followed have been prepared by
the Hydraulic Infrastructure Division within CNA, and would be supported by
financing the required equipment as well as by ensuring adequacy of staff
responsible for the supervision of O&M at District level, clear definition of
duties and responsibilities of official staff and Water Users' Association,
their training in maintenance work identification, water scheduling, discharge
measurements, data collection and reporting and full coverage of O&M cost.
g. Reuse of Sewage Waters (US$10 million)
3.30        This sub-component consists of the execution of 3 projects of
sewage water reutilization for agricultural irrigation. The works of this
sub-component include only the infrastructure of agricultural reuse for the
irrigation of about 3,000 hectares, with the end of avoiding the use of sewage
waters and/or saving good quality water flows for other uses, such as domestic
use.



- 27 -
2. Support Actions Components
a. Environmental Actions and Works (US$34 million)
3.31        Since there will be a lag time between the initiation of the
projected works (many of them already in progress) and the initiation of the
works and/or measures of mitigation proposed for all the projects of the
portfolio, and given that some require additional studies and/or designs, the
Investment Program includes annual sums for this purpose, totalling US$25
million. These sums have been estimated at 3 percent of the investments in
irrigation districts and 2 percent of the investments in small irrigation and
rehabilitation. Besides this, moreover it is estimated an additional US$9
million for the 1991-1994 period, to be invested in additional studies and
diagnoses of the environmental impact of projects (US$2 million), studies for
environmental improvement (US$4 million), and material and equipment for
laboratories and the monitoring of water quality (US$3 million).
b. Institutional Development (US$24 million)
3.32        The project's Institutional Development component will support the
decentralization and improved performance of irrigated agriculture, by
strengthening the institutional capacity of CNA and newly organized Users'
Organizations to develop and productively manage irrigation activities.
Institutional development actions were identified to address those major
capacity gaps identified in CNA and users' organizations (para. 1.49).
Actions are organized in the following five areas: (i) developing and
strengthening the capacity of Users' Organizations to manage their systems;
(ii) improving the internal management systems of CNA, increasing the
effectiveness of planning, monitoring, financial, and evaluation systems;
(iii) strengthening CNA's technical capacity related to new irrigation
development, rehabilitation and modernization, operation and maintenance,
transferring of districts, and environmental protection; (iv) modifying CNA
staffing patterns to increase number of professional staff, increase specific
technical skills of staff, and retrench redundant lower level staff assigned
to Irrigation Districts; and (v) strengthening CNA's evaluations of irrigation
system performance and the impact of investment and transfer activities (Annex
IV, paras. 1-8). The strategies to be employed to strengthen CNA and Users'
Organizations are included in the Institutional Development Action Plan.
Assurances have been obtained that the Institutional Development Component
shall be carried out in accordance with the Action Plan referred to in Annex
IV (para. 7.1 A (4) and Annex IV, Attachment I). A breakdown of costs for the
institutional development component is provided in Annex IV, Attachment II.
3.33        The major inputs financed by the project include long and short
term consulting for applied and adaptive research and technical assistance to
Users' Organizations and CNA units; approximately 350 training programs and
seminars for CNA professionals and 400 for Users' Associations; graduate
programs for 50 CNhA professionals and international study tours. In the
execution of certain institutional development activities IMTA will
participate. CNA has formalized with INTA through a Letter of Instruction
dated August 27, 1991, satisfactory arrankements regarding the latter's role
in the implementation of the Institutional Development Action Plan.
Assurances have been obtained that such arrangements shall be maintained
(para. 7.1 A(16)2. Planning for institutional development activities will be
part of the SPS, and will be monitored, reviewed and revised annually, to the
satisfaction of the Bank.

3. Other Works and Complementary Actions Component
a. Studies and Desi&ns (US$37 million)
3.34        Studies and designs are to be contracted for projects from the
present and future investment portfolio. Priority will be given to those
studies which are related with the Program from 1991-1994.  On-going works
that are less than 50 percent complete require updated feasibility studies and
designs prior to being contracted. New projects also require updated
feasibility studies and detailed designs when those available were done prior
to December 1985 (Annex II, Table 2). A number of special studies to evaluate
environmental matters are also scheduled to help prevent or mitigate impacts.
3.35        CNA's design and project planning criteria need to be updated to
be able to adequately handle the rolling topography within many of the
remaining areas to be developed and the anticipated shift to crops requiring
pressurized application systems (e.a. tree crops). The technical assistance
provided through the Institutional Development component will focus on this
task as part of CNA's research and development agenda.
b. River Training (US$22 million)
3.36        River training work to be financed under the first time-slice will
involve actions in 25 of Mexico's 34 states. Most of the measures to be
carried out are smaller civil works facilities due to the financial and
planning constraints at this time. Civil works actions will involve about 46
construction operations in the 1991-1994 period. These actions will involve
levees, river training, bank protection, river straightening, sediment removal
and jetty construction. These measures are expected to benefit over 100,000
people.
c. Dams Safety (US$29 million)
3.37        This sub-component consists of about 336 activities and small
works to maintain the security of about 176 existing dams in 25 states,
serving about 700,000 residents and protecting 232,000 hectares. The works
and actions vary widely and include outlet valve repair, rehabilitation of
operation mechanisms, electric boards, access roads, and even embankments,
filters. and drains. The first year of the Program will also include
maintenance actions which were previously deferred due to lack of available
budget.
d. PreRaratory Study for Potential Future Project
3.38        In addition to the technical studies related to various sub-
projects of the Investment Program, the prolect will include a study on
feasibility of User Associations raisinx resources through Rublic borrowina.
The purpose would be for a selected number of User Associations to augment
their internal cash generation (water charges) with public borrowing in order
to finance a greater portion of future investments with non-governmental
funds. CNA will consult with the Bank and IDB on the TOR of this study. The
study will be completed by December 1993 to enable IBRD and IDB to use
conclusions and recomendations of the study in the design of a possible
future time-slice operation in irrigation and drainage. Assurances to conduct
this study have been obtained (para. 7.1 A (15)).

D. Cost Estimates
3.39        The total cost of the 1991-1994 investment program for irrigation
and drainage projects is about US$1,245 million (Table 5.1). Only about 6
percent of total investment for projects in 1991-1994 is earmarked for new
projects, the rest being divided between completion of major irrigation (57
percent) and completion of minor irrigation projects (9 percent),
rehabilitation and modernization (excluding machinery and equipment for O&M)
of existing Irrigation Districts and Units (28 percent). There are several
countrywide programs, such as local river training, treatment of sewage water,
dam safety, environmental protection programs and institutional strengthening
(12 percent). Physical contingencies were computed as 5 percent of the total
investment program, while price contingencies were calculated on a dollar
inflation rate of 4.9 percent p.a. and assuming that the Mexican Peso would be
adjusted following the purchasing power parity with the US Dollar.

S/ Chiapas and PRODERITH projects will be financed through on-going IBRD loans, but new projects would be included in the time-slice financing. A revised
investment proposal following these criteria is under preparation.



- 31 
3.40        CNA provided designs and feasibility studies for the new projects
and to the on-going ones with more than 50 percent of pending completion. The
assessment of costs is considered appropriate (Annex II, Table 2). The
average estimated cost per hectare o, 3 new large scale irrigation projects is
about US$7,300 while the average cost of minor schemes is about US$5,000. The
cost of rehabilitation of existing projects when major works or land
reclamation are involved (dams, diversion weirs, main canals) is in the order
of US$1,500-4,000 per hectare, but normal rehabilitation or modernization
projects have a cost of US$400-900 per hectare.
E. Financing
3.41        The proposed Bank loan of US$400 million would finance about 33
percent of total project cost, net of taxes. The proposed IDB loan of $200
million will finance about 17 percent of the project cost in parallel with the
Bank. The loans would be made to Nacional Financiera S.N.C., which would make
the funds available to CNA for the execution of the project. The loans would
finance 98 percent of foreign expenditures (Table 3.1). The Bank Loan would
be payable over 17 years including five years of grace, an" would bear
interest at the Bank's standard variable rate. Eligible expenditures incurred
after January 1, 1991 to the date of loan signing would be eligible for
retroactive financing up to a maximum of US$40 million equivalent. Claims for
retroactive expenditures would be made no later than 90 days after the
effectiveness of the loan. It would be a condition of loan effectiveness that
NAFIN and CNA have signed an agreement for transferring the loan Proceeds
(para. 7.1 B (2)).
F. Procurement
3.42        Allocation of procurement packages, disbursements, and direct
supervision between IDB and IBRD has been made on the basis of criteria agreed
between the Government and the Banks. The criteria takes into account project
economy and financing size of bidding packages and thresholds, relative
experience of each Bank in certain components and prior associations in
finsncing of previous operations (Annexes X and XI). The following table
shows distribution of the procurement packages by project components.

and Apetzingan Ln. 1858-NE)
***   To be financed only by tocal funds.
3.43         The Bank would finance civil works contracts, technical assistance
and purchase of equipment for about US$724.1 million over a period of four
years (1991-94). The civil works sub-component vould comprise construction of
new projects and completion of ongoing ones, rehabilitation and modernization
of existing Irrigation Districts and hydraulic infrastructure. Goods would
comprise mostly of purchasing of equipment and machinery for maintenance of
canals, drains and roads and some electrical and hydromechanical equipments
like pumps and gates. Sub-components and parts for rehabilitation and
retrofitting of existing equipment are also included. Annex III provides a
complete outline for Repairs and Acquisition of Equipment and Instruments for
Operation and Maintenance of the Irrigation Districts).
3.44         The Bank would only finance civil works contracts estimated to
cost more than USS2 million and Roods contracts estimated to cost more than
USS100.000 (nara. 7.1 C (3)). For retroactive financing, civil works procured
under contracts costing more than US$500,000 equivalent will be accepted
subject to the retroactive financing limit. The Bank loan would finance on
average about 80 percent of oach ICB and 40 percent of each LCB procured
contract. All contracts for civil-works components will be procured through



- 33 -
ICB procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines and using the standard
bidding documents agreed by the Mexican authorities and the Bank, except
civil-work contracts estimated to cost less than US$5 million in aggregate
amounts of up to US$200.0 million equivalent and contracts for goods estimated
to cost less than US$250,000 each up to an aggregate amount equivalent to
US$15.0 million, which may be procured using LCB procedures satisfactory to
the BUnk. All environmental and institutional development components will be
procuwed through procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
3.45        ICB and LCB grocedures and standard bidding documentation were
reviewed and agreed during proiect preparation and were confirmed during
negotiations. The review procedures used to determine acceptance by the Bank
of proposed contracts for financing, would be as follows:
(a)   Drior review of decisions would be required for: (i) all contracts
proposed for ICB procurement; and (ii) the first 3 LCB packages
for the construction of hydraulic works and the first 3 LCB
contracts for goods. In each case CNA would send to the Bank the
draft tender documents including information on advertisement,
final bidding documents, copy of any related relevant
correspondence issued during the bid preparation stage, the
evaluation of tenders, and the award recommendation. After
obtaining the Bank's nor.-objection, CNA would award the contract
and send to the Bank two copies of the legalized contract.
(b)   ex-Rost review of LCB contracts would be conducted by the Bank on
a sample of the remaining contracts, after the initial review
mentioned above.
3.46        It is expected that the prior review requirements would cover
around 70 percent of loan disbursements. CNAINAFIN submitted the Dreliminary
biddint grogram for CY 1992 for Bank review in Segtember. 1991. a final one is
going to be presented with the 1992 A-xoP (condition of effectiveness). For
the following years the biddinp_nackaxes will be submitted to the Bank prior
to the annual AIOP review. Procurement arrangements envisaged are summarized
in the following table.

3.47         To encourage competition CNA would, group procurement of
equipment, machinery and instruments and materials in contract packages
expected to cost not less than US$1 million.  Bid packages for contracts
expected to cost less than US$250,000, would go under LCB. Mexican
manufacturers whose ICB bids include components manufactured in Mexico
including a value added in Mexico of at least 20 percent of the value of their
bids would be given a margin of preference of 15 percent or the applicable
import duties, whichever is lower. Past experience suggests that about 70
percent of the value of the contracts placed through ICB would be awarded to
Mexican suppliers.
3.48         Consultant services, training and technical assistance, for
Environmental Assessment and Institutional Development components would be
contracted in accordance with Bank guidelines.
G. Disbursements
3.49         Disbursements from the Loan Account would be made on the basist
80 percent for Category Y1 (civil works above US$5.0 million); 40 percent for
Category #2 (civil works, engineering services and electro-mechanical repairs
above US$2.0 million up to US$5.0 million); 100 percent for foreign
expenditures and 55 percent for local expenditures for Category #3 (purchasing
of equipment, machinery and instruments above US$250,000); 55 percent for
Category 14 (local purchasing of equipment, materials and parts above
US$100,000 up to US$250,000) and 100 percent for Category #5 (technical
assistance and consultancy). The following table provides allocation of
amounts and percent of eligible expenditures to be financed for each of the
five categories.

Disbursements would be fully documented except for purchases and contracts of
less than US$250,000 (goods) and US$3.0 million (works) respectively, which
would be made against certified Statements of Expenditures (SOEs).
Documentation in support of SOEs would be retained by the CNA and would be
available for review by the Bank missions and the auditors. Considering the
type and scope of the project and to reduce the time for its implementation, a
Special Account of US$40.0 million will be set up for the project. Since this
project finances a time-slice of the entire investment program, this will
permit the borrower to access a wider base of eligible e-penditures and
thereby accelerate disbursements (para. 4.18). No disbursement will be made
for a sub-groiect unless it: (a) is included in an anProved AIOP: and (b) has
formal commitment from beneficiaries on their capital contribution (only for
new sub-Rro1ects) (gara. 7.1 C (1) and (2)); see also para. 5.10.
H. Environmental Effects
3.50         The proposed project supports mainly on-going projects and
rehabilitation of existing irrigation systems. All project and civil works
investments will be screened by CNA. For new investments, full environmental
tmnact assessments will be carried out at the sub-project level in accordance
with Mexican law, and depending on the nature of the proposed investments.
CNA's Investment Selection Criteria include environmental screening based on
this assessment. To strengthen CNA's capacity to commission or carry out
environmental assessment and to monitor and enforce environmental regulations
and criteria, the project includes institutional strengthening; a schedule for
these activities was developed during project appraisal and was confirmed
during negotiations as a part of the Institutional Development Action Plan.

I. Role of Women
3.51        Women have a very active role in all phases of agricultural
activity, although that role changes somewhat by ethnic group, region and
level of farm mechanization. To develop better information about the role of
women in the irrigation districts and their participation in agriculture, the
survey of farm households has been adapted to ensure that women are used as
informants and that questions are asked to identify gender specific issues
related to productive roles and access to land, financial and other resources.
Survey results would be analyzed and used as a basis to identify potential
strategies for addressing gender issues within the project. Depending on the
results of the survey, and the extent to which gender specific strategies are
required to achieve project goals, a workshop would be conducted by CNA in the
second year of the project, where participants would develop specific
proposals to be incorporated into CNA's work program (Annex IV, Attachment I,
Section I). A consultant, specialized in gender related analysis would assist
in the survey design, implementation and analytical work, and, if needed,
would serve as a resource person to the workshop and the development of
proposals. Implementation and follow-up to plans outlined in the seminar
would be undertaken by CNA, with monitoring carried out as part of the annual
project review process.
3.52        in addition, in the development of water Users' Associations and
in the strengthening of those associations, active participation by women in
organizational meetings would be encouraged by CNA staff members. The extent
of participation of women in water Users' Association and in training programs
would be monitored and reviewed regularly by the responsible IMTA team.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Or2anization and Management
1. National Level Ortanization and Manatement
4.1         CNA, through its Sub-Directorates and field offices, is
responsible for project implementation, with the assistance of IMTA for
specific research, training and other institutional development activities,
Overall coordination of the project as well as the direct supervision of most
project components would be provided by the Sub-Directorate for Hydro-
agricultural Infrastructure with the Sub-Director responsible for overall
project management. As has been agreed during appraisal, the head of the
Investment Studies and Planning Unit, within that Sub-Directorate, would be
designated Project Coordinator (see para. 1.39 and 1.40 for description of
CNA's structure).
4.2         The Sub-Directorate for Hydro-agricultural Infrastructure and its
units would be responsible for all components of the project except four; the
re-use of sewage water, river training, and environmental studies would be the
responsibility of the Sub-Directorate for Administration of Water, and the
coordination of the institutional development component would be the
responsibility of the Office of Advisor Coordination, within the office of the
Director General of CIA. The four sub-components of the institutional
development component and the respective CIA units responsible for them ares
(i) staffing and human resource development -- Sub-Directorate for
Administration; (ii) administrative and financial systems -- Sub-Directorate
for Administrationg (iii) CIA technical and organizational development for
.rriuation development and management -- Sub-Directorate for Hydro-



- 37 -
agricultural Infrastructure with the Sub-Directorate for Planning and Finance;
and (iv) irrigation user organization technical and organization development -
- Sub-Directorate for Hydro-agricultural Infrastructure. In each of these
sub-components except the second one (administration and finance), IMTA has
been asked by CNA to take a leadership role in designing, contracting and
implementing the required training and technical assistance.
4.3         As a time-slice project, project activities include the complete
range of irrigation and drainage activities of CNA. Therefore, internal CNA
reviews would occur using established organizational management procedures,
including weekly meetings of senior management in which needed coordination
among units can be identified and planned, weekly staff meetings at the Sub-
Directorate level, and monthly progress review meetings at the state Gerencia
level. In addition, three established internal CNA committees would be used
to review and guide the development of CNA's information system, CNA's
professional development program, and the process of project selection. While
the information system committee is relatively new, the other two committees
have already established successful track records over the past two years.
These committees, along with the new Expert Review Groups to be supported by
the Institutional Development component (para. 1.49(f) and Annex IV,
Attachment I, Section III), would play an important role in guiding project
implementation and ensuring effective coordination among CNA and IMTA units.
4.4         Joint reviews of the Bank and CRA of implementation progress would
would occur on a four monthly basis, with more in-depth reviews and approvals
of an Annual Investment and Operational Plan (AIOP) occurring annually.
Details regarding this system and what it addresses are provided below.
2. Regional. State and District Level Organization and Management
4.5         The State Offices play a major role in the initial identification
of potential projects, in the development of small scale projects, and in the
construction, operation, maintenance, and transfer to users of projects of all
sizes. State Offices no longer have, however, special units to conduct
project studies as this function has been re-assigned to the Regional Offices.
The Regional Offices are responsible for contracting and supervising basic
studies, completing the project feasibility analysis, and assisting states in
operations and construction. The central office Sub-Directorate of Hydro-
agricultural Infrastructure is responsible for integrating proposed projects
from each region into CNA's programming model, setting priorities according to
that model, and, during implementation, contracting for designs and civil
works for large projects. Construction of actual works is supervised in the
field by an office of the Resident Construction Engineer. In addition, each
District is managed by an Irrigation District Manager who is responsible for
operation and maintenance and the eventual transfer of the District to a user
organization.
4.6         In addition, special staff units exist to assist Irrigation
District Managers in addressing issues related to the transfer of Districts
(regional Asesoria Legal unit and state Asesoria Juridica unit), and the
organization of users' groups (regional and state units of Citizen Information
and Participation). Professional development activities for CNA field staff
are coordinated by a regional Professional Development unit.



- 38 -
3. Users' Organizations
4.7         Users' Associations have been established in a number of
irrigation districts including Rio Mayo, Carrizo, El Grullo, and Rio Culiacan.
In Rio Mayo, all 16 irrigation modules have organized Users' Associations,
with the next step being the organization of a district-wide Company. The
Users' Associations and the Companies that have yet to be developed would
function with formal rules, responsibilities and procedures relating to the
charging and collection of revenues and the operations and maintenance of the
irrigation system. The Companies would then be responsible for hiring
permanent staff to manage the system. Given the cost recovery requirements
for new capital investments, these organizations will also be required to
participate in reviewing and agreeing to investment plans. Because of the
need to rapidly develop the capacity of these organizations, they will receive
significant training and technical assistance as part of the institutional
development component.
B. Investment and Operations Planning and Monitoring System
4.8         To support the effective implementation of the project and long
term organizational effectiveness, CNA would substantially revise and
strengthen its system for planning, implementation monitoring and review, by
adopting a comprehensive system called the Sistema de Programaci6n y
Seguimiento (SPS--Planning and Monitoring System) (Annex I, Appendix III-A).
The SPS is a system designed by CHA, with the assistance of the Bank, that
brings together all relevant activities regarding the development of a given
Irrigation District into one integrated plan. It includes the physical and
financial targets for the following twelve areas: studies; designs;
environmental impact assessment and mitigative actions; civil works;
procurement; repairs; operation and maintenance; cost recovery; transfer of
districts; institutional development; and technical assistance, agricultural
extension and research.
4.9         The SPS contains both a multi-year plan (Plan de Acci6n de
Proyecto--PAP) and an annual plan (Annual Investment and Operational Plan--
AIOP--also called the Programa Annual de Trabajo). The SPS will be used for
all irrigation districts receiving rehabilitation, modernization, acquisition
of maintenance equipment, and/or new construction.  Activities in all twelve
categories would be included in the plans, even though some may involve no
project financing. Where financing is involved, the plan would include a
budget, indicating the source or sources of funds. In addition, other project
efforts (e.g., research activities and CNA internal management systems
development), which are not Irrigation District specific, would also be
planned and monitored using the SPS. The AIOPs would be consolidated in order
to provide an overview of CNA activities in a given year within each state and
region, within IMTA, within central CMA units, and within each of the twelve
planning categories (para. 4.5). Although the SPS would be initially
developed at the field level, plans would receive input and approval of
central CNA offices, to ensure that they reflect policy priorities, the
application of project eligibility criteria and optimization analysis, and
budgetary constraints.
4.10        Monitoring and reporting of progress against financial and
activity targets in the twelve categories covered by the SPS would occur every
four months. During the annual planning exercise, in August-September of each
year, progress against both the AIOP and the multi-year plan would be
reviewed, and a t.ew AIOP developed that would address any problems identified.
This would be done in a manner eatisfactory to the Bank.



- 39 -
4.11        CNA would begin utilizing the SPS and completing necessary
computer applications. By September 15 of each year, the updated SPS plan for
the upcoming year, including the PAP and AIOP, covering all eligible projects,
would be presented for review by the Banks. By December 15, the SPS plans
would be formally approved within CNA. As a condition of loan effectiveness
the elements of the SPS would be established and made operational, and the
AIOP for 1992 covering each Irrigation District and cross-prolect activity
area would be complete, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank (Rara. 7.1 B (1)
and Annex 1, Appendix IV).
C. O&M Funding
4.12        Under the project, the budget for .-fficient O&M would be built up
every year on the basis of actual need as determined at each District level,
and will include as recoverable costs those associated with operation,
conservation, extension services, and administration. To provide incentives
for farmers to be self-sufficient in O&M operations and to pay 100 percent of
O&M costs, CNA's policy is to increase farm income by better services and
extension and by the rehabilitation and modernization of all Irrigation
Districts. In line with the decentralization strategy outlined in the
National Development Plan 1988-1994, the Government of Mexico decided to
transfer the responsibilities for operation and maintenance of Irrigation
Districts to water user associations in each District. It is a condition of
loan effectiveness, that the Bank has received the final and official budget
proposal presented by CNA to SPP. covering the operation and maintenance costs
of the Government's hydraulic infrastructure.  In addition, assurances have
been obtained that the Government shall submit to its Congress budgets to be
consistent with the Government's macroeconomic framework and an adequate
allocation of budgetary resources for operation and maintenance of its
hydraulic infrastructure in irrigation and drainage for its fiscal year, 1992
and thereafter. The Government will furnish by March 15 of each year evidence
of its aRproved budgetarv allocation and exNenditures raade by CNA for this
Rurpose (paras. 7.1 A (13) and 7.1 B (3)).
4.13        A detailed discussion of the procedure and legal framework for
cost recovery appears in paras. 5.1 - 5.5 below. Tables 1.1 and 1.2 in Annex
VI illustrate the CNA's plans for O&M expenditures for the years 1991 through
1994. For each of Mexico's 77 Irrigation Districts, Table 1.3 in Annex VI
describes O&M cost recovery rates based on full, "normal", O&M expenditure
levels for 1991. These rates are given for total, "normal" O&M costs (column
1), and for the minimum level of recoverable O&M costs based on Mexico's
Federal Rights Law (column 3).
D.  Environmental Screenina
4.14        Under the project all sub-projects eligible for financing under
the proposed loan would be subject to a review process to detect current and
potential environmental impacts from project works and activities. The
process to be followed would comply with the Govsrnment's legislation on
environmental protection and the Bank's Environmental Guidelines for
Irrigation and Drainage Projects.
4.15        CNA would be responsible for screening all proposed operations
included in the Portfolio of Projects submitted by each State, and for
obtaining clearance from SEDUE. Although national legislation exempts on-
going and rehabilitation projects from the EIA requirement, under the project
all proposed operations would be screened and ranked for environmental



- 40 -
purposes according to the procedures established by CNA which are satisfactory
to the Bank.
4.16        While SEDUE would continue to enforce current environmental policy
and to establish required norms and regulations, CNA's Sub-Gerencia de
Evaluaci6n y Seguimiento Ambiental would be strengthened to monitor project
impact to prevent and mitigate environmental and natural resource degradation.
This Unit would be supported by field branches at the Regional level and by
laboratory facilities to test water quality (Annex IV). CNA and SEDUE have
concluded an agreement defining the rules for environmental assessments and
ensuring provision of adequate resources to coordinate EIA evaluations.
Assurances have been obtained that such agreement will be maintained (Annex I.
Appendix V. PP. 104-110) .
E. Accounts and Audit
4.17        CNA would maintain separate accounts of expenditures made under
the project. Supporting documentation will be made available to the Bank for
review in Mexico as requested. Independent qualified auditors would carry out
an audit satisfactory to the Bank on the accounts of CNA (including the
accounts of the Irrigation Districts) and SOEs in accordance with existing
arrangements between the Bank and the executive control entity of the Mexican
Government (i.e., Secretaria de la Controlaria General de la Federaci6n
(SCGF)). Audit reports would be submitted to the Bank no later than six
months after the close of each fiscal year.
1. Special Account
4.18        As stated earlier, to facilitate Bank disbursements, a Special
Account in US dollars would be established in the Banco de Mexico with an
initial deposit of up to US$40.0 million.   This deposit is based on estimates
of the project's financing needs and projected Bank loan disbursements.
F. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.19        The SPS (paras. 4.8 - 4.11) would form the basis of the project
monitoring system. The Annual Reviews would be structured to address the
achievement of the AIOP, including activities in each of the twelve planning
categories (pars. 4.8). In addition, the Annual Reviews would address the
following issues: (a) compliance with the investment selection criteria,
(b) implementation of the Action Plans for cost recovery, transfer of
Districts, and institutional development; (c) implementation of agreed
investment program for modernization, rehabilitation, and new construction;
(d) implementation of the plan for deferred maintenance in 1991-92;
(e) implementation of river training works; (f) implementation of
environmental studies and actions for each sub-project as required by the
Reglamento Operativot (g) achievement of dam safety targets; (h) procurement
and repair of maintenance equipment as per Action Plan for transfer of
Districts; (i) implementation of agreed program for studies and designs; and
(j) the bidding packages for all investment programs. During the Annual
Reviews, issues and problems would be identified and remedial actions would be
agreed upon between the Government, the Bank and the IDB and incorporated into
the AIOP for the following year. Assurances have obtained that the Government
and the Bank will hold Annual Review meetings in October of each year to
assess the above areas of pro1ect implementation. includina compliance with
the memorandum of Operatinx Regulations (Annex I). and aaree on a new AIOP for
the next year. If proaress in Project im-lementation is not satisfactory.
Government shall implement remedial actions satisfactory to the Bank. To



- 41 -
allow adeguate Rreparation for Annual Reviews, assurances have been obtained
that CNA would submit to the Bank the RroDosed AIOP of the next year no later
than September 15 of each year (para. 7.1 A (9) and (10)).
4.20        Ex-post evaluations of rehabilitation, modernization, new
irrigation, and transfer would require the conduct of studies of the physical
performance of the system, and the socio-economic impact of the investment and
transfer. Within the first year after the completion of works, an evaluation
would be conducted by CNA of the performance of the physical system of each
project. CNA would then conduct a socio-economic impact study on a
representative cross-section of projects three to five years after each is
completed when some degree of consolidation is anticipated. For those
selected projects, baseline socio-economic data will be collected before the
new or rehabilitated system becomes operational. Responsibility for the
design and conduct of impact evaluations would be held by the Sub-Directorates
of Hydro-agricultural Infrastructure and of Planning and Finance. They will
be conducted with the assistance of consultants. The Regional and State
Offices would be responsible for the conduct of system performance evaluations
upon ?roject completion, based on guidelines established by the Sub-
Directorate of Hydro-agricultural Infrastructure.
V. COST RECOVERY
A. The LeRal Framework
5.1         Provisions regarding cost recovery of operation and maintenance
are found in the Mexican's Lev Federal de Derechos (Federal Law of Rights),
Lev Federal de ARuas (Federal Water Law) and Ley de Distritos de Desarrollo
Rural (Rural Districts Law).
5.2         The minimum level of cost recovery for O&M costs is annually
determined through the Lev Federal de Derechos. For 1991, there are three
categories according to the size of District and average size of farm
(percentages are 100 percent, 80 percent and 60 percent). These percentages
may be reduced, if (a) an unpredictable event (i.e., drought) affects the
program for the Irrigation District or (b) in the view of CNA and the SHCP, an
Irrigation District would not have the economic capacity to meet the
prescribed level of cost recovery.
5.3         CRA has in place a transparent system for accessing and monitoring
water charges for each Irrigation District in terms of O&M costs, water
demand, allocation and schedules which are satisfactory. The procedure for
determining the charge to the beneficiaries is as follows. At first, the
charges are proposed within the relevant rural District by a technical
committee formed by representatives of the relevant Secretariats (SARH,
Agrarian Reform, Fisheries, etc.), CNA, State Government, other public
entities (e.g., BANRURAL, and other governmental entities in the agricultural
sector) and the beneficiaries. Such charges are then reviewed by CNA and
further approved by SHCP.
5.4         All above-mentioned provisions are not applicable to an Irrigation
District or Unit which is decentralized. In such case, the charges are
determined within the Users' Association or holding company and are treated as
private charges out of the scope of the Lev Federal de Derechos. There is no
legal limitation to having 100 percent O&M recovery within a decentralized
District or Unit. In regard to the infrastructure administered by CNA and not
transferred to the users, CM& would charge a "cuota nor entreza en blogue"



- 42 -
(bulk water charge) to cover its O&M costs. This charge is regulated by the
Lev Federal de Derechos and is subject to the budget approved for CNA.
5.5         Provisions regarding cost recovery of capital investments are in
the Lev de Contribuci6n de Meioras Ror Obras Publicas Federales de
Infraestructura Hidraulica. Accordingly, beneficiaries must pay up to 90
percent of the reimbursable cost of the investment. Such charge is paid
semiannually or annually to a maximum period of 40 years and adjusted semi-
annually in accordance with the CPT. Reimbursable costs are defined in the
same law. They are calculated by the CNA, but may be reduced by Presidential
decree based on ability to pay.
B. O&M Recovery
5.6         The CNA has two interrelated short-term goals relevant for O&M
costs: (i) bringing levels of O&M expenditures up to "normal" levels required
to fully maintain systems (thereby avoiding continual deferred maintenance);
and (ii) 100 percent recovery of O&M costs from water users. The primary
mechanisms for achieving these goals are, first, the rehabilitation and
modernization of districts, and, secondly, the transfer of responsibilities
for the operation and maintenance of irrigation cacilities to water users.
5.7         The CNA has realized notable progress in achieving these goals
prior to the completion of rehabilitation works in many irrigation districts,
particularly in large districts in the Northwest. This progress throughout
CNA's districts is reflected by the following. Budgeted expenditures for O&M
during 1991 are 93 percent of full, "normal", O&M costs (Table 1.4, Annex VI).
Cost recovery rates based upon budgeted expenditures (including CNA labor
costs) which are legally recoverable rose from levels of 15 percent to 20
percent prior to 1989 to some 38 percent in 1991 (Table 1.4, Annex VI). User
contributions to total budgeted O&M costs for 1991 are estimated to be 37
percent (Table 1.4, Annex VI).
C. Capital Cost Recovery
5.8         The CNA's 8oal for capital cost recovery is an averaze of 30
percent for newly initiated investment proiects. This policy represents a
substantive improvement from historical policies in Mexico's irrigation sector
which have required little or nothing in the way of capital cost recovery.
The CNA's commitment to the principle of capital cost recovery is seen in
several districts in the Northwest and North Regions wherein water users have
begun paying 15 percent to 25 percent of capital costs required for on-going
rehabilitation and modernization works.
D. Cost Recovery Targets
5.9         CNA's cost recovery targets for each of its 77 Irrigation
Districts is given in Annex VI. Over the period 1991-1994, the CNA plans to
complete rehabilitation works and the complete transfer of O&M
responsibilities to User Associations in 21 Irrigation Districts. These
Districts include more than 60 percent of all irrigation lands in the CNA's 77
Districts. As a result, as seen in Annex VI, the CNA is committed to
achieving 100 percent recovery of full O&M costs in these 21 rehabilitated
Districts by 1994.  Also, CNA's cost recovery targets for 1994 include actions
required to increase O&M cost recovery rates to the full legal minimum set out
in the Ley de Derechos in the remaining 56 Districts. The CNA's achievement
of these cost recovery targets in all 77 Districts would result in an increase
in the overall O&M cost recovery from its current level of 34 percent in 1991



- 43 -
to 89.9 percent in 1994 and 100 percent in 1995 (Annex VI, Table 1.2).
Assutances have been obtained for minimum 100 percent immediate recovery of
O&M costa for the 21 Districts transferred, and for the remaining Districts 48
percent in 1992. 70 percent in 1993. and 90 percent in 1994 as provided in the
Action Plan (Rara. 7.1 A 6) and Annex VI).4
5.10        CNA's target for capital cost recovery is the recovery of 30
percent of all capital costs expended for investment programs for large and
small new irrigation developments and 40 percent for rehabilitation and
modernization programs.  Achievement of this goal will require water users to
enter into contractual agreements with the CNA for the repayment of capital
costs prior to the initiation of the investment projects. Assurances have
been obtained that all New Sub-projects are subject to capital cost recovery
includiny expansion Sub-proiects (as defined in the Reglamento Operativo).
The referred Sub-proiects are divided into two groups: (i) those for
rehabilitation and modernization of Irrization Districts: and (ii) all other
New Sub-proiects excluding those for rehabilitation and modernization (para.
7.1 A (6) and C (2)).
(i)   For each New Sub-project in the first group, a minimum of 40
percent of the total cost of the Sub-project in real terms will be
recovered from the respective beneficiaries. Exception to this
will be given to farms between 0 and 5 hectares, from which a
minimum of 30 parcent of the total cost of the Sub-project in real
terms will be recovered from the respective beneficiaries.
(ii)  For each New Sub-project ir. the second group, a minimum of 30
percent of the total cost of the Sub-project in real terms will be
recovered from the respective beneficiaries. Exception to this
will be given to farms between 0 and 5 hectares, from which a
minimum of 20 percent in real terms shall be recovered from the
respective beneficiaries.
E. Cost Recovery and Efficiency
5.11        As CNA districts are rehabilitated and O&M responsibilities are
transferred to User Associations, the CNA plans to look for ways by which
intra-association and inter-association exchanges of water can be facilitated.
Such transfers of water from low to higher valued uses will enhance the
overall efficiency of water use in Mexico's irrigation sector. "Market-like"
exchanges of water between Users in CRA Irrigation Districts take place at the
present time. Such practices will be expanded as a part of CNA policy, and
will require that, as a part of their establishing "titulos de concesi6n" with
User Associations, they develop rules which allow for market transfers of
water (leases of usufructuary water rights) between water users in Irrigation
Districts that are consistent with the Federal Water Law. Assurances have
been obtained that SARR and CNA will iointlv carry out a feasibility study for
market transfer of water. including economic and regulatory analysis by not
later than September 15. 1992 (para. 7.1 A (7)). This study will provide a
basis for a possible future Bank project to support Small-Scale Private
Irrigation.
By lkle dated 09/2311991, CNA has indicated that it will auempt to achve O&M cost recovery of 95 percent in 1995 and 100
peire ian 1996

VI. BENEFITS. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Benefits and Beneficiaries
6.1         Quantification of incremental production due to the investment
program at this stage is based on the preliminary investment proposal for
1991-1994, in the process of being finalized by CNA. According to the
proposals currently being analyzed by CNA, the proposed investment program is
expected to incorporate, by the end of 1994, about 0.14 million hectares new
under irrigation, and some 0.63 million hectares currently under irrigation
would have improved. their efficiency as a result of the rehabilitation and
modernization projecte. Additionally, investment in drainage and other land
improvements would have brought under production some 0.44 million hectares of
rainfed agriculture. The area benefitted by the 1991-1994 investment program
could be distributed as follows:

Financed under other on-going Bank loans.
6.2         The combined effect of these investments could, in principle,
allow Mexico to substitute a substantial part of its basic agricultural
imports. CNA's estimates indicate that, at full development, the benefitted
area would have an incremental production of, for example, 2.4 million tons of
basic grains, or 30 percent of the average annual inputs of those produce. On
the other hand, the same source estimates that the gross value of the
incremental annual production expected from the benefitted area would be about
US$950 million. However, an ex-post analysis would be required to have an
accurate assessment of the actual impact of the program. In principle,
incremental production in the irrigated areas would be in response to one or
more of the following four factors: (i) an increase in the cropped area under
irrigation; (ii) an improvement in yields; (iii) an increase in crop
intensity; and (iv) expansion of crop diversity. The first three would be
made possible by enhanced capacity and efficiency of water delivery and



- 45 -
application, with crop diversity arising from these and other factors such as
reliability of water and support services, plus favorable market conditions.
6.3         Examples of anticipated incremental production in response to an
increase in yields and cropping intensities can be found in the investments
for three Irrigation Districts in the Northwest (Yaqui, Mayo, and Carrizo)
where cropping intensity would increase on some 350,000 ha from 119 percent to
136 percent as a result of savings in water from increased operation and
on-farm efficiencies, thus enabling expansion of the area planted to second
crops (mainly soybeans following wheat). Annual incremental crop production
is estimated at 100,000 tons at full development. Also, land levelling and
improved water application and drainage in portions of these same Districts is
estimated to increase crop yields between 10 percent and 15 percent.
6.4         Six recent investment projects in the State of Chiapas
(Acapetahua, Huixtla, Cornitan, San Miguel II, Suchiapa and Tapachula) in the
humid tropics of Southeast Mexico are indicative of responses which can be
expected under rainfed conditions to infrastructure investments in drainage,
flood control and access roads. Here investments in drainage and flood
control affecting some 260,000 ha would have a major impact on incremental
production by (i) bringing new land into production and converting land now
used for extensive livestock production to more intensive crop and livestock
production; (ii) intensifying crop production on existing land; (iii) changing
cropping patterns from subsistence crops (maize and beans) to a wide range of
commercial crops; and (iv) increasing yields through improved production
technology, particularly the use of higher levels of inputs once the risk of
water logging and flooding are reduced.
6.5         The proposed investment program is expected to benefit some
425,000 farmers, of which 55 percent earn less than the minimum wage. Once
the projects included in the time-slice financing have reached full
development the income of these producers is expected to increase by a factor
of 5, in the case of the lowest paid, and of about 2 for those at the other
end of the scale within this income group. Some 250,000, or nearly 60 percent
of the total number of producers participating in the program would take over
the operation and maintenance of their irrigation schemes t)'us improving their
operation efficiency and saving about US$30 million per annum in 0&M expenses
once the rehabilitation and the transfer has been completed. Additionally,
some 100,000 people would benefit from flood prevention as a result of the
river control component.
B. Economic Analysis
6.6         Feasibility studies exist for all projects being considered for
the 1991-1994 Irrigation and Drainage Investment Program. They have either
been recently prepared or updated. In order to assess the quality of current
project evaluation practices at the local and central level a sample of
feasibility studies representing about US$440 million, or 35 percent of total
investment in 1991-94, was reviewed in detail. The studies are prepared by
CNA's state-level units and supervised by their respective regional offices.
While the feasibility studies are generally adequate in their technical
aspects, economic analysis at the State level is generally weak as costs and
benefits are usually assessed in terms of market prices rather than economic
prices. CRA's Central Office has tried to overcome this by re-evaluating the
economic benefits and costs of each project using standard regional
assessments of benefits and costs, together with shadow prices. The use of
project specific data rather than regional parameters would become the general
rule during the first year of implementation of the time-slice operation as a



- 46 -
result of the various actions included in the institutional strengthening
component and the improvement in the overall programming exercise. (See Annex
VII and para. 4.2, Appendix I-B, Annex I, Operating Regulations, for a more
detailed presentation of the economic analysis).
6.7         The economic efficiency criteria require that as a general rule
any project considered for inclusion in the investment program should have at
least a 12 percent rate of return on investment. Under the current investment
financing constraints, however, not all projects with a positive net present
value, or a minimum rate of return of 12 percent, that also meet the agreed
technical and environmental selection criteria, can be executed. The
selection problem is solved through an investment programming model which
selects, following the agreed investment selection criteria (Annex I, Appendix
I-B), a set of projects that maximizes, within the expected irrigation and
drainage investment budget constraints, the net present value of all on-going
and new projects considered for the medium-term investment plan. Projects are
ranked according to their net benefit-investment ratio, discounted at 12
percent, and those that can make the largest contribution, given the budgetary
constraints, are included in the investment program. The rates of return of
the projects that have thus been selected range between 12.5 percent to 23.0
percent, with nearly two-thirds of the projects presenting rates of return
within the rate of 15 percent to 20 percent and another 25 percent of the
projects falling in the range of 20 percent to 25 percent rate of return.
There Pre only 11 projects, with a total investment cost of US$57.1 million,
whose rate of return are less than 15 percent but still larger than the
opportunity cost of capital. The range of rates of return for the main
categories of projects are shown in Annex VII. For new modernization and
rehabilitation projects that de not yet have full feasibility studies, these
will be prepared during the first year of implementation of the time-slice
operation. However, given the importance of rehabilitation work and the
likely high returns on these types of investment, during the first year of the
time-slice operation, funds would be earmarked to finance initial
rehabilitation works in those Districts where projects are being prepared.
Starting in Year 2 of implementation of the time-slice operation, these
projects will enter the programming model and compete with the rest of the
projects for investment resources.
6.8         The introduction of a poverty bias (n-0.5) into the selection of
the projects included in the investment program (see Annex I, Appendix I-B
page 20), results in an overall loss in the total net present value of about 9
percent when compared to the net present value that would have been achieved
if only efficiency criteria has been applied. This lower net percent value,
however, is further reduced as the model accepts certain projects which, while
meeting the minimum economic criteria (i.e., an IRR of at least 12 percer,t),
could not gain a place in the investment program. The argument for this type
of exception is that previous commitments make it impossible for the
Government not to execute these projects at this stage. This type of problem,
however, is expected to disappear in future as the programming exercise
becomes fully operational in 1992. The investment program presented by CNA to
the appraisal mission contains several of these "forced" projects which were
introduced as restrictions to the programming model. In addition to these
projects the Government could also include some small projects which do not
meet the economic efficiency criteria, provided these would not represent more
than 3 percent of the total investment in irrigation and drainage that has
been subject to the programming model. As shown in Annex VII, these
exceptions to the economic efficiency criteria are expected to be well within
the proposed 3 percent margin, since the total investment cost of these
projects is only about US$10.3 million, or 0.8 percent of the total investment



- 47 -
program. The final result was a difference of 14 percent between the net
present value of CNA's proposal and that of the pure economic efficiency
alternative. This was also within the agreed criteria, which established that
these exceptions which are within the 3 percent limit, would not reduce the
net present value of economic benefits of the 1991-94 Irrigation and Drainage
Investment Program by more than 15 percent, as compared with the result of the
pure economic efficiency alternative. Agreement on the economic analysis for
sub-2rojects to be financed under the Proiect has been obtained (para. 7.1 A
(3)).
C. Risks and Uncertainties
6.9         An inherent risk of a time-slice operation is related to the
Government's commitments to provide adequate resources (fiscal counterpart
funds or cash generation through water charges) for (i) projects which will be
completed after the Closing Date of the proposed operation, and
(ii) maintenance of the existing irrigation infrastructure. A sharp shortfall
in any of these areas could compromise the viability of the investment
program. These risks would be reduced through increased cost recovery plans
supported by the institutional decentralization and beneficiary participation
in water management. Moreover, the annual review of the investment program
and budget proposed under the project will help to size the level of planned
investments and O&M expenditures to the changing macroeconomic conditions.
6.10        Since this is the first time-slice irrigation project in Mexico
and given the wide scope of the operation, there is a risk that the agreed
investment selection criteria will not be strictly adhered to. This would
cause delays in project implementation since the Bank and IDB would not
disburse against sub-projects that do not meet the investment selection
criteria. This risk will be substantially reduced through training and
institutional capacity strengthenings of both CNA and Water Users Associatione
and intensive Bank supervision. The project design includes institutional
strengthening and training for this purpose. The Closing Date has been set at
December 31, 1995 to accommodate for any slippage of project implementation
included in the 1991-1994 investment program.
VII. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A. Agreements Reached at Negotiations
7.1         Assurances were provided by the Government at negotiations that:
(1)   CNA will adhere to the Operating Regulations which will not be
changed without the Bank's consent. (para. 3.14).
(2)   The investment program will comply with the investment selection
criteria and methodology included in the Operating Regulations.
(para. 3.14).
(3)   Subject to the Bank's agreement and based on social factors,
activities not meeting the economic efficiency criteria set forth
in the Operati.ng Regulations may be financed under the Project
provided, however, that the aggregate cost of all such activities
shall: (1) not exceed three (3X) percent of the total cost of the
Project; and (2) not result in a decrease exceeding fifteen (152)



- 48 -
percent of the net present value of economic benefits of the
Project. para. 6.8 and Annex I, Appendix I-B para. 1.6).
(4)   Implementation of the Institutional Development component shall be
in accordance with the Action Plan referred to in Annex IV.
(para. 1.48 and 3.32).
(5)   Irrigation Districts will be transferred according to the agreed
Action Plan (para. 1.36).
(6)   Cost recovery would be achieved in accordance with the targets
established in the Cost Recovery Action Plan that is a
Supplementary Letter to the Loan Agreement. This Action Plan
establishes increasing annual targets for the recovery of
Irrigation District O&M costs, resulting in the recovery of 90
percent of O&M costs in 1994. The Action Plan also reflects
agreement that capital costs for new investments will be recovered
at a rate of 40 percent for rehabilitation and modernization works
and 30 percent for new construction (farmers with 5 hectares or
less would repay a smaller percentage, 30 percent and 20 percent,
respectively) (paras. 1.37, 5.1, 5.9 and 5.10 and Annex VI).
(7)   SARH and CNA will prepare a feasibility study for market transfer
of water, including economic and regulatory analyses by not later
than September 15, 1992. (para. 5.11).
(8)   CNA would maintain adequate staffing with relevant functions and
skills for implementation and supervision of the project. (para.
1.49 (c)).
(9)   CNA would submit to the Bank the AIOP for the next year not later
than September 15 of each year. (para. 4.19; Annex I, Appendix
III-A).
(10)  The Government will hold annual reviews with the Bank in October
of each year to assess project implementation, including
allocation plans, Action Plans, compliance with investment
selection criteria and agree on the AIOP for the next year. If
progress in project implementation is not satisfactory, the
Governament shall implement remedial action satisfactory to the
Bank. (para. 4.19; Annex I, Appendix III, Part II para. 2.1).
(11)  Transfer of Irrigation Districts will be conditional upon
assumption of full O&M cost recovery and that CNA shall supervise
and monitor the performance of the associations (transferred
Irrigation Districts and units) and shall take prompt remedial
actions in case of non-compliance by such associations of the
contractual terms. (para. 1.37).
(12)  Government will complete all investments and rehabilitation works
begun but not completed within the time-slice period. (para.
3.14).
(13)  Government would:  (a) submit to Congress budgets to be consistent
with the Government's macroeconomic framework and an adequate
allocation of budgetary resources for operation and maintenance of
its hydraulic infrastructure in irrigation and drainage for its
fiscal years 1992 and thereafter, and (b) by not later than March



- 49 -
15 in each year, furnish evidence, satisfactory to the Bank, of
(1) the approved budgetary allocations for operation and
maintenance of its hydraulic infrastructure for such year and
(2) the expenditures made by CRA in the previous year in respect
of the operation and maintenance of the Government's hydraulic
infrastructure (para. 4.12).
(14) CNA will have final designs of all dams, and related structures,
to be constructed under the project reviewed and the construction
of such dams inspected periodically by a panel of experts with
qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank. Moreover,
should implementation of the project require displacement or
resettlement of population, the Government will preserLt and
implement a resettlement plan satisfactory to the Bank. (para.
3.16).
(15) CNA will complete a study on feasibility of User Associations
raising resources through public borrowings by no later than
December 31, 1993. (para. 3.38).
(16) CNA and IMTA will maintain their current arrangements which
provide for INTA's support for the institutional development
component of the project (para. 3.33).
B. Effectiveness Conditions
(1)   The SPS system has been established and made operational and a
satisfactory AIOP for 1992 has been completed. (para. 4.11 and
Annex I, Appendix III-A, pages 39-49).
(2)   NAFIN and Government have signed an agreement for transferring the
loan proceeds. (para. 3.41 and Annex I, Appendix V).
(3)   The Bank has received the final and official budget proposal
presented by CNA to SPP, covering the operation and maintenance
costs of the Guarantor's hydraulic infrastructure. (para. 4.12).
(4) Agreement on environmental assessments has been signed between CNA
and SEDUE. (Condition fulfilled, para. 1.60 and Annex I, Appendix
V, pp. 104-110.)
(5)   Signature of a satisfactory contract between CNA and IMTA for
purposes of determining responsibilities and coordinat.%on in
carrying out the Institutional Development Program. (Condition
fulfilled.)

(1)   No disbursement would be made for a sub-project or a technical
assistance activities unless such sub-project or activity is
included in an approved AIOP. (para. 3.49).
(2)   No disbursement would be made for any sub-project for new
investments unless formal co mitment has been reached with



- 50 -
beneficiaries on their capital contribution. (paras. 3.49 and
5.10).
(3)   No disbursement would be made for any civil works contract
estimated to cost US$2 million or less and goods contract
estimated to cost US$100,000 or less. (para. 3.44).
7.2         Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project would
constitute a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$400.0 million equivalent to
the United Mexican States, to be repaid over a period of 17 years, including 5
years of grace.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
I.   Methodologv
1.1   The medium- and large-scale investment sub-projects to incorporate
new areas into irrigation, foster the introduction of irrigation
technology on rainfed land, and/or rehabilitate and modernize the
existing irrigation districts, as well as wastewater recycling and
river control, will be programmed within the PIRD in accordance
with the investment programming methodology and the optimization
model developed by CNA, which is described in Appendix I-B.
1.2   For purposes of the foregoing, the CNA will proceed to incorporate
into the existing programming model the evaluation criteria of the
water recycling and river control sub-projects which will permit
their programming starting in 1992.
1.3   The  programming  of  the  sub-projects  of  the  remaining  PIRD
components, enumerated in Sections V to VII of the Operating
Regulations, will be done according to the following criteria:
II.   Eligibility criteria
2.1   The eligibility criteria for each of the sets of sub-projects
considered within the PIRD, whether or not included in the
investment programming model, are as follows:
2.2   Each work considered by the PIRD must, without exception, have a
certificate of environmental impact (CEI), prepared by SGESA, and
its corresponding environmental classification, according to the
following categories agreed upon by CNA and SEDUE:
Group 1:  Those sub-projects located in biosphere reserve zones are
canceled, or immediatelv suspended, and no statement of
environment impact is issued.
Group 2:  Those that require a Statement of Environmental Impact
(or Environmental Impact Assessment) and, as a result,
require the ruling of SEDUE (or the Environmental
Evaluation and Follow-up Division of CNA).
Group 3:  Those  that,  in  accordance with  legal  norms,  do  not
require a Statement of Environmental Impact (or, under
SCESA ordinances, an Environmental Impact Assessment),
the resolution of which can be achieved through a
Preventive Report.

ANNEX I
APPENDIX I
Page 12 of 58
Group 4: Those which for lack of information cannot be classified
in  any  of  the  above  groups.   W4hen  the  respective
information becomes available, they are classified as
appropriate.
2.3   New irrigation sub-projects or those already started, to support
the introduction of technology on rainfed land or modernize the
existing irrigation districts.
a. For  their  inclusion  in  the  model:    That  they  have  the
corresponding overview, prefeasibility or feasibility study
(technical,   agronomic,   economic,   financial,   legal   and
environmental), the corresponding Certificate of Environmental
Impact and their respective environmental classification,
according to the categories described in point 2.1.
b.  To use the resources of the PIRD
- All the new medium-scale irrigation sub-projects must have,
in all cases of this type, the application and execution
agreement with the future beneficiaries.
- Financial feasibility at the sub-project level.
-  Socio-economic feasibility:   IRR equal to or higher than
12%, calculated on the basis of economic (or efficiency)
prices rather than financial (or market) prices.   In the
case of major irrigation, both the selection of crops as
well as yields must be based on specific area, rather than
regional. agronomic parameters,  as would be the case for
minor irrigation. For Appendix I-C sub-projects which are
already started, feasibility studies and designs must have
been previously updated. Despite this, the studies for any
sub-project, whether or not in Appendix I-C, will be updated
when it is classified in environmental Groups 1 or 2,
providing that investments corresponding to the mitigating
measures so justify.
- Executive Designs, including the drainage system and works
which mitigate the environmental impact, if applicable. To
guarantee the feasibility of physical execution of the sub-
project, in accordance with fluctuations in the proposed
budget and schedules, the Executive Designs should be
completed before the bidding procedure, in accordance with
dates agreed upon by the Banks.   The Executive Designs
should comply with the manuals and technical design models
of the CNA and those approved by the Banks.
- In the case of major dam irrigation sub-projects designed to
supply water for other purposes and/or areas, these purposes
should  be  included  as  an  integral  part  of  their
juetification.

APPENDIX I-A
GUIDELINES FOR THE 1991-1994 TIME - SLICE INVESTMENT PROGRAM
1.    No sub-projects with an IERR less than 12% are allowed and no a
priori model constraints on resource allocation to rehabilitation
and modernization sub-projects are allowed.
2.    The decrease in the total present value of net economic benefit
(PVNEB) of the 1991-1994 Irrigation and Drainage Investment Program
iue to any cause, including social consideration (n=0.5)   should
not be greater than 15%, as compared to the PVNEB of said Program
under pure economic efficiency criteria (n-O.O).
3.    Certain sub-projects not meeting the economic efficiency criteria
may be included in the investment program due to social
considerations, but should not represent more than 3% of total
investment of the Normal Irrigation and Drainage Program (that
which is included in the programming model).
4.    The Investment Program should include annual amounts for additional
rehabilitation of irrigation districts and for environmental
mitigation measures.   The first should be enough to support the
goals of the agreed transference program included in Annex V of the
SAR, and the second should be at least 3% of tne investment for
major irrigation,  and at least 2% of both minor irrigation and
rehabilitation investments.  These amounts will be included in the
programming model as the feasibility and environmental studies are
completed.
5.    For  both  the  rehabilitation  and  the  safety  of  hydraulic
infrastructure programs, the first two years only of the time slice
includes a lump sum to finance the minimum requirements for
deferred maintenance. These sums are to be allocated according to
the criteria stated in the Operating Regulations.
6.    To be included in the time - slice financing,  all investments
should meet the technical, agronomic. economic, environmental and
other criteria included in the Operating Regulations.

APPENDIX I-B
METHODOLOGY OF INVESTMENT PROGRAMMING
The programming methodology is based principally on the Resource
Allocation Model through which Program sub-projects are selected,
including the annual allocation of investments.
I.    The Resource Allocation Model (Annual)
1.  Theoretical Basis and Scope of the Model
1.1   As concerns its theoretical basis,  the mathematical programming
model used outlines the optimization problem based on an integer-
programming approach, adapted for PC use. Conceptually, the model
is relatively simple. It attempts to identify the best combination
of sub-projects that fits annual budgetary limits established by
the programming horizon (15 years in this case).   Although the
financing could cover a lesser period, as in the four-year time
slice case, programming demands a larger horizon, taking into
account levels of anticipated resources, both from external and
national budgetary sources, and varying execution schedules, both
inormal" and slower, according to the characteristics of each sub-
prcoject.
1.2   The first step is the comparison of costs, expressed in present
value (discounted 12S), with the respective sub-project benefits,
to prove that they meet the minimum criteria (IRR of 12Z) before
being considered for the model, where each sub-project is evaluated
for its possible inclusion in the "optimum" group of sub-projects.
Jp to three execution schedules are considered for this purpose.
1.3   As to the sunk costs of sub-projects in execution, the accepted
procedure of considering only investments still outstanding are
followed.   In these cases, neither the costs incurred nor their
respective benefits are taken into consideration as the latter are
attributable to the "without sub-project" situation in cases of
sub-projects  already  in  execution.        The  ensuing  analysis,
therefore, is designed to evaluate the impact of the investments
not yet made, starting in 1991.
1.4   The following step, prior to the optimization process,  is the
incorporation in the analysis of a factor which reflects the object
of income distribution.   Said factor, which will be explained in
detail further on, is applied to the restated income generated by
each sub-project, based on the relative income level of the
affected population. This results in a corresponding adjustment in
the flow of net benefits, compared with the "pure" situation, or
indifferent to income distribution.



- 73 -
ANNEX I
APPENDIX I-B
Page 21 of 58
1.5   The objective function of the model, therefore, which is maximized,
consiets of the sum of the net present value of the net benefits
(NPVB, discounted 12X for the ycar 1991) attributable to program
investments, calculated in li- - of an "average equalizing
tendency" for income distribution. It is noted that any adjustment
of this nature has the sole effect of selecting a different group
of sub-projects, under different parameters used to define another
alternative concept of the "optimum" program - in this case that
which coincides with the policies adopted by the CNA for the sub-
sector.   The same basic criteria remain valid - that all sub-
projects are feasible according to traditional economic, technical
and financial criteria, since these are applied beforehand, prior
to application of the model.  As explained later, the system and
the model are sufficiently flexible to enable the result of the
programming exercise to be verified later against the basic
version, without the use of benefit and/or cost adjustment or
restated parameters.
II.   Basic Information and Parameters Used by the Model
2.1   The above-described process is based on the series of specific
studies traditionally prepared for each sub-project in the complete
sub-project portfolio.
2.2   This information is used to calculate the basic indicators (IRR,
NPV, number of beneficiaries and their income, etc.). The latter,
together with the economic cost of investment (adjusted for
accounting prices), constitute the main input of the model, the
basis for objective comparison of sub-projects of different typee,
sizes and geographic location.
2.3   The methodology of sub-project selection is only one part of the
process, which consists of: (1) the identification and evaluation
of sub-projects; (2) the programming of investments at the level of
the program as a whole and of the individual sub-project; (3) the
execution of the physical sub-projects and their entry into
operation as irrigation and drainage systems; and finally (4) the
group of activities necessary to achieve agricultural production,
or final objective.
2.4   Under the Operating Regulations of the Program, the criteria and
the successive steps which each sub-project must fulfill to be
considered for eventual inclusion in the model are established
first. Later, the scenarios corresponding to the three alternative
modes of execution (normal, and two "deferred") are established for
each sub-project.   Each mode of execution is expressed as an
investment schedule which, together with the corresponding flow of
benefits, constitute the main inputs of the integer programming
model. Finally, said model then identifies the package of sub-
projects which best satisfies the economic conditions, maximizing
the net present benefit value, in line with the indicated
parameters, within current financial restrictions.



- 74 -                           ANNEX I
APPENDIX I-B
Page 22 of 58
2.5   The parameters are of three basic types:
1. Economic, including the adjustments of costs and prices to
efficiency values which reflect the opportunity cost of the
principal factors of production and .'nputs, as well as the
rates of exchange for the national currency;
2. Agronomic, including patterns, yield, technological packages.
market prices of the products, unit costs of inputs and the
rate of incorporation of beneficiaries and benefits (crop plans
and yield increments).
3. The distribution of income, through the previously-mentioned
adjustment factor.
2.6   The distribution at;pect is included in the analysis in an objective
fashion through the utility of marginal income, calculated as a
function of the actual incomes of the groups affected by each sub-
project.  It is applied uniformly to all sub-projects by selecting
a constant value for the parameter which reflects the preference of
the government for a more equitable distribution of income. 1/
2.7   The value selected by the government of Mexico for this parameter
is n=O.5, considered by the government as an "average" income
distribution tendency.  It is applied to each sub-project by means
of information on the socio-economic characteristics of the
beneficiary population, divided between farmers and workers.
i/    The utility of Marginal Income Function is applied within the model
after  a  subset  of  feasible  projects  has  been  selected  under
conditions of "pure" economic efficiency in order to restate the
net benefits. The objective is to select an optimum set of projects
from the income distribution point of view. The following function
is applied for each individual project to the flow of incremental
income of the three groups,  to wit,  farmers, workers  and the
government  itself,  adopting  the  hypothesis  that  the  average
recipient of public funds is a person who receives the equivalent
of two minimal annual salaries:
(UTILITY OF MARGINAL INCOME) -  (GROUP INCOME LEVEL/AVERAGE
NATIONAL INCOME)-n
PG {Yi/Ym)-n
where P   =  Utility of marginal income of project
Yi u Income level of project group i
Ym - Average national income
n   - Distribution preference parameter, Ocncl.5

III.  Restrictions and Exceptions to the Model
3.1   Due to the limitations of any qualitative methodology applied in a
political-economic context, there exists a need to impose certain
restrictions which are dictated by national policies, as well as by
the Banks. There also exist exceptions, for the same reasons.
Cost variations may occur in the sub-projects selected by the
optimization model (described in Appendix I-B of this Annex) as a
consequence of including environmental mitigation measures; in the
bidding process or during the annual revision of the Investment
Program.  If these variations amount to more than 20% of the sub-
project costs used in the Investment Program agreed with the Banks,
such sub-projects should be re-evaluated and re-programmed by the
model so that their proper place in the In-vestment Program is found
in accordance with their revised parameters.
3.2   The principal exception admitted within the system refers to the
continuation of certain sub-projects, most of them major irrigation
sub-projects.   All have been evaluated as feasible but are not
necessarily included in the "optimum" set and, mainly because of
their size. tend to exclude various minor sub-projects which are
more economical. The total suspension of some sub-projects in full
construction is considered difficult in that it could create
technical, legal and socio-political implications of relative
importance in view the strategic importance of the works for social
and economic development, under present contractual conditions.
For those sub-projects which should not be totally halted,
therefore, the rate of investment has been reduced to the
respective levels of commitment.  This scenario has been labelleid
"restricted."
3.3   Apart  from the budgetary projections which constitute  the key
restriction of the model, various types of limitations were
established for exogenous adjustments, regardless of source. First,
in the interest of avoiding distortions in the basic objective oi
justifying the investment, agreement in principle was reached on
the need to limit the global impact that said adjustments might
have on the Program results.   To this end, a key provision was
introduced into the methodology, both for purposes of analysis and
for later execution of the program, which permits the comparison of
the results with different sets of parameters. In principle a run
of the model containing all the exceptions of the "restricted"
scenario, as well as the income distribution factor (n=0.5), is
compored to the basic "unrestricted" scenario, referring to the



- 76 -
ANNEX I
APPENDIX I-B
Page 24 of 58
absence  of  exceptionsZ/  and  of  "pure"  efficiency without  any
adjustment in the benefits (n=O).
3.4   As per the guidelines contained in the Operating Regulations of the
Program, under no circumstance, including the application of this
or    another  adjustment  factor,  may  the  total  net  benefits.
expressed as net present value (NPBN at 12Z) and calculated with
n=O, be less than 152, compared with the NPBN corresponding to the
package of sub-projects selected with n=O. SJ
IV.   Updating of the Program
4.1   The Program will be reviewed annually, from the point of view of
its execution and of the work plan for the coming year as well as
from the point of view of updating the medium- and long-term
investment program. To this end, the most recent price projections
and new data generated as progress is made in the execution of the
sub-projects and studies will be incorporated into the programming
system while new sub-projects will be incorporated into the
portfolio ander analysis.   In this last category are located the
rehabilitation sub-projects which, for whatever reason, have not
been included in the basic program.
4.2   As part of the updating of the investment selection model, CNA will
define, by no later than April 1, 1992, a methodology and sources
of data for the calculation of shadow pricing for unskilled labor.
that is acceptable to the Banks. By August 1, 1992, CNA will have
determined and communicated to the Banks the shadow price for
unskilled labor to be used in the 1992 exercise of the investment
selection model (for determining CNA's 1993 irrigation and drainage
investment portfolio), in a manner consistent with the agreed
methodology and data sources.
ZJ    As per agreement with the CNA,  the analytical concept of the
formulation of "UNRESTRICTED" alternatives is due exclusively to
the need to have a referernie to measure the effect of the
restrictions imposed on the respective scenario.
3/    In order to base the comparison on constant conditions of economic
efficiency, this comparison is achieved by readjusting the
parameter (n) to zero to calculate the NPBN of the set of projects
already selected with n-0.5, and comparing this with the NPBN of
the basic package selected with nO.

CONT1ROL AND MONITORING
I.    Monitoring and SuDervisioTn Mechanism
1.1   CNA will develop a new integrated system of planning, programming
and monitoring of its operations which, together with the
Investment Selection Model, will provide the information needed to
program and execute Program investments.   The Annual Investment
Operating Program (POAI) is the instrument through which control
will be exercised over measures which the program seek to establish
to help resolve the main problems existing in the public irrigation
and drainage sub-sectors as well as to oversee compliance with the
technical criteria outlined in the present Operating Regulations.
This set of regulations and the POAI are complementary in this
respect and together constitute the operating mechanism for
monitoring the Program.
1.2   The monitoring and ex-post evaluation system, also under way, will
contain more detailed information which is designed for different
purposes and is thus better suited to socio-economic aspects than
the POAI.   Both systems will be implemented in parallel and one
will feed the other.
II.   InsDection and Supervision
2.1   The inspection and supervision of the Program will be done jointly
by the World Bank and the IDB. The World Bank will make inspection
visits every  four months  from headquarters.   The  IDB will do
likewise through its field office in Mexico.   In addition to
regular field office supervision, an annual tripartite inspection
(IDB/IBRD/CNA) of the investment program in progress and the work
plan for the following year has been proposed.   On the basis of
ttklis review, pertinent measures will be adopted to complete program
goals for the next year. This task will be facilitated by the POAI
and by the Programming Model runs samples with updated information
on the budget and of individual sub-projects.
III. Ex-Post Evaluation of the Program
3.1   The system to be applied is based on the document "Monitoring and
Ongoing and Ex-Post Evaluation of Irrigation and Drainage Projects"
of March 1991 presented to the Bank by CNA. This document contains
all the ex-ante type information which will serve as a comparison
in the ex-post evaluation. On the other hand, it will be fed by
the present computerized system called "Physical and Financial
Monitoring of Projects" (SEPROFF) with physical and financial
information required for monitoring.

3.2   The ex-post evaluation will be based on a stratified sample of
completed sub-projects. although in the case of major irrigation
all sub-projects will be evaluated.

PLANNING AND MONITORING SYSTEM
I.    INTRODUCTION
1.1   The process of planning and monitoring of the Project "Time Slice"
will be conducted by means of a Planning and Monitoring System
(SPS) designed to guarantee accomplishment of the objectives of
irrigation and drainage policy and decentralized CNA management.
SPS  is  essentially  a  management   system  that  will  permit
coordination of the activities performed by the various CNA areas
in carrying out the irrigation and drainage program--specifically,
execution of the "time slice" program.
1.2   Implementation of the SPS will be based on existing CNA information
systems, although they will need to be adapted and expanded to
cover all of the activities required to carry out the project, from
the start of action until it is fully implemented. This includes
both investment activities and others that require no expenditures
but are an integral part of the series of measures for attaining
certain objectives.  In its  final stage of development, SPS will
address full automation of the comprehensive information system for
management of the project, which will be operating in decentralized
fashion,  making  optimal  use  of  the  computer  equipment  to  be
installed by CNA.
1.3   This annex covers nine basic points of the SPS, which have been
agreed on with CNA pursuant to the terms of reference stipulated in
advance by the banks. Those points are: i) system objectives; ii)
basic concepts and definitions; iii) the linkage between the
project and the nature of the investments; iv) structure of the
system; v) responsibilities of CNA offices; vi) information needs
and periodicity of the reports; vii) work program for initial
development of the system; viii) implementation of the system; and
ix) reccmmendations for monitoring of the work program.
1. System Objectives
1.4   The objectives set for the SPS may be summarized as follows:
a. Coordinate all project components
b.  Establish the efficiency,  efficacy, and congruence of each
component in the context of the project's goals and objectives
c. Take account of the project's financial and nonfinancial
activities
d. Provide all managerial levels of the project with the necessary
information
e. Support the policy of general decentralization of CNA

f. Ensure a connection between the various stages of the project's
management pro,ess
g. Establish a clear assessment of the advances achieved in
execution of the project
h. Identify any interruptions or problems that have arisen and the
way they were handled or resolved
i.  Assess  the  results  and  present  alternatives  that  might
accelerate the execution process
2. Basic Concepts and Definitions
1.5   The SPS embodies the following concepts and definitions:
a. All phases of the management process must be covered, from
definition of the sub-projects that will be implemented to
identification of the results achieved thereby.
b. The system of individual project management will be followed,
viewing each as a structured series of variegated activities
all of which are designed to arrive at specific goals and
results.
c. The program will be d4vided into specific sub-projects. All of
the activities necessary to attain the corresponding goals and
results will be identified for each sub-project, and the
activities will be performed directly by CNA professionals, or
under contracts with companies or suppliers of goods and
.services.
d. Determination of the sub-projects to be executed will be based
on economic and social analysis procedures that take into
account the sub-projects' market and shadow prices, inputs, and
the cropping and agricultural activity parameters in order to
estimate, the flows of benefits generated by implementation of
the sub-projects. The economic analysis will include the cost
of any environmental protection measures that may be necessary.
e. Determination of the activities to be performed each year will
be based on the economic analysis of the sub-projects and the
resources allocated to each. Each individual activity will be
determined by the ranking of the sub-projects and the funding
assigned them.
f. The monitoring will note monthly progress; identification of
the causes of any delays incurred; and adoption of decisions at
each of the various management levels in re&ard to the goals
set in the annual work programs as well as. in a cumulative
approach to the project's global goals.
g. Evaluation of the results will address che impact of the
activities conducted in the period resquired for their



- 84 -                          ANNEX I
APPENDIX III-A
Page 32 of 58
.ompletion. identifying the solutions to execution problems and
making adjustments in the application of strategies, the
distribution of resources, the design of sub-projects, and the
support measures needed.
h. The ex post evaluation sutarizes the steps taken after
completing the investment in a comprehensive review of the
experience acquired and a definition of the impact produced by
the sub-projects and the project in general. This will be the
basis for future formulation of subsequent stages and new sub-
projects and for the design standards and rules. It covers the
economic,    physical,    financial,    productive,    social,
institutional, and environmental factors and the impact they
produce.
i. The implementation of different types of activities determines
the need for adopting very specific execution, analysis, and
monitoring  processes.    It  is  nevertheless  necessary  and
expedient to follow procedures that guarantee the linkages
between  components   and   sub-projects  with   the  use  of
integration, analysis, and control points.
j. Responsibility for compiling the reports on data acquisition
will lie with the heads of the executing units, who must be
approved by the state managers.  Those reports must therefore
include the names of the persons responsible and the date when
they were prepared.
3. Linkaze between Sub-Projects and Investment Categories
1.6   To ensure the integration of activities, either by sub-project or
according to the different technical features of each activity, the
following categories have been established for homogeneous analysis
thereof.

_     Technical assistance. agricultural extension and research          A
1.7   Each of the categories also includes the entire process of public
bidding and contract award, if applicable.
1.8   It  is  assumed  that  all  of  the  necessary  activities  will  be
identified for accomplishment of each sub-project's goals and
objectives,  and the specific nature of each activity   will be
clearly defined.   This will provide a global view of the sub-
projects and all of the associated activities, at the same time
identifying all activities in the same category and thus ensuring
control and supervision of the analogous content thereof.   The
activities will also be supervised according to their nature, and
participation of the central administration management offices in
the programming, monitoring, and evaluation processes will be
ensured.
4. Structure of the System
1.9   Based on a broadly defined concept of project management, the SPS
covers all of the stages in the management process, from the time
the sub-projects to be executed are defined to identification of
the results achieved and evaluation of their impact as compared
with the objectives and goals originally set for the irrigation and
drainage program.
1.10 To meet all of the needs and operate in accordance with the
concepts described, the system uses the structure described in
Appendix 1--which also indicates the flows of decision and data,
the logical sequence of steps in the flow chart, and the feedback
considered essential to guarantee the efficacy of the management
process.



- 86-                           ANNEX I
APPENDIX III-A
Page 34 of 58
1.11  The system addresses the following functions:
a.  pluriannual programming
b.  annual programming
c.  execution of the annual program
d.  accounting period
e. monitoring
f.  evaluation of results
1.12  Thus conceived, the management process calls for intervention at
the different managerial levels in various CNA areas to establish a
two-way flow of information:
a.  Vertically, from the level of a specific sub-project to the
central level and vice versa
b.  Horizontally, between the different CNA functional areas that
play a part in project execution and in operation of the
managerial process (hydroagricultural infrastructure, planning
and finance, administration, audit, research and technological
development, etc.)
1.13 Implementation of the SPS seeks, on the one hand, to make this
relationship between functional and management levels explicit;
and, on the other, to define and coordinate the flows of
information required in order for the process to work properly.
5.  ResRonsibilitv of CNA Offices
1.14 The time slice project will be organized in components which will
in turn be structured in sub-projects, each of which will define
the  activities  needed  to  obtain  the  desired  results.    The
individual activities may or may not have a financial cost, and
they may be carried out directly by the CRA or under contracts with
third parties.
1.15 Each of the SPS functions noted above will be accompanied by
different indications that ensure complementarity of the general
responsibilities among the CNA offices.  It should be noted that
the regional management offices or the administrative units of the
central administration having a level of responsibility for sub-
project coordination analogous to that of the state management
offices could be involved in the components of institutional
development, environmental activities, studies, designs, and
consulting services.
1.16 Hence it is established that the design and implementation of the
SPS will take into account four levels of responsibility:
1.17  General Coordination of the Proiect will be the responsibility of
the central level--specifically, the General Sub-Directorate of
Hydroagricultural Infrastructure, through its recently created



- 87 -                           ANNEX I
APPENDIX III-A
Page 35 of 58
Investment Programming Office, which it will equip to ensure the
horizontal and vertical, internal and external coordination
required by the project management process.
1.18  Regional Supervision of the Prolect will be carried out by CNA
regional offices, primarily to strengthen the technical support and
supervision functions at the state level but also to support the
integration tasks required by the various functions of the
management process.
1.19  The Project Management Office will be rosponsible for managing the
sub-projects comprising the various components of the time slice
project. CNA state management offices will usually be the ones to
assume this role, pursuant to the decentralization policies. It is
nevertheless anticipated that in some cases this responsibility
might be delegated to the regional management offices or to one of
those at the central level.
1.20  The Executing Unit will be responsible for carrying out any of the
activities that are part of a sub-project, and it will keep the
project management office apprised of the progress and results
obtained.
6. Information Reguirements and Periodicitv of Reports
1.21  Examples of reports consideredI to be important for execution and
linkage of each stage of the SPS will be provided.   Two basic
principles have been established as guidelines for the final
reports:
a. The SPS is a system for global management of the project.
Hence the system will include the internal reports used by the
various CNA management levels as well as the reports to the
Banks.   No parallel informazics systems will be set up for
management of the project, so transmittal of the same data to
CNA and the Banks is guaranteed.
b. The formats prepared by the Banks contain the information
considered necessary for monitoring the programming and follow-
up process.   The structure for presenting the   information
(and, consequently, the designs of those formats) will be
flexible to allow CNA to present it in the manner most
compatible with the systems now being used.
1.22 Periodic reports on each function in the process will be presented
by CNA to the Banks.

8.   Iiglementation of the System
1.24  Hardware:   CNA has an information program that has allowed it-
depending on the availability of funds--to increase the use of PC-
type computers with a view to more efficient performance of its
activities. The program is set up to allow changes in the systems



- 89 -                           ANNEX I
APPENDIX III-A
Page 37 of 58
for networking to make optimal use of the equipment available.
Development of the SPS will of course require incorporation of the
additional computing needs in the informatics program, although the
existing program might well permit immediate installation of the
SPS and its information'system at all levels.
1.25  Software:  Most of the information systems cited in the previous
paragraph are designed for PC computers, using data bases that are
compatible with each other, so that interfacing is relatively
simple.   The developments anticipated in this area will improve
that concept and facilitate the shift from systems for a single
user to a multiple-user system.
1.26  It  is  recognized,  however,  that  in  some  areas  (Irrigation
Districts, for example) the information systems are still operated
manually.   It is here that the greatest  programming and data
acquisition efforts must be made to achieve at least a minimal
level of automation to speed up the annual and pluriannual
programming processes to be implemented in the near future.
1.27  To put the system into effect,  it is deemed essential to have
support units at the state level to create conditions for better
performance by the state managers.   But no administrative units
have yet been set up at that level to perform such tasks.
Accordingly, it has been agreed that CNA should be given the
necessary resources to:
a.   Establish suitable administrative units  for support to the
managers, either by creating new units or by assigning that
task to existing ones; and
b.   Promote the training of personnel in the procedures required by
the SPS, to which end the following are required:
i) Request the IMTA to address the growing need for training
professional   staff  to  use  microcomputers,   followed  by
instruction in the special features of the SPS;
ii) Ask the state managers to assign the necessary personnel for
training in the future operation of the SPS.

OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
I.    Operation and Maintenance Activities
1.1   The operation and maintenance activities to which the Operating
Regulations refer are:
-   The operation of the irrigation districts includes the works
and activities which are carried out to plan the use of the
assigned water, to operate the hydraulic infrastructure of the
district, and to program, transport and distribute the water
from its sources of supply to the holdings of the various
users.
-   Together with the above, operation of the district irrigation
areas, control of the register of users, conditioning of works
for water control and management, setting and collection of
irrigation rates, control of the results of the irrigation
plans and agricultural production program, generation of
hydrometric and agricultural statistics.
-   Irrigation and drainage engineering activities and technical
assistance for users.
1.2   The maintenance works include the conservation of:
-   Distribution network
-   Drainage network
-   Road network
-   Structures
-   Buildings
-   District machinery and equipment
1.3   These activities will be carried out in accordance with the manuals
and instruction established by the CNA.
1.4   In similar fashion, planning of normal maintenance activities will
be done annually in accordance with procedures established by the
CNA.
II.   Irriaation Rates
2.1   The irrigation rates are the payments that the users must make
periodically for irrigation and other services provided by the CRA
through  the  existing  infrastructure  in  the  district.         The
fundamental objective of the rates is that they be sufficient to
cover normal operation and maintenance costs established in the
district to supply said services.

APPENDIX IV
Page 44 of 58
2.2   Accordingly, the calc-lation of the rates will be based on a study
that will have to be prepared in advance of every farming year,
taking into consideration data of the Irrigation and Cultivations
Plan, areas and water requirements which must correspond to the
hydraulic availability of the sources of supply.
1. Irrigation Districts managed by the CNA (perioa of transition
before being turned over to users)
2.3   The function of determining, approving and applying the user rates
will be based on the legal aspects of the Federal Water Law, the
Federal Agrarian Reform Law and the Federal Rates Law.
2.4   For districts managed by the CNA, that part of the Federal Rates
Law that refers to the Irrigation Districts establishes the
percentage of budgetary self-sufficiency required of each district
in accordance with its total surface and the average holding of
each user, which is specified for each group of districts and by
irrigation districts.
2.5   After   the   district   determines   water   requirements   and
availabilities, the cost of the operation and maintenance of the
works is calculated.   The rates will be determined by dividing
total expenses by the physical areas to be planted, irrigation-
hectares or net average volumes to be turned over to the producers,
thus obtaining a rate per season or farming year. Said rates will
be adjuated periodically to reflect inflation.
2.6   The study of irrigation rates will be carried out by the Office of
the Chief of Operations of each irrigation district, which will
permit it - during the transition period before delivery to the
users - to be submitted for discussion and approval to the District
Technical Irrigation Suacommittee, and duly noted and recorded;
later the Committee of Directors of the Rural Development District
will convene to formally approve the rate.
2.7   The enactment of the new user rates can be accomplished following
Committee approval - or before if authorized by the retroactivity
provisions which should be included in each resolution.
2.8   To satisfy the provisions of the Federal Rates Law, the irrigation
dist-iots should receive the authorization of the Ministry of the
areasury and Public Credit to collect the rates.   The request to
the ministry for authorization to collect the rates is handled by
the State Directorates and the Offices of the Chiefs of Irrigation
Districts of CNA.   Each district should annex the request and a
copy of the resolution approving of the corresponding tariff.

2.  Districts that Msy Be Transferred to the Users:
2.9   As is the case of Districts that are not transferred to usere, the
O&hM water rate assessment for transferred Districts will be based
on the budget requiremetts for operation, maintenance and normal
administration of the District (at all levels), as well as the
water demand and availability according to the annual irrigation
plan (plan de riegos).
2.10  The water taiiff/rate that the user will pay will be composed of
two parts:   (i)  the Water Users' Association  (WUA)  share and
(ii) the National Water Commission (CIA) share.
- The first reflects the fees to cover the costs of operation and
maintenance of the minor network of canals and other
infrastructure located in the module (m6dulo de transferencia).
- The second reflects the fee for bulk water supply and is
related to the total costs of operation, maintenance and
administration of the headworks (major networks of canals and
drains  which  serve  not  only  the  module),  irrigation  and
drainage technical assistance as well as supervision done by
CNA.
2.11  The  first  art  of  the  fee which  corresponds  to  the WUA  is
established by the WUA itself and authorized by CIA.  The second
vart which corresponds to the bulk water supply is regulated by the
Ley Federal de Derechos. CNA, with the WUAs, determines the fee.
The CIA office of Gerencia de Distritoo de Reigo then submits the
request to the Secretaria de Hacienda y Credito Publico (SHCP) for
approval.
Each user will pay the fee, based on the crops he grows, to the WUA
which will retain its portion and will pay CIA for the volume of
water that has been supplied in bulk.

APPENDIX V
AGREEMENTS
Agreements will be entered into with the following institutions for the
purposes indicated:
SEDUE:      irovision of adequate resources and agreement on
sub-project evaluption criteria
NAFIN:      Transferring the loan proceeds
The agreement between SEDUE-SARH-CNA is attached. This agreement will be
the base for the contract between these organizations.
GUIDELINES FOR SEDUE-SARH-CNA COORDINATION
The present document contains the technical proposal to define the
guidelines for coordination between SEDUE and CNA, so that the latter may
comply in a timely fashion with the provisions of the General Law of
Ecological Balance and Environmental Protection and its Regulation on
Environmental Impact, together with the orientation and specific features
for hydraulic infrastructure sub-projects which SEDUE may issue.
GUIDELINES FOR NEW SUB-PROJECTS
1.    CNA will prepare and present to SEDUE the sample of hydraulic
infrastructure sub-projects which it is charged with programming
and/or carrying out and that are not exempted from division II of
article 5 of the Regulation of the General Law of Ecological.
Balance and Environmental Protection as it concerns environmental
impact.
This sample will be reviewed and once approved by the SEDUE will be
used as a basis so that the sub-projects later established in it
adhere to the legal provisions pertaining to environmental impact.
Once the sample of sub-projects is approved, it may be expanded
when one of the parties gains knowledge of new types of hydraulic
infrastructure sub-projects not included in the approved sample.
To this end, the parties are obliged to make known these new types
of sub-projects not included in the original sample. Any additions
will be carried out by SEDUE after seeking the technical advice of
CNA.
2.    SEDUE and CNA will jointly prepare the technical criteria that the
CNA will apply in order to propose to SEDUE the type of statements
of environmental impact that it will present for each sub-project
contained in the portfolio referred to in guideline 3. Said



- 99 -                          ANNEX:
APPENDIX V
Page 47 of 58
proposal will be contained in the internal report on environmental
impact that CNA may prepare, as indicated in guideline 4, clause
(f).
As a precaution against particular cases or exceptions, the CNA's
proposal of the type of statements of environmental impact that it
is present may be modified by SEDUE when it lo wishes, within its
areas of competence.
The parties agree that the technical criteria will form part of
these guidelines for coordination, once SEDUE approves them.
3.    Once the sample of sub-projects and the technical criteria referred
to in guideline 3 are approved by SEDUE, CNA will present the
annual portfolio of sub-projects that it plans to carry out so that
SEDUE may determine the type of statqment of environmental impact
that CNA will present for each sub-project.
Due to the intervention of federal, state and municipal authorities
in the programming of the hydraulic infrastructure sub-projects for
water supply to urban centers, these are exempted from presentation
in the annual sub-projact portfolio.
In order to arrange for environmental impact authorization, the
sub-projects referred to in the previous paragraph will be present
to SEDUE by CNA, individually or collectively, once the latter
issues its internal report on environmental impact. In this case,
CNA will observe the provisions of the General Law of Ecological
Balance and Environmental Protection in order to comply with the
resolution on environmental impact which SEDUE issues, prior to
start of the projected works.
4.    The portfolio of sub-projects referred to in the previous clause
will contain, at minimum, the following information for each sub-
project.
a. Name of sub-project.
b. Projected works, including their description, stages and
probable dates of start and completion.
c. Location and area, in an adequate scale plan.
d. Plans for soil use in sub-project zone.
e. Amount of investment.
f.  CNA internal report on environment.
5.    SEDUE will review the sub-project portfolio that CRA will present
and will determine if its presentation satisfies the requirements



- 100 -                             x   I
APPENDIX V
Page 48 of 58
for information established in the previous base and within 15
working days after receipt of the portfolio will notify CNA.
a.  The type of ststement of environmental impact for those sub-
projects that fulfill the information required in guideline 4.
b. The information requirement needed to fulfill the terms of
guideline 4.  Once the pertinent information is presented by
CNA, SEDUE will proceed -.s indicated in the first paragraph of
this guideline and in th, previous paragraph.
If after the type of statement of envilonmental impact has been
stipulated by SEDUE extraordinary circumstances should arise which
indicate the need to modify the type, SEDUE will announce the new
type required within 30 working days of the corresponding
notification of CNA.
6.    CNA will prepare and present the statement of environmental impact
at the appropriate time and with the appropriate technical content,
prior to the start of the projected works and considering that
these can only be started until SEDUE issues a favorable
environmental impact resolution.  Said resolution would be issued
by SEDUE once it receives the statement of environmental impact to
its satisfaction. within the following time periods.
a. Thirty working days. when a general type is involved.
b. Forty-five wiorking days when an intermediate type is involved.
c. Sixty working days when a specific type is involved.
7.    Instructions to prepare the preventive report and the statement of
environmental impact for hydraulic infrastructure sub-projects will
be issued by SEDUE, after having obtained the opinion of the CNA
concerning its contents.
Until the instructions are issued, CNA will apply the procedures
published in ecological gazettes No. 3 and 4, corresponding to
September and November of 1989, respectively.
FOR SUB-PROJECTS WITH WORKS ALREADY STARTED
8.    So that SEDUE may determine the way to proceed on those hydraulic
infrastructure sub-projects which are already constructed or under
construction by CRA, the latter will outline the sub-projects in
that category. Said outline will irJicate for each sub-project:
a. Name of the sub-project.
b. Description of the works already carried out and the stage of
completion.



- 101 -                          ANNEX I
APPENDIX V
Page 49 of 58
c. Date of start of the works.
d. Any environmental studies performed.
e. The internal certificate of environmental impact prepared by
CNA; if applicable.
For each of these sub-projects SEDUE will notify CNA if the
regulation  pertains,  as  well  as  its  bearing  on  applicable
legislation.
For those sub-projects on which works started after March 1, 1988,
and for which no statement of environmental impact has been
received, action will be required to ensure their conformity with
the environmental standards.
GENERAL GUIDELINES
9.    S'DUE  and  CNA  will  in  a  coordinated  fashion  determine  the
appropriate mechanisms to achieve joint supervision of the
application of activities which CNA may undertake to comply with
mitigation measures established in the resolution of environmental
impact issued by SEDUE. These mechanisms will be applicable to new
sub-projects as well as to those for which action may be required
as noted above.
10.   CNA will contract technical personnel which will be used by SEDUE
to evaluate the environmental impact statements and studies as they
relate to the hydraulic infrastructure sub-projects under the
supervision of CNA. Said personnel will report to SE1UE within 30
working days after signature of the present quidelines for
coordination, or one working day after CNA present.. f.e sub-project
portfolio referred to in guideline 3. or one day &:ter presentation
of the outline of sub-projects referred to in guideline 8--
whichever comes first. Once the technical personnel completes its
work, if agreeable to the parties, the personnel will return to
CNA.
CNA agrees that the review of the statements of environmental
impact to be carried out by the personnel mentioned in the
preceding paragraph will provide special training for said
personnel.
SEDUE and CNA agree that when the present document goes into effect
the initial number of technicians to be contracted by CNA will be 8
(eight).
11.   The content of the present document may be reviewed annually by the
parties if one of the parties so requests in writing of the other.
The review may consider additions or modifications, to be adopted
by mutual accord.

MEXICO - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE SECTOR PROJECT
REPAIRS AND ACQUISITIONS OF EQUIPMENT. MACHINERY AND INSTRUMENTS
FOR OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE IRRIGATION DISTRICTS
AND FOR USERS ASSOCIATION TRAINING
A. Maintenance Equipment and Technology
1.        This Investment Program sub-component is mainly addressed to the 21
Irrigation Districts which are in process of transfer to the Water Users'
Associations from 1991-1994.
2.        The adequate sizing of equipment with the appropriate mix of
machinery plays an important role together with technology in the efficiency
and costs of the O&M mode in the Irrigation Districts.
3.        The lack and proper use of adequate equipment for maintenance of
drains and unlined canals is a current problem in the Mexican Irrigation
Districts. The prevailing cleaning schedules are unsufficient for Mexican
conditions. The almost exclusive use of drag-lines disturbs embankments
stability and by consequence causes damages to the side slops, enlarges cross
sections, reduces the rolling strips of side service roads.   Consequently,
sediments increase, weed and vegetation growth are agravated in the unlined
canals and drains. Further adverse effects in the Districts are poor
irrigation deliveries, waterlogging and salinity build-up. These problems
cause frequent and expensive rehabilitations. A better mix of equipments with
modern, lighter, more efficient and appropriate performances as well as
updated maintenance technologies are needed in Mexico. This problem is
addressed in this component which is split into seven sub-components:
-    Heavy maintenance equipment acquisitions;
-    Heavy maintenance equipment repairs and retrofittings;
-    Light maintenance equipment acquisitions;
-    Special program for maintenance improvements;
-    Upgrading of the Districts mechanical workshops;
-    Special reclamation machinery acquisitions; and
-    Tractors for the light maintenance and reclamation equipment.
The total cost of the component is estimated in US$61 million (see Table 1).
4.        The equipment was sized and allocated to the Districts considering
technical criteria of present requirements (see Table 2). A non-structural
sub-component was outlined to pace the needs of improvement in technology and
efficiency (see Table 7).
5.        The Tables 3 and 4 give costs for the 21 and 77 Districts.  Tables
5 and 6 give details of the composition and costs estimation of each of the
other sub-components (light and reclamation equipment).
6.        Acquisition are expected to be performed through 2 or 3 packages of
ICB.

7.         This sub-component of the Investment Program is also addressed to the 21
Districts which were selected to be transferred to the Water Users' Associations
during the 1991-1994 "time-slice" period.
8.         These 21 Irrigation Districts comprise 1.98 million hectares and
represent 2/3 of the irrigated area of 3.2 million hectares in the 77 existing
Districts.
9.         Three main items are considered here in as operation equipment.  They
refer to telecommunication equipment, telemetric sensors and commands and some
volumetric water metere
10.        Since CNA is engaged in a process of selection of appropriate electronic
volumetric water meters, this sub-component is only considing the installation of a
limited number of measurement points. The total number of measurement forecasted in
the complete program would be some like 80,000 for the 77 Districts which would
include the 54,000 required for the priority 21 Districts program for 1991-1994.
11.        The complete program for the 21 Districts will be funded by the
modernization component presently under studies.
12.        The following table provides a cost estimation of the three main items
for the 21 Districts.

MEXICO - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE SECTOR PROJECT
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT
1.          The project's Institutional Development component (US$24 million)
will support the decentralization and improved performance of irrigated
agriculture, by strengthening the institutional capacity of CNA and newly
organized Users' Associations and Societies to develop and productively manage
irrigation activities. Institutional development actions were identified to
address those major capacity gaps identified in CNA and users' organizations
(para. 1.49, SAR). Actions are organized in the following five areas:
(i) developing and strengthening the capacity of Users' Organizations to
manage their systems; (ii) improving the internal management systems of CMA,
inicreasing the effectiveness of planning, monitoring, financial, and
evaluation systems; (iii) strengthening CNA's technical capacity related to
new irrigation development, rehabilitation and modernization, operation and
maintenance, transferring of districts, and environmental protection;
(iv) modifying CNA staffing patterns to increase number of professional staff,
increase specific technical skills of staff, and retrench redundant lower
level staff assigned to Irrigation District, and (v) strengthening CNA's
evaluations of irrigation system performance and the impact of investment and
transfer activities. The strategies to be employed to strengthen CNA and
Users' Organizations are identified in an Institutional Development Action
Plan, agreed during negotiations (para. 7.1 A (4) of SAR and Attachment I). A
breakdown of costs is provided in Attachment II.
2.          The major inputs financed by the project include long and short
term consulting for applied and adaptive research and technical assistance to
Users' Organizations and CNA units; approximately 350 training programs and
seminars for CNA professionals and 400 for Users' Associations; graduate
programs for 50 CNA professionals and international stidy tours.  Most of the
institutional development activities would be managed by IMTA on behalf of
CNA.  A Letter of Instruction by CNA to _T.A rexardina the latter's role in
the implementation of the Institutional Development Plan has been signed
(para. 3.33 of SAR). Planning for institutional development activities will
be part of the SPS, and will be monitored, reviewed and revised annually, to
the satisfaction of the Bank.
3.          Develoving and Stren_thening the CaDacitv of Users' Or'tnizations
to Manase Their Systems. During the past year, IMTA initiated a training
program to support the development of Users' Associations. T'his program
involves video-assisted training sessions to communicate the details of
Government's cost recovery policy and the process for transferring operation
and maintenance responsibilities to users. During the project, this effort
will be expanded to cover all 21 Districts. The program to strengthen Users'
Organizations includes: (i) training programs for Users' Organizations in
general topics regarding the process of transfer, cost recovery, and operation
and maintenance; and (ii) technical assistance to the Users' Organizations in
such priority areas as cost recovery, financial management, irrigation
scheduling, and operation and maintenance. To support this work, IDTA is

ANNEX IV
Page 2 of 4
helping to establish local and regional units within CNA that would coordinate
and provide training and technical assistance to nearby irrigation district
Users' Associations.
4.          Improving Internal Manafement Functions of CNA.  CNA has already
taken significant steps in the development of a computerized, program-based
financial management system and the decentralization of certain financial and
administrative functions. That improved system is expected to be operational
at the central level by the end of 1991 and at the state and regional levels
by 1992. As a part of this change, training in the new procedures is planned
once the system is operational. In addition, a workshop on World Bank
procurement and bidding requirements is planned for CNA staff in late 1991, to
be conducted by a World Bank procurement specialist. To address the need for
a planning and monitoring system, CNA will develop and implement the Sistema
de Programaci6n y Seguimiento (SPS--Planning and Monitoring System) (Annex I,
Appendix III-A), which includes the development of multi-year and annual plans
for each irrigation development effort at the State level. This planning
system will permit CNA to establish and monitor physical, financial, and
institutional targets. Workshops are to be held in 1991 and 1992 with State
and Irrigation District managers to assist them in developing and monitoring
the integrated work plans required by the SPS.
5.          In addition, institutional development technical assistance will
be provided to assist in the design and conduct of evaluations of irrigation
system performance and the impact of the investment and transfers. CNA will
conduct these evaluations in part by contracting assistance and in part by its
own staff.
6.          Strengthening CNA Technical Cagacitv.  CRA has well established
technical capacity in the areas of irrigation engineering design and
supervision of works. Although it is weaker in such areas as economics and
agronomy, it has been filling in many of these technical gaps through its
recruitment and professional development training program. The priority
institutional development actions which will be financed by the project to
strengthen CNA's technical capacity are related to strengthening the
implementation of existing technical procedures and the introduction of new
technology. They are in five areas.
a)    Team Planning.  Workshops will be used to assist central and field
level CNA teams to clarify new and evolving organizational roles,
responsibilities and inter-relationships, especially with regard
to the implementation of technical functions. These events are
planned to occur at the state and district levels, annually,
focusing on three key areas: (i) conduct of feasibility studies,
(ii) transfer of districts, and (iii) initial determinations of
potential environmental impact.
b)    Research and Develooment.  To support the development of
irrigation and drainage technology, a strong program of adaptive
and applied research is essential. This program is being
developed by IMTA and CNA based, in part, on the results of a



- 134 -
ANNEX IY
Page 3 of 4
review of Mexico's research needs by an IPTRID (International
Program for Technology Research ln Irrigation and Drainage) team.
That review focused on three areas: (i) irrigation modernization;
(ii) operation and maintenance; and (iii) drainage and salinity
control. The project will finance a significant portion of CNA's
research agenda, with additional financing being sought by CNA
from other donors. IMTA will also be developing and disseminating
within CNA and user organizations guidelines and manuals regarding
practices in these areas. In addition, special attention will be
given to issues such as the transfer of districts and cost
recovery, with special seminars conducted, as indicated in the
Institutional Development Action Plan, to examine CNA's experience
in these areas (see Attachment I, Section III, Technical Review
Seminars).
c)    SubRroject Review and Analysis.  Technical assistance will be
financed by the project to provide expert input on specific
issues. Subproject Review Groups will be convened by CIA to
provide input to specific projects in the areas of modernization,
rehabilitation, operations and maintenance, salinity and drainage.
These subprojects would be selected on the basis of their size,
complexity, or unusual technical or other characteristics.
Specifically the Subproject Review Groups would review designs and
implementation of rehabilitation and modernization works,
including such areas as maintenance technology and equipment,
drainage and salinity control, upgrading standards of operation,
upgrading efficiency and equity of water distribution, and
technology transfer and management strengthening of Users'
Organizations. They would include members of CIA, IMTA's
Consultivo Tecnico, and outside experts, as needed, from such
fields ast irrigation engineering, soil reclamation, drainage and
salinity, maintenance practices and machinery, automation and
water distribution, electro-mechanical engineering, environmental
protection, and management. It is estimated that up to 80 person
months of external consulting will be needed to support these
review groups.
d)    Environmental Protection.  CNA's and SEDUE's capacity to assess
and mitigate the environmental impact of projects is being
strengthened through a number of actions. They include:
(i) reorganization of the CNA Office of Water Quality (GCA) to
upgrade its environmental unit in terms of its functions and
number and skills of its staff; (ii) establishment of new
operational procedures to integrate the unit's environmental input
in CIA's project preparation cycle; (iii) establishment of
regional units to deal with environmental and resource management
issues during project design; and (iv) strengthening SEDUE's
capacity to review CNA's environmental etudies, through the



- 135 -
ANNEX IV
Page 4 of 4
addition of ten professionals dedicated to this task.-" To
ensure provision of adequate resources and coordinate criteria of
EIA evaluation, CNA and SEDUE have concluded an agreement
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 1.60, 4.16 and Annex I, Appendix
V, pp. 102-108).
7.          Staffing and Human Resource Development.  With the planned
expansion of CNA's investment program and the professional requirements for
managing the transfer of districts to users, CNA is understaffed in certain
professional areas, especially at the state and regional levels. To address
this, CNA has established an ongoing recruitment program with a rigorous,
multi-phase selection process. During 1990, CNA recruited 295 professionals,
covering a range of disciplines. Those new professionals, titled "Hydraulic
Specialists', are assigned to field operations, and receive nearly equivalent
salaries of those of high level managers. Over the next four years, CNA plans
to recruit a total of 1,300 additional professionals within this new category.
CNA's professional development program for these new professionals, managers,
and technical personnel involve an ambitious schedule of short courses, plus
short or long-term training overseas for a limited number.
8.          CNA is using central government programs to provide incentives for
redundant lower level staff to leave voluntarily. This retrenchment program
is tied directly to CNA's hiring program, as SPP allows CNA to hire one new
professional for every six staff members retrenched. For example, in 1991,
CNA estimates that at least 2400 staff will be retrenched out of a total of
28,000. As a consequence, it will be allowed to hire 400 additional
professionals.
1/ The expansion of SEDUE staff is not financed by the project.

IRRIGATION DISTRICTS TRANSFER ACTION PLAN
l.          The objective of the Irrigation Districts Transfer Action Plan is
to promote institutional changes in 21 selected Irrigation Districts (Chart
1), containing 283 irrigation modules and approximately 2 million hectares, in
order to gradually move from centrally managed Government systems towards
systems managed by local Users' Associations and which are financially self
sustainable. This Action Plan describes: (i) the two stages of the transfer
process and the specific actions to be performed in each, and (ii) the
transfer timetable.
2.          In accordance with the CNA plans, the process of transfer of
Irrigation Districts to Users Associations, will be eventually implemented in
all 77 Irrigation Districts in the country. This plan addresses 21 of the
largest Irrigation Districts in which producers were assessed by CNA to be
most ready to assume responsibility for operation and maintenance. The
transfer process will be implemented in two stages. The major activities of
Stage One are the establishment of Users' Asociaciones Civiles (Civil
Associations) in each Irrigation Module of each Irrigation District, and the
development of a Master Plan for its complete transfer and rehabilitation
and/or modernization.  Charts 2, 3, and 4 present by year and by Irrigation
District the number of Irrigation Modules to be transferred, the number of
users who will receive them, and the area in hectares covered.  The major
activity of Stage Two is the establishment of a Company of Limited
Responsibility, Public Interest and Variable Capital that includes all the
Users' Asociaciones Civiles which form part of a given Irrigation District.
This new legal entity will have under its charge the administration and
operation of the primary irrigation and drainage network, and of the
Irrigation District operation and maintenance equipment.
3.          Table 1 provides the timetable for the completion of Stages One
and Two in each of the 21 Irrigation Districts. In summary, the timetable is
as follows: six Irrigation Districts to complete Stage l in 1991; three to
complete Stage 1 and six to complete Stage 2 in 1992; four to complete Stage 1
and four to complete Stage 2 in 1993; and eight to complete Stage 1 and eleven
to complete Stage 2 in 1994.
4.          DescriRtion of Actions to be Performed in each State
A.    Stage One
i.    Users are informed of the purpose of the transfer, its scope and
procedures, and their rights and obligations. At the same time,
CNA assesses their capacity and willingness to operate, maintain
and administer the infrastructure and equipment slated for
transfer.
ii.   Organization of the users in each Irrigation Module of the
Irrigation District into a Users' Asociacion Civil.

MEXICO
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE SECTOR PROJECT
COST RECOVERY TARGETS PLAN
1. Objectives
The objectives of the Targets Plan are to achieve: (i) full O&M cost
recovery from beneficiaries in the Irrigation Districts; and (ii) partial
capital cost recovery from beneficiaries of new Sub-projects.
2. Targets for Operation and Maintenance (hereinafter O&M) Cost Recovery
For the purposes of this Targets Plan, the 77 existing Mexican
Irrigation Districts are divided into two groups: (i) 21 which are in a
process of full transference to the Users' Associations (see Table 1), and
(ii) the remaining 56 Irrigation Districts. The targets for the recovery of
normal operation and maintenance cost (as such term is defined in the
Renlamento QPerativo) are the following:
(i)   For each Irrigation District in the first group, 100 percent immediately
upon the formal execution of the arrangements on the transfer of the
respective Irrigation District.
(ii) For the remaining 56 Irrigation Districts, and any other new Irrigation
Districts that may be created, 90 percent average cost recovery for O&M
shall be achieved by 1994 (see Tables 2 and 3V). Mimimum average cost
recovery for O&M for all of CNA's Irrigation Districts combined shall be
not less than:
1991        1992         1993        1994
34%         48%          70%         90%
In 1995 and thereaftir, the minimum average cost recovery for O&M for
all districts combined shall not be less than 90 percentV.
3. Targets for Capital Cost Recovery
For this Targets Plan, all New Sub-projects are subject to capital cost
recovery including expansion Sub-projects (ampliaciones as such term is
defined in the Reglamento Operativo). The referred Sub-projects are divided
into two groups: (i) those for rehabilitation and modernization of Irrigation
Tables 2 and 3 provide estimated percentages and totals of O&M cost
recovery for individual Irrigation District.
/    By letter dated September 23, 1991, CNA has indicated that it will
attempt to achieve O&M cost recovery of 95 percent and 100 percent.

I TEXICO IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE SECTOR PROJECT
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE PROGRAM
1.   All projects being considered for the 1991-1994 Irrigation and Drainage
Investment Program have feasibility studies either recently carried out or
updated. In order to assess the quality of current project evaluation
practices at the local and central level a sample of feasibility studies
representing about US$440 million, or 35 percent of total investment in 1991-
|'       94, was reviewed in detail (Table 1).  Based on this review, recommendations
were made by the Bank for improvement of the studies.  The revised studies are
expected to serve as a basis for providing guidelines for future studies and
defining minimum standards for project preparation.  The studies are prepared
by INA's state-level units and supervised by their respective regional
offices. While the feasibility studies are generally adequate in their
technical aspects, economic analysis at the State level is generally poor as
costs and benefits are usually assessed in terms of market prices rather than
economic prices. CNA's Central Office has tried to overcome this by re-
evaluating the economic benefits and costs of each project using standard
regional assessmcats of benefits and costs, together with shadow prices.
These standard benefits and cost parameters have been estimated for 25
irrigation regions in which the country has been divided for this purpose. In
the case of feasibility studies that have been recently carried out, the
economic analysis has been done on the basis of project specific data rather
than regional parameters.  This should become the general rule during the
first year of implementation of the time-slice operation as a result of the
various actions included in the institutional strengthening component and the
improvement in the overall programming exercise.
2.     The shadow prices of tradeables are based ^n the IBRD 1989 Commodity
Prices Projections. Shadow price estimate were zaviewed on the basis of the
latest (1090) Bank commodity projections. The shadow price of unskilled labor
is put at 0.20, which seems low and would be revised upwards during the first
year of implementation. As part of the updating of the investment selection
model, CNA will define, by no later than April 1, 1992, a methodology and
sources of data for the calculation of shadow pricing for unskilled labor,
that is acceptable to the Bank. (Annex I, Operating Regulations, Appendix
I-B, para. 4.2.) The shadow price of electricity is assumed to be equal to
its marginal cost of production rather than its scarcity value which, given
the blackouts in rural areas, is likely to be higher. Net present values are
calculated for all projects using a discount rate of 12 percent throughout.
Alternative calculations were made for a range of income distribution weight,
but it was agreed that a moderate poverty bias ("n" = 0.5) would be used as
the base case for project selection.
3.    The agreed economic efficiency criteria require that any project
considered for inclusion in the investment program should have at lease a 12
percent rate of return on investment. An exception to this rule would be
allowed only for special cases and provided these represents less than 3
percent of total investment, as explained below. Under the current investment
constraints, however, not all projects with a positive net present value, or a
minimum rate of return of 12 percent, that also meet the agreed technical and



- 171 -                        ANNEX VII
Page 2 of 7
environmental selection criteria, can be executed.  The problem is solved
through a programming exercise which selects, following the agreed investment
selection criteria (Annex 1), a set of projects that maximizes, within the
expected irrigation and drainage investment budget constraints, the net
present value of all on-going and new pro'e-ts considered for the medium-term
investment plar.  Projects are ranked accotring tc their net benefit-
investment ratio, discounted at 12 percent, and then those that can make the
largest contribution, given the budgetary constrairts, are included in the
investment program. The rates of return of the projects thus selected range
between 12.5 percent to 23.0 percent, with nearly two-thirds of the projects
presenting rates of return within the range of 15 percent to 20 percent
(Table 2) and another 25 percent of the projects falling in the range of 20
percent to 25 percent rate of return. There are only 11 projects, with a
total investment cost of US$57.1 million, whose rate of return are less than
15 percent but still larger than the opportunity cost of capital. The range
of rates of return for the main categories of projects are shown in Table 3.
New modernization and rehabilitation projects do not have at the moment full
feasibility studies; these will be prepared during the first year of
implementation of the time-slice operation. However, given the importance of
rehabilitation work and the likely high returns of these types of investment,
it was agreed that during the first year of the time-slice operation funds
would be earmarked to finance initial rehabilitation works in those districts
where projects are being prepared. Starting in Year 2 of implementation of
the time-slice operation, these projects will enter the programming model and
compete with the rest of the projects for investment resources.
4.    The introduction of the poverty bias (n=0.5) into the selection of the
projects included in the investment program, results in an overall loss in the
total net present value of about 9 percent when compared to the net present
value that would have been achieved if only efficiency criteria has been
applied.

This lower net percent value, however, is further reduced by the Government
"forcing" the model to accept certain projects which, while meeting the
minimum economic criteria (i.e., an IRR of at least 12 percent), could not
gain a place in the investment program in straight competition with the rest
of the projects. The argument Zor this type of distortion is that previous
political commitments make it impossible for the Government not to execute
these projects. This type of problem, however, will disappear in future as
the programming exercise becomes fully operational. The investment program
presented by CNA to the appraisal mission contains several of these "forced"
projects which were introduced as restrictions to the programming model
(Table 4). In addition to these projects, the Government could also include
some "exception" projects which do not meet the economic efficiency criteria,
provided these would not represent more than 3 percent of the total investment
in irrigation and drainage that has been subject to the programming model. As
shown in the table below, these exceptions to the economic efficiency criteria
are well within the agreed margin, since the total investment cost of these
projects is only about US$10.3 million, or 0.8 percent of the total investment
program.

5.    The final result was a difference of 14 percent between the net present
value of CNA's proposal and that of the pure efficiency alternative (Table 4).
But this was also within the agreed criteria, which established that the
combined effect of these exceptions on the total net present value of economic
benefits of the 1991-94 Irrigation and Drainage Investment Program should not
be more than 15 percent as compared with the result of the pure economic
efficiency alternative.

MEXICO - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE SECTOR PROJECT
Environmental Rankink and Procedures
General
1.        Environmental protection in Mexico is governed by legal instruments
enacted at recently as 1988 when the Ley General del Equilibrio Ecologico y la
Proteccion al Ambiente (LGEEPA) became operational. In June of the same year
the regulatory and normative framework of the law was established. The public
sector entity responsible for enforcement of the law and its regulations is
the Secretaria de Desarrollo Urbano y Ecologia (SEDUE). The law prescribes
that all investment activities, public or private must obtain SEDUE's approval
before implementation.
2.        The approval process is triggered when the executing entity or
individual submits an Environmental Protection Report (Informs Prevert vo
Ambiental-IPA) outlining the potential impacts of the proposed activizy.
Depending on the severity of potential impacts SEDUE may require preparation
of one of four types of environmental impact assessment (see paragraph 4).
Environmental Ranking
3.        Potential for environmental impact is one of the elements includel
in the selection criteria of subprojects for the inveetment program. With
certain exceptions all subprojects would fall, for environmental purposes,
under SEDUE's ranking system. The exceptions (para.4 Group 3) include
rehabilitation subprojects and those which were constructed, or work
initiated, before enactment of the law. However, joint IBRD/IDB review of
such subprojects indicated the need to introduce mitigating measures for on-
going impacts and to prevent potential new effects. To find out what those
measures should be it was necessary firstly to rank those activities
accordingly and second to define the type of study that would be needed. CNA
agreed with IBRD and IDB to include those subprojects in the selection and
ranking criteria CNA designed for the project with SEDUE's assistance. It was
also agreed an Environmental Diagnosis (Diagnostico de Impacto Ambiental-DIA)
would be the type of study required. Both elements will be formalized in an
Operational Coordinating Agreement sI to be signed between CNA and SEDUE.
Simultaneously CNA put into effect internal environmental screening procedure. s
spelling out in detail the steps to be followed by its regional environmental
units and by the central unit at headquarters.
4.        Selection Criteria.   Four groups have been establishedt

Group 1. Subprojects to be located within biosphere reserve areas will
not be considered unaer any circumstance.
Group 2.  New subprojects and extensionslexpansion of existing systems.
According to the degree of negative impacts expected, one of
the following types (modalidades) of environmental assessment
(Manifestacion de Impacto Ambiental-MIA) may be required: a)
general (modalidad general); b) intermediate (modalidad
intermedia); and c) specific (modalidad specifica). Detailed
requirements for each appear in the selection criteria
document agreed between SEDUE and CNA 31.
Group 3.  Subprojects for which, according to the law, no environmental
impact assessment is required. For these, however, CNA may,
in agreement with or at the request of, the financing banks
commission through its Environmental Unit the preparation of
Environmental Diagnosis (Diagnostico de Impacto Ambiental -
DIA). Subprojects under this group include the following:
-    dams with a holding capacity of less than 500,00;
cubic meters;
-    isolated water wells;
-    irrigation areas less than 100 ha;
-    irrigation systems which obtain less than 101 of the
annual capacity of a natural water body; and
-    rehabilitation systems and those with at least 1O0
of its civil works already completed.
Groups 4. Subprojects for which construction of civil works was
initiated after enactment of the law but did not receive
environmental ranking from SEDUE. These would be reclassified
according to the parameters of the first three groups.
5.        Based on the above criteria subprojects within each group would
need the tollowing documents for clearance from SEDUE or from CNA's
Environmental Unit to initiate execution:
Group 1.  These subprojects would be deleted in the initial screening
carried out by CNA;
Group 2.  Preventive Report and, if required, a MIA.  Clearance from
SEDUE;
Group 3.  An Environmental Diagnosis.  Clearance from CNA's
Environmental Unit;
Group 4.  Preventive Report.  Additionally, according to the
reclassification, a MIA or a DIA. Clearance from SEDUE or
from CMA's Environmental Unit.

6.        Result of Initial Screening.  The portfolio of subprojects
initially included in the program by CNA totalled 129. After initial
screening these fell under the following groups:
Group 1.  none
Group 2.  80 out of which 47 would require Preventive Reports, and
33 need environmental impact assessments (31 general, 1
intermediate and 1 specific); and
Group 3.  49 would require Environmental Diagnosis.
7.        For the 1991-92 investment program 87 subprojects have been
proposed of which 22 already have DIA's prepared last year. For 36
subprojects no environmental assessment would be needed. For the last 29, 22
required DIA's and seven EIA's. Drafts for these were completed and reviewed
by the banks in a workshop organized by CNA and held in Mexico between June 25
and 28, 1991. Screening of subprojects to be included in the 1992-93
investment period would take place in September 1991. The same screening
procedures would be followed for the last year of the project in September
1992.
8.        For the preparation of EIA studies CNA is commissioning the work to
local consultants. At least 13 consulting firms have participated so far. The
quality of their reports, varies to large extent in the previous experience of
the team members. Results of the review workshop held in last June revealed
the main shortcoming of the reports was the lack of adequate specificity of
the mitigatory recommendations, including the absence of quantifiable
performance indicators and estimated cost of implementation. CNA's training
program should include members of local consulting firms to build up the
country's capacity to carry out EIAs.
9.        Environmental Protection and Mitigatory Measures.  Based on the
results of the environmental diagnosis prepared so far CNA classified
recommended protection/mitigatory measures in two groups 6/. The first group
corresponds to project specific measures for which CNA would be responsible
for their implement'tion. The second group includes mitigatory actions for
environmental problems that are, common to one or more regions such as those
caused by inadequate used of agrochemicals or by the use of residual waters.
Implementation of proposed remedies for these problems require intersectoral
agreement and coordination with other institutions.
10.       Given the widespread scope of impacts caused by the use of
agrochemicals and of residual waters, CNA is preparing procedural guidelines
for its staff and beneficiaries 51. Given the high cost of treating residual
waters current efforts are oriented toward the introduction of improved

agricultural practices and limiting the type of food crops that can be grown
with such waters. Regarding pesticides, several actions are being implemented
including more strict enforcement of existing legislation such as the one
prohibiting the sale of banned pesticides. However, the main focus would be
on providing adequate farm advisory service for project beneficiaries.
Coordination to address these issues with other institutions is being
channelled through the existing Intersectoral Committee (SARH, HEALTH, SECOFI
and CNA).
11.       Proeedures.  There are two sets.  The first set includes internal
steps within CNA's organization establishing communication linkages between
the Regional Environmental Units where local programming is initiated and the
corresponding central unit at headquarters. The purpose is to screen and rank
subprojects according to existing/potential impacts, and prepare for SEDUE
recommendations regarding the type of environmental analysis to be carried
out.
12.       The second set corresponds to procedures agreed with SEDUE for its
teview and opinion of CNA's initial recommendations, and for its analysis and
clearance of EIAS's requested. Attachment 1 shows the path of procedures,
communication flow and the service standards agreed for each step. These
procedures form the basis for the coordination agreement signed between SEDUE
and CNA.
Institutional Strengthening
13.       To carry out the environmental protection role the project would
support CNA's plans to upgrade its environmental unit at headquarters and to
create new units at the regional level. At headquarters the former
Subgerencia de Cuerpos Receptores e Impactos Ambiental has been renamed,
(Subgerencia de Evaluaci6n y Seguimiento Ambiental) reorganized and its
functions redefined. The major changes include the establishment of two
Jefaturas de Proyecto each staffed with six specialists (before there was one
jefatura with two specialists), and the redefinition of functions to make
them more specifically linked to environmental protection.
14.       At the regional level the major effort has been the creation of an
environmental unit at each of the six regional offices where none existed
before. Each unit, called Jefatura de Proyecto para Impacto Ambiental, would
be staffed with a chief and three specialist. Attachment 2 includes
organizational charts showing where were environmental aspects handled before
and after the reorganization at the central and regional levels.
15.       Staff turnover at CNA is a serious concern.  The main reason for
desertion is the low level of salaries in comparison with the private sector.
Recently at least four environmental specialists have left the organization to
join private consulting firms. This may continue to be an issue in the future
and it would seriously affect CIA's ability to enforce environmental
protection measures unless salaries are upgraded. Provision of qualified
staff for the environmental units would be one of the loan conditions.

16.       SuRRort to SEDUE   Human resources constraints have prevented SEDUR
in the past from reviewing cnd given a timely opinion on EIAs submitted by
CRA. In many cases this has resulted in the implementation of subprojects
without adequate environmental safeguards. To offset this problem CNA has
agreed to recruit experienced specialists who will be loaned to SEDUE with the
specific function of assisting SEDUE in the review process of CNA's EIA
studies.   Initially eight professionals will be recruited.  Agreement on this
subject has been ratified under the Operational Coordination Agreement
(para. 3) to be signed between the two institutions.
17.       Training.  Updating of staff's technical knowledge would be an
important ingredient of CNA's strengthening. The core of the training program
would include post graduate work, and attendance to seminars, workshops, and
international study trips. Current and new staff would be eligible .
18.       Laboratories.  Under the project CNA's laboratory's facilities
would be upgraded to provide the institution the capacity to monitor
compliance with and the effects of mitigating measures through water quality
testing. Other specialized tests, such as for pesticide residues would be
carried out through peivate laboratory facilities.

MEXICO - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE SECTOR PROJECT
Distribution of Investment Packages between IBRD AND IDB
The proposed distribution of investments packages between IBRD and
IDB was based on six basic criteria which were agreed upon.
These criteria were the following:
(a) Project economy;
(b) Relative experience of each Bank in each project/category;
(c) Background of projects previously financed by each Bank;
(d) Size of bidding packages;
(e) Geographical distribution of projects; and
(f) Proportion cf financing by each Bank.
A set of aeven tables cover the final result of the exercise which
was agreed upon between the two Banks.
Out of the total 12 project components four would be financed with
local funds only (Rehabilitation of Small Irrigation, Studies and Designs,
Small River Training Works and Dam Safety). The other eight components which
represent 91 of the investment program will be financed by local and foreign
funds. One of the eight components (reuse of sewage water) will be financed
by IDB the other seven components will be financed by both Banks.
Table 1 summarizes the distribution by project components. The
following Tables 2,3,4,5, 6 and 7 give details by project for the components
of Construction of Irrigation Districts and Rehabilitation/Modernization of
Districts which together comprise 632 of the investment program.
