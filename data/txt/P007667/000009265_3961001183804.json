institutional reforms; fully utilize\n            existing irrigation schemes by finishing uncompleted works;\n            improve water use efficiency; strengthen the institutional\n            capacity of the National Water Commission (CNA) and user\n            organizations; monitor and help prevent environmental and\n            natural resource degradation; and optimize the use of land\n            and water resources in the Irrigation Districts and Units.\n            The project will include rehabilitation and modernization\n            and transfer to users of 21 Irrigation Districts,\n            representing about 60 percent of total irrigation Districts,\n            deferred maintenance of the remaining 56 Districts, repair\n            and acquisition of maintenance equipment, completion of 23\n            on-going investments and construction of 3 new investments.\n            In support of these investments the project also includes\n            environmental studies and actions, institutional development\n            assistance for CNA and user organizations, and other studies\n            and designs."}, "docdt": "1991-10-29T00:00:00Z"}
