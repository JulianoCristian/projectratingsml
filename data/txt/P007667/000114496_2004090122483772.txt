Re:    Loan 3419-ME (Irrigation and Drainage Sector Project) Amendment to 
the Loan 
Agreement 
Dear Sirs: 
We refer to the Loan Agreement between International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (the Bank) and Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (the Borrower), dated December 
6, 1991, with respect to the above-captioned Project.  We are pleased to inform you of 
our agreement to amend said Loan Agreement as follows:
1.
The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 is hereby amended to read in its entirety 
as set forth in the Attachment to this letter.
2.
Paragraph 3 of Part C of Section I of Schedule 4 is hereby amended by replacing 
the figure "$15,000,000” with the figure “$41,500,000”.
3.
The paragraph in Section II of Schedule 4 is hereby numbered as paragraph 1 and 
amended to read as follows in its entirety:  “In order to assist the Borrower or the 
Guarantor in carrying out the Project, the Borrower or the Guarantor shall employ 
consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment 
shall be satisfactory to the Bank.  Such consultants shall be selected in accordance 
with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the basis of the 
“Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank 
as Executing  Agency” published by the Bank in August 1981 (the Consultant 
Guidelines).  For complex, time-based assignments, such contracts shall be based on 
the standard form of contract for consultants’ services issued by the Bank, with such 
modifications thereto as shall have been agreed by the Bank.  Where no relevant 
standard contract documents have been issued by the Bank, other standard forms 
acceptable to the Bank shall be used.”.
4.
A new paragraph 2 is hereby added immediately after paragraph 1 of Section II of 
Schedule 4 and shall read as follows in its entirety:  “Notwithstanding the provisions 
of paragraph 1 of this Section, the provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring 
prior Bank review or approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures, letters 
of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts shall not apply to 
contracts estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent each (in the case of 
contracts with consulting firms) or less than $50,000 equivalent each (in the case of 
contracts with individual consultants), up to an aggregate amount which shall not 
exceed $6,425,000 equivalent (said aggregate amount to combine contracts with 
consulting firms as well as contracts with individual consultants).  However, this 
exception to prior Bank review shall not apply to the terms of reference for such 
contracts or to single source selection of firms, to assignments of a critical nature 
as reasonably determined by the Bank or to amendments of contracts raising the 
contract value to $100,000 equivalent or above (in the case of contracts with 
consulting firms) or $50,000 equivalent or above (in the case of contracts with 
individual consultants).”.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendments by signing and dating 
the three originals of this letter in the space provided below, and returning one to 
Page  2
us.  This amendment shall enter into effect as of the date first above written, upon 
receipt by the Bank of one original of this letter signed by you.
Sincerely yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR 
  RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
