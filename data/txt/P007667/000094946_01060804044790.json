Sector\n            Project's outcome is considered highly satisfactory.\n            The main lessons learned are: 1) The ability of governments\n            to provide the required funding for the irrigation sector\n            from the public budget results in a situation where public\n            infrastructure cannot be maintained and is unsustainable\n            over time. Strong political will is required to charge the\n            full organization and management cost to users of irrigation\n            facilities, while devising acceptable transfer mechanisms.\n            2) It is important to mitigate the traditional bias that\n            government irrigation agencies have in favor of\n            infrastructure development as they tend to overlook or\n            ignore broader sector policies. 3) The Bank committed itself\n            to high standards to assist Mexico with the best efforts\n            from preparation to implementation, by assigning top\n            expertise, adequate resources, intensive supervision, and\n            proactive dialogue. 4) It is important to coordinate with\n            Inter-American Development Bank. 5) The creation of\n            institutional capacity for project implementation was\n            fundamental. 6) The best structure of water fees would be\n            through a two-step structure that would consider the volume\n            and the irrigation right in the registry. 7) Water user\n            organizations were much more efficient than a specialized\n            government agency in managing and performing rehabilitation,\n            organization & management, and modernization of\n            irrigation systems."}, "docdt": "2001-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
