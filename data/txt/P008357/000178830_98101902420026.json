assist Cyprus to\n            develop a comprehensive energy development and conservation\n            program, including the introduction of appropriate energy\n            policies, and attain its longer term objective of reducing\n            its virtually total dependence on imported fuel for its\n            energy needs. Institution building measures included in the\n            project would help to establish the administrative, policy\n            making, planning and technological capacity required to\n            implement a balanced energy program. The project also\n            includes pilot and demonstration schemes involving renewable\n            energy applications and introduction of energy conservation\n            measures. The Ministry of Commerce components include: (i)\n            energy planning, including the collection and analysis of\n            existing energy data, medium- and long-term energy plans,\n            and recommendations on energy pricing; (ii) assistance in\n            strengthening energy audit capabilities; and (iii) a\n            renewable energy component, creation of a solar and wind\n            resource measurement network, and pilot and demonstration\n            projects and studies involving solar, wind, and biogas\n            renewable energy applications. Assistance to the Electricity\n            Authority of Cyprus would entail the introduction of energy\n            conservation measures and installation of appropriate energy\n            conserving equipment."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
