I. POWER AND ENERGY SECTOR
A. Energy Sector
Commercial Energy Balances
1.01     The petroleum products consumed in Cyprus are gasoline, aviation
fuel, kerosene, gas oil, LPG and light and heavy fuel oil. Gasoline and
aviation fuel are used exclusively in the transport sector; kerosene in the
household sector; gas oil (diesel) in the transport, industrial, commercial
and agricultural sectors; LPG in the household sector and a small volume in
the industrial sector (bricks, mining); and heavy fuel oil in the industrial
(cement) and power sectors. Commerce and industry accounted for about 65% of
total electricity sales in 1982 to the Government-controlled 1/ areas of
Cyprus.
1.02     Since 1970 growth in the consumption of energy has been somewhat
erratic due to the political, economic and demographic disruptions following
the 1974 events, as well as the international changes in the price of oil in
the post 1974 period. Since 1975 growth in petroleum product consumption has
averaged 6% annually, although this has varied over that time from over 10%
per annum to below 4% per annum.  Electricity growth (including the unbilled
portion to the area not under Government's control) has averaged 6.3 percent
annually, and total energy consumption has increased by an average of
approximately 5.5 percent per annum. This implies an elasticity with respect
to real GDP of about 1.2. The dependency of Cyprus on imported fuel and the
large investment required to meet the demand for electricity places a severe
financial burden on the country. To decrease dependency on imported fuel
requires tne development of renewable energy sources, the generation of
electricity as efficiently as possible, and the conservation and management of
electricity load requirements to reduce plant investment. The proposed Loan
would finance studies, equipment, training and consulting to enable Government
to develop economic renewable energy sources and to establish efficient
generation and load control measures to conserve fuel.
1.03     Growth of energy consumption will depend critically upon the future
success of Government policy measures in, the fields of conservation and
interfuel substitution. The energy balance shown in Table 1 assumes a 4% GDP
growth rate and estimates that demand for energy will rise by about 4% per
annum through 1986. The 1986 energy balance implies a growth in the energy
import bill of 21% over the 1981 figure, equivalent to C£ 120 million
(equivalent to US$240 million) in 1982 terms. However with a vigorous
conservation program, especially in the industrial, electricity and transport
sectors, it is estimated that by 1986 an overall saving of about 9% on
projected consumption could be mnade equivalent to C£ 34 million per annum (in
1982 terms).
1/ Since 1974 the island has been defacto divided into two political/economic
zones. The north is under the control of the Turkish Cypriots while the
south is under the control of the Government of Cyprus. Project
activities are confined to the Government-controlled area of Cyprus.

Energy Resources
1.04     Cyprus has no known commercialLy exploitable conventional energy
resources and, therefore, continues to be totally dependent upon imported
energy, primarily crude oil and petroleum products. Imported petroleum
products constitute about 20% of total imports to Cyprus. Given the difficult
balance of payments situation of Cyprus, considerable efforts must be devoted
to energy conservation and to the maximum economic utilization of the island's
renewable energy resources. The indigenous energy resources have not, as yet,
been well delineated but include solar, wind and biomass.
1.05     Solar energy has been actively developed for residential water
heating but this is a renewable energy resource with broader potential which
the Government should continue to develop. Solar water heaters could be
employed not only in the household sector but also to help provide process
heat in industry and hot water for commercial and public buildings (e.g.,
hotels, hospitals). Solar energy may also be used in agriculture for crop
drying and greenhouse heating and the application of passive solar design
techniques can help to reduce the amount of energy required for heating and
cooling buildings. The other resources with economic potential are wind for
water pumping, and biogas using municipal waste and pig manure. The
development of these renewable energy resources can only make a modest
contribution to meeting Cyprus' energy needs over the medium to long term but
such a contribution is likely to be a useful adjunct to the Government's
energy rationalization and conservation program. The precise extent of
economic renewable energy applications has yet to be fully evaluated.
1.06     At present there is no detailed program for the development of
Cyprus' renewable energy resources and the Government has given priority to
developing such a program based on:
(a) a detailed resource assessment, especially of wind regimes and solar
intensity including mapping of resources.
(b) a careful economic and technical appraisal of the various
applications of renewable energy technology in Cyprus; and
(c) a review of the most appropriate institutional mechanisms for
developing renewable energy, including price incentives, training,
and information efforts that would be required to support such a
program.
Energy Pricing
1.07     Government policy is to set the average price (weighted) of petroleum
products at about 10% above border prices (weighted) but to cross subsidize
products for various social and economic objectives. The domestic price of
petroleum products is reviewed annually by MCI in collaboration with
the local oil companies. MCI, after reviewing annual financial reports from
the petroleum distribution companies and sales targets for the ensuing year,
set prices to ensure that, within the price levels indicated by the companies,
Government energy pricing policy is adhered to. Price proposals are then
submitted to an ad hoc Prices Committee prior to formal approval. The price
of gasoline is set high enough to much more than cover the subsidies to all

other users of petroleum products (Table 2). The oil companies are
responsible for all imports other than those made by EAC and the cement
companies which, in addition to local purchases, contract and import directly
supplementary quantities of fuel oil. EAC's local purchases of fuel oil are
subsidized. The cross subsidy program "taxes" primarily the transport sector
and "subsidizes" the industrial, commercial and electricity sectors. Energy
pricing is included in tihe consultant's terms of reference for the Energy
Planning sub-component (para. 2.01). Assurances were obtained that Government
would review with the Bank the consultant's findings and recommendations,
particularly those relating to energy pricing,not later than December 31, 1984.

1.08     EAC determines the level and structure of the electricity tariffs
subject to approval by the Co-uncil of Ministers.  Tariffs are subject to an
automatic fuel adjustment clause.  The present average revenue of 41.3 mils
(Cf)/kWh_/ compares with the long-run narginal cost of supply estimated at
34 mils (CW)/kWn. However, the present revenues remain below a level required
to ensure the financial viability of EAC. To alleviate the situation, the
Governmenit recently converted its loans of CZ9 million to EAC to equity, which
enabled EAC to meet its debt obligations in 1982. EAC's electricity tariffs
are discussed in para. 1.23.
1/  This includes the unbilled consumption.  The average revenue for
electricity actually billed and paid for is 53.4 mils (CE/kWh).

Energy Policy
1.09     The dependency of Cyprus on imported fuel and the large investment
required to meet the demand for electricity places a severe financial burden
on tile country. To decrease dependency on imported fuel requires the
development of renewable energy sources, the generation of electricity as
efficiently as possible, and the conservation and management of electricity
load requirements to reduce plant investment to meet demand. The energy
policy is directed towards four major goals:
(a)  The conservation of energy in all sectors of the economy;
(b)  The development of indigenous energy resources in order to reduce
dependence on eniergy imports;
(c)  The diversification of the energy economy in order to reduce
dependence on a single-product energy import, i.e., oil; and
(d)  The diversification of the sources of energy imports in order to
reduce dependence on a single or limited number of supply sources.
The Government has earmarked over 30 actions which are to be implemented over
the 1982-86 Plan period, although an assessment of priorities for actions has
yet to be undertaken. These measures will need to be translated into a phased
and coordinated program of action. In 1982, the Government commissioned a
study to review the costs and benefits of diversifying the energy economy by
the substitution of coal for fuel oil. The study was completed at the end of
1982 and the various Government agencies are currently reviewing the results
of the study (para. 4.05). The proposed Loan would finance studies,
equipment, training and consulting services to enable Government to develop
economical renewable energy sources and to establish efficient generation and
load control measures to conserve fuel.
Organization
1.10     Major energy policy decisions are made by the Council of Ministers.
The Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MCI) has general responsibility for the
energy sector. An Energy Advisory Unit (EAU) has recently been established in
MCI to provide conservation services and advice to industry and commerce. EAU
is also responsible for renewable energy but it has not so far had the
resources to play an active role in this field. EAU has initiated some work
on the establishment of standards for solar collectors, and some useful
research is being done by other agencies, but there has been no concerted
effort by the Government to systematically evaluate Cyprus' renewable energy
resources, to plan their development or to promote their commercial
application. The Cyprus Development Bank (CDB) is responsible for financing
energy conservation schemes in cooperation with MCI. Public electricity
supply is the responsibility of the Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC)
(paras. 1.13 and 1.14). Cyprus has one oil refinery owned and operated by the
Cyprus Petroleum Refinery Limited, of which the Government owns 35% of the
shares (but 50% of the voting power) and three oil companies (two
multinational and one local) the balance.



1.11      EAU will continue to act as the focal point for aLl non-power
energy-related development, including conservation and renewables. Since
renewables and conservation are relatively new fields of activity in Cyprus,
trained manpower is scarce. The engineers assigned to the EAU received
training in energy audits from UNDP consultants and have made a number of
energy surveys in selected sectors.   MCI is currently financing training
overseas for key staff. Nevertheless, EAU is still an embryonic institution
and will require further staff strengthening if it is to adequately meet its
objectives as defined by the fourth plan. The Project will strengthen EAU's
institutional capacity through training and advisory services.
B. Power Subsector
Background
1.12      EAC was formed by the integration of 16 separate local power
enterprises. Since its establishment, EAC has acquired control of all public
power supplies and serves all major population centers including all villages
in soutlh Cyprus as of 1979. After 1974, the island was dei-acto divided with
the Turkish Cypriots controlling the northiern part (about 36% of the island).
EAC no longer has access to the electricity facilities (about 17% of EAC's
assets as of 1974) in the area not under Government's control which is being
operated by the Turkish Cypriot Elect-ricity Authority (KIBTEK). EAC has
continued to supply power to the area not under Government's control even
though it is unable to collect payment for power consumed in that area
(para 1.22).
Organization of EAC
1.13      EAC is managed by a Board composed of a Chairman, a Vice-Chairman and
five members. The Board is appointecd by the Council of Ministers for a
five-year term.  The Board appoints the Chief Executive Off-icer of EAC, the
General Manager. The present General Manager, who also holds the post of
Clhief Engineer has been associated wi-th EAC for many years.
1.14      Annex 1.1 shows the present organization of EAC.  At present most of
the EAC's operations are managed from its head office in Nicosia with three
area offices handling transmission and distribution system operations. The
power station superintendents in charge of individual power stations are
responsible to the Generation Engineer at the head office.
1.15      At the end of 1982, EAC's permanent staff totalled 1,548 compared to
1,435 at the end of 1979, and comprised 152 professional engineers, 9
professional accounting and administrative staff, 261 accounting,
administrative and clerical staff, 44 meter readers and collectors, 890
skilled technical staff and 192 semi-skilled and unskilled staff. The present
staffing is adequate and will not increase substantially during 1983-87 due to
placement of surplus Dhekelia 'A' power station staff resulting from the
gradual retirement of old generating units in the power station.



-7-
Training
1.16     EAC encourages the upgrading of its experienced staff through courses
and training. It also arranges special overseas training; in 1980/81, 16
senior staff members attended 10 international conferences and seminars, and
16 staff members went on educational visits to power utilities in other
countries. Also, about 210 EAC employees; attended seminars, courses, and
conferences organized by EAC and professional institutions in Cyprus. The
training program is adequate for EAC's needs.
Existing Facilities
1.17     At the end of 1982, EAC's generating capacity totalled 324 MW from
thermal power stations located at Dhekelia and Moni on the southern coast of
the island, as shown in the map attached (IBRD 16999). The Dhekelia 'A' power
station capacity is 84 MW, comprising of two 7-MW and five 14-MW units
commissioned during the period 1952-1963. The construction of Dhekelia 'B'
power station with a capacity of 120 MW (two 60-MW units) was completed in
December 1982, and the first unit started in December 1982 while the second
unit is scheduled for commissioning in April/May 1983. With the stabilization
of these new units EAC plans to gradually withdraw the old units of Dhekelia
'A' powei station. The Moni power station has a capacity of 180 MW, with six
30-MW units commissioned from 1966 to 1976. Dhekelia 'A' station's thermal
efficiency of 20% compared to the Moni station's thermal efficiency of 29%
and anticipated Dhekelia 'B' station's thermal efficiency of 33% reflects
improvements and use of energy-efficient larger modern unit type sets. KIBTEK
has installed capacity of about 60 MW in gas turbines which have been operated
occasionally for short periods only, probably due to high cost of fuel and
foreign exchange shortage. At present, I-Lowever, this capacity could not be
considered as available for system operations. The other power generation
facilities in Cyprus, of about 12 MW, are a mini-hydro power station, standby
sets at industrial plants, hospitals, communication centers and airfields and
a small combined desalination power installation at Dhekelia UK base.
1.18     At the end of 1982, EAC's transmission system comprised 78 circuit
miles of 132-kV lines, 6 circuit miles of 132-kV underground cables, 188
circuit miles of 132-kV lines operated at 66 kV, 376 circuit miles of 66-kV
lines; and total transformer capacities comprised 508 MVA of 132 and 66-kV,
step-down, 420 MVA of interbus and 388 MVA of step-up transformer units. Most
new 132-kV lines constructed during the past decade operate at 66 kV. EAC has
primary distribution at 11 kV consisting of 1,802 miles of overhead circuits,
366 miles of underground cables, and 590 MVA of distribution transformer
capacity. Its medium and low voltage grid extends to about 2,589 miles of
overhead lines and 146 miles of underground cables.
Operations
1.19     Of the total installed generating capacity of 384 MW by April/May
1983, EAC proposes to retire two 7-MW and three 14-MW units of Dhekelia 'A'
thereby reducing the installed generating capacity to 328 MW. The firm
capacity accordingly would be 268 MW, the estimated peak load during 1983
being 221 MW. Considering the anticipated relief in peak demand from 1985
onward employing load management techniques, EAC has now proposed the addition



- 8 -
of 60 MW generating capacity in 1988 instead of 1987. EAC plans to retire the
remaining two units of 14 MW at Dhekelia 'A' power station in 1991. EAC has
satisfactorily maintained the plant and facilities, and for the size of the
system, has a satisfactory reliability record.
1.20     In 1981 the total system losses were 11.1% and are expected to be
10.8% from 1982 onwards. Generating station energy consumption in 1982 is
estimated at 4.5% of the energy generated while transmission and distribution
losses are estimated to be 6.3%. The system losses are reasonable. The
annual load factor for the system in 1981 was 60.7% being the highest for the
decade and is expected to be about 58.7% in the future.
1.21     Dispatching and load forecasts for the area not under Government's
control are based on historical data of electric energy supplied to the area.
Under the present conditions dispatching, load forecasting and maintenance of
common facilities along the border are very difficult. Restoration of
electric service, following outages, is often delayed because of problems of
access to facilities along the border between the area not under Government's
control and the area under Government's control.
Unbilled Consumpti_n
1.22     EAC's most serious operational problem is its inability to secure
payment for consumption of electricity in the area not under Government's
control. The unbilled consumption annually is equivalent to about 20% of
EAG's revenues, The total amount of unbilled consumption since 1974, as of
December 31, 1982 was estimated at C£ 39.2 million, the equivalent of US$78.4
million. The problem of unbilled consumption is part of a broader political
problem which can only be resolved within the context of a more general
settlement between the Greek and Turkish communities. Consequently, EAC is
dependent on its electricity tariffs to provide revenues sufficient to cover
the deficit of the unbilled consumption.
Electricity Tariffs
1.23     Under the Electricity Development Law of 1952, EAC is free to
determine the level and structure of its tariffs subject to approval by the
Council of Ministers.  The guiding principles are that revenues should be
sufficient to meet operating expenses (including depreciation) and debt
service, and to generate funds for system expansion. An automatic fuel
adjustment clause was made effective in May 1977 to compensate for the rapid
rise in fuel prices. Electricity tariffs (including fuel adjustments) were
increased 270% from an average 14.5 mils (CE/kWh) in 1974 to an average of
53.4 mils (CW/kWh) in 1982. The last tariff increase was implemented in two
stages: (i) 9% effective November 1, 1980, and (ii) 2% effective June 1,
1981. The average revenue per kWh (about US$0.ll/IcWh) is high compared to
other countries in the region 1/.
I!  Portugal US$0.06/kWh, Yugoslavia US$0.03/kWh, Jordan US$Q.07/kWh,
Turkey US$0.05/kWh.

Sales
1.24     Annex 1.2 gives actual sales by category for the years 1976 to 1981
and forecast of sales from 1982 to 1987. The annual growth in consumption of
electricity in the Government controlled area reduced from 8.4% in 1977 to
1.7% in 1981 and is estimated to be 3.5% in 1982. The lower growth in 1981
was mainly due to lower sales to industrial consumers on account of the
current recession. The annual growth in sales in the area not under
Government's control dropped from 10.5% in 1977 to 3.7% in 1981, and is
estimated to be 5.1% in 1982. The annual growth in total sales including the
unbilled consumption is expected to be in the range of 3.4% to 3.8% for the
years 1983 to 1987 and is reasonable considering the growth of the tourist
industry in Cyprus and the trend of consumption in the country.
1.25     Sales by categories to customers in the Government controlled area
for tihe years 1981 (actual) and 1987 (estimated) are as follows:

No data regarding consumers is available for the area not under Government's
control. The consultants for the Load Management Study estimate that 22% of
EAC's peak demand in 1982 (Annex 4.1) would be due to consumers in that area,
the estimated unbilled consumption for 1982 being 222 GWh (20% of total
consumption).
Bank's Participation in the Power Subsector
1.26     The Bank has been closely involved in EAC's development since the
early 1960's having made a total of five loans to assist in financing the
expansion of Moni power station and expanding the transmission and
distribution facilities. The Loan amounts for 335-CY, 494-CY, 649-CY, 831-CY
and 1873-CY were US$21.0, 2.8, 5.0, 9.0 and 16.0 million respectively. The
Bank's introduction of international competitive bidding methods helped EAC to
achieve substantial savings. In particular, due to savings in costs, the
disbursements (US$16.4 and 2.3 million respectively) against the first two
loans, 335-CY and 494-CY, were less than the Loan amounts. The projects under
the first four loans have been satisfactorily completed and the fifth loan,
1873-CY, is expected to be completed in 1984. Through these five loans the
Bank has promoted and encouraged substantial institution- building and
assisted EAC to develop into a modern and well-managed utility.

EAC's 1983-1987 Expansion Program
1.27     EAC's expansion programs (including the 1980-1984 expansion program
financed under Loan 1873-CY) is based on least cost alternative (para. 4.05)
and has been updated at intervals. The expansion program for 1983-1987
includes the consultants' recommendations submitted in 1980 and 1983, and
consists of:
(i)  investment for additional 60 MW generating capacity to be
commissioned in 1988;
(ii)  the expansion and reinforcemient of the existing transmission system;
and
(iii)  the extension and reinforcement of the 11-kV medium and low voltage
distribution networks in urban and rural areas.
The program excluding the Project 1/ component is described in detail in Annex
1.3. Annex 1.4 gives the details of the existing and planned facilities while
Annex 1.5 gives the breakdown of cost:s on a year-to-year basis, The program

II. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives and Description
2.01     The objective of the Project is to improve energy planning and
conservation. The Project would strengthen MCI's institutional capabilities
in the fields of energy planning and implementation of conservation and
renewable energy projects in order that appropriate recommendations may be
made to the Government regarding energy supply and conservation options. The
Project would also facilitate effective power use by improving the operational
efficiency of the electricity system through the implementation of proven load
dispatch and management techniques and installation of energy efficient
equipment for generation plant. The load management sub-component would also
provide data to assist in the preparation of an appropriate energy pricing
policy. The Project would include training, advisory and consultancy
services, studies and equipment to both MCI and EAC. The Bank-financed
Project would consist of the following:
(a)  An Energy Planning component to include the collection of existing
energy data and preparation of energy balances; a detailed optimum
medium-term energy master plan, including recommendations for energy
pricing; and a long-term energy plan.
(b)  Strengthening of MCI's existing energy audit capabilities through
intensive field training, provision of additional instrumentation
equipment, experienced executive and operational personnel to advise
on mnanagerial and organization techniques to operate the unit to meet
the objective of improving and accelerating energy conservation in
industry and commerce.
(c)  A Renewable Energy component in which assistance would be provided
for the creation of a solar and wind resource measurement network,
for the establishment within MCI of a center that would serve as the
focal point for the Cypriot renewable energy program, and for test
facilities, studies and pilot/demonstration projects involving the
most promising applications of renewable energy technology in Cyprus
using solar, wind and biomass resources.
(d) Assistance to EAC for energy conservation through;
(i)  the development of a load management and efficient load
dispatch program;
(ii)  the development of an energy conservation project for Moni
power station; and
(iii)  a feasibility study for standby and peaking generation
requirements.
A detailed description of Project componerLtS is given in Annex 2.1.

Project costs for the MCI components of the Project are based on estimates in
the following reports included in the Project File:
(i)   "Cyprus Renewable Energy/Conservation Project, Renewable Energy
Component" prepared by the Bank;
(ii)   "Appraisal of Energy Conservation, Sub-Project, Cyprus" prepared
by the Bank; and
(iii)   "Proposal to Carry Out Cyprus Energy Planning Project" prepared
by consultants.
Project costs for the MCI components are set out by years in Annex 2.2.
Project costs of the EAC component are based on the estimates in the studies
mentioned in para. 2.07 and revised by the mission after discussions with
EAC.  The base costs are as of the end of December 1982.  In view of the
details available, physical contingencies have not been provided for the
efficient load dispatch equipment, while 5% has been added for load management
equipment and 10% has been provided for F[oni power station energy conservation
equipment to allow for quantity uncertairnties and design changes during
implementation.  Allowances 1/ of 8.0% in 1983, 7.5% in 1984, 7% in 1985 and
6% in 1986 onwards have been added for future escalation of foreign costs in
accordance with the current estimates of expected international price trends.
Allowances for local price contingencies have been made made at the rate of
9.5% in 1983, and 9% from 1984 through 19,87. Project costs for the EAC
component by years are detailed in Annex 2.3. Consultants' costs for the MCI
and EAC components, on the basis of 250 man-months, average about US$10,000
per man-month.
Project Financing
2.03     The Project would be financed by two Bank loans:  one to EAC, with
the guarantee of the Republic of Cyprus, and the second to the Republic of
Cyprus for the MCI components of thie Projiect. The proposed Bank loans of
US$6.6 million and US$3.6 million would finance 100% of the estimated foreign
exchange costs of the Project.  The local costs of the MCI components of the
Project, estimated at US$1.7 million for the energy planning component, the
renewable energy component and strengtherling of MCI's energy audit capability
would be funded by Government's budget allocations to MCI. The local costs of
the EAC component, estimated at US$1.2 million, would be funded from EAC's
internal cash generation. Government and EAC have indicated that because of
the relatively small amount of the Bank's front-end fee, the fee would be paid
up-front of the loan.
Project Implementation
2.04     MCI would be responsible for the energy planning component, the
renewable energy component including the demonstration and pilot projects
I/ Price contingencies are not included for the three consultants' studies
which were completed in January 1983 and for which retroactive financing
is recommended.

and the strengthening of the energy audit capability; EAC would implement the
load management and efficient load dispatch scheme, the Moni power station
energy conservation measures and the standby/peaking generation plant study.
EAC has carried out 5 previous Bank-financed projects and is fully capable of
implementing the power component of the proposed Project.
2.0(     MCI Component Implementation.  The proposed Project would be the
first Bank-financed project to be implemented by MCI. An Energy Advisory Unit
(para. 1.10) is already in place at MCI, and the UNDP has provided financing
for the first six months of the services of an expatriate Advisor/Coordinator
to advise and coordinate the Project beginning about mid-May 1983. The
proposed Loan would finance the Advisor/Coordinator to continue his services
to direct the component. It is proposed to establish an Applied Renewable
Energy Center (AREC) under MCI's direction at the Higher Technical Institute
(HTI) in Nicosia for tihe purpose of implementing the renewable energy
components of the Project. The AREC would rely largely on the facilities
(workshops, computer, etc.) of HTI but would be staffed by engineers,
economists and technicians as required to implement the Project. An engineer,
with qualifications acceptable to the Bank has been selected, and would be
appointed by MCI to head the AREC as the Project Manager, assisted by the
expatriate Advisor/Coordinator, to carry out the MCI components of the Project
in accordance with the timetable (Annex 2.5) agreed with the Bank. MCI and
Government recognize that the successful implementation of the components
would depend upon MCI's organizing the Center and appointing staff at an early
date to allow for training and to permit start-up according to the Project
implementation schedule. Government has confirmed that:
(a) the allocation of the Project Manager and three staff members
for the Project has been approved for the full Project period;
(b) during the first year of the Project (1984) one additional
engineer, a clerical assistant, and a shorthand/typist would be
employed for the Project; and
(c)  any additional staff required for the Project in years 1985 and
1986 would be approved on the basis of a continuous review of
the Project's work load.
These arrangements are satisfactory for implementation of the Project.
Project implementation schedules for the MCI components are summarized in
Annex 2.5. The Project Manager, the expatriate advisor/coordinator and the
EAU staff, assisted by consultant advisers would implement the
demonstration/pilot projects and carry out the various studies associated with
the Project. Close collaboration between AREC and other agencies will be
called for in a number of cases and appropriate arrangements for such
collaboration have been made. The completian date of the MCI Project
component would be December 31, 1986.
2.06     EAC Component Implementation.  The installation, supervision during
construction and commissioning of the works included in the project would be
carried out by EAC's techinical staff and construction crews, and with
supervisory personnel with qualification and experience satisfactory to the
Bank. EAC would acquire through purchase or lease the required construction



- 15 -
and testing equipment. EAC Project implementation schedules are detailed in
Annex 2.4. The expected completion date of the EAC Project component would be
July 1, 1987.
Studies and Consultancy Services
2.07     EAC Component.  On the basis of a short list of consultants and terms
of reference for studies suggested by the Bank, EAC invited proposals and
selected and appointed the following consultants in November 1982 according to
Bank guidelines:
(i)  Electricity Supply Board (ESB), Ireland for the Load
Management and Efficient Load Dispatch Study; and
(ii)  Preece Cardew and Rider (PCR) of UK for the Energy
Conservation Study of Moni Power Station and Standby and
Peaking Generation Plant Study;
to prepare details and cost estimates for the EAC component of the Project for
which retroactive financing of US$0.2 miLlion is recommended in the proposed
Loan.
2.08     MCI Components.  Consultants (METRA International of France),
acceptable to the Bank, were appointed in January 1983 for the Energy Planning
component.  The study is expected to begin ii1n Aprl -1983, and--retroactive
financing of US$100,000 is recommended for financing this portion of the
study. Consultants for preparing studies for strengthening of MCI's audit
capabilities, the Resource Assessment, and for the renewable component would
be appointed in accordance with Bank guidelines and with terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank.
2.09     Engineering.  The overall responsibility for the engineering and
design of all works included in the EAC components for the project would be
undertaken by EAC's engineering staff which is well qualified and
experienced. Services of consultants wolald be used for the design and
preparation of bid documents for procurement of material, equipment and civil
works for Load Management and Moni Power Station energy conservation schemes.
The in-factory inspection would be carried out by consultants or EAC's staff.
Procurement
2.10     Consultants' services for the MCI and EAC components of the Project
would be obtained in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts for supply
and installation of equipment financed by the Bank would be by international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Guidelines for Procurement.
Small items such as relays, recorders and instruments required for the EAC
component, and instruments, recording devices and computer software for the
MCI components which would be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of
"limited international bidding" procedures satisfactory to the Bank whereby
bids would be invited from a list of qualified suppliers eligible under the
Guidelines and contracts awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder following the
procedures under Part A of the Guidelines. Such procurement would be limited
to US$60,000 per contract and US$700,000 in the aggregate for the MCI
components, and US$90,000 per contract and US$300,000 in the aggregate for the



- 16 -
EAC component.  Procurement contracts would include appropriate provisions for
inspection and supervision during construction and commissioning by the
supplier. Bank financing would cover 100% of foreign exchange costs of all
imported materials and equipment, installation and consultants' services
included in the Project. Civil works associated with the MCI and EAC
components would be contracted locally and financed as part of local costs.
Disbursemenlts
2.11     The proposed Loans, totaling US$10.2 million, wouli be disbursed as
follows:
(i)  MCI components (USt3.6 million) September 1983 through
December 1986 - 100% of foreign cost expendi'tures of
consultants' services, equipment, training, and installation;
and
(ii)  EAC component (US$6.6 million) September 1983 through December
1987 - 100% of foreign cost expenditures of consultants'
studies, engineering services, materials, equipment,
installation and commissioning of the Project.
Retroactive financing of US$300,000 (paras. 2.07 and 2.08) would be provided
for consultants' services from November 1982 for providing detailed cost
estimates of the Project components.  The estimated schedules of disbursements
for MCI are shown in Annex 2.6 and for EAC in Annex 2.7.  The closing date of
the Loans to MCI and EAC would be December 31, 1987.  Annex 2.8 compares the
profile of the disbursements with the Region-wide and Bank-wide disbursements
for power sector loans. The disbursernents under the proposed Loan would be
faster than the Region-wide and Bank-wide averages since the Projects are not
as complicated as generation, transmission and distribution projects.
Environmental Aspects
2.12     Thiere are no adverse environmnental effects of the Project or from the
overall 1983-87 expansion program of EAC, and in fact, the renewable
components are expected to improve the environment through, for example, the
treatment of agricultural waste products. EAC uses underground transmission
and distribution in most of the urban areas and to minimize the visual impact
of the power facilities it would continue this approach with the planned
expansion network. EAC would take necessary measures to ensure that new
additions to the generating capacity would meet the acceptable gas and dust
emission standards.

III. FINANCE
Accounts
3.01     EAC has a well-organized accounting department and an efficient
computerized accounting and management information system, staffed by
competent and experienced personnel. BiLling and collections, inventory
control, personnel records and accounting functions are computerized.
Accounting work is decentralized in three regional offices each with its own
budget and accounting staff. Tight control is exercised over all expenditures
and financial statements are prepared bi--monthly for management and budgetary
purposes. Adequate internal auditing practices are followed by the company.
3.02     MCI's accounting, financial controls and auditing procedures are well
established in accordance with the Government's prescribed accounting system
and are acceptable to the Bank. MCI has agreed to maintain separate accounts
for the Project components (see para. 3.12 for auditing and submission of
annual accounts to the Bank and para. 3.14 for monitoring the Project).
EAC's Billings and Accounts Receivables
3.U3     EAC's consumer billing arrangemeants are satisfactory; and its
accounts receivable for electricity suppLy, excluding the unbilled consumption
in the area not under Government's control, are within acceptable limits.
Large consumers' (industrial and commercial) meters are read and billed
monthly; domestic meters are read cyclically and billed at two-month
intervals. All consumer bills are mailed1 and settlement of the account is
required within 15 days of the billing date.
EAC's Taxes and Duties
3.04     EAC is exempt from sales taxes, municipal taxes and import duties,
but is subject to income taxes. However, because of investment allowances and
othier deductions and carry forward of losses, EAC has not been liable for any
income tax payments in previous years.
Past Performance and Present Position of EAC
3.05     Loan 1873-CY requires that EAC earn a rate of return of at least 3%
in 1980, 47 in 1981, 5% in 1982 and 6% thereafter on average net fixed assets
in service and revalued from time to time beginning in 1980. EAC's
electricity tariff structure includes an automatic fuel adjustment clause,
which has allowed EAC to pass on fuel price increases to the consumer.
Because electricity sales to the area not under Government's control produce
no revenue, EAC has not been able to achieve the agreed rate of return on
revalued assets even though tariffs are about 20% above long-run marginal cost
(para. 1.10). Indeed, EAC would have achieved an average rate of return on
revalued assets of 12.4% from 1979 through 1981 if these unbilled sales would
have been billed and included as EAC revenues. As a result of insufficient
earnings, due to unbilled sales to the area not under Government's control,
EAC has had to resort to increased borrowings since 1974. During 1978 and
1979, EAC's net revenues fell short of covering its debt service, and EAC



- 18 -
achieved only a breakeven debt service coverage in 1980 and 1981. In 1982,
EAC would achieve a coverage of only 0.9 even after the conversion of
Government loans into equity contributions. Since EAC's electricity tariffs
are very high in absolute terms and above long-run marginal costs, the Bank
has accepted EAC's past financial performance as satisfactory.
3.06     Beginning in fiscal year 1980 EAC has been permitted to revalue
annually its assets in service for depreciation and rate-malking purposes. For
revaluing assets EAC uses annual coefficients based on the general wholesale
price index published by the Government. EAC submits to the Bank its accounts
and financial statements with assets revalued in accordance with the
methodology agreed under Loan 1873-CY and duly audited by independent auditors.
3.07     The new steam generation plant (Dhekelia 'B') and i:he associated
transmission lines are nearing completion. EAC achieved this construction
program while maintaining an acceptable financial position. However, tariff
increases to cover inflation are now required to meet the debt service for
borrowings used to finance the 1983-1987 construction program. EAC's
financial statements for years ended December 31, 1977-1981 are included in
Annexes 3.1 and 3.2,
Financing Plan
3.08     EAC's planned construction and expansion program for 1983-1987 and
the proposed financing plan are detai:Led in the projected Sources and

. 19 -
To attain the projected level of internal cash generation would require a
tariff increase effective July 1, 1983 of an overall average of 15%, with
additional increases of 10% in 1985 and 7% in 1987. The proposed tariff
increases are projected to provide from internal cash generation, after debt
service and increases in working capital, about US$34.7 million (equal to
about 36% of the total capital expenditure requirements); and customer
contributions would provide about US$23 million (about 24% of the capital
expenditure requirements). Of the required borrowings of US$39.4 million,
US$16.5 million is already secured through existing IBRD, European Investment
Bank (EIB) and multi-currency loans, leaving US$22.9 million to be secured.
Discussions are presently underway with EIB for partial financing of the
program, and suppliers' credits and local bank borrowing are expected to
provide US$13.6 million for financing the balance required for the expansion
of the generation and transmission components of the program. The
distribution component of the program costing about US$9.3 million is expected
to be financed largely by borrowings from local banks.
3.09      The Energy Planning component, the Renewable Energy component,
and the Strengthening of MCI's Energy Audit Capability component of the
Project would be carried out by MCI. The proposed Bank loan would finance
US$3.6 million, providing 100% of the foreign exchange cost of the MCI
components of the Project. Government, through annual budget allocations,
would provide MCI withi all of the associated local costs (US$1.6 million) of
those components.
EAC's Future Performance
3.10      The financial projections for EAC (Annexes 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4) include
the tariff increases of 15% effective July 1, 1983, 10% in 1985 and 7% in
1987, which are needed to achieve rates of return on revalued assets, without
taking into account the value of the unbilled consumption, of about 5.1% in
1983, 5.8% in 1984, 6.8% in 1985, 5.8% in 1986, and 5.7% in 1987. Debt
service would be covered 1.4 times in 1983 and increase annually to more than
2 times by 1987. Total internal sources (internal cash generation and
customer contributions) after debt service and working capital would provide
financing for about 60% of EAC's total construction program for 1983-1987.  If
the unbilled electricity revenues were included in the rate of return
calculations, EAC would earn an average of 15% on revalued assets for the
years 1983-1987.
Financial Covenants
3.11      The rate of return and debt service covenants of previous Bank Loans
to EAC served to ensure a viable financial position for EAC. The financial
covenants of the earlier loans require EAC to earn a 9% rate of return on
revalued assets and to achieve a debt service coverage of 1.5. However, in
view of EAC's inability to collect for sales to the area not under
Government's control, Loan 1873-CY reduced the rate of return to 3% in 1980,
4/% in 1981, 5% in 1982, and 6% in 1983 and thereafter, and modified EAC's debt
service coverage from 1.5 to 1.3 for 1980-1982. As noted above, EAC's
existing electricity tariffs are already about 20% above the long-run marginal
cost of electricity. Therefore, tariff policy alone cannot reasonably be
expected to provide sufficient revenues to meet the rate of return requirement



- 20 -
and to cover EAG's debt service from 1983 onward. A 15% overall tariff
increase effective July 1, 1983 would provide revenues sufficient to enable
EAC to earn a 5% rate of return on revalued assets for 1983, and would cover
the 1983 debt service requirements. However, it would be appropriate to allow
flexibility in the timing and the amount of the tariff increase, and to permit
Government and EAC to take other possible measures towards ensuring EAC's
financial viability; such as, reduction in interest rates through Government
assumption of EAC's debt, subsidies to offset unbilled sales to the area not
under Government's control, etc. Therefore, assurances were obtained that as
a condition of Loan effectiveness of the proposed Loan to EAC, Government and
EAC will have taken all measures, including but not limited to a tariff
increase, to enable EAC to achieve a 3% rate of return on revalued assets for
1983. Assurances were also obtained that EAC would:
(i)  not incur any long-term debt, except as the Bank and EAC shall
otherwise agree, unless a reasonable forecast of its net
revenues for each year during the term of the debt to be
incurred shall be for 1983 not less than 1.4 times its debt
service requirements, and for each year thereafter, not less
than 1.5 times its debt service requirements for such year; and
(ii)  from time to time EAC shall take all steps necessary to obtain
such adjustments in its electricity tariffs as will provide it
with revenues sufficient to yield an annual rate of return on
average net fixed assets revalued of (a) at least 9% in the
fiscal years following such time as it shall be enabled to
charge and collect payment for power provided by it and consumed
throughout the Republic of Cyprus, and (b) until such time at
least 5% in fiscal years 1983-1987 and 6% in ithe following
fiscal years.
Audit
3.12       Under existing Loans, EAC is required to submit its audited
financial statements to the Bank within four months after the end of the
fiscal year. EAG's financial statements are audited by an internationally
known independent auditing firm satisfactory to the Bank, and audit reports
have been submitted to the Bank within the agreed time.  The existing auditing
covenant would be repeated in the proposed Loan. MCI's accounts are audited
by the Auditor-General who is independent of the Government, and this
arrangement is acceptable to the Bank for the purpose of auditing Project
expenditures.  MCI has agreed to submit to the Bank its annual statement of
expendicures for the Project component:s as audited by auditors satisfactory to
the Bank not later than six months aftler the end of each fiscal year.
Insurance
3.13       EAC's insurance arrangements are consistent with sound public
utility practices and acceptable to the Bank and cover risks of fire,
explosion and theft of or damage to inventories.  Self-insurance provides for
breakdown of machinery and electrical damage, which is satisfactory,
considering EAC's high operation and maintenance standards.



- 21 -
Monitoring System
3.14       Key indicators presently used to monitor EAC's technical and
financial performance under Loan 1873-CY are satisfactory to the Bank for
monitoring the EAC components of the Project. MCI has agreed to prepare
reports to facilitate monitoring the implementation of MCI's components of the
Project.

IV. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
MCI Components
4.01       The planning and the energy conservation components have pervasive
and favorable economic implications. They underlie the justification of the
Project. Unfortunately, they cannot be quantified. The energy masterplan
which will be an ouput (Annex 2.1) of the planning component: will provide
Government with the information required to make decisions regarding key
issues in the optimal development of the energy sector and will assist in
ensuring that costly investment mistalces are avoided. Furthermore, the
planning component will strengthen the institutional capabiLity of EAU to
analyze and present to Government future energy-related options.  The
potential savings of energy in Cyprus are considerable (para. 1.03) and under
the energy conservation component the training and advice given to EAU should
enable the unit to develop, within the project period, a pipeline of about 60
viable conservation projects in the industry and commerce sectors. In
addition, EAU would be equipped to give advice and information on energy
conservation. The pipeline of projects generated would be submitted to the
Cyprus Development Bank for possible J-inancing.
4.02       The objective of the renewable energy component Jis to provide
Cyprus with a solid foundation for developing a sustained and meaningful
renewable energy program.  This it would do, first, by assisting Cyprus in
building the information/planning and institutional infrastructure necessary
for the systematic development of its renewable energy resources. The
establishment of a solar and wind measurement network would provide basic data
presently lacking on Cyprus' most important resources, while priorities for
the application of renewable energy technology would be evaluated and an
action plan prepared as part of the energy planning study.  The Applied
Renewable Energy Center to be established under the project would serve as a
focal point for the country's renewable energy effort. It would provide the
Government with technical and economic advice on renewable energy development,
undertake research and development where needed to adapt technology to Cypriot
requirements, test and promote the application of renewable energy technology
through pilot/demonstration projects and other means and assist in and
coordinate the work of other agencies in the renewable energy field.
4.03       The second major thrust of the component is to support concrete
activities designed to improve and/or initiate the commercialization of the
most promising applications of renewable energy in Cyprus. In the one area in
which Cyprus has already begun to make good use of its renewable resources,
domestic solar water heating, the project would improve the efficiency of
locally made equipment and increase consumer confidence in the technology. In
the other areas of solar technology, and in the use of wind power and biogas,
the project would support demonstration/pilot projects and studies that would
enable Cyprus to evaluate their commercial potential. The demonstration/pilot
projects involve applications of renewable energy technology that appear to be
technically and economically ready for utilization in Cyprus but with which
firsthand experience, carefully monitored and evaluated, is needed before
their role can be accurately assessed. Each of these project activities
focuses on renewable energy applications that appear to have good potential
for displacing petroleum imports and improving the energy ef-ficiency, and
therefore the economic competitiveness, of Cypriot industry and agriculture.



- 23 -
EAC Component
4.04       Load Forecast.  Annex 4.1 gives the details of EAC's forecast based
on the available details of load growth in the Government controlled area and
on the assumptions that load growth in the area not under Government's control
will follow the trend in the previous years. The load growth associated with
tourist industry and the pumping load from 1987 onwards for the Southern
conveyor scheme have been considered. Given the uncertain political situation
and lack of data on future generation andc load growth in the area not under
Government's control, EAC has reasonably presumed that it would be generating
electricity to meet future system requirement of the area not under
Government's control. The overall annual load growth during 1983 through 1986
has been assessed at 3.5% and is reasonable.
Least Cost Alternative
4.05       EAC with the assistance of its consultants (PCR) considered in 1978
various alternatives for the 1980-84 generation and transmission program. The
Bank reviewed the consultant's report and agreed with EAC that it represented
the least cost expansion program.  The program has, however, been updated
regularly on the basis of new information available. For example, in 1980 PCR
updated EAC's proposals for the Moni-Limassol-Paphos system development scheme
for 1980-87. EAC's generation program is based on the use of oil as fuel.
The oil price increases in recent years made EAC consider using alternate
fuels for electricity generation as well as investment in equipment to improve
fuel efficiency. Consultants (Bechtel) have recently submitted their report
on the use of coal for generation and it is under careful consideration by EAC
and the Government. The consultant's (P('R) report on improving fuel
efficiency at Moni power station and the load dispatch and management study
(ESB) have been completed, their recommendation accepted by EAC and the Bank,
and form part of the Project.
Economic Rate of Return - EAC Component
4.06       The Project constitutes about 10% of the cost of EAC's 1983-1987
Expansion Program.   Annex 4.2 gives the cost and benefit streams for the
Project. Cost streams are those associated with:
(i) installation of new efficient oil burners, variable speed fan
drives, new air heater seals, oxygen control instrumentation
equipment for dosing of fuel additives, on-load condenser
cleaning equipment, an auxiliary steam turbine generator of 3-MW
nominal ouput and an additional stage of feeder water heating and
(ii) installation of a mini-computer, frequency meter, recorder
underfrequency relays, loadl management equipment and receivers.



- 24 -
The benefit streams are those associated with:
(i)  improved thermal efficiency of the four units of Moni power
station;
(ii) savings in total fuel costs on account of implementing Efficient
Load Dispatch; and
(iii) savings on account of deferred capital investmrent due to one
year's delay in commissioning of additional 60-MW generation
capacity in 1988 instead of 1987.
Certain benefits such as improved reliability and quality of supply to the
consumer and improved availability and reduction in maintenance costs at Moni
power station have not been quantified. Further consultants (ESB), on the
basis of case studies, noted a reduction in total fuel costs of 1 to 2% due to
Efficient Load Dispatch and suggested considering a reduction of 0.5% in the
total fuel costs. However, for the Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
calculations, a reduction of only 0.25% in the total fuel costs is assumed.
Similarly, for the purposes of ERR it is assumed that generation is allocated
equally among the six units of Moni power station even though it would be
possible to allocate more generation to the fuel efficient f-our units. The
ERR on the project is about 22%. If the preferential allocation for the four
units of Moni power station is assumecl and reduction of 0.5%' in total fuel
cost instead of 0.25% is considered the ERR on the project would be 32%.
Sensitivity Analysis
4.07       A 20% reduction in the benefits due to improvement in thermal
efficiency of Moni power station lowers the ERR to 18%.   A 25% reduction in
benefits associated with Efficient Load Dispatch would bring the ERR down to
20%. If the costs associated with cost streams are increased by 10% and
simultaneously the benefits associated with Moni power station and Efficient
Load Dispatch are reduced by 10%, the ERR is reduced to 16%.
Risks
4.U8       There are no special risks involved in the EAC component of the
project where the equipment proposed has been tested and used by other
utilities and installation of the material and equipment would follow normal
practices and procedures. The studies provided in the Project for the
renewable energy component are expected to adapt technology now being applied
in many countries to conditions in Cyprus through the pilot/demonstration
projects. However, as the renewable component of the Project would be the
first project of this nature to be undertaken by MCI intensive supervision and
monitoring of the Project implementation by the Bank would be required.

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01     Assurances were obtained that Government would:
(i)   review with the Bank the consultant's study and
recommendations, particularly those for energy pricing by
December 31, 1984 (para. 1.07);
(ii)  appoint consultants in accordance with the Bank guidelines for
the MCI components of the Project (para. 2.08);
(iii)  maintain separate accounts for all the MCI components (para.
3.02);
(iv)  submit to the Bank not later than six months after the end of
each fiscal year its annual statement of expenditures for the
MCI components, as audited by auditors satisfactory to the
Bank (para. 3.12); and
(v)  provide to the Bank reports and key indicators to facilitate
monitoring the implementation of MCI's renewable energy
component of the Project (para. 3.14).
5.02     Assurances were obtained that EAC would:
(i)   not incur any long-term debt, except as the Bank and the Borrower
shall otherwise agree, unless a reasonable forecast of its net
revenues for each year during the term of the debt to be incurred
shall be for 1983 not less than 1.4 times its debt service
requirements, and for each year thereafter, not less than 1.5
times its debt service requirements for such year (para. 3.11);
(ii)   from time to time take all steps necessary to obtain such
adjustments in its electricity tariffs as will provide revenues
sufficient to yield an annual rate of return on average net fixed
assets revalued of (a) at least 9% in the fiscal years following
such time as it shall be enabled to charge and collect payment
for power provided by it and consumed throughout the Republic of
Cyprus, and (b) until that time, at least 5% in fiscal years
1983-1987 and 6% in the following years (para. 3.11); and
(iii)   continue to appoint independent auditors satisfactory to the
Bank, and to submit its audited financial statements to the Bank
not later than four months after the end of each fiscal year
(para. 3.12).
5.03     A condition of effectiveness of the Loan to EAC would be that
Government and EAC will have taken all measures, including but not limited to
a tariff increase to enable EAC to achieve a 5% rate of return on revalued
assets for 1983 (para. 3.11).
5.04      In view of the agreements reached as indicated above, the Project is
suitable for a Loan of US$3.6 million to the Republic of Cyprus for the MCI
component, and a Loan of US$6.6 million to EAC with the guarantee of the
Republic of Cyprus for a 15-year term including a three-year grace period.

ENERGY PLANNING AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
Description of EAC's Expansion Program for 1983-1987
(excluding the project component)
I. Dhekelia `3i Station
Tile new Dhekelia "B' stationi will consist of 2 x 60-MW steam units,
each comprising a 260 ton per hour oil-fired boiler, a 60-&MW turbo-generator,
and associated auxiliaries and electrical equipment. The plant is adjacent to
the existing station at Dhekelia and will be known as Dhekelia "B" Power
Station. The first unit has been commissioned towards the end of 1982 and the
second unit wili be in operation by April/May 1983. An investment for
additional 60 MW capacity required in 1988 has been included.
II. Transmission System
The maain items of the transmission system extensions are:
(i) Transmission line between Dhekelia and Athalassa with interbus
transformers at Dhekelia. This line is associated with the Dhekelia
"B" Power Station and will be used to transmit bulk energy to the
Athalassa substation, mainly to cover the needs of Nicosia town and
surrounding area;
(ii) Transmission system extensions and reinforcement in the
Moni-Limassol-Paphos areas are required to meet increased demand
resulting from industrial, tourism and agriculture investments
including irrigation projects financed by the Bank in the Limassol
and Paphos areas. These extensions cover the Moni-Polemidhia
132/66-kY Overhead line, the tee-off to Ayia Phyla and Yermasoyia
sub-stations, the Polemidhia-Episkopi 132/66-kV Overhead line and the
stringing of the second circuit between Episkopi and Paphos
substations;
(iii) The establishment of the Yermasoyia and Ayia Phyla 132/11-kV
substations and uprating of the Polemidhia substation to 132 kV to
meet load growth stemming from tourism and industrial investments in
the Limassol area as well as increasing domestic demand;
(iv) The Moni-Pyrgos-Mari transmission line reinforcement and the
establishinent of a new substation at Mari to meet the increase in
demand from industrial development in this area. Demand from the
Cement Industry in the Pyrgos-Mari area is estimated to be in the
region of 30 MW by 1984. In addition, the new Fertilizers and
Sulphuric Acid Industry load is expected to reach 5MVA while the
demand of the nearby Radio Relay Station would be 6 MVA by 1984;

Page 2 of 2
(v) The reinforcement of the Alambra, Kophinou 66/11-kV and Athalassa
66/11-kV substations are required to meet industrial, domestic water
supply and irrigation loads in these areas. The Vassilikos-Pendaskinos
Water Resources Development and Nicosia Water Supply Projects are
expected to have an ultimate demand of the order of 3 MVA;
(vi)  Reinforcement of the Sotera and Cape Greco substations and the
establishment of Ay. Nicolas 16/11 kV Substation is necessary to meet
increased demand especially from tourism;
(vii)  Reinforcement of the Nicosia District Office L32/ll--kV substation and
Larnaca 66/11-kV substation is required to meet increasing demand
from existing and new consumers in these towns; and
(viii) Reinforcement of the Orounda '56/llkV substation and the establishment
of the Ergates 66/llkv Substation is required to meet increasing
demands from existing and new consumers mostly for irrigation and
from the establishment of a new industrial estate.
IL. Distribution System
The distribution system extension and reinforcement is designed to
meet increased demands from existing consumers, new major industrial and
commercial consumers and the low cost refugee housing development. It will
also cover the additional demands due to expansion of the Limassol and Larnaca
harbors, development of the Larnaca International Airport, supply to Paphos
Airport, new and existing industrial estates and tourism development along the
entire coast from Cape Greco to Polis.
The planned distribution system extensions and reinforcement will
benefit about 41,000 new consumers, out of which 16,250 rural, who will be
connected on the system during the period 1983-1987.

ENERGY PLANNING AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
MCI Project Component
1.       Assistance to MCI consists of three interrelated sub-components:
(1) Energy Planning Sub-component;
(2) Renewable Energy; and
(3) Energy Conservation.
2.       The above components build upon the initial work and studies prepared
by various consultants under a UNDP-financed program of assistance.
I. Energy Planning Sub-component
3.       This sub-component is as follows:
(a)  A detailed medium-term energy masterplan consisting of actions
to be taken by the Government in the key areas of renewable
energy, demand management, the pricing of energy and interfuel
substitution options. The consultants will prepare in close
collaboration with the Government a program of actions to be
implemented over the 1985-1990 period.
(b)  A long-term energy plan and policy including likely scenarios
for the demand and supply of energy.
(c)  Strengthen MCI's capabilities in energy planning by the
collection of energy data and developing more fully through
training, capabilities in the techniques of planning, analysis
and policy formulation.
4.       The work program for the study is organized into three phases as
outlined below and shown in Attachment 1. A Steering Committee, consisting of
representatives of MCI, the Planning Bureau, EAC, Ministry of Finance and the
Statistics Department will be established to monitor and guide the work of the
consultants. To the extent possible and appropriate the Bank will participate
in the Steering Committee meetings convened to review and discuss the reports
prepared by the consultants at the end of each phase.
(a) Phase 1 - Diagnostic study and collection of data - This phase
will include the following:
(i) Collection of data, preparation of detailed energy
balances, identification of data gaps.



- 33 -                            ANNEX 2.1
Page 2 of 11
(ii)  Analysis of pricing policy.
(iii)  Analysis of existing legislation relating to energy.
(iv)  Elaboration, on basis of available data, of economic
cost of energy supply options.
(b)  Phase 2 - Medium-term masterplan - This phase will include the
following:
(i)  Detailed analysis of energy demand, potential for energy
conservation and energy substitution by end use.
(ii)  Demand forecasts to 1985 and 1990.
(iii)  Recommended pricing policy, actions to be taken, and an
implementation program.
(iv)  Recommended actions to improve incentives for energy
conservation.
(v)  In conjunction with the renewable energy component a
medium-term program for the development of renewable
energy including the level and likely sources of finance
for such a program.
(vi) Detailed energy balances for 1985 and 1990.
On the basis of the review by the Steering Committee a series of
recommendations will be submitted to the Government and the Bank for
consideration by December 1984.
(c)  Phase 3 - Long-term planning and institutional strengthening -
This will include;
(i)  Strengthening planning capabilities within MCI.
(ii)  Development of the energy data collection procedures
established in Phase 1.
(iii) Proposals for any appropriate hardware and software
requirements.
(iv)  Training program.

5.           The outputs of the Energy P'lanning sub-component will be as
follows:
(i) Inception Report -- at the end of Phase 1. This will
include a detailed energy balance for 1982, analysis of
energy demand, revriew of available data and
identification of data gaps; diagnostic review of energy
related activities in Cyprus including existing
legislation, energy pricing and subsidies policy,
availability of existing data (cost, resources, etc.) of
energy supply options. The Steering Committee will
review the report and within three weeks of submission
prepare comments and any revisions.
(ii)  Medium-Term Masterplan - Draft report for
review/discussion by the Steering Committee will be
prepared at the end of Phase 2.  The niasterplan will
provide a coherent set of planned actions and an
appropriate implementation plan for a 5-year period
(1985-1990) in the fields of conservation in the various
sectors of the economy and including energy pricing
policies, incentives and regulatory measures and the
likely size, scope and sources of finance for a
conservation and renewable program; the development of
new supply options including their likely costs to the
economy as well as an implementation plan to 1990; and
the identification of any future training requirements
and training programs for MCI staff. The report would
be supported by ainexes detailing energy data. On the
basis of modifications by the Steering Committee the
plan would be submitted to the Government for their
review. The Bank would participate in this review.
(iii) Long-Term Planning Report - Discussion report prepared
at end of Phase 3 outlining alternative long-term
strategies and scenarios and impact of policies and
actions taken in 1985-1990 period on evolution of energy
demand and supply.
(iv)  Strengthening Planning Capabilities - Assistance by
consultants will strengthen MCI's staff in the field of
planning. Outputs are as follows:
(a)  Trained Staff - MCI will nominate a staff
member to act as project manager and work in
close collaboration with the consultants.
On-the-job training will be given by
consultants in the various aspects of energy
planning as outlined in the three phases.

Page 4 ot 11
(b)  Improved data collection, collation and
analysis procedures. At present virtually no
data/information on energy is collected by the
EAU. While the data requirements for EAU will
be relatively small and may in fact be
available in other Government departments no
system has yet been developed to collect this
information. The consultants will recommend
improvements to the present system and will
assist EAU in its implementation.  The
consultants will assess the eaxtent to which it
is appropriate to develop a simple simulation
model for energy planning in Cyprus and whether
modifications to existing data storage
facilities are required. IL appropriate the
consultants will prepare the specifications for
such a modeL.
(c)  Training programs - The consuiltants will
identify appropriate short-term traLning
programs for MCI staff in the fields of energy
pLanninag, policy formulation and analysis and
will, if possible, identify sources of finance
or training grants for such programs.
II.  Renewable Energy SbcpntS
6.       The Cypriot Government has assigned high priority to the development
of renewable sources of energy. While a limited number of studies and other
work in renewable energy have already been carried out  much remains to be
done in such areas as planning and resource assessment3 research and
development, demonstration and coTmercialization and training and institution
building before Cyprus' renewable energy resources can be developed on a
meaningful scale. The 10 sub-projects which make up the sub-component will
provide assistance in these areas.  While they cover a number of diverse
fields, the sub-projects are in fact interlinked and constitute a package
which would provide Cyprus with a solid foundation for the development of its
renewable energy sources.  The sub-comiponent includes the following.
Resource Assessment
7.       Comprehensive information about the availability of solar and wind
resources is fundamental to the development of a renewable energy program in
Cyprus. The resource assessment sub-project will establish a national solar
and wind resource measuring network, covering about 10-12 locations in the
country (the exact number will be determnined through site surveys).
Mechanisms will be developed for systematically analyzing the resulting data,
archiving it and making it available to the users in the renewable energy
field, along with relevant past climatological data collected at



- 36 --                       ANNEX 2.1
Page 5 of 11
existing meteorological stations. The sub-project will be implemented with
the assistance of the Meteorological Department under the guidance of project
(AREC) technical staff. Financing will be provided for the necessary
measurement and data processing equipment, together with the technical
assistance required in site selection, analysis and archiving of data.
8.       The performance of most solar and wind energy systems is highly
site-specific and accurate solar and wind resource information (as well as
data about other climatalogical variables) is essential to their correct
design. Without adequate resource information, the systems are likely to have
to be over-sized to ensure adequate output and, thus, to be unnecessarily
costly. The resource assessment sub-project will therefore be crucial to the
development of technically adequate, least-cost solar and wind energy systems
in Cyprus. The resource data will also be a major input to the planning study.
Solar Water Heating
9.       The sub-project would:  (i) establish indoor and outdoor test
facilities to certify the locally manufactured solar water heating
systems/sub-systems as to performance and construction quality; (ii) test and
demonstrate the use of solar water heating systems for commercial and
industrial (process heat) applications on four buildings, each typically
deploying a flat plate collector array of 500 sq. ft.; (iii) provide technical
assistance to local manufacturers--through establishment of test rigs and
adaptation program at AREC--to help improve the performance and reliability of
Cypriot solar water heating systems/sub-systems to internationally accepted
standards; and (iv) train, at AREC, local engineers in the public and private
sector to help them learn the latest techniques needed for designing domestic,
commercial and industrial solar water heating systems.
10.      Solar water heating using flat plate collectors is the most
commercial of the renewable energy technologies today and its widespread use
in homes in Cyprus is evidence of its economic attractiveness to consumers
there. However, Cypriot water heaters do not perform as efficiently and are
not as well constructed as they need to be if the full benefits of residential
applications are to be realized and the potentially much larger commercial and
industrial markets have not yet been touched. By providing the facilities and
technical assistance necessary for the upgrading of locally manufactured
systemns and testing and demonstrating applications outside the residential
sector in hotels, in hospitals and other public buildings, and in industry the
sub-project would help to substantially increase the contribution of this
technology to meeting Cyprus' energy needs.

Passive Solar Heating and Cooling of Buildings
l1.      This sub-project includes a study which would review the existing as
well as projected building stock (donmestic, commercial, institutional and
industrial) in the country and associated energy demand patterns in order to
develop a detailed plan for minimizing energy consumption. The study will
concentrate on three main areas: (a) the 'envelope' of theb buildings, (b)
hteating, ventilating and air conditioning equipment, and (c) appliances and
lighting. In addition to these technical aspects, the conservation plan will
address economic, financial, and policy issues. The sub-project would also
provide technical assistance to acquaint local engineers in the public and
private sectors with the use of latest passive solar designs and conservation
measures which can help reduce significantly the energy demand in buildings.
This sub-project will be implemented by AREC in close collaboration with the
Ministry of Communication and Works (MCW).
12.      Currently, about 25% of the total consumption of electric energy
takes place in the domestic sector and 30% in the commercial sector and it is
believed that a very high percentage of this is attributable to heating and
cooling. The potential for energy saving in existing as well as projected
buildings appears to be considerable. Experience in many countries shows that
energy requirements can be substantially reduced both through conventional
conservation measures (e.g., insulation) and through the "passive solar"
design which maximizes the sun's contribution to meeting winter heating needs
while minimizing summer cooling loads (e.g., by siting and glazing buildings
for maximum energy efficiency and through the use of special design features
such as overhangs).  The study included in the sub-project will seek to
quantify the conservation potential and develop a strategy for realizing this
potential. The technical assistance to the Cypriot architects and engineers
will help to develop the indigenous capability necessary to implement the
measures recommended.
Solar Greenhouses
13.      Through this sub-project, ongoing work on "tactive"' solar systems for
heating greenhouses will be supplemented by a program to develop "passive"
solar greenhouses. The active systems typically use a collector array to heat
conventionally designed greenhouses while the passive systems rely on changes
in greenhouse designs to reduce heating and cooling loads. The sub-project
would involve the installation of 10-15 prototype greenhouses (each typically
with a plant canopy area of 120 sq. ft.) that would demonstrate various ways
and means of substantially reducing the energy load of existing commercial
greenhouses in Cyprus (e.g., through addition of movable insulation,
rock/water heat storage). It would help to develop and standardize for
widespread installation inexpensive, energy efficient greenhouse designs which
make maximal use of solar energy. The prototype greenhouses will be built on
the premises of Agricultural Research Institute (ARI) and tested by ARI
staff. Technical guidance for the sub-project will be provided by AREC staff.

14.      The use of greenhouses for growing fruits, vegetables and flowers has
been increasing rapidly. Greenhouse area currently stands at about 90
hectares and is to be more than doubled with the help of a Bank Loan 1988-CY.
Winter heating is often necessary to obtain maximum yields. The total energy
consumption in greenhouses in Cyprus is probably in excess of 25% of the
energy consumnption in agricultural sector. Given the sunny winters in Cyprus
and the recent advances in construction of energy efficient solar greenhouses,
it is quite possible to reduce heating bills of the existing (through retrofit
measures) as well as future greenhouses by well over 33%. The energy
efficient greenhouses will also drastically reduce the temperature build-up in
summer which would prolong the growing season by making it possible to use the
greenhouses in all but the hottest months. Since solar features can usually
be included in greenhouses without increasing costs, the economics of solar
greenhouses promises to be far superior to that of conventional greenhouses.
Solar Crop Drying
15.      This sub-project would develop a pilot solar system for drying
grapes, evaluate its performance and develop recommendations for the future
use of solar drying techniques for grapes and other promising crops. A grape
warehouse, with a properly oriented and tilted roof, would be modified to test
and demonstrate a simple, low cost solar air heating system. After
installation, the system will be subjected to performance evaluation for about
a year. In the off-season, when grapes are not being dried, alternate uses
for the dryer (e.g., heating of adjacent buildings) will be investigated.
16.      Table grapes constitute the largest agricultural crop in Cyprus.
About 5% of grapes are converted through normal outdoor sun drying into
raisins, which are a preferred product both for domestic and export markets.
ARI has estimated that, if a drying process is evolved which can result in
more uniform and better quality raisins, raisin production could be more than
tripled. Solar crop drying is one such process. It has been successfully
used on a number of crops (including grapes) in different countries. The
technology is simple, inexpensive and readily adaptable for use in Cyprus.
Solar crop drying not only eliminates the danger of rain but also has the
advantages of accelerated and more uniform drying, improvement in product
quality, and avoidance of contamination with mud (which occurs in sun drying)
and need for subsequent washing.
Solar Ponds
17.      The sub-project consists of a study of the potential for solar
ponds. This technology involves the use of large salt water ponds as solar
collectors from which heat can be drawn off for power generation and other
purposes. Small- and medium-size ponds are being operated, mainly for
research and development purposes in a number of countries and a large (5 MW
peak capacity) pond is under construction in Israel.

ANNEX 2.1
Page 8 of 11
18.      A number of small salt lakes near Larnaca and a large one near
Limassol may be suitable sites for solar ponds. They have a theoretical
potential of generating well over 250 MW of thermal energy (to meet diverse
end uses such as desalination, industrial process heat, space heating and
cooling, etc.) or well over 50 MW of electrical energy. Although solar pond
technology has not been commercially proven, it seems sufficiently promising
to warrant consideration in countries like Cyprus where suitable sites may
exist and where there are few other indigenous energy resources.  The study
would make a preliminary assessment of the potential for solar ponds in Cyprus
and, if the findings are positive, recommend measures for the development of
this potential if and when the technology develops to the point at which this
becomes feasible. The study will be supervised by AREC in close collaboration
with EAC and the Water Development Department.
Wi nd-pumps
19.      Tne purpose oL this sub-project is to evaluate the technical and
economic performance of various wind-pumping systems and to prepare a program
for their application in Cyprus. Both traditional Cypriot windmills and
aodern, imported systems would be evaluated through the establishment of
on-farm pilot installations.  A large number of disused windmills (typically
of 14' diameter) that have been replaced by diesel pumps exist in Cyprus. Up
to 10 of tnese would be refurbished and reactivated under the project.  In
addition 5 new pumps of both 14' and 25' diameter would be installed, also to
operate in tandem with diesels in a "fuel-saver" mode, These installations
would be carefully monitored and their performance compared. AREC would be
responsible for implementing the project in collaboration with the Ministry of
Water Development. A considerable number of farmers have evinced interest in
water pumping and participants would be chosen from among those who are most
able and willing to cooperate in the installation and monitoring of the pumps.
20.      Wind-pumping is a well known technology and Bank and other studies
have shown that, even where average wind speeds are moderate (i.e., 4 M/S or
more), windmaills are likely to be the least cost alternative in comparison
with both conventional pumps and other renewable technologies. Cyprus has a
wind regime which is more tnan adequate for water pumping and windm.ills offer
potential for significant fuel savings.  A recent study estimates that, if 20%
of the existing 5,000 boreholes were equipped with 14' or 25' d4ameter
windmills, annual fuel savings of about 1,300 and 7,000 toe, respectively,
would be possible. This should be economically attractive to Cypriot
farmers. Although imported 14' and 25' diameter wind-pumps would cost about
$2,400 and q9,000, installed, preliminary estimates indicate that, if operated
in tandem with existing diesel engines, annual fuel saving of the order of
4500 and q2,500 could be achieved, giving rates of return of about 15. and
25%, respectively. For refurbished wiindmills, the economics would be even
better.

Biogas
21.      Under this sub-project a pilot commercial biogas system would be
instalied for testing and demonstration purposes on a 7,000 pig swinery near
Nicosia. The system would consist basically of a biogas digester with a
capacity of about 420/m3 and a 65 HP motor-generator set. The exact
dimensions and output of the biogas systema will depend on a number of factors
(e.g., retention time, animal weight) which will be decided through a design
study included in the sub-project but the typical daily output from a 7,000
pig swinery can be expected to be approxirmately 850 m3 of gas, which would be
about sufficient to meet the swinery's 350,000 kWh annual power needs. AREC
would be responsible for the installation and evaluation of the biogas system
in collaboration with ARI. The swinery would operate and maintain the system,
would keep the detailed records necessary for performance monitoring and would
provide free access to the facility for demonstration purposes.
22,      Biogas systems of the type to be installed under the sub-project are
in commercial operation in the US and Europe and in the Philippines and some
other developing countries. They are proving to be well adapted to meeting
the energy and environmental needs of modern large-scale livestock enterprises
such as now exist in Cyprus. Pork production on the island has shifted from
the small producer to large mechanized feeding operations. In these swineries
the manure is collected in a wet slurry form that can be fed directly into a
biodigester without further processing or the addition of water. The biogas
production potential from the swineries is about 20,000 m3/day, equivalent to
about 3,500 toe per annum. The swineries should find biogas an attractive
investment. A commercial installation (i.e., without the instrumentation,
etc., needed for demonstration purposes) would cost about $180,000-200,000 and
have a useful life of about 20 years; it would provide annual fuel savings of
about $40,000 (at the average EAC tariff of $0.11 kWh), resulting in a rate of
return in excess of 15%. Additional benefits can be expected from the use of
the residue from the digestion process as a fertilizer and/or as an animal or
fish food. The environmental benefits of biodigestion may be of even greater
importance, although difficult to quantify, since it provides a solution to
the waste disposal problem caused by the concentration of a large number of
swineries in the Nicosia area.
Applied Renewable Energy Center (AREC)
23.      The project will provide the technical assistance and facilities
necessary for the establishment of a national renewable energy center. AREC
will serve as a focal point for Cyprus' renewable energy program. It will be
the MCI agency responsible for implementing the renewable energy component of
the project and, thereafter, for carrying out the renewable energy program
recommended in the planning study. AREC's specific functions will be to;



- 41 -
ANNEX 2.1
Page 10 of 11
(1) provide the Government with expert technical and economic advice
on renewable energy policies and projects;
(2) assist in standardization of renewable energy systems
produced and/or marketed in Cyprus;
(3) undertake the adaptive research which will be necessary in many
cases before renewable energy technologies can be applied
effectively in Cyprus; and
(4) promote the widespread use of renewable energy technology
through pilot/demonstration projects and other commercialization
schemes.
24.      In performing these functions, AREC's principal role will be a
coordinating one; as a small entity with limited resources it will have to
draw neavily on the capabilities of other government agencies, and of the
private sector.
25.      AREC will be headed by a project manager who will be responsible to
the Section Chief, Energy Advisory Unit in MCI. He will be assisted by an
adviser/coordinator who will be an expatriate with well established technical
qualifications in renewable energy and substantial management experience. To
initiate its activities AREC will have 3 full-time Cypriot staff members who
will be assisted by 3 expatriate experts. AREC will be located at the
premises of the Higher Technical Institute (HTI) which has agreed to share its
workshop, computer and otner facilities with AREC. Additional equipment and
facilities needed by AREC will be provided under the Project.
III. Energy Conservation
26.      The sub-component consists of a technical assistance program for the
Energy Advisory Unit. Its main objective is to improve and accelerate energy
conservation in industry and commerce. Its secondary objective is to develop
an Energy Conservation Scheme (ECS) with defined targets for motivation and
subsequent achievement monitoring. The sub-component will be implemented with
the assistance of consultants. The sub-component comprises the following:
-  Intensive field training for a nucleus (3) of the Unit's engineers.
- Further academic training for one engineer.
- Advice on the managerial and organizational techniques required
for the Unit to operate with maximum effectiveness.
- Experienced executive and operational personnel during the first
year of the ECS to ensure its satisfactory establishment, and some
additional equipment and instrumentation.

Page 11 of 11
27.      The Unit will be able to secure the implementation of a number of
conservation projects during the Scheme's first 3 years. The confidence and
experience thereby gained will enable the service to expand and develop and so
realize the conservation potential nationwide.  This sub-component is expected
to result in the generation of about 60 projects in industry and commerce,
diversified by size and sector, during the Scheme's first 3 years. The energy
savings are valued at about $0.4 million al year.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
A. Income Statements
1.       Sales of electricity are based on EAC's estimated Load growth. The
forecasts assume annual energy sales growth of 3.5% for 1983-1986 and 3.7% for
1987. Average tariff increases of 15% effective July 1, 1983, 10% from
January 1, 1985 and 7% from January 1, 1987.
2.       Sales to consumers in the area not under Government's control are
assumed to increase by 3.5% in 1983 and 1984, 3.4% in 1985, 3.7% in 1986, and
3.5/. in 1987.
3.       Fuel cost increases would be recovered through the fuel adjustment
surcharge.
4.       Operation and maintenance costs are assumed to increase 20% p.a. for
1983-1987.
5.       Depreciation for 1983-1987 is calculated on revalued assets.
6.       EAC does not capitalize interest during construction, all interest
expense is charged to year interest expense is incurred. Interest charges
include an exchange loss arising from the conversion of loans in foreign
currencies and are covered by tariff increases. Front-end fee of the Loan
would be paid in advance by EAC.
B. Balance Sheet
7.       Gross fixed assets in service were revalued in 1980 based on
revaluation factors from assets in service as of December 31, 1979 using 1952
as a base-price year. For 1983-1987 annual coefficients of about 7.5% are
used to reflect average inflation rates. Asset values reflect cost of plant
in the occupied area and are also revalued.
8.        Inventories are assumed to increase during 1983-1987 in keeping with
operation requirements.
9.       Accounts receivables are forecast to average 40 days of sales.

10.      Customers' contributions are assumed to increase by C£2,100,000 in
1983, C£2,200,000 in 1984, Cf£ 2,300,000 in 1985, C£2,400,000 in 1986 and
CE2,500,000 in 1987.  Asset values on the Balance Sheet are net of customer
contributions.
