There are\n            six project components. 1) Planning and regulation of the\n            healthcare delivery system will cover district health\n            service planning and strengthening the capacity of the\n            Ministry of Health. 2) Essential upgrade of district\n            hospitals will undertake phased implementation of an upgrade\n            of essential secondary-level hospital facilities, and\n            training of hospital staff in management of emergency\n            medical cases. 3) Primary health care development will\n            support a global strengthening of primary health care\n            facilities, equipment, and staff skills. 4) Emergency\n            medical services will support further development and\n            extension of integrated, community-based emergency medical\n            services. 5) Public health and disease control will\n            establish legal and regulatory basis for public health and\n            disease control, and develop a capacity to control the main\n            causes of illnesses and premature deaths. 6) Project\n            coordination and management will provide technical\n            assistance and staff training."}, "docdt": "2000-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
