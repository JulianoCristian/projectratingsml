learning aids at various\n            educational levels; (b) expand the supply of trained\n            agricultural manpower; and (c) improve the rural education\n            network of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church (EOC). The project\n            was declared effective on August 30, 1974, seven months\n            after the original effectiveness date because of a delay in\n            reaching agreement with the (EOC) on the operation of the\n            training center. The project was completed with a cost\n            overrun of less than 1 percent. With regard to the\n            project's operating outcome, the USC serves 50 percent\n            more than its intended number of students and research and\n            community service activities have been improved and\n            expanded. This report gives data on the operating outcome of\n            the university science center, the science curriculum, the\n            agricultural training centers, the community skill training\n            center, the technology center, the extension of the animal\n            institute, and technical assistance. The report also gives\n            some recommendations and lessons learned."}, "docdt": "1983-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
