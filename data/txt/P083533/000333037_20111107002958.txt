F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of this project was: to assist the Borrower in preparing and implementing
the next phase of its national economic growth program. This project was part of a
technical assistance program, the overall objective of which was to assist the Government
in implementing its economic growth program, as described in the Minister's of Finance
development policy letter dated January 20, 2004 and in the Program Document for the
First Programmatic Loan for Sustainable and Equitable Growth (Report n. 27507-BR).
  The technical assistance program was intended to contribute to the objectives of a
strategically selected sub-set of activities of the government's growth program, and thus
to sustainable and equitable economic growth, and to poverty reduction. This was to be
achieved by (1) reducing logistic costs, (2) improving the business environment, (3)
enhancing the efficiency and depth of the financial system, and (4) increasing innovation
capacity.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
This Implementation Completion Report (lCR) describes the results of the Sustainable
and Equitable Growth Technical Assistance Project (SEGTAP) which supported a
programmatic lending operation that was effective through most of President Lula's
administration. The main objective of the Development Policy Lending (DPL) series
was to support sustainable and equitable growth in Brazil.
a. Macro-economic situation at appraisal
The Sustainable and Equitable Growth Technical Assistance Project (SEGTAP) was
prepared when the Brazilian government had already launched its "Plano Real", and was
addressing hyper-inflation and increased internal and external debt. The "Plano Real",
implemented during the Cardoso administration (1995-2003), included strict controls on
spending, currency reform, the tightening of monetary policy, and openness to foreign
investment.
By the end of the Cardoso administration, "Plano Real" had stabilized the economy, and
the government was able to turn its attention to a new agenda that included poverty
reduction and various sectoral issues related to economic growth. I The growth agenda
included institutional changes, such as judicial, transport, customs, and infrastructure
reforms.
In 2003, the election of Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva brought a new administration with
strong support from social movements. However the new administration faced low
investor confidence, currency depreciation and inflation. The administration introduced
a number of reforms, increased interest rates and cut spending. As a result, inflation and
inflationary expectations were brought down. The reform agenda focused on (i) changes
to the public-sector social security system and the country's system of social assistance
transfers, (ii) efforts to improve economic efficiency and (iii) increasing investment and
savings. The focus of the reform agenda were very much aligned with the Bank's
Country Partnership Strategy. The support of the Bank to the reform agenda at the time
of transition in the administration was important to improve investor's confidence.
This continuity of fiscal and institutional reform contributed to an average growth rate of
4 percent, approximately, for the decade. The sustained economic growth, the additional
social programs, and general economic stability contributed to an impressive
macroeconomic growth record and significant reductions in poverty levels. By the end
of the Lula administration, Brazil ranked seventh among the world's largest economies,
government debt was rated investment grade, and the country had become an
International Monitory Fung (IMF) creditor.

b. The Development Policy Lending loans I and II
At the time of project design (2003), the Bank's practice was to provide targeted
technical assistance to specific sectors with growth potential through programmatic
Development Policy Lending (DPL) accompanied by technical assistance loans. To that
end, the Bank planned a series of three DPLs supported by an APL series of TA loans.
Two DPL loans (First and Second Programmatic Loan for Sustainable and Equitable
Growth loans IBRD-72180 and IBRD-73860) were approved and implemented (see
implementation completion ratings below). The third planned DPL was not pursued,
since the country's fiscal position had improved considerably. For the same reason, the
second DPL was cancelled after partial disbursement and only one TA loan was
approved to accompany the DPL series. These two DPL projects targeted four topics: (i)
logistics and transport, (ii) the business environment, (iii) the financial sector, and (iv)
innovation. The objectives of SEGTAP were determined by the objectives of the DPL
series, which gave the reason of being for the loan. The POOs of the DPLs were listed in"
the respective document with identical wording to those of SEGTAP i.e. "support the
sustainable and equitable economic growth potential".

The Sustainable and Equitable Growth Technical Assistance Project (SEGTAP) was
approved on July 8, 2004 and became effective on October 31, 2005 due to the lengthy
Senate approval process. SEGTAP's approval followed the first OPL loan as part of an
effort to facilitate progress towards and compliance with indicators and programs
targeted by the OPL loans. The PAD further contemplated a second-phase Adaptable
Program Loan (APL) to be triggered upon "satisfactory project implementation and
satisfactory contribution of the project to the policy development and dialogue on the
implementation of Brazil's economic growth program."
This ICR is set in the context of the overall program of loans, including the OPLs. The
two OPL-funded projects were rated moderately satisfactory because significant legal
and institutional changes were implemented in the original four areas many of which
had measurable development inputs. However, because there were no follow-up
activities from a third project, some of the initially planned reforms were not
completed. 2 Both OPLs were rated moderately satisfactory when considering outcomes.
c. Rationale for Bank Assistance
The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of Oecember 2003 saw a role for the
Bank in supporting the government's growth agenda through a series of OPLs that
would provide the Government with the funding needed to move forward. As part of the
engagement with the Government with the OPL a set of companion programmed loans
that would provide the necessary technical assistance in key areas of the reform. The
CAS identified high logistics costs and inadequate transport infrastructure as having
major negative impacts on Brazil's competitiveness. In addition, the CAS identified a
number of constraints affecting the country's business environment (administrative costs,
regulations, anti-trust enforcement, and corporate insolvency) and financial system.
Finally, the CAS asserted that an improved innovation environment (such as links
between universities and the private sector and an innovation law). would enhance
Brazil's growth agenda. The Bank's program, as described in the CAS, sought to
address these and other challenges, beginning with the OPL loan series and related
technical assistance .loans. 3

The DPL series and the companion SEGTAP were then aligned with the vision of the
CAS. The two DPL loans (#71280-BR and #73860-BR) contributed to this progress in
four areas: logistics and transport, the business environment, the financial system, and
innovation. In keeping with this line, SEGTAP's Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
recognized Brazil's recent "deep macroeconomic reforms," but pointed out that these
first-generation reforms were not enough, in the absence of other microeconomic and
institutional reforms. Brazil's unemployment rate was high and its growth lagged behind
other Latin American economies. Despite liberalization, trade remained low compared
to other large· economies. Privatization in transport and electricity had not generated
sufficient competition or expansion of service to support strong economic growth.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The project's objective which was aligned with the DPLS was defined "to assist the
Borrower in preparing and implementing its economic growth program." The program
called for an Adaptable Program Lending (APL) series of Technical Assistant loans to
assist in implementing the program. The main objective of the related programmatic
DPL lending was to support sustainable and equitable growth in Brazil. The program
would raise Brazil's sustainable economic growth potential, thus increasing employment
and reducing poverty.
The T A loans were designed to be flexible (PAD pages 7 - 8). New activities consistent
with the growth agenda could substitute other activities that had been completed or were
no longer needed. The inclusion of new activities was to be subject to, among other
considerations, an official request from the Borrower. The activities consisted, among
others, of the provision of technical assistance and training services, office equipment,
and software to the project beneficiaries to carry out activities needed to achieve the
project's objectives.
The technical assistance program was to help key Government entities in developing the
capabilities needed for preparing and implementing its economic growth program of the
Borrower, Additionally assist in moving forward micro-economic policy and
institutional reforms, and be ready for the implementation of the next phase of the
growth program. Specifically, the TA program focused on the needs of four Ministries
to move forward five secondary objectives key to sustainable and equitable growth:
   •   Improve productivity and facilitate trade by reducing logistics costs, increasing
       the effectiveness of customs, reducing port costs and delays, reducing road
       transport costs, and promoting efficient multimodal transport options;
   •   Improve the business environment, by strengthening the regulatory framework
       for infrastructure, anti-trust enforcement, corporate insolvency resolution, and by
       reducing administrative costs to. businesses;
   •   Enhance the efficiency and depth of the financial system, by increasing
       competition in the banking sector, fostering mobilization of long:-term capital
       through strengthened markets for risk and stronger institutional investors in the
       insurance sector, and improving access to financial services;
   •   Increase Brazil's technological innovation capacity to transform knowledge into
       productivity gains, by increasing the· effectiveness of public research and
       development (R&D), improving the incentive regime for private R&D, and
       structuring/managing the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); and
     •   Support reforms and institutional measures to achieve other objectives of the
         Government's growth program, such as deepening trade integration, reducing tax
         distortions, and strengthening labor markets.
 Within the first four secondary objectives, the PAD identified the following results:
     (i) Reduce logistics costs:
     •   Strategic plan defined for Customs' modernization, clearance procedures
         reengineered (with time release measurement in place), automation of Customs'
         systems improved, and port and cargo security enhancement plan approved;
     •   Port reform and dock companies restructuring plans prepared and approved; and
     •   National Waterborne Transport Regulatory Agency (ANTAQ) regulatory
         accounting and performance monitoring systems established;
     •   Highway strategic plan and management reform program prepared and
         approved; and
     •   Public-private partnership capacity and program monitoring and evaluation
         system established in the Ministry of Transport; and National Land Transport
         Regulatory Agency (ANTT) concession evaluation models operational.

     (ii) Improve the business environment:
     •   Anti-trust system capacity strengthened through improved processes, systems,
         and training;
     •   Bankruptcy framework strengthened through appropriate regulations and training
         of judges and court personnel; and
     •   Performance assessment of judicial system in resolving economic disputes in
         public and private sectors completed.

     (iii) Enhance efficiency and depth of the financial system:
     •   Diagnostic studies and action plans prepared for reducing the cost of credit and
         reducing financial spreads through studies on fmancial system competition;
     •   Regulations and procedures in place to ensure application of anti-trust law in the
         banking sector;
     •   Studies undertaken on financial access for the poor which includes an evaluation
         of recent measures adopted; and
    •    Action plan developed for strengthening insurance regulations and supervision.

    (iv) Increase technological innovation capacity:
    •    Ministry of Science and Technology's sector funds monitoring and evaluation
         system established and reform plan approved;
    •    Capacity for appraising and certifying clean development mechanism projects in
         place;
    •    Pilot internet technology/social inclusion project completed and evaluated; and
    •    Ministry of Science and Technology's strategy to foster nanotechnology industry
         growth approved .
. These intermediate results could be adjusted in the course of project implementation.


                                              5
 1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
The Project objectives were originally designed taking into consideration: (i) the high
demand from several agencies of the Borrower involved in the execution of the
Program; (ii) the limited fiscal space to accommodate a larger loan for technical
assistance; (iii) an agreement reached between the Bank and the Borrower in relation to
the importance of a long term relationship aimed at addressing key issues affecting
Brazil's growth. Therefore, the Project aimed at benefiting four ministries (Finance,
Justice, Science and Technology and Transport).
At mid-term, the supervision team reviewed the progress of the components and
recommended a formal restructuring, which was approved in December of 2008. The
World Bank·and the government also agreed to a two-year extension of the closing date,
but a fiscal constraint in 2009 (a two-year loan extension would have required a special
budgetary approval) led to a one-year extension. Subsequently, after the first year, the
loan was extended an additional year, meeting the Borrower's request. At the time of the
restructuring the initial intention of additional Adaptable Program Lending (APL) was
abandoned.
The restructuring sought to "strengthen implementation arrangements and facilitate
timely disbursement" of funds. It also: (i) added a new component on fiscal and public
resource management; (ii) strengthened the financial component with new activities to
be developed by the stock exchange regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(CVM); (iii) reassigned project implementation duties to the Treasury Secretariat, in the
Finance Ministry; and (iv) eliminated: a component on innovation and technology 4 •
These modifications did not change the environmental classification.
The three new indicators listed below were added to the existing indicatorss:
  •   The development by the Ministry of Planning of a taxonomy of the existing
      models of public institutions inCluding, inter alia, their funding, financial and
      administrative internal controls, accountability, and labor regimes;
  •   Preparation of an Operationalization for Economic Co-operation and Development
      (OECD) peer review on human resource issues in Brazil; and
  •   Operationalization by the Treasury Secretariat of specific processes (risk
      assessment, planning, strategies, auctions, budgetary and financial programming)
      for public debt management completed.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
Direct beneficiaries were the four ministries, secretariats, agencies, and authorities
involved in the project. In the Finance Ministry, the beneficiaries included the Customs
Administration (SRF), the Economic Policy Secretariat (SPE), the Insurance
Supervisory Agency (SDSEP), the Economic- Monitoring Secretariat (SEAE), and the
stock exchange regulatory agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM). In


4 Disbursement of the component for the Ministry of Science and Technology were stalled because of the
Ministry's insistence on sole source procurement. As this was not consistent with Bank's rules, the
Ministry opted to drop out of the program.
S Due to the elimination of the Ministry of Science and Technology, the associated five indicators were
not to be tracked, but were not eliminated from the ISR system.


                                                   6
the Justice Ministry, the beneficiaries included the Economic Law Secretariat (SDE), the
Judicial Refonn Secretariat (SRJ), and the Economic Defense Council (CADE). In the
Transport Ministry, the beneficiaries included the National Transport Policies Secretariat
(SPNT), the Transport Infrastructure Department (DNIT), the Land Transport
Regulatory Agency (ANTI), and the Water Transport Regulatory Agency (ANTAQ). In
the Science and the Technology Ministry (MCT), the beneficiaries were the Executive
Secretariat (SE), the Strategic Scientific Development Policies Secretariat (SEPED), and
the Strategic Development Policy Secretariat (SETEC). After restructuring, the Science
and Technology Ministry was removed, while the Ministry of Planning (MPOG) and the
Treasury Secretariat (STN) were added.

The component was devised to support the Ministry's efforts to foster the development
of nanotechnology industry in Brazil.
1.6 Revised Components
At restructuring, the supervision team worked extensively with the Borrower to define
an updated set of activities that, while remaining within the original intent and scope of
the Project, would improve disbursement and better meet the current needs of the
Government.
New Intermediate Results Indicators (IRIs) and activities were added. The new activities
fit well into the broad PD~ and involved important previous Bank clients with relevant
work programs - and with whom the Bank desired to maintain an active dialogue. The
new activities were:
   •      Strengthening the regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM,
          Brazilian SEC) to develop risk based supervision and strengthening management
          systems.
   •      Strengthening debt management and public resources management in the
          Ministry of Finance, through further development of the public debt information
          system. This new component would contribute directly to the strengthening of
          the Borrower's public resource management and indirectly to improving the
          business environment.
   •      Strengthening human resource management and other administrative and budget
          reforms in the Ministry of Planning, Budget, and Management (MPOG),
          including support for budget reform and an assessment of the Government's
          human resources management system.
   •      Strengthening customs administration reform within the Ministry of Finance.

1.7 Other significant changes
The second extension (December 2009) was intended to solve the budgetary time
constraints the Government experienced in the first extension, when a longer time period
could not be accommodated. The extension also provided the time to complete
procurement and project work.
An important change to improve project implementation and increase the pace of
disbursements was to move the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) from the Ministry of
Finance Economic Policy Secretariat (SPE) to its Treasury Secretariat (STN). Because
participating agencies had no prior experience in Bank project implementation, the
proactive role of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was critical. The restructuring
provided the opportunity to address this problem. The sm was a good choice because it
had recently completed a large debt management component in the Fiscal and Financial
Management Technical Assistance Project (Loan 4604-BR) and it was a frequent
interlocutor with the Bank.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry -
The Project was designed to support the activities developed under the DPLs program.
As can be seen in Annex 2, the links among the two DPLS and SEGTAP were well
aligned and structured. Project design was based on previous Bank experience and given
the complexity and broad scope of activities, a dual project coordinator responsibility
together with project coordinators in each participating Ministry was recommend. The
design team recognized the complexity of the supervision and tried to systematize the
monitoring process by tracking a composite PD~, reflecting accomplishments of the
four ministries.
    A. Assessment of Project Design
Implementation was the responsibility of two Project Coordination Units (PCUs), one in
the Economic Policy Secretariat of the Finance Ministry and the other in the Executive
Secretariat of the Ministry of Science and Technology. There were also three project
coordinators (PCs) in the National Department for Transport Infrastructure (DNIT), the
National Agency for Land Transport (ANTI) and the National Agency for Waterborne
Transport (ANTAQ). The Finance Ministry delegated procurement responsibilities to
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
The PAD advocated a decentralized implementation arrangement as "key to ensure
satisfactory implementation performance." However, this support for dissimilar
activities across a large number of agencies in a decentralized management structure
resulted in implementation problems for the project. Few agencies had recent and
relevant experience working with Bank-financed projects. This, combined with the
relatively small amounts of funds and relatively high transaction costs, led to low
disbursement rates.
The PCU in the Economic Policy Secretariat was not able to manage the overall project,
since it lacked the status and leverage to push the ministries and agencies to implement
their programs efficiently. Centralizing greater authority in the PCU or the ministries
might have been viable alternatives. However, to the credit of the Bank project team


                                          10
this issue was recognized and actions were taken. During the final two years, after the
project's extension, the PCU was moved to the Treasury Secretariat in the Ministry of
Finance.
    B.   Ad~quacy   of Government's Commitment
The project was designed to support a government facing specific challenges. However,
by the time of effectiveness in 2005, the country had already shown signs of economic
growth that were unprecedented and could not have been predicted. By 2010, Brazil's
economy had become the seventh largest in the world; its government debt had
improved to investment grade quality; and it was an IMF creditor. The budget support
represented by the DPLs and the project was no longer as critical. In this new scenario,
the implementing agencies used USS2.0 million of their own resources when they were
not able to meet Bank procurement requirements. This demonstrates the high degree of
relevance of key activities supported by the project. This also demonstrates adequate
Government commitment.
    C. Assessment of Risks
The PAD rated the project as "high-risk, high-reward." The two main risks were
insufficient budgetary allocations from the government and inadequate supervision from
the Bank. The PAD recognized that the project was complex, given the large number of
beneficiaries and activities and the inclusion of diverse sectors. The document stated that
successful implementation would provide a "base for a continuous, extensive and
integrated dialogue on economic growth" with key stakeholders within the Government.
To that end, the project would require a "strong commitment," "effective project
supervision" and "adequate resources" from the government. In response to this
requirement, the project organized a ''joint coordination mechanism" to evaluate
implementation progress, develop action plans to address major issues, and reallocate
resources from weak to stronger government ministries and agencies.
Procurement arrangements were addressed in the Project Appraisal Document but,
despite the "high risk" rating, there was no proposed action plan. In 2003, it seemed
reasonable to assign project management to the existing Project Coordination Units
(PCUs) and project coordinators (PCs) in the participating ministries. However, capacity
in the ministries and agencies was weak, given a lack of experience with Bank
procurement requirements and practices.
Project preparation did not fully recognize the degree of risk posed by working with
multiple government ministries with little experience with procurement and project
management and monitoring. As such, training for the PCUs and PCs was not
contemplated.
2.2 Implementation
The project was declared effective on October 31, 2005. There were early impressive
successes in the areas of customs, transport and road networks that led to reductions in
logistic costs. The Units responsible for restructuring the administrative procedures and
developing regulatory framework for railroads and buses as well as for the valuation
models for the concession supervision system quickly hired the key consultants and
began to implement activities. The same can be said for those counterparts responsible



                                           11
for improving business environment by strengthening infrastructure regulation
reinforcing the legal and institutional framework for Private Public Partnerships (PPP).
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) in 2006 indicated the loan had a high likelihood
of achieving development objectives given that (i) the Government growth agenda was
on track, (ii) a number of project beneficiaries had undertaken most of the background
work necessary for implementation of a first phase of project activities, and (iii) many of
them were even utilizing significant amounts of their own resources to initiate activities.
Since the four-year project was only declared effective in October 2005, a midterm
review was undertaken in November 2008, discussions were timely regarding the need
to restructure and extend the project closing date, as some project activities were delayed
and the Government indicated interest in additional activities.
The 2008 restructuring was significant, justified and fit in well with SEGTAP's PDO.
The demand-driven reallocation to align the activities of the loan with the new priorities
of the Government was consistent with the flexible structure that was envisioned for the
loan. In addition, the supervision team worked with the Borrower to provide additional
support to those ministries and agencies that had shown implementation capacity and
could boost disbursements over the two year extension.
To facilitate SEGTAP implementation, an experienced consultant was retained in
Brasilia. The consultant was an important player in keeping the project moving forward
and advising the new Bank task managers of political and operational matters.
The problems of slow disbursement and poor performance of some of the participating
agencies might not have had ready solutions at the time, given the evolving political
economy and project design. Procurement was an issue requiring sustained attention.
Procurement was a major contributing factor in project delays due to coordination
challenges. For example, the Ministry of Science and Technology withdrew from the
project over a single disagreement regarding a sole source contract. The "Procuradoria
Geraf' ruled against the Department of Transport Infrastructure for failure to follow the
national Law #8666 on procurement.
Procurement problems also included difficulties working with UNDP, which
complicated implementation of the new components following restructuring. In several
instances there was disagreement as to which procurement rules were to apply (UNDP
or the Bank), for example with the purchase of computer equipment. In the four-month
grace period following loan closure, a case arose regarding information technology (IT)
purchases and consultant contracts valued at around US$500,000, which had not
followed proper Bank processes.
There were costs to the use of the "flexible design". Monitoring was difficult, with so
many key implementation results and intermediate output indicators. In addition, some
were not adequately defined, making it difficult for the ISRs to provide adequate
progress on all the indicators. The ISRs focused heavily on implementation issues such
as procurement and disbursement.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Project design was based on previous Bank knowledge and followed the experience
available at the time for decentralization of implementation arrangements. The PAD


                                           12
recognized that past experience in Brazil and elsewhere with centralization of
implementation arrangements had caused tensions between the government entity
responsible for implementation and the other entities with lower accountability.
The design team recognized the complexity of the supervision of a decentralized
arrangement, and tried to systematize the monitoring process by tracking a composite
PD~. The ISRs were structured to track a single composite PD~ over the life of the
loan: "critical mass of 14 out of 16 Key Intermediate Results achieved."
Results Indicators were described as "(an unspecified) number of related activities
funded under the project satisfactorily completed." Results Indicators were described as
"corrective measures during activities' implementation for quality assurance and
timeliness of products to be delivered." Further description included "Reallocation of
funds from non-performing to performing activities / entities." The activities aligned
with the DPL series however, were not detailed in the Results Framework.
The original project target of achieving 14 KIRs was not adjusted during restructuring.
Five KIRs associated with the Ministry of Science and Technology activities were no
longer relevant when the component was officially dropped at restructuring. Three new
indicators were added (regarding planning, human resources, and public debt
management), resulting in 14 KIRs. The original criterion for success called for the
successful completion of 14 out of the original 16 KIRs. As a result it was unclear how
many KIRs would satisfy the equivalent of the original project compliance target of 14
out of 16.
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and, subsequently, the ISRs process, were
complicated due to the issues mentioned above. The complexity of the project design,
with four participating ministries, made tracking costs difficult. The cost accounting
system tracked costs by ministry and not by KIR or activity. In some cases UNDP and
non-UNDP transactions needed to be aggregated and reported.
The project had. two distinct phases, including (i) the design and problematic first
implementation stage, which also saw some impressive gains in customs, transport and
logistics costs, followed by (ii) the phase of restructuring and smoother implementation.
Depending on the phase being evaluated, the outcomes and performance of key actors
(the Borrower, the Bank and the implementing agencies) are very different. These issues
will be further reviewed in the respective Bank and Borrower performance.
Nonetheless, the relative success of the two DPLs supported by this TA Loan show the
significant value added provided to the four ministries.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguards. There were no safeguard issues.
The project was categorized as a "C." There were no direct environmental implications.
Fiduciary Compliance
There was one covenant which required annual progress reviews and adjustments where
needed. The covenant was rated "in compliance" every year and the Progress Reports
were useful.



                                           13
Financial Management (FM) was rated moderately unsatisfactory in implementation
status reports (lSRs) from June 2006 to December 2007. A June 2007 annual audit
detected several errors and incorrect actions executed by the project. Based upon this
report, the task manager sent a letter to the project coordinator suggesting urgent
measures to correct flaws. The letter pointed out that the FM rating was unsatisfactory
because: (i) an action plan was not observed; (ii) a supervision mission was postponed
because of a lack of PCU structure at Treasury; (iii) staff were not formally assigned to
the project; (iv) weak internal controls; (v) a need for an updated Operations Manual to
reflect the new PCU; and (vi) the delay in replying to the Bank's review letter pertaining
to the 2006 audit report.
After the Bank's audit review letter was sent, the project coordinator took corrective
measures to solve the issues. A financial management supervision mission in 2007
reviewed the situation and found that most issues were resolved and the remaining ones
were in the process of being resolved. From there on, FM arrangements were rated
moderately satisfactory in all ISRs until the closure of the loan.
The involvement and experience of the Government Audit Department played an
important role in keeping the project aligned. The Audit Department was involved in
many other activities related to the Bank and was quite knowledgeable about both Bank
and Government procedures. The approach utilized during the audits was very helpful in
addressing the discrepancies between Bank's and Borrower's procedures.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
There are no transition arrangements for a follow-up project. Although the PAD had
envisioned a possible APL series, significant changes in circumstances and the
impressive rapid Brazilian economic growth made this less attractive and appropriate. In
fact, the issue was not included in the restructuring and there is no project under
implementation or in the pipeline to carry on SEGTAP interventions. Nevertheless,
SEGTAP's work is very important for the government agencies, and they are using their
own resources to advance the agenda and continue many of the activities that were
initiated by the project. These agencies include, inter alia (i) the Ministry of Planning on
strategic planning and completion of studies relevant to its organization, (ii) the
Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) on deepening of capital markets, (iii) the
Treasury Secretariat on the final phase of managing government debt and (iv) the Justice
Ministry's Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econ6mica (CADE) on refinement of the
Insolvency Law.
Brazil's recent growing pains pose significant challenges and provide important
opportunities for more lending and technical assistance. Useful follow-up might begin
with a dialogue with the new administration regarding useful public sector management
reforms and how the Bank can help. One option could be a large judicial sector loan to
strengthen some reforms. In addition, there is much more to be done in areas first
developed by SEGTAP, such as debt management in the Finance Ministry and in the
Planning Ministry. Other significant opportunities include strengthening governance
and public sector management, supervision of gov~rnment pensions, innovation, and
sub-national fiscal management, to name a few.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
SEGTAP was developed to support and extend reforms begun under the first DPL
project. Its design faithfully reflected the DPL prior conditions and was aligned with the
Brazil's growth agenda, as described in the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
of December 2003. The CAS called for a focus on creating a country that was "more
equitable, sustainable, and competitive." The CAS saw a role for the Bank in supporting
the government's growth agenda through programmed loans that would provide the
necessary technical assistance. The initial DPL series and SEGTAP were designed
together to reach those goals by supporting the government's "efforts toward higher
productivity and investment."
The participation of four ministries. the KIRs and 101 activities were driven by the DPL
series. The definition of the PD~ as facilitating the implementation of the DPL growth
agenda resulted in the participation of four ministries and a high number of indicators to
match identified prior actions in the DPLs.
The overall objectives remained relevant throughout the implementation period, and the
DPLs and SEGTAP helped consolidate progress made by providing technical advice,
training, and equipment to participating ministries and agencies. Underlining the
continued relevance of the SEGTAP objectives and the importance of the Bank's
support, many of the project's activities, that had not been finalized utilizing Bank's
funding, were concluded by the ministries utilizing their own resources.
The. Bank's teams supervising the loan provided significant guidance and the local
consultant in Brasilia provided essential continuity and assistance to beneficiary entities
and made up, to some extent, for PCU weakness. Also, transport and logistics activities
were achieved fully within the original project schedule. However, given the 51 percent
disbursement rate, procurement problems overall implementation was not strong.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
PD~   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Project Development Objective was largely met. Many of the objectives (KJRs) and
activities were partially or fully met through efforts funded either by SEGTAP or the
Borrnwer's own resources, or both. These activities included a number of studies and
reports, training and reorganization of agencies or processes, that improved existing
capabilities. With improved capabilities these agencies were able to carry out an
important agenda that relates to the development objectives of the DPLs and SEGAP.
The list below describes the progress made by the different Ministries as they relate to
the different secondary objectives.




                                           15
Reduce Logistics Costs - Satisfactory:
   •   Customs strategic plan and plan for re-engineering Customs' procedures
       approved and cleared. Port reform plan, dock companies restructuring program
       and the structure of the ANTAQ regulatory system approved and disclosed.
   •   Highway strategic plan and management reform approved and disclosed.
   •   Action plan for the MoT PPP capacity strengthening approved and disclosed,
       structures of MoT M&E system established, and ANTI concession evaluation
       models approved and disclosed.
   Selected examples:
   •    Customs Administration (SRF) completed reengineering of procedures, systems,
        risk management, bonded warehouses, and broker procedures. The government
        simplified export procedures and reformed the clearing systems and the
        management and information systems of customs. The expected outcome of
        reducing release times was achieved, which now can be done in 3 days
        (previously 5 days). An importer can clear customs in three days and an exporter
        can clear customs in about haIfa day (previously it took two days). According to
        Doing Business 2010, the time needed to complete an export decreased from 18
        days in 2007, 14 days in 2009 to 13 days in 2010. Similarly, the number of days
        to complete an import decreased from 24 days to 19 days and to 17 days during
        the same sequence of years.
   •    As part of the reform agenda, the government created the Secretariat for· Ports
        (SEP) and defmed policies and guidelines for port development. The Decree
        6,620 issued in 2008 defines policies and guidelines for the development of the
       port sector are important steps setting up the stage for ports reform and
        infrastructure rehabilitation. Three studies were conducted to support the reform.
        Ports have improved their operations and port handling times have fallen from
        13.8 days to four days for imports and from 8.4 days to three days for exports.
   •   The project completed an environmental diagnosis for complete port reform,
       with action plans and recommendations. Port and cargo security improvements
       and compliance with international norms (ISPS) have also been completed. The
       reform of ANTAQ was initiated but it is yet to be completed, turnover in
       management did not help in the consolidation of the ref~rm.
   •   The government reorganized the Federal Transport Administration and
       transferred the remaining trunk roads from the federal network to state
       management. Transport times on roads have fallen and road conditions have
       improved. The federal road network has passed the 30 percent target for output-
       based maintenance contracts.
   •   The Transport Ministry developed its capacity in long-term planning and project
       financing. Developed system to manage road work: Sistema de Gestiio dos

Enhance Efficiency and Depth o/the Financial System - Moderately Satisfactory
Action plans approved and disclosed for:
   •   Promotion of compe~tive structures in banking sector
   •   Facilitation of access to credit
   •   Development of capital markets and institutional strengthening of SUSEP
   Selected examples:
   •   The Economic Policy Secretariat (SPE) completed studies for the efficient
       development of financial markets and for improved enforcement of creditor
       rights. One study was a judicial analysis of pUblic-private partnerships. The other
       study focused on the micro-economy of social transfer programs.
   •   SPE developed regulation of payroll deduction for loans was introduqed to
       facilitate access to credit to low income groups.
   •   The Agency developed studies for improved financial sector competition, access
       to credit, and capital markets development.
   •   Securities and Exchange Commission - CVM (added at restructuring) developed
       a method to assess the costs and benefits of regulating capital market, and
       created training materials for basic education program aimed at increasing the
       level of financial education of Brazilian investors. Initiated the move to Risk
       Based Supervision. ,
   •    The Insurance Supervisory Authority (SUSEP) was strengthened with a
       development plan in regulation, supervision, human resources, and
       infrastructure. It developed circulars, manual on procedures, training. It also was
       supplied with hardware and software. By the beginning of the second extension,
       SUSEP had already implemented the majority of the planned activities. Due to
       changes in priorities, the strategic planning and neural networks studies were
       canceled.

Increase Innovation Capacity (removed at restructuring, 2008)

Strengthen Public Resource Management (added at restructuring, 2008) - Moderately
Satisfactory

Included the following:
    • Development ofa taxonomy of the existing models of public institutions
    • Preparation of an OECD peer review on human resources issues in Brazil
    • Operational incorporation by the National Treasury Secretary of specific
       processes for debt management
   Selected examples:
   •   The Planning Ministry developed the guidelines and TORs for the taxonomy
       studies using SEGTAP funds. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and
       Development (OECD) was awarded the contract. SEGTAP funds could not be



                                           18
        used to pay the OECD for the actual studies. The government paid for the studies
        with its own resources.
    •   The Treasury Secretariat (SlN) completed the design for the Integrated Public
        Debt Management System (SID), which built capacity to forecast analyze growth
        and trajectory of government debt. And built capacity through training for budget
        execution and public expenditure management.
    •   The Ministry of Planning. Budget, and Administration (MPOG) completed
        assessments in the government's human resources management system, indirect
        administration and budget reform efforts.
Despite these accomplishments, the project faced some challenges, which slowed
progress and resulted in a 51 percent disbursement rate.
    •   Procurement disagreements with the UNDP highlighted some of the problems
        that resulted in some of the activities being funded by the client's own resources.
        The Science and Technology Ministry withdrew from the project in 2008 due to
        a disagreement over a single-source procurement contract for a web· site.
        However, these activities were part of the project's planning and implementation.
        Some of the implementation problems were beyond the project's control.
    •   Beneficiary performance was uneven and many of the fifty-plus activities
        described in the PAD were only partially undertaken.
    •   The PCU never claimed the Bank-approved US$I.2 million of retroactive
        expenqitures.                                                           .

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The costs in achieving project objectives were reasonable in comparison with the
benefits. In the end, there was sufficient value for the US$6.22 million disbursed to
justify a moderately satisfactory rating. The specific activities funded were significant,
although, in some cases, the amount disbursed may have been insufficient to meet the
KIR. The activities that were undertaken were important and contributed to the
objectives, and their cost was reasonable.
During the second extension year (final year of the loan), the project was on track to
reach 86% of loan proceeds. However, due to the restructuring process of UNDP,
contracts were delayed and disbursement reached 51.13%. However, the clients were
significantly committed with the process to the point of using their own funds to
complete activities that were delayed by UNDP procurement process. As such, and
despite the low disbursement, much of what was funded by the client's own resources
reflected SEGTAP's design and efforts.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The rating of Moderately Satisfactory is justified because the project was able to meet a
substantial portion of its objectives despite a low disbursement rate, an ambitious agenda
and problematic monitoring. SEGTAP made an important contribution to the Brazilian
government's growth agenda by contributing to a pro-reform environment that will


                                            19
continue to be felt well after project closing. The beneficiary agencies did accomplish
important reforms, and they are continuing many of the project's reform activities with
their own resources on what was built with SEGTAP funding. This is especially true in
the areas of judicial reform, transport, and debt management. The project's impact will
surely be felt as· the government continues its reform program despite the transitory
disagreements over procurement.
3.5 Overarehing Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, aod Social Development - Moderately
Satisfactory
SEGTAP was a straightforward technical assistance operation whose impact on poverty,
gender and social development aspects was almost entirely indirect. A number of its
activities supported the strengthening of SPE in its work to improve credit access for the
poor, micro-credit and credit for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) during the
project period.
(b) Institutional ChangelStrengthening - Satisfactory
There were several important laws and decrees, prepared by agencies that benefited from
SEGTAP that contributed to the PD~. The following examples can be mentioned:
insolvency law, bankruptcy procedures, regulations for opening and closing firms, credit
access, and anti-trust, judicial system performance in economic cases, banking sector
competitiveness, and capital market deepening. There were important and sustainable
gains in terms of institutional strengthening of the Customs Administration, the
Insurance Supervisory Authority (SUSEP), and the Transport Ministry (ANTI). These
changes were the result of a combination of project strengthening agencies capabilities
and government funding and deserve a satisfactory rating.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive)
During the supervision missions that visited the Securities and Exchange Commission
(CVM), the Bank project team came to learn about the pilot program on financial
literacy being developed for high school students. The pilot is part of the Brazilian
Financial Education Strategy (Estrategia NacionaZ·de Educafiio Financeira), a national
priority of· the government. 7 The strategy recognizes that financial education is a
potential tool for social inclusion, improving the lives of citizens and promoting stability,
competition and efficiency of the financial system. The team identified implementation
issues and the lack of impact evaluation of the program. An impact evaluation mission
was subsequently organized and the discussions led to a request for NLT A to design and
conduct an impact evaluation of the pilot project.
As a direct result of this project, the Bank became a valued partner of the program that is
reaching 24,000 students in 880 schools distributed in six states and the Federal District.
The impact evaluation program has successfully secured over a million dollars from
international and local donors and has attracted interest from the OECD and other

countries in the region. While not directly related to the original loan, these programs
emerged from the discussion on financial access, which took place under this loan.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N.A.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The question of "risk" refers to whether outcomes' sustainability was at risk at the time
of the ICR.. In the case of SEGTAP the question is complicated because the PD~ was
designed to support the facilitation of a series of DPLs and it was defined by
ambiguously worded and unclear outcomes. The SEGTAP successfully supported two
DPLs, whose reforms have been sustainable and have been rated moderately satisfactory.
Even though it is.hard to determine just how much SEGTAP contributed to institutional
strengthening with its studies, training and processes review, almost all were very
relevant for the units that undertook them. This is highlighted by the fact that many units
utilizing own resources continued and finalized the studies.
Sustainability risk "ambiguity" is made worse because the KIRs and the overall PDQ'
were linked to the DPL series, which was truncated at 25 percent disbursement of the
second DPL. Nevertheless, Brazil today enjoys a much more favorable economic and
judicial governance framework than at the time of loan preparation and has weathered
the worldwide recession well in large measure because of interventions taken during the
period of loan implementation. Furthermore, the laws, decrees, and institutional
strengthening activities completed by the beneficiary agencies using project and non-
project resources are largely sustainable. For example, the insurance supervisor SUSEP
strengthened its capabilities (developing circulars, manuals on procedures, training and
acquiring technological infrastructure - both hardware and software); the preparation
work for CVM's studies (assessing the cost and benefits of regulating capital markets)
and the studies done by the Economic Policy Secretariat (improved enforcement of
creditor's rights). Also many of the activities that could not be funded with SEGTAP
resources due to procurement issues, have been carried out with beneficiaries own
resources. On balance the risks to the development outcomes are perceived to be
moderate.

s.   Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
S.l Bank Performance
(a> Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately: Unsatisfactory
The project objectives were strategically relevant. The objectives were aligned with
Government priorities and Bank strategies and the DPL loans it supported. The loan was
designed based on prior research that pointed to a broad decentralized cross-cutting
approach combined with a flexible design that would allow the loan to accommodate
changing priorities. However, the design was overly complex with many activities and
stakeholders, which led to some implementation challenges and also the achievement of
the PD~ could not be easily measured. Eight factors were used to assess quality at entry


                                           21
and come to a holistic moderately unsatisfactory rating. This reflects the lack of
participation of the participating agencies in the four ministries at the design stage, the
very broad project development objective, the choice of key performance indicators, and
the overall complexity of the design of the technical assistance loan. This rating
recognizes that the technical assistance loan matched the programmatic focus of the two
DPLs, and the choice of instrument allowed the project to respond to changing needs of
the counterpart and complement the work of other Bank projects.
Quality at Entry: More thorough initial background analysis could have detected low
level of preparedness of the units that were going to implement loan activities and
prepare an action plan to tackle weaknesses.
Strategic: Relevance and Approach: Given the size of the DPLs and the strategic
importance of the government's growth agenda, this TA loan was timely and relevant.
Political Ownership: Despite problems with disbursement, the Borrower showed
continued interest in the project's reform agenda. The continuation of the activities using
government funds highlights the importance of the work.
Policy and Institutional Aspects: At the time of preparation the operation was well
aligned with the government's growth agenda of the DPLs. The project's reform agenda
design remained unchanged throughout the life of the loan. However, the institutional
capacity was not well assessed.
Technical, Financial and Economic Aspects: Indicators were congruent with DPL and
CAS objectives and remained so throughout the life of the operation. However, some of
the participating entities were ill-prepared to carry out a Bank loan.
Bank Inputs and Processes: There was sufficient knowledge of the components within
the Bank's team, which included experts in most of the areas covered (transport, finance,
insurance, environment, legal, etc.) There were synergies in the supervision with the
teams that managed the DPLs loans. The interactive and open dialogue provided an
opportunity to engage with the counterpart in other areas (such as financial literacy).
Risk Assessment: There were gaps in the risk assessment specifically given the
proliferation of beneficiary entities with little or no experience in Bank lending.
Preparedness of some of the units involved could have been better assessed so action
plans to tackle the issue could have been prepared.
Implementation Arrangements: Bank efforts to keep the loan on track are commendable.
One of the PCU was moved to the Treasury for the final years of implementation.
Realizing that the additional project coordinators did not have sufficient knowledge of
Bank procedures, the team retained an experienced external consultant through the life
of the loan to provide guidance, continuity and consistency. Procurement problems
slowed progress and the lack of a properly specified results matrix did not provide the
detail necessary for well dermed lOIs.
Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements: The unwieldy number and specification of
KlR and IRI activities and especially the specification issues of thePDO, KlR and IRI
results made supervision difficult and subsequently led to a focus on procurement and
disbursement.
Poverty, Gender and Social Development Aspects: See comments on 3.5 a.


                                           22
 Environmental Aspects: N.A.
 (b) Quality of Supervision
 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

 Five factors were used to assess quality of supervision: adequacy of supervision,
 fiduciary safeguards, focus on development, candor and quality of reporting and
 adequate transition arrangements.                            .

 Adequacy of Supervision of Inputs and Processes: Given the project's complex design,
 the Bank had to provide close and intense supervision through the project's life. Given
 the 'flexible' design the Bank was proactive and restructured at mid-term to meet the
 changing priorities of the Government. After the restructuring implementation activity
 peaked. During that period the Bank had daily communication with the PCU and
 implementing units and provided detailed feedback on a significant. amount of "no
 objection" requests. For activities where specific skills were needed, the team found an
 appropriate expert to review the issues before issuing the "no objection." However, the
 supervision team could have been more skeptical about the government implementation
 schedules particularly when procurement problems continued surfacing.
  Supervision of Fiduciary and Safeguard Aspects: The audit process was comprehensive
  and while there were no major issues, there were several qualified audit reports.
  Adequate response was always provided. There were also few processing issues in the
  beginning. For example, Financial Management systems were slow to be put in place
  and their coverage was inadequate and staffing the original and new PCUs was delayed .
. However, fiduciary management issues that surfaced in the early years of the loan were
  properly addressed by the counterpart and corrective measures were taken. The financial
  management supervision that reviewed the situatjon after corrective measures were
  taken confirmed the reversal of the situation.
 Focus on Development Impact: Many key outcomes were identified and achieved.
 Additionally, the midterm review and resulting restructuring increased the development
 impact by providing resources to responsive ministries and agencies. However, poor
 specification of the PDO and KIR did not contribute to efforts in this area. Due to poor
 specification, too much emphasis had to be placed on procurement plans and
 disbursement and too little on results to ensure development impact. Also at the time of
 restructuring, the team should have refocused the monitoring and evaluation framework.
 Candor and Quality of Performance Reporting: ISRs lacked important detail reporting
 on KIRs and Component IRIs in the Results Framework and questionable loan design
 and risk analyses. However, procurement and component progress reporting was
 moderately satisfactory.
 Role of Ensuring Adequate Transition Arrangements: The APL series was not included
 in the restructuring, and no formal transition arrangements were left in the pipeline.
 However, three ministries using their own resources continued follow-up work in these
 areas using TORs, action plans and technical work provided under the loan. This was a
 strong indication of an appropriate transition, given the major unexpected changes in the
 macroeconomic situation.



                                            23
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The project had two stages of implementation. Some of the activities were completed
satisfactorily within the original project timeline (including transport, logistics and
regulatory gains in railroads and buses and concession supervision). Significant effort
and resources were spent on preparation, review, launch, implementation, supervision,
and portfolio review. The project was complex, with four components (run by four
ministries), 16 KIRs, 5 IRIs, and a composite PDO. The Bank project team proactively
restructured the project to eliminate the slow disbursement components and supervision
missions were conducted generally every three to four months. The turnover of task
team leaders affected the overall project supervision. However, efforts were made to
perform frequent supervision missions, track key indicators carefully,and hire a field-
based experienced local consultant, who joined the team. in early 2007 and remained
until loan completion. Counterbalancing this effort was the late restructuring, and the
initial inability to force counterparts to improve slow disbursements and slow
implementation. Taking into account the positive and negative aspects of the Bank's
performance, the rating has been set at Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Federal Government was directly responsible for the design, and there is little
evidence that implementing agencies participated in a consultation process during design.
The Federal Government was the actor responsible for the reform framework that led to
rapid economic growth during the life of the project. In this regard a top-down approach
with the Borrower's imposition of some parts of the growth agenda - supported· by the
loan - on some of the Ministries and implementing agencies was considered appropriate
in times of transition to a new administration. In addition to these considerations, nine
factors were considered in assessing government performance.
Government ownership and commitment to development objectives: Borrower's
commitment was reasonable, despite the departure of the Ministry of Science and
Technology due to a procurement dispute. In the other cases, the government was
engaged and committed. Several units used their own funding (in excess of US$2.0
million) to continue the work related to SEGTAP after the loan was closed. This
includes: US$280,OOO for consulting on strategic planning and development of a
taxonomy study of the public sector, US$400,000 for debt management system,
US$75,000 for implementation of Risk Based Supervision approach in CVM,
US$150,000 for research on effectiveness of Judicial System (more detail can be found
in Annex 10).

Enabling environment, supportive policies; The Government maintained its commitment
to support the reforms developed in the original program. In line with the objectives of


                                          24
both DPLs and SEGTAP, the Government introduced significant pieces of legislation to
support the program, inter alia a legal change to unifY tax collection at federal, state and
municipal level for micro and small companies, new bankruptcy law and tax codes
(passed by the lower house of Congress), introduction in Congress of a new law
extending application of antitrust to banks, and completion of the geographical
restructuring of the railways concession.
Adequacy of beneficiary/stakeholder consultations and involvement: Despite the top-
down approach there was an intense dialogue with the executing units especially during
and after the restructuring. Representatives of the ministries consulted the Bank for
advice on project management. The most frequent topic was procurement requirements
of the Bank. After the restructuring, the new PCU took a leading role in seeking advice
from the Bank on procurement issues related to UNDP systems.
Readiness for implementation: The initial PCU was not completely staffed; financial
management and internal control needed strengthening and as late as March 2007 a
Bank financial management specialist rated SEGTAP financial management as
Moderately Unsatisfactory. The four ministries were also not adequately trained and
staffed, which contributed to the slow start, US$1.2 million of retroactive expenditures
that were approved before Effectiveness could have been claimed but due to lapses they
were not.
Timely resolution of implementation issues: The restructuring was justified, but irregular
performance across beneficiary entities and serious procurement disagreements with
UNDP remained unresolved. However, it is not clear that the client could have done
anything more to resolve the latter issues.
Fiduciary Oversight: Despite some technical delays in submitting information to the
Bank, in general most agencies acted diligently in handling the process. One area that
should be commended is the work of the Government external audit agency that
oversaw the actions of the different units. This unit is well prepared and versed in
dealings with the Bank. In several instances the audit agency raised questions about the
eligibility of certain expenses and inadequate planning.
Adequacy of Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements: Most reports, such as end-of-
year reports and other ad-hoc responses to Bank questions, were provided on a timely
basis, procurement tables were updated, and there was reasonable monitoring of
progress on procurement plans. However, the agencies were not focused in measuring
impact.
Relationships and coordination with partners and stakeholders: The initial PCU's
performance and leverage with the ministries were insufficient to allow progress to
pro~eed at the projected pace Only when the Ministry of Finance Economic Policy
Secretariat was replaced by the Ministry's Treasury Office did the situation improve.
The relationship with UNDP was a continuing stakeholder problem.
Adequacy of transition arrangements after loan closing: The APL series was not
included in the restructuring, and the no formal transition arrangements were left in the
pipeline. However, several agencies using their own resources continued follow up work
iIi specific areas utilizing work provided under the loan.



                                            25
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
As mentioned before (in the Monitoring and Evaluation section), the project had two
distinct phases, (i) the design and problematic first implementation stage followed by (ii)
the phase of restructuring and smoother implementation. This coincides with two levels
of commitment and performance of the implementing agencies. During the first phase,
these agencies were given a new assignment and the funds provided offered no
additionality. This meant the participating agencies had to adjust their work plan to
dedicate resources and staff to the activities included in the project. After the
restructuring, due to the preparation work done and the involvement of the supervisor
team, participating agencies performance improved. There was better coordination and
buy-in from agencies However, UNDP's systems and procedures which in many cases·
diverged from Bank's procedure, materially affected the rate of implementation and
disbursement under the project.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The top-down approach from the new government which was undertaking a reform
program was justified. Despite shortcomings in the implementing agencies performance,
the project achieved several important outcomes already discussed, justifying an overall
moderately satisfactory rating. The satisfactory rating granted to Borrowers Performance
by the two DPLs also supports the conclusion. Many of the ministries offices found
important value on the activities and utilized their own resources to complete these
activities when procurement issues prevented them from using SEGTAP funding.
6. Lessons Learned
First and most important lesson keep the project structure simple. An overly
complex design with too many components and activities led to a project that was
difficult to implement, supervise and evaluate. Also, the project specifically tried to
address the possibility of change in Government priorities with flexible architecture.
This flexibility comes with a price at the time of-evaluation when the original objectives
had to be evaluated, although it was appreciated by the Government and matched
changing conditions.
Strong involvement of participating agencies. The big difference between the first
phase and the restructured phase of implementation was a far greater understanding of
the ways the technical assistance loan could reinforce reform efforts supported by the
DPLs and the government's reform agenda. This led to a greater buy-in and an improved
rate of disbursements. By giving the implementing ministries and agencies more of a
voice in choosing specific activities, there was a greater response and appreciation for
the reforms and for project support.

Third party procurement support can be useful or complicate project
implementation. The UNDP has been involved in a number of Bank operations in the


                                           26
past. It is still being used to reduce the risk of judicial complaints and to compensate for
low capacity of some government counterparts. If the SEGTAP experience is any
indication, a third party whose ability and willingness to diligently and efficiently assist
the Bank and the Brazilian Government to implement loans could be a questionable
strategy. In the case of SEGTAP the centralization of UNDP's operational structure did
not help, with the management of many activities taken care of outside the country. In
addition, UNDP's insistence on applying its policies regarding procurement rules
created serious delays. To a certain degree, the UNDP's approach negatively impacted
the overall disbursement of the loan, forcing some of the agencies to use their own
resources to complete project activities. If a stronger project implementing unit had been
responsible for implementation in the early phase of the project, it may not have been
necessary to rely on UNDP for this support and more efficient procurement systems
using Bank practices might have increased project activity significantly.
Small T ALs can be useful to support DPLs. Notwithstanding the design related
problems with this TAL, it is generally useful to have such an operation in place to
support programmatic DPLs and to maintain Bank involvement in reforms and a place at
the table when issues are being sorted out. If this is not possible, then a fee-for-service
arrangement or other possibilities should be explored.
A changing political economic environment can challenge the relevance of a
project's initial design. Great care must be taken in designing projects that will span
more than one government administration and in adapting loan design to changing
environments. Despite the flexible design there are few effective mitigation measures. A
smaller number of SUb-components and implementing agencies might have been a
suitable response to the risks inherent in working on government reform in a changing
political economy. Also the willingness to consider cancelling the loan at an early stage
should have been kept present in the realm of possible courses of action.
PD~, Results and Results Framework, below is a summary of issues related to the
PDQs and results.
   •   There can be too many indicators as well as too few.
   •   PDQs should be well specified and measurable; a PD~ that facilitates an agenda
       is neither.
   •   PDQ indicators should be detailed and not indicated as a number or percentage
       of total indicators. They should each be monitored and evaluated individually.
   •   PDQ indicators should be properly specified and protocols used to clarify their
       meaning.
   •   PDQ indicators' dimensioning should be commensurate and aligned with loan
       objectives. Great care should be taken to align loan activities with the desired
       outcome.
   •   The Results Matrix should be thoroughly and comprehensively specified and
       then downloaded to the ISR.
   •   PD~ indicators need to be selected with care and to reflect important loan
       objectives. They should also be reviewed and appropriately amended during any
       restructuring.

Risk Analysis, this should be elaborated first around political economy, the Results
Matrix and implementation arrangements. Expenditures should reflect Results Matrix
priorities. Mitigating measures Ileed to be specific and useful, not generic.
Dedicated Staff in Country, any· loan but especially complicated ones will benefit from
having experienced staff or consultants on the ground, whose job descriptions and
experience are adequate for supervising and supporting implementation is a good
practice worthy of replication whenever warranted by circumstances.
