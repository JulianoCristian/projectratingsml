"Ratings for the Sustainable and\n            Equitable Growth Technical Assistance Program Project for\n            Brazil were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: an overly complex design with too\n            many components and activities led to a project that was\n            difficult to implement, supervise and evaluate. Also, the\n            project specifically tried to address the possibility of\n            change in Government priorities with flexible architecture.\n            This flexibility comes with a price at the time\n            of-evaluation when the original objectives had to be\n            evaluated, although it was appreciated by the Government and\n            matched changing conditions. The big difference between the\n            first phase and the restructured phase of implementation was\n            a far greater understanding of the ways the technical\n            assistance loan could reinforce reform efforts supported by\n            the Development Policy Loans (DPLs) and the\n            government's reform agenda. This led to a greater\n            buy-in and an improved rate of disbursements. By giving the\n            implementing ministries and agencies more of a voice in\n            choosing specific activities, there was a greater response\n            and appreciation for the reforms and for project support."}, "docdt": "2011-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
