The\n            restructuring is aimed at adjusting project objectives and\n            activities with the current priorities of the Borrower.\n            Changes are also to strengthen project implementation\n            arrangements and facilitate timely disbursement of loan\n            proceeds. The restructuring changes including the following:\n            (i) the inclusion of a new component on fiscal and public\n            resource management; (ii) the strengthening of the financial\n            component, through the inclusion of new activities to be\n            developed by Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios (CVM); (iii) a\n            reassignment of project implementation duties to a different\n            secretariat within the Borrower's Ministry of Finance;\n            (iv) eliminating a component on innovation and technology;\n            and (v) a reallocation of loan proceeds among disbursement\n            Categories, including the assignment of unallocated funds to\n            specific activities. The Bank has extensively worked with\n            the Borrower to define an updated set of activities that,\n            while remaining within the original intent and scope of the\n            project, will improve disbursement and better meet the\n            current needs of the Government. Based on the\n            Government's request and the evolving growth agenda in\n            Brazil, the intermediate development objective (DO) and\n            outcomes related to the science and technology component are\n            dropped. Instead, a new intermediate DO is included for the\n            support of the Borrower's efforts to strengthen its\n            public resource management."}, "docdt": "2008-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
