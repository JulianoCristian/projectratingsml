                         The loan will disburse approximately fifty percent and would have disbursed about 60% if approximately$1.2 million of eligible GoB expenditures had properly been recorded and
                         reimbursed. This amount is lower than what was expected in the previous report. Different procurement processes of the Bank, UNDP and client, as well as changes in UNDP,

                         delayed the execution or several activities. However, the Bank worked closely with the client so the objectives of the loan could be met. The designs of TORs, bidding packages, etc.
                         were finalized. The client's commitment to implement a number of these activities is very strong and will utilize its own (client) funds to finalize them after the loan is closed.
