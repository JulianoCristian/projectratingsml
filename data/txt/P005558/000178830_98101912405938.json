{"cdata!": "The Project aims at rationalizing\n            Syria's state-owned oilseed processing industry by\n            improving the technical efficiency of existing plants and\n            increasing total processing capacity. A factory with a daily\n            capacity to process 300 m tons of cotton seed equivalent\n            would be constructed and equipped at Deir ez Zor; two\n            existing factories in Aleppo would be modernized by the\n            provision of solvent extraction process equipment and a\n            third factory modified; and technical assistance for\n            engineering and design, supervision of construction, test\n            runs and initial operation, training Syrian technicians and\n            a study of the vegetable oil subsector would be provided. At\n            full development vegetable oil processing efficiency and\n            capacity would be increased resulting in an annual gross\n            incremental value of $5.6 million. The financial benefits\n            would accrue to the Government; the incremental oil\n            production would benefit Syrian consumers who would be able\n            to purchase larger quantities of vegetable oil, while\n            increased by-products would benefit some 500,000 livestock\n            farmers by providing a relatively inexpensive supply of feed\n            for the dry season. A failure to increase the availability\n            of oilseeds is the principal risk faced. Technical risks are\n            negligible since processes are tested and proven."}, "docdt": "1978-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
