Project loan\n            will support the government's structural adjustment\n            program and economic recovery by directing economic activity\n            towards areas of Panama's comparative advantage. The\n            strategy aims at creating new growth opportunities by\n            reorienting the economy towards accelerated production of\n            goods for export by the private sector. The main areas\n            covered include: (i) greater efficiency in both the\n            allocation of resources within the public sector and\n            reduction of its scope; (ii) measures to stimulate greater\n            exports orientation and increased employment in the\n            manufacturing sector; and (iii) a new agricultural policy\n            geared towards greater efficiency and a higher volume of\n            goods for export. Supported by the technical assistance\n            project, the government would also undertake a series of\n            studies and technical assistance designed to strengthen the\n            Social Security Agency, extend and deepen reforms in the\n            agricultural and industrial sectors, improve efficiency in\n            the health sector, and improve utilization of transport\n            infrastructure in the vital trans-isthmian corridor."}, "docdt": "1983-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
