express provision to that effect; provided, however, that, if for
any constitutional or other legal reason such provision cannot be

other public assets satisfactory to the Bank.

lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof, solely
as security for payment of the purchase price of such property or
as security for the payment of debt incurred for the purpose of

chase of such property; and (ii) any lien arising in the ordinary


﻿-6-
course of banking transactions and securing a debt maturing not
more than one year after its date.
(c) As used in this Section, the term "public assets" means
assets of the Borrower, of any political or administrative sub-
division thereof and of any entity owned or controlled by, or
