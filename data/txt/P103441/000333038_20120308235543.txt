                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.      The proposed changes to the Chile Second Public Expenditure Management
Project, IBRD Loan 7485, P103441 include: (i) redefinition of project activities including
cancellation of the activities related to the strengthening of the Management Control
System (sub-component 2.2); (ii) revision to the results framework; and (iii) changes in
project financing including the revision in financing sources, reallocation of project costs
by component and of Loan proceeds. Adjustments are required due to a change in
Government strategy or approach and are being made at the request of the Ministry of
Finance to focus the Project’s activities on the consolidation of the Financial Information
System at the Central and Subnational levels, and to drop activities related to sub-
component 2.2 given the Government’s intention to redefine the instruments for
management control and evaluation. The Project Development Objective remains
unchanged. The negotiated legal documents would be revised accordingly.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.     Project implementation and performance is satisfactory. Most PDO and
intermediate indicators are being achieved as planned. Progress towards the achievement
of the PDO includes: (i) increased efficiency of public financial management
administration by upgrading and expanding the national Financial Administration System
(SIGFE), which has been fully developed and is almost completing its implementation;
and increased effectiveness and transparency of public expenditure management at
municipal level by developing a Municipal Financial Information System (SIFIM), which
has been implemented in all the 110 targeted municipalities.

3.      Although the Project has almost fully disbursed the original amount ($24,681,311
out of $24,800,000), the Bank is still involved in the support of key activities to complete
implementation of the financial management system at the central and subnational level
(SIGFE and SIFIM respectively). Main advances in the Project components are
summarized below.

4.      Component 1. Upgrading and Extending the Financial Information System to the
Central Government Entities. The objective of this component is to support the further
development and consolidation of the national Financial Management System - SIGFE
by: (i) upgrading and optimizing the ICT and technical design of SIGFE modules; (ii)
improving its functionality, interoperability and reporting; and (iii) implementing data
standards issued by Normative Entities in all entities using the homologated systems.

5.      Significant progress has been made in this component. The Financial
Management System is almost fully implemented. The Government has closed the
contract with the software developer (Everis) and is currently testing the final release and
resolving the last incidences during the guarantee period. However, the system is still
unstable and fine-tuning is being conducted by external specialists. Depending on the

                                             4
outcome of the tests, the implementation plan may have to be reviewed. The Government
has requested support from the Bank in the final stages of the system’s implementation,
mainly for: (i) reviewing the performance of the system’s final release; (ii) providing
recommendations for the implementation plan; and (iii) providing advice on issues
related to the maintenance of the system (including the bidding process for hiring
maintenance services once the guarantee period is completed).

6.      Component 2. Improvement of Budget Procedures and Mechanisms of the
Management Control System. The objective of this component is to support the efforts
directed to enhance the quality of public expenditures by strengthening the Management
Control System (MCS) and integrating it into the Budget Cycle, mainly through the
development and implementation of (i) a new conceptual model for the Budget Cycle,
linking the budget classification with the information categories of the MCS; (ii) a MCS
information system; and (iii) a new version of the budget formulation system (SIAP) used
by the Budget Directorate (DIPRES).

7.      Progress in this component is modest. Regarding sub-component 2.1, directed to
improving budget procedures, the Government has prepared draft terms of reference for
the development of SIAP II; however, given the delay in the bidding process, the SIAP II
will not be ready for 2012 budget formulation. Regarding sub-component 2.2, directed to
strengthening the MCS, the Government has decided to redefine the instruments for
management control and evaluation, and therefore the sub-component would be dropped.

8.      Component 3. Strengthening Financial Administration at Municipal Level. The
objective of this component is to (i) improve the availability of information on municipal
budgets and on financial transfers; (ii) strengthen financial administration at the
municipal level; and (iii) improve the effective use of central government transfers to
municipalities.

9.      Steady progress has been made in this component. The contract with the firm
CAS Chile to implement the municipal financial management module was closed. The
equipment has been installed in all municipalities; however, some of them have
experienced challenges with the migration of the data and therefore are not using the
system. The Under-secretariat for Regional Development and Administration
(Subsecretaría de Desarrollo Regional y Administración – SUBDERE) is reviewing it on
a case by case basis in order to solve this problem. The SUBDERE and the internal
control body (Contraloria General de la Republica) have reached an agreement regarding
the development of the module to aggregate the information ("aggregator") but there have
been delays in the drafting of the terms of reference and the technical specifications.

10.     Component 4. Project Management. The objective of this component is to
strengthen the Government’s capacity to monitor and supervise the overall
implementation of the Project. The Project Management Unit has performed highly
satisfactory. The project submits bi-annual progress reports where indicators are
monitored and key issues regarding implementation highlighted; and is disbursing faster
than planned. There is a fluid communication between the authorities and the technical
teams to ensure a smooth implementation.

                                            5
11.   The proposed restructuring does not affect the financial management
implementation arrangements. There are no overdue audit reports.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

12.     As indicated above, the Project Development Objective remains unchanged.
However, adjustments are required due to the request of the Government to: (i) focus the
Project’s activities on the consolidation of the Financial Information System at the
Central and Subnational levels; (ii) drop activities related to the strengthening of the
Management Control System (sub-component 2.2) given the Government’s intention to
redefine the instruments for management control and evaluation; and (iii) reduce the
scope of SIAP 2.0, eliminating the development of the interoperability function. Changes
in results indicators and components are described below.

Results/indicators

13.     Adjustments would be made to Project results indicators to align them with
changes being introduced in the Project components. The adjustments in PDO level
indicators and in intermediate results indicators (IRI) are described in detail in Annex 1.

14.     PDO Level Indicators. Indicator 2 related to the Management Control System
has been dropped with the cancellation of sub-component 2.2 and the yearly target values
for the other indicators have been revised to better reflect Project progress.

15.    Component 1. Upgrading and Extending the Financial Information System
to the Central Government Entities: Target values for Indicator 1.i would be revised to
properly capture Project’s advances.

16.    Component 2. Improvement of Budget Procedures and Mechanisms of the
Management Control System: Project sub-component 2.2 would be dropped due to the
Government’s intention to redefine the instruments for management control and
evaluation. Accordingly, indicators 2.i, 2.iii and 2.iv, set to measure progress in this sub-
component, would also be dropped. Indicator 2.ii would be revised to reflect the
reduction in the scope of the SIAP 2.0.

17.    Component 3. Strengthening Financial Administration at the Municipal
Level: Target values for Indicators 3.i and 3.ii would be revised to properly capture
progress in the Component’s activities.

Financing

18.    Under the proposed restructuring, total Project costs would not change. However,
costs by component would change to reflect changes in scope and activities, as follows:

       Component 1: Increase in the total amount as a result of the higher amount of the
       awarded contract, compared to the original estimated amount for the development
       of the system. The revised amounts also reflect a change in the source of
                                             6
          financing, given that, after discussing with the Bank’s technical and procurement
          teams, it was agreed with the government that the system would be funded with
          counterpart financing instead of Bank financing.
          Component 2: Reduction in the total amount as a result of dropped activities and
          the reduction in the scope of SIAP 2.0.
          Component 3: Increase in the total amount as a result of an expansion in the
          coverage of the municipal system to include health and education sectors. To
          accommodate the change in financing for Component 1, this component would
          then be fully Bank-financed.
          Component 4: Reduction of the total amount as a result of a decrease in consultant
          costs due to the creation of the Information Technology Department within the
          DIPRES, responsible of the operation and maintenance of the system.

Reallocations

19.    The proposed restructuring would require reallocation of proceeds by category as
a result of the changes in costs assigned by component. The revised allocation of
proceeds is presented in the table below.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

20.     The proposed restructuring does not change substantially the scope of the Project
nor the amount of funding, and therefore it does not alter the Project’s economic and
financial viability. There are no new social or environmental issues. It does not trigger
new risks or exceptions to Bank policy.
