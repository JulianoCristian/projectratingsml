                         The overall development objective would be to increase the efficiency of operations regarding financial management, budget formulation, and budget execution, and the
                         transparency of public expenditure management at the central and municipal level through the implementation of an updated, functionally enhanced and expanded
                         financial administration system (SIGFE).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Prospects towards achieving the outcomes continue to be moderately satisfactory. While the main system performance issues appear to have been resolved, implementation of the
                         system advanced more slowly than expected (currently being in production in approximately half of the targeted central government institutions (84 out of 173)). The Project is almost
                         fully disbursed (US$24,681,311 disbursed out of US$24,800,000), and all remaining funds are expected to be fully disbursed by project closing.
