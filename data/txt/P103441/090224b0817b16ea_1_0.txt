                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall development objective would be to increase the efficiency of operations regarding financial management, budget formulation, and budget execution, and the
                         transparency of public expenditure management at the central and municipal level through the implementation of an updated, functionally enhanced and expanded
                         financial administration system (SIGFE).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is almost fully disbursed: US$24,681,311 disbursed out of US$24,800,000. Per the government request, the Bank will continue supporting the Budget Office supervising
                         key activities to complete the implementation of the financial management system at the central and subnational level (SIGFE and SIFIM respectively) until the closing date (June, 30
                         2013).

                         Project implementation remains highly satisfactory. The performance issues of the software appeared to be solved. However, the government has adopted a cautious approach
                         slowing down implementation and conducting new performance tests on the system every time it is rolled out to a new group of institutions.
