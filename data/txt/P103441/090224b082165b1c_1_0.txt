                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall development objective would be to increase the efficiency of operations regarding financial management, budget formulation, and budget execution, and the
                         transparency of public expenditure management at the central and municipal level through the implementation of an updated, functionally enhanced and expanded
                         financial administration system (SIGFE).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Prospects towards achieving the outcomes continue to be moderately satisfactory. Despite main system performance issues appear to have been resolved, the implementation of the
                         system was not resumed yet (the Government is preparing to restart implementation with the new fiscal cycle in January 2014). The Project is almost fully disbursed: US$24,681,311
                         disbursed out of US$24,800,000.
