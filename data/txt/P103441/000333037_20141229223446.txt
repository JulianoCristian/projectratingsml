                                                     were revised, and one PDO
                                                     indicator was dropped.

I. Disbursement Profile
    1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      In 2002, with support from the Public Expenditure Management Project (P069259
for US$23.23 million), the Chilean Government had initiated work on a financial
management information system (FMIS) intended to help move Chile from budgeting
practices which narrowly focused on controlling expenditures towards a focus on
promoting the effective and efficient use of resources. By 2007, this system, called
SIGFE (Sistema de Información para la Gestión Financiera del Estado), and
administered by the Budget Directorate in the Ministry of Finance (Dirección de
Presupuesto – DIPRES) and the Office of the Comptroller General (Contraloría General
de la República – CGR), had become a key feature of budget management in Chile, with
coverage equal to roughly 90 percent of the central government and information on
budget execution being much more readily available.

2.     At the time of design, public sector modernization continued to be a top priority
for Chile. 1 The Bachelet administration’s Transparency and Probity Agenda aimed to
ensure accountability in the appropriate use of public funds and high standards for public
services, as well as increasingly decentralized financial management (critical given
municipalities’ key role in service provision) 2 . While the implementation of SIGFE
represented a significant advance in Chile’s financial management system, further efforts
– including updating the technology, ensuring its scalability, adaptability, and
interoperability with other systems, as well as the automation of core modules, linking of
the budget administration system (SIAP), and the mainstreaming of the SIGFE team into
the Government structure - were still pending. At the national level, further work was
also needed to update the Treasury’s cash management processes and strengthen their
connection to SIGFE, as well as to further the integration of the Management, Control
and Evaluation System (MCS) with the budget classification system to enhance the
monitoring and evaluation of public expenditure.

3.      At the municipal level, given the weak financial administration of many
municipalities, their growing responsibilities for service delivery (and hence
administration of greater amounts of public resources) and a lack of aggregate municipal
financial data, work was needed to strengthening financial administration at the


1
  Chile was experiencing an extended period of solid economic growth, having averaged an annual per
capita growth rate of 4.1 percent over the fifteen years since 1990. This growth had helped Chile to reduce
poverty and improve living conditions for the poor, with poverty having been cut from 40 percent in 1990
to 13.6 percent in 2006. However, with the need for continuing progress to address poverty and inequality,
it faced the challenge of sustaining high levels of growth while ensuring that all segments of the population
were able to partake in the benefits of economic prosperity.
2
   As a part of this decentralization of financial management, system of incentives and sanctions was
planned in order to allow municipalities more autonomy in their financial management. Also planned were
steps to improve municipalities’ timely and accurate reporting of information (PAD page 2).



                                                     1
municipal level, and make the mechanisms for collecting such information easier to use,
more efficient, and ensure the accuracy of the data.

4.      With its experience supporting the Government through the Public Expenditure
Management Project as well as at the municipal level through the First and Second
Municipal Development Projects (P006677 and P055480), the Bank was well-positioned
to support Chile in these areas through the Second Public Expenditure Management
Project. Projects objectives were consistent with the Bank’s assistance strategy to Chile
and directly supported the strategic objective of accelerating sustainable growth by
strengthening public sector management (as stated in the 2007 Country Partnership
Strategy (Report No. 38691-CL, discussed by the Board on April 24, 2007)) and the
Chilean Government’s Transparency and Probity Agenda. Project objectives were also in
line with the findings of the 2006 Development Policy Review (Report No. 33501-CL;
June 2006), which concluded that the use of revenues and transfers could be improved by
providing greater discretion to municipalities along with enhanced accountability, as well
as by strengthening institutional capabilities at the local level to further decentralization.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5.     The overall Project Development Objective (PDO) was to increase the efficiency
of operations regarding financial management, budget formulation, and budget execution,
and the transparency of public expenditure management at the central and municipal level
through the implementation of an updated, functionally enhanced and expanded financial
administration system.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

6.      The PDO remained unchanged throughout Project implementation. Following a
Government request, the Project was restructured in March 2012. In this restructuring,
PDO indicator #8 in the table in Annex 10 (related to the dropped subcomponent on the
Management Control System) was eliminated from the Results Framework, the yearly
target values for other PDO indicators were revised to better reflect Project progress, and
the formulation of PDO#1 adjusted somewhat 3. Changes to the PDO indicators can be
seen in Annex 10, and are further described in Section 2.3 (Monitoring and Evaluation).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7.     The Project’s main beneficiaries were to be the Central Government Entities
(CGE) in which the system was to be implemented, including the Ministry of Finance
and the CGR, and the municipalities using the Municipal Financial Information System
(Sistema Financiero Municipal, SIFIM). Moreover, by reducing the lags in the generation


3
  Due to differences between the Results Framework as noted in the first part of Annex 3 of the PAD, and
the PAD’s monitoring matrix, this change was recorded as a change to an intermediate indicator.



                                                    2
of information, the project was to benefit policy-makers both at the central and sub-
national level. Overall, the operation would help to strengthen financial management and
expenditure effectiveness, rendering benefits for taxpayers and users of public services.

1.5 Original Components

8.      Component 1 - Upgrading and Extending the Financial Information System
to the Central Government Entities (US$31.1 million of which US$l7.1 million was
to be financed by the Bank loan): This component was to support the further
development and consolidation of SIGFE to upgrade and expand its functions and
implement it in all Central Government Entities by: (i) upgrading and optimizing the ICT
and technical design of SIGFE modules; (ii) improving its functionality, interoperability,
and reporting; and, (iii) implementing data standards issued by Normative Entities in all
entities using homologated systems.

9.      Component 2 - Improvement of Budget Procedures and Mechanisms of the
Management Control System (US$4.7 million of which US$2.8 million was to be
financed by the Bank loan): This component was to focus on enhancing the quality of
public expenditures by strengthening the Management Control System (MCS) and
integrating them into the Budget Cycle. Specifically, this component was to support the
development and implementation: (i) a new conceptual model for the Budget Cycle,
linking the budget classification and the MCS; (ii) a MCS information system; and (iii) a
new version of the budget formulation system used by DIPRES (SIAP). Innovative
methods of budget formulation would be developed for selected policy modules and the
capacity of DIPRES to undertake results-based monitoring and evaluation was to be
strengthened.

10.    Component 3 - Strengthening Financial Administration at the Municipal
Level (US$7.5 million of which US$4.5 million was to be financed by the Bank loan):
This component was to focus on: (i) improving the availability of information on
municipal budgets and on financial transfers; (ii) strengthening financial administration at
the municipal level; and (iii) improving the effective use of central government transfers
to municipalities, for example within the Municipal Fund (Fondo Común Municipal).
The Office of the Comptroller General in partnership with the Sub-secretariat for
Regional Development within the Ministry of the Interior (Subsecretaría de Desarrollo
Regional y Administración - SUBDERE) was to implement this component.

11.     Component 4 - Project Management (US$3.4 million of which US$0.4 million
was to be financed by the Bank loan): This component was to cover operating expenses,
related to the following activities: (i) Provision of technical assistance to Central
Government Entities as part of the implementation of SIFGE or SIGFE-compatible
financial administration systems; (ii) Strengthening the Government’s capacity to
monitor and supervise the overall implementation of the Project.




                                             3
1.6 Revised Components

12.     The Project was restructured in March 2012 following a Government request to
(i) focus on the consolidation of the system at central and subnational levels; (ii) drop
activities related to the strengthening of the Management Control System (sub-
component 2.2) given the Government’s intention to redefine the instruments for
management control and evaluation; and (iii) reduce the scope of SIAP 2.0, eliminating
the development of the interoperability function.

1.7 Other significant changes

13.    During the March 2012 restructuring, loan proceeds were reallocated between
components and expenditure categories as detailed in Annex 11. Subsequently, following
an official request from the Government in June 2014, the closing date was extended
from June 30, 2013 to June 30, 2014 in order to continue to provide Bank technical
support to the completion of implementation.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

14.     The ICR finds the quality at entry to be Moderately Satisfactory due to the
Project’s overall comprehensive design, combined with some complications that later
arose during implementation and which could have been better anticipated at design.

15.    The Project was intended to build upon past Bank support and the achievements
made under the previous Project by continuing to consolidate and expand the SIGFE
system. A number of studies 4 confirmed that Chile’s recent reforms had left in place a
high level of fiscal transparency and a budgeting system that clearly articulated
government priorities, with tools that allowed for the evaluation of budget performance.
The country had also completed the first stage in the adaptation of its fiscal statistics to
the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM), and introduced a new
functional classification of expenditures in line with the GFSM.

16.    However, as indicated by international experience, the consolidation and
deepening of public sector reforms requires continuous modernization. In the case of
Chile, SIGFE was facing technical challenges that needed to be resolved in order to
extend coverage to all public entities. The system’s technology had to be updated to
allow for a faster processing of financial transactions and automation of the core
modules. In terms of subnational financial management and transparency, there was
space to improve the effective use of public money by increasing the responsibilities of

municipalities to manage resources, along with supporting greater accountability and
increased institutional capacities at the local level 5.

17.    The Project had strong political support from the highest authorities. It was to be
implemented by the same PIU managing SIGFE, established in DIPRES, which had
gained considerable experience both in the implementation of a public financial
management system and in working with Bank procedures. The PIU reported directly to
the Deputy Budget Director, who served as project coordinator and was responsible for
implementation. In addition to the overall project implementation, DIPRES was
responsible for the execution of Components 1 and 2, while SUBDERE was responsible
for Component 3.

18.     Lessons from the previous project were considered during preparation. Moreover,
project design identified several mitigation measures to tackle risks that might have
affected both the overall PDO and component results. To address difficulties in
coordination between DIPRES and other branches of government, and reluctance from
individual entities to support the system as a potential risk, a users’ committee that was
consulted during the development of the system was created. Other risks, related to the
implementation of SIFIM in municipalities with weak technical and institutional capacity
and possible municipal resistance to providing timely reports on their financial
information to the central government, were proactively managed by SUBDERE.

19.     However, the PAD did not identify either the risks of having to regain political
support after a change in government administration, or those that using state of the art
technology can pose in terms of limited availability of expertise – two factors which in
practice contributed to delays. Project preparation also did not fully consider the
coordination arrangements between DIPRES, SUBDERE and CGR for the design and
implementation of the municipal information aggregator, and this shortcoming was felt
during the implementation of this activity, as described in Section 2.2. Other issues
encountered during implementation and described in greater detail below related to
differences of opinion in procurement procedures (See Section 2.2) and monitoring
arrangements (See Section 2.3) could have been resolved through a more detailed
analysis of the arrangements set forth in the PAD.

2.2 Implementation

20.     The Project was signed in November 2007, and became effective on February 27,
2008. As mentioned, implementation arrangements were similar to those in the previous
project. To promote the further institutionalization of the system, near the end of 2008,
the Information Technology Division (División de Tecnologías de Información-DTI) was
created within DIPRES, where the PIU was hosted.

21.    Overall, the project was very ambitious, covering three key areas of work in
public financial management, each of which with its own complexities. During
implementation, a series of challenges directly related to SIGFE II were encountered.
Some of these issues (described in detail below) had implications not only on the pace of
implementation of the SIGFE II system , but also upon other areas of Component 1 as
well as the other two components, as efforts were concentrated on the successful
implementation of SIGFE II.

       Implementation of Component 1

22.     System design. Some initial system design choices affected the implementation of
SIGFE II, adding extra layers of complexity to an already ambitious project. In order to
ensure that the system would remain up to date, the Government elected to use a state of
the art technology (which by nature can pose a risk due to the lack of experience and
knowledge associated with its use, as well as a lack of performance and testing tools),
that introduced technical challenges during implementation. Additionally, the conceptual
design of the system envisioned an excessive level of flexibility (the system can be
adapted to requirements from different institutions and to normative changes, and
information can be aggregated and presented in multiple ways), something which
contributed to additional challenges during the development of SIGFE II.

23.     System development. SIGFE II introduced new functionalities, such as
government asset administration and management of international credits, and a module
for financial audit, among others. While the main functional model and system
architecture were defined in-house by DIPRES, in order to avoid having to hire and
manage a large team of highly specialized IT staff, the Government contracted out IT
development (programming) of a custom made solution. During the bidding process to
hire the software developing company, due to differences with the Bank regarding
procurement procedures, the Government opted to finance this activity with its own
resources and speed up the process.

24.      Once the firm was hired, and the development of the system was initiated, several
issues posed challenges to the system’s development. First, technical issues which took
time to resolve due to limited knowledge about the technology resulted in some delays.
Second, the project lacked a robust testing site in which the firm’s deliverables could be
comprehensively tested before implementation in the institutions, leading to the
discovery of some system issues only following the initial roll-out of SIGFE II. Third, the
terms of the associated contract left the Government and the company with little
flexibility to solve quality and performance issues in an expeditious manner. Finally, with
the change in administration in March 2010 - and a change of the political party for the
first time in 20 years – implementation suffered a temporary halt (between 3 to 4 months)
while the new government became familiar with the Project’s objectives and assessed
their alignment with its priorities.

25.    Roll-out of SIGFE II. System roll-out started in mid-2011. The implementation
plan envisioned finalizing the year with 85 agencies using SIGFE II exclusively. Some



                                            6
institutions were first time users of SIGFE. However, in many agencies which were
already users of SIGFE, the new system was tested while SIGFE continued to be used,
implying that SIGFE and SIGFE II were operating in parallel. While international experts
who accompanied supervision missions favored a big bang approach to implementation -
that is, implementing the system at the beginning of the fiscal year in all agencies at the
same time (which would not have required the maintenance costs or duplication of
financial management transactions associated with operating the two systems at the same
time, and which would have expedited the change process), DIPRES maintained a more
gradual approach, similar to the one previously used in the successful implementation of
SIGFE I 6.

26.     During implementation, performance issues not identified in integrated testing
processes 7 began to arise with the system in November 2011. This forced DIPRES to
come up with a contingency plan that included hiring additional staff to strengthen the
software architecture, and hiring a specialized firm to perform enhanced software quality
control. In January 2013 implementation was paused until system errors could be reduced
considerably. At that point, the system had been implemented in 55 agencies. System
implementation restarted in January 2014.

27.     As part of SIGFE II’s gradual implementation, the integration of several key
entities, including the Ministry of Public Works and the pension administration, was
planned. While progress was made with these entities, it was more limited than had been
expected. In the case of the Ministry of Public Works, feasibility studies were carried out,
but did not proceed to implementation of SIGFE. Within the pension administration, in
2008, as a result of Law 20.255, the Institute of Social Security Standardization’s
(Instituto de Normalización Previsional, INP) (now called the Institute of Employment
Security (Instituto de Seguridad Laboral, ISL)) functions and responsibilities were, with
the exception of those ascribed to the INP in Law 16.744, transferred to the Institute of
Social Security (Instituto de Previsión Social, IPS). As the ISL was a new institution,
SIGFE II was implemented there in 2011. While the necessary preparatory work was
carried out in the IPS, organizational changes in 2012/2013 impacted the implementation
plans and its integration with SIGFE is still pending.

        Implementation of Component 2

28.     Implementation of this component was impacted by both pressure to finalize and
implement SIGFE II successfully as well as a change in Government priorities. The
issues faced during the implementation of SIGFE II mentioned above put considerable
strain on the technical staff at the DTI, slowing the progress in the development of SIAP
2.0. During 2009-2010, necessary preparatory work for development of the updated

system (including collection of information on budgetary processes; an analysis of
alternative technologies; and requests for information on available tools) were carried
out. A bidding process for its implementation was carried out in 2012, but as a result of
budget reassignments and the desire to prioritize development of SIGFE II, the contract
was not awarded.

29.     Following the change of administration in 2010, the decision was made to
redefine the instruments for management control and evaluation before they would be
integrated into the budget cycle. As a result, Subcomponent 2.2 was dropped from the
operation.

       Implementation of Component 3

30.     As in Component 1, the development of the municipal financial system was
contracted out to a firm. The implementation of the system faced several challenges,
some of which are usually encountered in most subnational projects: resistance from
some local authorities, in particular those in the political opposition; lack of technical
capacity and high rotation of local public staff; and problems in the coordination with
other agencies. Most of these issues were successfully overcome and the implementation
of the system was accomplished successfully, resulting in significant progress in terms of
management of municipal finances, and transparency and timeliness of municipal
information.

31.     The original scope of this component was expanded once project implementation
started (from 100 municipalities to 122 municipalities and 10 municipal corporations,
including health and education sectors). Technical support to the municipalities were
SIFIM was implemented (subcomponent 3.2) was financed with funds from the loan,
which also included the municipal financial management system and IT equipment. The
network connection, data center and the system to aggregate the information from all
municipalities (subcomponent 3.1) was financed with local funds. Because of the larger
scope and other costs not anticipated at design (such as IT support, management and
control systems, IT storage, and back-ups) this component was underfunded, causing
delays in the implementation of the municipal system aggregator (which has been
developed, is expected to be rolled out in 2015) until funding became available.

32.     Coordination between SUBDERE, DIPRES and CGR also posed a challenge to
the design and implementation of the municipal information aggregator. During the
Project, the Bank played a key role in bringing the three institutions together in technical
meetings, promoting and coordinating a memorandum of understanding to determine i)
the role of each institution within the system; and ii) the type of information that would
be requested from municipalities and shared by the three institutions.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

33.     The Project’s M&E framework is considered to be moderately unsatisfactory. A
set of indicators covering all Project components was prepared at design. Annex 3 of the
PAD specified seven Project Outcome Indicators in its presentation of the Results


                                             8
Framework (pages 39-40). Three of these indicators were presented as PDOs in the
matrix detailing the Arrangements for Results Monitoring (pages 45-46), two appeared in
the section presenting results indicators by Component, two were not included in the
matrix (which subsequently resulted in their not being specifically monitored during
implementation), and one additional indicator was included in the matrix (See Annex 10
for an overview). In 2012, the restructuring used the Results Monitoring matrix from the
PAD as the basis for adjustments made at that time. For purposes of evaluating Project
Results, Section 3 of this ICR will use the seven indicators from pages 39-40 of the PAD
as well as the additional PDO indicator appearing in the PAD’s results monitoring matrix,
any adjustments made to these indicators in the March 2012 restructuring, and additional
supporting information. While perhaps weighted more towards the objective of
improving the efficiency of financial management operations and with some indicators
corresponding to multiple aspects of the PDO, overall, the original PDO indicators
measured each of the four objectives.

34.     The PIU established a Project Management Office (PMO) within the DTI to
monitor progress on Project activities. The PMO met bi-weekly with the coordinator of
each activity to track progress and prepared a dashboard with project indicators, risk, and
mitigation measures for the management. Regular supervision missions, including the
Bank supervision team and technical experts were carried out, and at least two
Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) were filed each calendar year.
However, given that many results indicators did not record any progress in ISRs filed
during the first years of implementation, it seems that M&E design was not well-suited
for tracking progress during the initial stages of the project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

35.    During implementation some procurement challenges were encountered. As
mentioned in Section 2.2, due to differences between the Bank and the Government
regarding procurement procedures, the Government decided to finance SIGFE II’s
software development with its own resources. Procurement ratings were Satisfactory in
ISRs through ISR#6 in September 2009 8. In January 2010, the rating was downgraded to
Moderately Satisfactory9 and it remained there throughout the rest of implementation.

36.     Financial management performance is considered to have been Satisfactory. The
Second Public Expenditure Management Project has been characterized by the use of
country systems and pre-financing of eligible expenditures by the government and
reimbursements from the Bank. Overall, the project maintained adequate financial
management arrangements during project implementation. Project budgeting, accounting,
treasury, and auditing arrangements were fully integrated into country systems and the
project fully complied with Bank requirements related to financial reporting and auditing.

Besides the use of country systems, the project has also benefited from maintaining
qualified and experienced staff, which contributed to a successful implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

37.      As of Project closure, advances related to SIGFE II and SIFIM have been well-
institutionalized. The creation of the DTI within DIPRES in 2008 marked an important
step in the institutionalization of SIGFE within the Government. Given the nature of
such FMIS projects - which makes it nearly impossible to revert to the old system once a
new one has been rolled out - as well at the incorporation of half of the central
government entities within SIGFE II, continuing advances are expected in the future, and
the incorporation of 31 additional institutions is already planned for 2015. Similarly,
SIFIM has been successfully implemented in the targeted 100 municipalities, helping to
improve their financial management processes, and SUBDERE is committed to
continuing to support the system. While as discussed further in Section 3, the completion
of some of the activities planned under the Project is still pending, achievements to date
provide a strong foundation for future work, and the Government has already defined
short-term timelines for continuing work to finish the SIAP and municipal aggregator.

38.    While the Bank does not currently have immediate plans for a follow-up project,
the topics addressed under the Project remain of high relevance and are expected to
continue to remain such in the future. From a financial perspective, having disbursed
more than 99 percent of Project funds by December 2011 and continued activities to
advance on Project objectives financed through local funds since that time, the
Government has demonstrated a clear commitment to these objectives well-beyond the
scope of the loan which is fully expected to be maintained.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

39.     Overall project relevance is considered to be substantial. The Project’s objectives
are fully consistent with the 2011-2016 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) (Report Nº
57989-CL, discussed by the Board on February 15, 2011), with public sector
modernization identified as a key results area, and improving performance and public
financial management being noted as one of the five subareas of focus (and the Project
being identified as one of the Bank’s instruments in this area). The Project was also well
aligned with President Bachelet’s Government Program for 2014-2018 10 , in which
continuing work to further improve medium term budget planning is noted as a
component of efforts to ensure fiscal responsibility.

40.     The relevance of project design and implementation is considered to be
substantial. Design focused on key areas of financial management processes requiring
modernization at both the central and municipal levels and was well-suited to support the
Project’s stated objectives. While an adjustment in priorities resulted in some changes to
the original design (e.g. dropping of Subcomponent 2.2 related to the MCS and
prioritization of attention to SIGFE II) and the performance issues encountered with
SIGFE II resulted in a slower than expected roll-out of the system, implementation
arrangements were highly responsive to the circumstances encountered and supported the
necessary adjustments through the project restructuring, the extension of the closing date,
and other forms of proactive implementation support.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

41.     Overall, the Project is viewed to have demonstrated substantial efficacy in
achieving its development objective of increasing the efficiency of operations regarding
financial management, budget formulation, and budget execution, and the transparency of
public expenditure management at the central and municipal level through the
implementation of an updated, functionally enhanced and expanded financial
administration system.

42.     The objective related to the efficiency of financial management operations has
been substantially achieved. SIGFE II improved the efficiency of financial management
operations mainly through changing the management model as well as the operation of
the system from a model based on accounting transactions to one based on
administrative/financial transactions. Those changes contributed to simplifying processes,
reducing the requirement of high accounting skills to operate the system, and providing
better performance management information for decision making.

43.     Operationalizing this reform, the SIGFE II system has been developed and
implemented in 86 institutions (50 percent of the target), and this number is expected to
continue to rise in the future as following the resolution of past performance issues, it will
now be possible to devote resources to the development of the capabilities necessary to
encourage the accession of other entities 11. Activities undertaken with other key entities
have also laid the groundwork for increased integration in the near future. As mentioned
above, progress towards implementation of SIGFE II has progressed more slowly than
expected in the IPS following organizational changes in 2012/2013, but advances to date
include the analysis of existing processes and gaps, definition of the operational model,
and the initiation of work on an accounting converter. Similarly, while the Ministry of
Public Works has not implemented SIGFE II, critical preparatory work for the agency’s
future use of SIGFE II or design of a homologation strategy – including analyses of
existing processes, the potential value-added to be provided to the Ministry through use
of the system, and gaps needing to be addressed by the Ministry before using SIGFE II –
was executed under the course of the Project. The eventual future incorporation of these


11
     As mentioned above, the incorporation of 31 new institutions is planned for 2015.



                                                      11
entities – which account for a significant fraction of transactions within Chile – will
represent an important step in increasing SIGFE II’s coverage, with important positive
implications for the efficiency of financial management operations in Chile.

44.      As a result of these advances, information is now available more quickly,
facilitating more efficient financial management. For institutions within the coverage of
the central government (except the Public Treasury), following the monthly closing
period on the 8th of each month, information is aggregated in SIGFE the next working
day (achievement of PDO#1 and partial achievement of PDO#4). The Public Treasury’s
interconnection and reporting systems have also been improved. They are now sending
weekly and monthly information to SIGFE, and potential strategies for making the
system compatible with SIGFE II (homologation) were carried out, paving the way for
future work 12.

45.     At the municipal level, the successful development and rollout of the municipal
financial administration system (SIFIM) which covers budgeting, accounting, recovery
orders, treasury, procurement, personnel and remuneration in 100 municipalities
(achievement of PDO#6) represents a significant advancement in Chile, ensuring the
compatibility of information provided to different central government agencies and
timely access to information. 13 Municipalities using the system now do not have to enter
information in multiple systems. The system facilitates communication with other
information systems, generates automatic reports, and facilitates medium term financial
planning.

46.     The two objectives related to the efficiency of budget formulation and execution
have also been substantially achieved. SIGFE is now automatically updated with
information from SIAP on the initial budget law each year (although manual updates of
budget modifications made during the year continue) and information entered into the
payments module of SIGFE is now automatically reflected in budget execution (partial
achievement of PDO#2). Based on information from performance and scalability tests, it
is projected that the system has the processing capacity to manage the targeted 200,000
financial transactions per day with a response time of 8 seconds (achievement of
PDO#3), allowing for up to date information for decision making. While SIAP 2.0 has
not been developed, as mentioned above, new bidding documents are under preparation,
and the process is expected to be carried out in 2015. Once implemented, SIAP 2.0 will
contribute to more efficient budget formulation. At the municipal level, the
implementation of the SIFIM system in 100 municipalities (described above, PDO#6) has
contributed to greater efficiency in budget formulation and execution through the
inclusion of a budget module.




12
   It is important to clarify that in Chile, the Treasury is responsible for revenue collection but not for
payments; responsibility for payments is decentralized and lies within each entity.
13
    Previously, information was heterogeneous and difficult to combine.



                                                    12
47.     Finally, the objective related to transparency was substantially achieved. As
mentioned above, the timely access to information captured through achievement of
PDO#1 points to improved mechanisms to support oversight and transparency. Entities
now have real time, online access to their information, and oversight entities have access
to information the next day after the end of the period, facilitating accountability. At the
municipal level, the upcoming launch of the municipal information aggregator (expected
in 2015, partial achievement of PDO#7), for which the software and hardware have been
purchased and the system installed, will ensure that DIPRES, SUBDERE and CGR are
all working with a single source of information.

48.     See Annex 11 for presentation of the PDO indicators and their achievement.

3.3 Efficiency

49.     Overall project efficiency is considered to have been modest. Neither the net
present value nor the economic rate of return were calculated in the PAD. A list of
Project benefits noted to “testify to its economic and financial soundness” – and which
emphasized the processing efficiencies to be delivered by the new system as well as its
potential to reduce costs – was presented in the Economic and Financial Analysis. Total
registered project costs (including local support) for the Project which was implemented
over the course of six and a half years are U.S $81.56 million (approximately U.S. $34.9
million more than expected at design, with the difference coming from the allocation of
additional local funds). The higher than expected costs are due to a variety of factors,
including the additional costs implied by using a gradual implementation strategy
requiring the parallel operation of SIGFE I for longer than anticipated and the need to
hire support to address the performance challenges encountered during implementation.
Additionally, hardware and software were purchased for all institutions at once, even
though a gradual implementation strategy was to be followed.

50.     When costs ascribed to local support but not directly imputable to the Project are
excluded 14, total Project costs decrease to U.S. $70.04 million (compared to anticipated
costs of U.S. $46.62 million); a figure that while larger than expected, is less than the
PAD estimates of the cost of comparable systems 15. Additionally, it is important to note
that the time taken to implement SIGFE II is below the average found in World Bank
research for completed FMIS projects (7.9 years), and together the cumulative time for
SIGFE I and II (approximately 11 years) is also less than the time required for back-to-
back FMIS projects in other countries in the region. 16



14
   These include three amortization repayments of the loan and the corresponding interest (U.S. $8.016
million) and operational costs for SIGFE I in the first half of 2008 (U.S. $3.51 million).
15
   According to Annex 9 of the PAD, “[c]omparable projects in other countries are costing an estimated one
hundred percent more than SIGFE.”

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

51.     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The Project’s overall outcome rating is
considered to be Moderately Satisfactory (See Table 1). Over the course of
implementation, the Project made substantial progress towards its development objective
of increasing the efficiency of operations regarding financial management, budget
formulation, and budget execution and the transparency of public expenditure
management at the central and municipal levels. The operation’s objectives remain highly
relevant for both the Government and the Bank, and given the substantial relevance of
design and implementation, overall relevance is considered substantial. While higher than
anticipated, Project costs were in line with comparable projects, leading to an overall
assessment of modest Project efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
52.     This Project has supported Chile’s more efficient and effective management of its
resources through its focus on financial management, budget formulation and budget
execution. While the Project was not designed to have a direct impact on poverty,
gender or social development, these improvements - and the more effective use of
resources they imply – could help to support the Government’s achievement of key
public policy priorities - including policies or programs focused on such areas.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

53.     This project has had a significant impact on institutional change and
strengthening. Through the work undertaken on the SIGFE II system as well as advances
related to the Public Treasury, the Ministry of Finance has strengthened its ability to
oversee Chile’s budget execution. Importantly, by developing SIGFE II with its greater
focus on facilitating usability and management (instead of a pure accounting focus) the
Ministry of Finance has strengthened the Government’s ability to more effectively and
efficiently manage financial resources through improved information management and
sharing (see Section 3.2 for a detailed account of improvements) – advances important
for continuing improvements in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency. As
a natural part of accompanying the development of SIGFE II, implementation has also
strengthened the Ministry’s capacity to manage the various aspects of work related to the
development and operation of its financial management system – including the
incorporation of additional, pending functionalities and the ability to respond to technical



                                               14
issues as they arise during implementation – making it well-equipped to continue to
support the system in the future.

54.     The Project’s work at the municipal level has also had several important impacts
in the area of institutional strengthening. Importantly, implementation of the municipal
financial administration system SIFIM in the targeted 100 municipalities has both
improved the central government’s ability to monitor municipal finances and also
provided the opportunity to provide municipalities with the tools (equipment, training,
systems, etc.) necessary to enhance municipal public management. The project has also
supported the strengthening of institutional connections between entities, with
collaboration agreements between DIPRES and the Treasury, as well as DIPRES,
SUBDERE and CGR forming the foundation for various aspects of work carried out
under the Project.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

55.    No unintended outcomes or impacts have been identified.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
56.    Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

57.      Rating: Moderate. The design, development and rollout of the SIGFE II system
represent a significant advance in Chile’s financial management. With the past
performance issues now resolved and approximately half of the central government
entities using the system (and additional entities expected to join in the near future),
SIGFE II is well on its way to achieving the critical mass necessary to become the
Government’s dominant financial management system. Through the implementation
process, the Government has gained substantial experience in operating the system and
trouble-shooting the various problems that have arisen, and is well-equipped to continue
to do so following project completion. While it was not possible to completely implement
all of the anticipated activities (e.g. development of SIAP 2.0, etc.), the work undertaken
under this Project serves as a solid foundation for future advances which are anticipated
in the short to medium-term.

58.     At the municipal level, the implementation of the SIFIM has provided
participating municipalities not only with needed equipment and systems to better
manage their financial information, but also with training targeted toward enhancing local
staff’s capacity. There is demand for the incorporation of additional municipalities, with
the Government regularly receiving requests for addition to the system. There are plans
for municipalities using the system to provide training to their peer municipalities in its
use, important for both strengthening municipal capacity as well as shifting responsibility
for the system to the municipal level.

59.     However, some challenges remain. In spite of SIGFE II’s greater focus on
usability, the incorporation of the remaining large central government entities is still


                                            15
pending and the parallel operation of the SIGFE I and II systems could make the
transition period between the two systems longer than expected. At the municipal level,
SIFIM continues to be financed by the central government, leading to some questions
about its long term sustainability. Additionally, the high rotation of municipal staff with
political cycles may require regular efforts to maintain effective municipal use of the
system.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

60.    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. During project preparation, the Bank team
drew upon its significant experience in Chile in general, as well as its specific experience
working with the SIGFE I system, allowing for the incorporation of important lessons
learned into project design.

61.     However, given the challenges encountered during implementation, which
resulted in the prioritization of activities related to SIGFE II (and the putting on hold of
other areas of work), it seems that implementation risks and their effects on the Project
were not fully anticipated at the design stage. Moreover, the issues encountered during
implementation related to the procurement method to be used to develop SIGFE II
suggests that procurement arrangements could have benefited from a more thorough
examination at the time of design, as could have the Results Framework and its
monitoring matrix so as to ensure better alignment between the two.

(b) Quality of Supervision

62.     Rating: Satisfactory. The Bank team provided continual and strong technical and
implementation support during Project execution. Its ability to convene the international
expertise critical to the development of SIGFE II, as well as its support in addressing the
performance issues encountered following rollout, were highly valued by the counterpart,
helping to promote technical dialogue and ensure the continuing advancement towards
project objectives 17. While the 2012 restructuring represents a strong effort to adjust to
the evolving implementation context and its impact on Government priorities, a more
detailed review of Annex 3 of the PAD at that time could have helped to adjust for the
differences between its Results Framework and its matrix for results monitoring.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance




17
  Implementation support missions included a mix of international experts (from OEDC and other LAC
countries) and IT experts to support the government in solving functional and IT issues that appeared
during implementation (see implementation support aide memoires).



                                                 16
63.     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. Overall Bank performance is considered to
have been moderately satisfactory. While at design it did not completely anticipate some
of the challenges that would arise, its proactive and tailored support during
implementation was critical to ensuring continued progress towards project objectives
and solidifying Chile’s capacity to continue such efforts in the future outside of the scope
of the Project.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

64.     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The Government played a crucial role during
the implementation of the project. It demonstrated a strong commitment to Project
objectives, with the deployment of SIGFE II continuing to advance in spite of mid-
Project changes in government administrations. Nevertheless, these changes in
administration did contribute to some delays as work to date was analyzed and priorities
re-examined. When combined with the technical performance issues encountered during
SIGFE II’s rollout, this impacted the pace with which work on the SIGFE II system was
able to advance as well the progress achievable under the other areas of the project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

65.     Rating: Satisfactory. The institutional arrangements for the implementation of
the project were devised to ensure continuity with the previous operation, and in practice,
provided a strong foundation for work under this Project. The PIU established within
DIPRES was successfully assimilated into the Government’s structure during Project
implementation, and comprised a very solid project management and technical team.
During implementation, it did a good job of adjusting to the range of challenges
encountered (including both the technical issues associated with the SIGFE system as
well as shifting Government priorities), proactively adjusting to the circumstances and
seeking solutions where possible.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

66.    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. Overall Borrower performance is considered
to be moderately satisfactory. While the Project’s broad scope, technical issues and
changes in administration did pose some challenges to implementation, projects of this
nature are always complex, and both the Government as a whole as well as the
implementing agency did a very good job of adjusting to the realities encountered and
supporting the continuing progress towards the development objective via the rollout of
SIGFE II and SIFIM, while also continuing progress towards other Project goals.

6. Lessons Learned

67.    Planning for the implementation of FMIS should be sure to allocate
adequate time for development, testing, incorporation of user feedback, and
implementation, and take the abundant international experience available into
account. The time envisioned for redesigning SIGFE II’s functionalities, updating,


                                            17
developing and rolling out the system to all entities proved to be too short, and an
extension of the closing date was ultimately requested in order to complete the
implementation of the system, following a temporary suspension of its roll-out due to
software performance issues. While not available at the time of design, future projects
should reflect upon existing wide-scale studies of similar projects 18.

68.     While the use of the most state-of-the-art and newest technology available
can provide benefits, it may also imply additional risks for implementation – and it
is important to balance these risks against the benefits. Using such technology can
confer important benefits, including increased usability, while perhaps lessening the need
to engage in as many updates in the future. However, potential risks include more
expensive and lengthier implementation periods. In the case of SIGFE II, these risks
associated with the use of such technology materialized.

69.      Both big-bang and gradual implementation processes for FMIS systems
present challenges, and there does not seem to be an easy answer as to which is the
better approach. In the case of Chile, the decision to proceed gradually allowed it to
initiate implementation (and deal with the issues that arose) without risking impacting the
entirety of the government, and shift towards a more aggressive strategy only when such
problems had been addressed. Nevertheless, this strategy has its costs – requiring that
resources continue to be allocated to both the old system and the new one – and may
diminish individual institution’s incentives to transition to the new system.

70.     While bundling central government FMIS projects with other reforms may
make sense from technical perspective, the value-added of doing such may be
limited by implementation constraints. The broad scope of this Project, covering both
the central and municipal levels, created a supportive environment for important
advances in Chile’s financial management which have already started to have positive
impacts in the timeliness of available information. Nevertheless, given the challenges
often associated with FMIS projects, it is important to consider and plan for the trade-offs
that may be necessary and their impact on full achievement of the development objective.

71.     As FMIS are designed to extend beyond one political administration, such
political transitions should be managed and accounted for in project design and
supervision. In the case of this Project, while political changes resulted in some slowing
of implementation and the re-prioritization of non-central activities, roll-out of the SIGFE
II was able to successfully continue given the strong technical orientation of the work and
an institutionalized foundation which transcended government administrations.

72.    When transitioning from one operational platform to a new one, assigning
separate human and technological resources is critical. Given that some staff were
shared between SIGFE I and II, when issues arose with SIGFE I, in order to ensure the
continued operation of the existing system, attention to SIGFE I had to be prioritized over
SIGFE II.

73.    In projects of this magnitude, it is important that the directorate leading it
have all of the necessary competencies related to technology, finances, budgeting,
and management capacity. When all of these are not present, it can cause challenges
that impact quality, time and/or costs.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

As noted in the main text, neither the net present value nor the economic rate of return
were calculated in the PAD. A list of Project benefits noted to “testify to its economic
and financial soundness” – and which emphasized the processing efficiencies to be
delivered by the new system as well as its potential to reduce costs – was presented in the
Economic and Financial Analysis.

Total registered project costs (including local support) for the Project which was
implemented over the course of six and a half years are U.S $81.56 million
(approximately U.S. $34.9 million more than expected at design, with the difference
coming from the allocation of additional local funds). The higher than expected costs are
due to a variety of factors, including not having fully captured the costs of implementing
SIGFE II in institutions (including the additional costs implied by using a gradual
implementation strategy requiring the parallel operation of SIGFE I), the high cost of
hardware and software, and the need to hire support to address the performance
challenges encountered during implementation.

When costs ascribed to local support but not directly imputable to the Project are
excluded, total Project costs decrease to U.S. $70.04 million (compared to anticipated
costs of U.S. $46.62 million); a figure that while larger than expected, is less than the
PAD estimates of the cost of comparable systems . Moreover, the time taken to
implement SIGFE II is below the average for completed FMIS projects (7.9 years), and
together the cumulative time for SIGFE I and II (approximately 11 years) is also less than
the time required for back-to-back FMIS projects in other countries in the region.

its preparation.

The draft ICR was shared with the Counterpart and their comments have been
incorporated. In regards to the lessons learned, they noted that they did not agree that
the sharing of some staff impacted the implementation of SIGFE II, given the stability of
SIGFE I.
