outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory; the risk to\n            development outcome was satisfactory; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and the Borrower performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: An\n            adequate political climate is crucial for project success\n            when there are many actors involved, particularly in a\n            decentralization process. Although the project had a good\n            start mobilizing resources and support from the\n            municipalities involved in developing a decentralized\n            system, further steps for implementing it were stalled by a\n            mix of different approaches to resource allocations, but\n            most importantly by the political climate that took place in\n            Venezuela during most of the 2002-04 period. Different\n            positions on how to implement a decentralized program became\n            insurmountable and the project suffered from this struggle,\n            leading to a sizable reduction in project scope. Although\n            the participation of many political actors was acknowledged\n            during appraisal as an important risk factor, it was not\n            possible to have foreseen that. The political environment\n            will make it impossible to implement a decentralized scheme\n            as originally conceived. When supporting a decentralization\n            process, project implementation is best placed as low as\n            possible within the available institutional structure."}, "docdt": "2007-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
