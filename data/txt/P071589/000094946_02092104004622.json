"In support of Jamaica's\n            fifteen-year program to reform secondary education, the\n            Project will improve the quality, and equity of secondary\n            education, and expand access to upper secondary education,\n            as well as strengthen the capacity of the central ministry,\n            and regional offices to manage, and monitor the reform. The\n            components of the Second Reform of the Secondary Education\n            Project will: 1) finance grants to selected secondary\n            schools, on the basis of annual work programs, and budgets\n            for activities designed to improve student outcomes, as well\n            as direct costs associated with preparing, and implementing\n            school improvement plans. Technical assistance (TA) will\n            support the preparation of a school improvement plan manual,\n            and training materials, while training assistance in school\n            development, and management will be provided; 2) finance\n            centrally coordinated activities that complement the bottom\n            up approach, and support all-age schools not eligible for\n            school improvement grants (SIGs), to rally national literacy\n            programs, and mathematics, by providing tools for teachers\n            to diagnose the specific learning problems, enriching\n            libraries and media centers, and supporting counseling for\n            at-risk youths; 3) provide access to upper secondary school,\n            by securing excess capacity in independent secondary\n            schools, through construction of new schools, and extension\n            of existing selected schools; and, 4) support the Ministry\n            of Education, and regional offices implement the above\n            components, as their role shifts from centralized, to one\n            responsive to school-based demands for TA, and continuous\n            support on monitoring outcomes."}, "docdt": "2002-09-16T00:00:00Z"}
