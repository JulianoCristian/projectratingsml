"Final", "loan_no": "7149", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second Reform of\n            Secondary Education Project for Jamaica were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the assessment of implementation capacity needs to be\n            realistic. Though the Bank and the Government of Jamaica had\n            been working together for a number of years, both parties\n            were overambitious in setting the targets and expected\n            outcomes, and did not realistically assess the capacity of\n            the system to carry out the agreed activities. Improving\n            literacy and numeracy requires strong school commitment and\n            appropriate tools. The findings of the evaluation on the\n            Diagnostic Tools and Strategies (DTS) showed that the\n            training was useful and the tools were appropriately\n            developed to tackle learning problems in the classroom. The\n            findings suggested, as a best practice, to make principals\n            in secondary schools responsible for monitoring the use of\n            the tools and implementation of tests to better achieve the\n            goal of improving literacy and numeracy. This would ensure\n            monitoring on a continuous basis. Since principals received\n            the materials, it was suggested that they be held\n            accountable for their use. The teacher training method (in\n            cascade versus other methodologies) should be carefully\n            reviewed to achieve the intended goals of training. The\n            materials for training should be elaborated and distributed\n            prior to the training or during training sessions to\n            guarantee hands-on training, and there should be systematic\n            follow-up and an established training schedule to ensure\n            that resource teachers carry out the training on site. The\n            outcomes of SIPs were influenced by the readiness of the\n            schools to receive the intervention. Not all of the schools\n            were ready to use, implement and benefit from the full\n            interventions. Yet once the regional monitoring officers\n            were brought on board, implementation improved\n            significantly. This highlighted the need for more hands-on\n            support for new initiatives. In cases where funds are\n            administered by schools, sufficient training and support\n            should be provided to manage the fiduciary monitoring."}, "docdt": "2010-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
