The proposed site is likely to\n            undergo more scrutiny by NEPA because of its coastal\n            location and underlying limestone, and the historical\n            properties in the area (namely the Green Grotto caves). In a\n            preliminary discussion of the site with NEPA officials, they\n            expressed some concern about water supply issues and solid\n            waste disposal, as well as the effect on the limestone caves\n            located in the area. An alternative site has been identified\n            in the event that the preferred location is rejected by\n            NEPA. The proposed site is located on about 14 acres of\n            government land, on a small elevation above the main section\n            of the town. The site is heavily vegetated, near a former\n            railroad station, which tracks now closed. Architects and\n            engineers have visited the site, and no major environmental\n            or cultural issues are identified with the proposed\n            selection; however, no alternative site has been identified.\n            The town's water supply comes from rainwater catchment\n            tanks, and this would be the proposed plan for the new\n            school. There are plans to bring piped water to the town,\n            but until that happens, the school design will likely\n            include the rainwater catchment tanks."}, "docdt": "2002-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
