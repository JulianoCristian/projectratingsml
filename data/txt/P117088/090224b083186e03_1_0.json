With the financial\n            crisis, the drop in oil prices and consequently in\n            government revenues, the Nigerian economy started\n            experiencing tremendous pressure. Economic Reform and\n            Governance Project helped the government arrest the slide in\n            market confidence, support economic reforms, and address key\n            financial transparency issues that will buffer the country\n            from future shocks. The project provided budgetary support\n            to the Nigerian government to offset the fiscal impact of\n            the global financial crisis and also supported the\n            government in maintaining its economic reform path in the\n            financial sector, fiscal policy, management and governance.\n            The improvements in public financial management let everyone\n            benefit from improved transparency and better use of public resources."}, "docdt": "2010-09-10T06:57:04Z"}
