"Ratings for the Financial Sector and\n            Public Financial Management Development Policy Credit\n            Project for Nigeria were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was substantial,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: key to the\n            development policy loans (DPL's) success is the fact\n            that the request for development policy credit (DPC) support\n            was initiated by the government without any prodding by the\n            Bank. This was made easier by the fact that the minister of\n            finance had prior experience in both the World Bank and the\n            Nigerian debt management office. The strong government\n            leadership and buy-in to the program at the time it was\n            being prepared was key to its success. The Bank's high\n            quality analytical work and numerous dissemination events\n            helped to build the Bank's credibility in the financial\n            sector, strengthen the relationship with the Central Bank of\n            Nigeria (CBN), and provided a road map for reform of the\n            banking sector and improvements in public financial\n            management. The DPC components focused on financial sector\n            reform cannot have been implemented without the reformist\n            governor of the CBN and the federal minister of finance.\n            These key reform champions communicated their own reform\n            program without much visible support from the World Bank.\n            Having all the reform messages come from respected Nigerian\n            leadership rather than from Bank staff was vital for the\n            success of the program in the complex Nigerian political\n            economy context. Having the task members based in one place\n            helped to develop a sense of teamwork and also allowed the\n            team to have day-to-day discussions with government counterparts."}, "docdt": "2011-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
