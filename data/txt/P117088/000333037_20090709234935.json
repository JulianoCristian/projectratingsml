The DPC\n            will support the Government's efforts to maintain its\n            current reform path and limit the crisis impact on the\n            non-oil economy. The policy actions supported by the credit\n            aim at sustaining a stable and sound financial sector,\n            maintaining sound management of oil revenues, refocusing\n            budgetary expenditures on investments addressing growth\n            bottlenecks for the economy, and continuing reform efforts\n            in the area of public financial management. In particular,\n            the monetary authorities have taken aggressive measures to\n            provide sufficient liquidity to the banking system, and\n            advanced measures to tighten bank oversight as part of a\n            medium-term financial sector reform program. The Government\n            has approved a 2009 budget that uses a conservative oil\n            price, reprioritizes spending toward capital outlays, and\n            taken measures to accelerate execution of capital spending.\n            At the same time, reforms continue in improving transparency\n            and accountability, and ensuring value for money in\n            procurement. Going forward the credit identifies a set of\n            medium term actions required to support implementation of\n            the identified structural reforms. These relate to both\n            strengthening the financial sector, macroeconomic management\n            and public financial management and procurement. These\n            actions discuss and endorsed by the authorities-lend\n            themselves to monitoring. Their realization will be crucial\n            to maintaining the momentum for reform supported by this\n            credit and to achieving the envisaged structural outcomes."}, "docdt": "2009-07-07T00:00:00Z"}
