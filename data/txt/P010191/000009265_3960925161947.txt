PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PAKlSTAN
FIFTH SUI NORTHERN GAS PIPELINE PROJECT
(LOAN 2324-PAK)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fifth Sui Northern
Gas Pipeline Project in Pakistan, for which Loan 2324-PAK in the amount of
US$43.0 million was approved on June 23, 1983. The loan was closed on June 30,
1989, two years behind the original schedule; the proiect was essentially
completed in March 1991, almost five years behind the original schedule.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Energy Operations Division of the
Europe, Middle East and North Africa Region (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts
I and III) and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal
Report; the President's Report; the Loan and Guarantee Agreements; supervision
reports; project progress reports; correspondence between the Bank and the
Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

FIFTH SUI NORTHERN GAS PIPELINE PROJECT
(LOAN 2324-PAK)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       This was the fifth Bank loan since 1964 to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines
Limited (SNGPL), in support of the expansion of Pakistan's northern transmission
and distribution systems. The loan of $43.0 million was provided to SNGPL, with
the guarantee of the Government of Pakistan (GOP).
Objectives
2.       The Bank's broad objective for Pakistan's petroleum sector has been to
promote an optimal gas development strategy that, in the long term, will utilize
indigenous resources and reduce hydrocarbon imports and, in the short term, will
address the emerging gas shortages (PCR, Part I, paras. 2.01, 3.01, and 3.02).
The specific project objectives were to increase SNGPL gas transmission capacity
by 70 MMcfd to 450 MMcfd and to complete a limited expansion of the residential
distribution system (FCR, Part I, para. 3.03). These objectives were achieved.
Implementation Experience
3.       Conditions of effectiveness included timely availability of additional
gas supplies and cofinancing (export credits) agreements for the major pipe
procurement.   Loan effectiveness was delayed for almost one year because of
uncertain gas supplies to SNGPL's transmission system and delays in firming up
cofinancing arrangements  (PCR, Part I, para. 4.11).   Because of delays in
finalizing cofinancing agreements, bids for line pipe procurement with co-
financing (export credit) provisions had to be retendered in 1984, after having
been initially received in June 1983. Project completion was over four years
behind schedule for three reasons: procurement of major equipment packages was
not expedited in early stage of project implementation; labor unrest at major
equipment suppliers in Korea delayed fabrication and shipment of che purification
plant and the package boiler unit; and local pipe supply, linepipe installation
and local equipment erection encountered quality and schedule problems (PCR, Part
I, paras. 4.03, 4.11, 6.03, 7.02.   03, and 7.04).  The loan closing date was
twice extended by one year.
4.       The perfo.mance of consultants was quite satisfactory.  The overseas
management training program was well structured and improved the operations and
management skills of SNGPL senior staff (PCR, Part I, paras. 4.06 and 5.01).
An updated pipeline telemetry/telecom system was implemented with the assistance
of a foreign consultant (PCR, Part I, para. 4.05).

Results
5.       The  project had measurable  results  in two broad  areas:  capital
investment and management capability. Thc expansion to SNGPL's gas transmission
and distribution network has now allowed the company to handle the available
increase in natural gas supplies, to 450 MMcfd.  The improved operations and
management skills of SNGPL staff has enabled the company to plan and execute
capital improvements with limited assistance required from outside consultants
(PCR, Part I, para. 5.01).
Sustainability
6.       SNGPL has the operational skills to manage an expanded gas transmission
and distribution network.   It is important that SNGPL generate sufficient
internal funds for debt service, uworking capital, and future capital investment.
In order for SNGPL to be viable :'inancially over the long term, the issues of
tariff adjustment and asset revaluation must be resolved.  The importance of
tariff policies and a commer:ially viable operation is recognized by both GOP
and the Bank. Consequently these are key issues of the Corporate Restructuring
and System Expansion Project approved in August 1990, Loan 3252-PAK (PCR, Part I,
paras. 5.01 and 5.02).
Findings and Lessons
7.       The project experience highlights the importance of establishing a
procurement plan and schedule that is compatible with the overall project
schedule. Prequalification of local contractors would be helpful to achieving
project schedule and quality objectives. Preparation of well-defined equipment
specifications would have a positive impact on project schedule.   Because
material delivery and installation is usually on the critical path of any
project, the procurement process should be expedited in the early project stages.
8.       It is important. to establish a realistic implementation schedule so as
to avoid the danger of underestimating costs and overestimating benefits. In
addition, a realistic schedule eliminates the uniecessary expenditure of
administrative time to negotiate and approve loan extensions.
9.       Co-financing represents a significant source of external funds for
energy projects. A review of GOP's procedure for approving export (supplier)
credit arrangements, with the intent to make the process more efficient, would
be beneficial to organizations, such as SNGPL, that will be responsible for
implementing future projects.   Timely government approval would reduce the
possibility of delay in project schedules.

2.   BackZroi id
2.01     In the decade preceding project appraisal in 1982. Pakistan had been
actively developing its indigenous energy resources, in particular natural gas
and hydro-electricity, with the stated goal of limiting oil imports. However,
despite the efforts to implement this strategy, the country remained heavily
dependent on imported oil to meet its primary energy needs. In 1980/81, over 90%
of the oil demand was satisfied by imports which totalled US$1.6 billion.
equivalent to 26% of the value of total imports.
2.02     During this period there had been considerable optimism that domestic
supplies of natural gas, together with some expansion in hydro-electric
facilities, would meet much of Pakistan's increase in energy requirements.
However, a gas supply and demand study, prepared in 1982 for the Government of
Pakistan (GOP) by the Gas Development Corporation (GDC), a consultant, and
financed from a PPF in the Fifth Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL)
Project, indicated that peak demand would exceed supply in every year of the
following decade, with the peak deficit exceeding 500 MMcfd by FY 91.   (The
demand figures were prepared for GDC by Enar Petrotech and summarized in the
Staff Appraisal Report.) In the short and medium-term, gas supplies would be
limited by inadequate investment in field development and transmission
facilities.
2.03     In response to this forecast of gas supply deficits. GOP developed in
1982 a medium-term gas development plan desLgned to increase production from
proven fields. The plan outlined investments in field development of US$488
million and associated pipeline investments of US$250 million (cost estimates in
constant 1981 prices). The gas development plan was reviewed by Bank staff and
was considered to be achievable and an appropriate short-term response to the
emerging gas shortages.
2.04     The Bank had been involved in Pakistan's gas sub-sector since 1964.
Four loans were extended to SNGPL to finance the expansion of the northern
transmission and distribution system and to strengthen the technical and



- 2 -
financial capability of SNGPL. These objectives were substantially achieved;
Pakistan has one of the most extensive gas transmission and distribution systems
in the developing world, and SNGPL has the ability to undertake project
implementation with limited technical assistance.
3.   Pro_ect Objectives and Description
3.01     The role of the Bank was, in a broad sense, to promote an optimal gas
development strategy in response to emerging gas shortages.   During project
preparation, the Bank insisted that a gas development plan (cf para. 2.03) be
developed to respond to the gas shortages identified in the gas supply and demand
study.
3.02     Four complementary and linked investments, designed to increase gas
supplies to the northern transmission and distribution system, were proposed.
(a) Supply of 19 MMcfd of Sui Upper Limestone (SUL) gas to SNGPL;
(b) Increase in Mari field production capacity to 187 MMcfd;
(c) Construction of a pipeline from Mari to Guddu where additional
Mari gas would be used in power generation with a corresponding
release of 55 MMcfd of raw Sui gas to SNGPL;
(d) Expansion of the SNGPL system to handle additional gas from SUL
and Guddu.
Although the Bank was only financing the last investment, timelv implementation
of the other three investments was critical to the successful implementation of
the Bank's project.
3.03     The specific project objectives were to increase SNGPL system capacity
by 70 MMcfd to a total capacity of 450 MMcfd, and to complete a limited expansion
of the distribution system to residential consumers to substitute gas for
imported, higher cost kerosene. The project had the following components:
(a) Procurement and installation of one 60 MMcfd gas purification
plant.
(b) Procurement and construction of 434 miles of high pressure gas
transmission pipelines of varying diameters complete with cathodic
protection.
(c) Procurement and installation of four 1100 BHP and one 3,800 BHP
turbine/compressor units in four existing compressor stations.
(d) Development of the distribution system and service lines to meet
new and normal growth of domestic consumers for the period FY 84
to FY 86.
(e) Procurement and installation of telecommunication/telemetry
facilities.



-3-
(f)  Technical assistance and training to upgrade the management and
operations of SNGPL,  This component included establishing a
management information system, undertaking a feasibility study for
peak-load shaving, and implementing an overseas training program
*                        in operations and management.
3.03     Estimated cost of the project was $196.8 million, of which $70.5 million
was foreign exchange costs. The Bank loan of $43.0 million and supplier credits
of $27.5 million were to finance the foreign exchange component.
Change in Proiect Scope
3.04     As a result of additional (new) gas supplies from the Loti and Pirkoh
fields, the Loan Agreement was amended in October 1987 to allow the installation
of three 3,800 BHP turbine/compressor units instead of the originally planned one
3,800 BHP unit and four 1000 BHP units. This change, resulting in only a nominal
increase in cost, provided increased compression capacity to facilitate the
handling of additional gas supplies.   The need to aecomodate for the ever
changing gas supply situation resulted in a revised transmission configuration
of 489 miles, compared to the originally planned 434 miles.
4.       Project Organization and Implementation
4.01     SNGPL was incorporated as a limited liability company in 1963 and
converted into a public limited company in 1964.   Thz company's principal
business is the transmission, purification, and distribution of natural gas from
the Sui and Meyal fields to industrial, power, commercial, and residential
customers.   In addition to internal assignments, SNGPL's Projects Department
performs engineering and construction activities for outside clients. The major
stockholder is GOP, which owns directly or indirectly about 90% of the equity.
4.02     As previously mentioned, SNGPL has a Projects Department that performs
engineering and construction activities.   This cd_sartment is experienced in
pipeline cc.._truction and the installation of compressor facilities.   The
department had successfully completed the fourth SNGPL project (Loan 1107-PAK)
with construction costs approximately 20% under the original estimate, due to
efficiency gains and easier field conditions. SNGPL planned to use its Project
Department for the design, engineering, and construction of this project.
4.03     Of the 489 miles of pipeline construction. SNG1 L's own crews were
responsible for 393 miles while 96 miles were assigned to two outside
contractors. Performance by SNGPL crews was satisfactory whereas the outside
contractors consistently missed pipe laying targets. This poor performance was
largely a result of lack of experience, especially in comparison to SNGPL crews.
Procurement of steel linepipe from local vendors proved problematic with schedule
delays and unacceptable quality necessitating additional imports against the
original procurement plan.
4.04     The gas purification facility was divided into three main procurement
packages: MEA process gas purification plant, TEG process dehydration plant, and
a package boiler unit. Erection was by local contractors under the supervision



-4-
of SNGPL's projects department staff with vendor assistance. Schedule delays in
supply of materials and pro-fabricated package units occurred with all thzee
packages. The subject of schedule is also addressed in Paragraphs 4.10 and 4.11
and in Section 6. The purification plant, owned by SNGPL but operated by Sui
Southern Gas Company, was commissioned in March 1991.   An unfortunate fire
incident on November 28-29, 1990, damaged five of the older purification banks,
installed prior to 1971.  Although the new unit was not damaged, additional
schedule slippage did result. It has been proposed that the damaged units be
replaced urder a supplementary energy sector loan, currently under preparation.
4.05     Consultants were  engaged  to prepare  the  specifications  for  the
procurement of a 24-channel micro4ave system, to be installed on the Sui-Multan-
Faisalabad pipeline route. Construction/installation of the microwave system was
completed on schedule in 1986 by SNGPL crews, with supervisory assistance from
the consultant.
4.06     A management training program for 51 SN%PL executives was coordinated
by CDC, Inc., a subsidiary of the Institute of Gas Technology of ChicaGo. The
program    incorporated  training courses  for  SNGPL staff  in  the  relevant
disciplines with plant visits to gas companies and manufacturers in the United
States.   Although generally successful,  it was concluded that operational
training would be more effective. In that regard, a "twinning" arrangement is
envisioned under the recently approved Corporate Restructuring and System
Expansion Project (SNGPL VI, Loan 3252-PAK).
4.07     The increased capacity compression  sacilities and the distribution
service lines were successfully installed on schedule.
4.08     GDC completed a Natural Gas Utilization and Demand Management Study.
The results of this study formed the basis for the SNGPL's future development
program, including SNGPL VI.
4.09     Although the TOR was -prepared, the Peak-Load Shaving Study was not
initiated because of the overall project schedule delays.  It was decided to
defer this study for implementation under the Energy Sector Loan II (Loan 3107-
PAK). Likewise, the Management Information System will be implemented under the
SNGPL Corporate Restructuring and System Expansion Project (Loan 3252-PAK).
4.10     The original project schedule, as prepared by SNGPL, indicated the last
pipeline loop would be installed in March 1986 and the purification plant
commissioned in November 1985. Although such a schedule could be achieved, it
was nonetheless optimistic and perhaps unrealistic. It apparently overlooked the
experience of the Fourth Sui Project (Loan 1107-PAK) which could be considered
a similar type project, and in which project implementation was delayed due to
limitations in SNGPL capabilities.   That project was approved in 1975 and
completed in 1032.
4.11     Theztt were unforeseen occurrences during project implementation: delay
of almost one year in loan effectiveness because of uncertain gas supplies to the
transmission system; associated delay in tendering for line pipe which involved
supplier (export) credit financing facilitie-; and labor problems at the major



equipment suppliers in Korea.  Nonetheless, the periodic schedule updates were
still too optimistic, and hence unrealistic. In February 1987, SNGPL indicated
the project completion would slip from riarch 1988 until December 1988. SNGPL
further confirmed in February 1988 that the project would still be completed by
end-December 1988. The purification plant, supplied from abroad and installed
by local contractors, was aot commissioned until March 1991; the linepipe
installation, largely don.e by SNGPL crews, was not completed until end-December
1989. In June 1987, the Lank granted a one year extension for loan closing; in
May 1988, the second and final one year extension until June 30, 1989, was
approved.
5.   Project Results and Sustainabilitv
5.01     The project had measurable  results  in  two broad  areas:  capital
investment and management capability.
(a)  Capital Investment:  The installation of 489 miles of linepipe
(bringing benchmark capacity to 450 MMcfd), gas purification and
gas compression facilities, upgraded tele-communications systems,
and the expansion of the gas distribution system will enable SNGPL
to handle the available increase in gas supplies and to contribute
to the overall GOP plan to minimize hydrocarbon imports and
maximize the utilization of domestic energy (gas) resources.
(b)  Management Capability:  The managemeitt skills of SNGPL have been
improved by overseas training in operations and management. This
will enable SNGPL to contin-t. to plan and execute capital
improvements to its gas trans_ssion and distribution facilities,
with limited requirements for consultart technical assistance.
5.02     SNGPL is a viable organization, both operationally and financially. The
issues of tariff adjustment continue to be problematic. It is mandatory that
SNGPL generate sufficient-internal funds for debt service and working capital,
but more important, to be able to finance a reasonable portion of future capital
investment. The importance of these issues has been recognized by both GOP and
the Bank and have been addressed in the Corporate Restructuring and System
Expansion Project, Loan 3252-PAK, approved in August 1990.
6.   Performance of the Bank and the Borrower
6.01     Supervision missions  were  frequent and were  always  staffed with
technical specialists who could provide sound professional advice to the staff
of SNGPL. The Bank's recommendation and the Borrower's concurrence to change the
project technical specifications to add larger linepipe size and increased gas
compression capability was prudent. Not only did this permit SNGPL to handle
immediately additional gas supplies from Loti and Pirkoh fields, but it provided
some 'cushion' for future gas demand.
6.02     Insufficient attention was given to the project's technical assistance
component. Of three major items, only the overseas training program for SNGPL
management was implemented. The peak load shaving study, an important element



-6-
for future strategies for gas development, was deferred to the Energy Sector
Loan-II, Loan 3107-PAK. The implementation of a financial management information
svstem is a key element of the SNGPL Corporate Restructuring and System Expansion
Project, Loan 3252-PAK.
6.03     The implementation schedule proved the most troublesome. for both the
Bank and the Borrower.  Bank staff failed to recognize early enough that the
implementation schedule was not realistic and that SNGPL's updated forecasts of
project completion could not be achieved.   Critical path items,  such as
procurement of major equipment packages, were not expedited.   Although loan
effectiveness was extended three times and the loan was not declared effective
until August 16. 1984, a December 1988 project completion date was still
achievable. However, due to the limited experience of SNGPL in the procurement
of complex items, such as a purification plant, adequate time was not allocated
for the procurement plan. There was not an adequate pre-qualification process
for local contractors.  In some cases equipment specifications were not well
defined. (On future projects, use of short-term consultants for preparation of
equipment specifications could have positive impact on overall schedule.)
Coupled with unforeseen delays by the vendors, the procurement schedule became
unachievable. Specifically, a review of the procurement process for three major
items revealed the following.
(a)  MEA Purification:   Prequalification package issued in January
1986, with a deadline of March 1986. The construction completion
date specified in the prequalification documents was Spring 1987.
This date was not realistic. After the contractor qualifications
were received, six months elapsed before a pre-qualification
report was issued. Another six months elapsed before the tender
was released.   The Bank approved the contractor selection in
October 1987, and the contract was awarded in March 1988.
(b)  TEG Dehydration Plant:  Tender documents issued in May 1987.  Due
to poor-response from the short-listed vendors, SNGPL requested
approval to retender in December 1987. Tender was reissued in
January 1988 and contract was awarded in September 1988.
(c) Package Boiler Unit: Tender documents issued in July 1987. Only
one bidder, from among three, appeared to be responsive. SNGPL
requested approval to retender in January 1988, at which time the
responsive bidder protested. Bank approved retender in February
and approved award in June 1988. Order was placed in August 1988,
resulting in a cost increase of about $100,000, and in a schedule
delay of about one year.
6.04     The performance of SNGPL's Projects Department in the laying and
commissioning of linepipe waLs satisfactory, although final completion did not
meet the original or interim revised schedules.   The overall satisfactory
performance of SNGPL was mitigated by the four-year schedule slippage, caused in
part by the setting of unrealistic schedules with insufficient expediting of key
items or events, particularly for the procurement and installation of the
purification plant. It should be noted that the some of the schedule slippage,



-7-
especially that attributed to labor problems in Korea. could not be foreseen and
hence was out of the Projects Department control.
6.05     Under this loan, SNGPL was to achieve a minimum annual rate of return
*         of 10% on its average revalued fixed assets in service.  The target was not met
if revaluation of fixed assets after FY85 is taken into account, because of flaws
in the application of the revaluation formula. Actual rates of return declined
from 9.0% in FY86 to 8.1% in FY89. Under the follow-on loan, 3252-PAK, SNGPL
will engage consultants to define an appropriate formula and will undertake to
implement the revised formula within three years.
7.   Consulting. Construction. and Supplier Services
7.01     The performance of outside contractors was mixed. Consultancy services
were very satisfactory.   The overseas training program and the Natural Gas
Utilization and Demand Management Study were well structured.   The tele-
communications consultant implemented a viable system.
7.02     The foreign suppliers of linepipe generally met quality and schedule
requirements. One local supplier of pipe had quality and schedule problems which
necessitated purchasing offshore, greater quantities of pipe than originally
planned.
7.03     Because of labor problems in Korea, fabrication and shipment of the
Boiler Package Unit and the Gas Purification Unit was significantly delayed.
7.04     Pipe laid by outside local contractors proceeded at a slower pace than
pipe installed by SNGPL's own crews.   In addition, there were some safety
concerns with the local contractors. Progress on the civil works construction
associated with the purification plant, again performed by local contractors, was
less than satisfactory.   In the future, the capability of local contractors
&n,,,tld be better evaluated during the pre-qualification process to ensure
satisfactory performance and timely project implementation.

PART II
(PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE)



1. Project 5 - Concept, Design, Scheduling and Construction
1.0] The Company's Project 5 was originally conceived to
2F.pand the system capacity from 378 M'ICFD dounstream of
Sui source to 447 IDICFD i.e., for an incremental total
:o.ailAbi. itvy of gas sup,plies from. Suii source of 69 IMICFD -
19 LMMCFD froni Sui Upper Limestone (SUL) and 50 .LJCFr,
,.f t.weot gas equivalent fromn Sui ?Iain Limestone (SfIlL).
.;t that ti.ne, the aforementioned CS r2ICFD were
r.I.c c.nly additional Las supplies in view and the
r;eoject design catered for just that much.
.n1 .!; rleAijn of the project based on the foregoing incre-
gi.nt;al Sas supplies was prepared aad a PC-I filed in
;Worber 1398'.  The scheduled date for project comple-
t ion was set at July 2985 provided loan became effective
].v\ Januzvy 1. 2981.
3.0:: The loan did not become effective *ntil August 1984 due
;r.inl, to delay in fulfilment bv the GOP/Company of the
7orld Bankls essential requirements of (i) revaluation
of the Company's assets and (ii) attainment of secure gas
supplies.  The project was approved by ECNEC in October
l994 delayed already by almost two vears from the
st.irting date earlier planned.
1.04 In the nmeantime. it had become necessary to i-evise/
e.%1arge the scope and, consequently, thei design of
Plrcject .. due mainly to :
1.041     provide for a reserve system capacity, doAm-
streamn Sui over and above the 69 tDICFD , to
cater for future availabilitY of sas from
Loti and Pirkoh gas fields.  or, possible
incremental production from Sui field itself:
1.042     provide for replacement of existing 16" pipe-
lines doumstream of compressor stations to
combat stress corrosion : and,
] .0'3    update the cost of project necessitated by
(i) escalaticin of prices during cIse two 3-ears
past and (ii) an adverse change in the
eNchang- rate.
3.05 A revised design of Project 5, larger in scope and con-
rZi-i.ration than its original version, was aCcordinely
puepanrd and submitted to the GOP for apf,roval : the
.evised IC-I was approved in Junle 1985.

For 18" pipe      -   October 1984
For 2k" pipe      -   August 1985

7h.- .nreil_ed quantities, as above. fronm order of local
sELbpple: were procured froml abroad.  The delivery of the
reduced local orders was eventually completed as follows
18" Pipe    -    may, 1989
24" Pipe    -    May, 1989
3.10 The rest of the pipe was ordered on foreign suppliers and



- 11 -
duly procured without any significant problem.
2.21 Consttuction of pipelines was started in November 1985
beginning with 24", pipe imported from abroad and 72 Miles
;., it-were laid until April 1986. as a matter of course.
rhereafter. further pipeline construction was to proceed
%:iuh supplies from local supplier referred to under para
1.08 above which turned out to be inordinately delayed &
e ratic, and made it in,possible to maintain planned pace
of construction. The-fate of 18' dia pipeline construc-
tiun was worse still since it dependecl totally on locally
si:pplied pipe material : not only did the pipeline cons-
:&ucrion start with an initial delay orf 6  onths but clso
iX proceeded with fits and starts restultinig 4n a protracted
,..Woletion period of 18 months (A.pril 3986-SeptLemiber 1987)
f,r completion of a 33-Miles Section.
1.1: IL, Junie 1936, the GOP took notice of aforenmentione-d
&iverse supply position of pipe and asked SNGPL to sub-
't a re-ised activitn  schedule and tin,e esrimates.  SNGPL
co611plied toith a revision in construction schledule projec-
ting completion of major pipelaying worl; by April 1988,
of last pipeline segment by September 1388 and of puri-
fic.ation plant by January 1989.
1.33 The aforementioned revised activity schedule catered for:
1.131     the slow rate of pipe delivery allowing
longer times of construction - e.g., 43 Miles
long 18", A7-Sidhnai section was scheduled to
be constructed in 5 1/2 months, it was allowed
12 monchs ; likewise, 20-Mile 18" Sidhnai-AC7
section was scheduled for 2 1/2 months, it was
allowed 6 months : 24" pipeline construction,
coo, which was originally scheduled for being
constructed in a total of 27 months, was
allowed 33 months :
1.132     re-scheduling of 16"1 line section which
depended upon pipe uplifted from completed
24' line section
1.133     and above all, for keeping the total construc-
tion period the same 33 months (or, as near to
it as possible) that had been earlier indicated
in original schedule (July 1985-March 1988) be-
cause GOP/ECNEC, while approving the project,
had directed for the project to be completed in
23 months :under the circumstances,  this was a
difficultr objective to achieve and it complicated
matters.
1.14 In order to accomplish the rater paradoxical task of comp-
2etint the project in the original time period of 33
months at a rate much slower than that originally
prescribed, the. 2-spread operation originally planned



-12 -
was split into a 6-spread operation, all six of them
working in parallel with each other at some time or
the other : and. that is where the trouble started.
1.141     Because of budgetary constraints and also
because neither construction staff nor
machinery could be mustered within no time,
the six spreads were not created by additional
staff or machinery but by splitting the avail-
able two spreads, worth of staff and machinery
into 6 crews, neither of them adequately
equipped.
1.142     Such fragmentation of staff and machinery made
it impossible for the construction crews to
maintain even the slower speed required of them
and their astute resources were unable to
cope with problems caused by uiforeseen out-of-
season inclement weather, uater lo-ed
stretches . delayed land a..quisirion/permits or
the unexpected problems of construction process
itself like trouble with coating and wrappin-
-   material. etc.
1.143     The coordination of activities of six construc-
tion crews also became rather unmanage3ble.
A.5 The problems enumerated at para 1.14 above were further
compourded by frustration of pipe deliveries from the lo-
ceal supplier and some more cancellations of pipe quantity
from latter's order and its procurement. from ahroad, with
rhe result that by November 1987 there had accunmulated a
L acklog of 177 Miles of pipelaying - 218 Miles completed
as against 395 miles required : stated ano-.her way, the
foregoing backlog of 177 Miles amounted to wastage of one
full year of construction period. In real terms, some 271
miles of pipe laying still remained to be accomplished.
1.16 To the aforementioned balance of 271 Miles remaining from
rrojec-t 5 work, some more pipe laying assignments, in
priority equally as urgent as Project S. had been added by
then   namely,
Pipe
size      Length               Priority
24"     44 Miles    P-6, Phase-I : P'koh Gas P'IUp

- 13 -
Thus. when comhined with the aforementionied pipe layin6
fir,m Jioject Z, a total of 424 miles of pipelay5lg
assi,;Cutient remained to be tackl.ed.
1.17 IL IDecember. 1987, a meeting under the aegis of
Miriiit*r of P&NR was lheld to chalk out the future couise
of action and it was decided that :
1.171      The construction forces shall be consolidated
Into no more than 2-spread operation .

1.191     Unsatisfactory and slow performance by local
Contractors :
As mentioned earlier (refer para 3.173), 96



- 14 -
ni.les of 16" line on 'C-Lee' of Cornpany's system
were f.rmed out t.o local contractors who comple-

3.192     Changes in assignment
As already mentioned under para 1.174, 32 Miles
of 1G" Dakhni li-ae and 32 Miles of 10" Adii
line were to be assigned to local c,intractors,
However, in view of the adverse performance of
the contractors on C-Leg, refer para 1.191
abov'e. the foregoing work had to be assigned to
Company's own construction crews which increased
rtheir original assignment.
1.193     The construction of pipelines in hilly areas of
Pirkoh/'oti as also in that of D3khni proved to
be mu:h more difficult than envisaged and took
considerably longer time to complete.
1.20 A conipalisor, of the planned and actual pipe laying assign-
ment is as under:

12/87 - 12/89.: 25 Mon.    370 Miles           14.80 Miles
it is to be noted that though the actual rate of construc-
tion pr,o,gess was rather slow during the period November
198.'-Novea,her 1987 comnpared with the planned (8.72 wiles



- 15 -
vs. 14.82) due mainly to shortfall in rate of pipe supplY
fronm local sources, the same rate during the rescheduled
period of December 1987-December 1989 was comparable
with platnned (14.80 Miles vs. 14.82 Miles) in spite of
thte problemas enumerated under para 1.19 above.
2.  Ciitical events adversely affecting pipe laying work and
Iess.ns learnt
2.1  Default in pipe supply froiu Local source
I..'hereas, in principle and as a matcer of nationa4. policy
for industrial developument, the local suppliers of
iwsterial have to be encouraged, their performance,
especially of suppliers/manufacturers in the public sector,
should be critically examined before investing them with
a major supply order.
2.2  Fragmentation of resources
Pipeline construction under Project 5 was originally
plannled to be a 2-spread operation. Later, when confronted
with shortage of major pipe supply, the same operation had
to be split, though per force, into 6 crew operation
which resulted in fragmentation of men and machinery
resources and did not perform efficiently.
2.3  Dove-tailing of unforeseen work and shuffling of
priorities :
During the course of Project 5 work, unforeseen assign-
ments on account of Project 6, Phase I, and other oper-
ational considerations, though important and unavoidable,
sot dove-tailed into the work in hand of Project 5, which
noc only threw the original planning overboard but also
reduced priority of Project 5 work in hand. Shuffling of
priorities of work - advancing schedule of construction
of components of work on account of operational priorities
or to meet ambitious gas supply schedules proclaimed by
suppliers, unforeseen taking over of the work of contrac-
tt.rs. all - were responsible to a great deal for unrealis-
ric achievement endeavours.
2.4  Default of local construction contractors
The local construction contractors for pipelaying did not
perforism well due mainly to lack of work experience, train-
ed sraff and construction machinery.  Whereas the capabi-
lities of the local contractors can only be developed by
iave-.tinu. rbhenu with work, they should, to all certainty,
tie award.ed worlc of lower/lowest p''.iority and also they
need to he assisted with c:onstruction miachinery and
continuous guidance in performing work.
2.5  Ov,r-ambitious delivery date pror,.ises. cf gas producers
2.51 Duri6g the course of Project 5 pipelines construction.
furrher availabilit) of gas supply from sources other
than Sui, namely, Loti, Pirlkoh and Dakhlni fields
becam.e apparent anLd naturally the Company had to gear
itself up to receiving such adclitional gas into its
7)



- 16 -
system by constructing gas pipelines connecting the
gas fields to its system.
2.52 How;ever, the promised gas delivery date by the
producer (OGDC), in altnost all cases, proved to be
over-anibitious and never achieved : namely ,
i)    Delivery of gas from Loti field was promised
July, 1988 but the actual supply only began in
Novemnher. 1989 with a period of 17 months delay.
ii)    Gas from Pirkoh field, too, was promised for
delivery in July 1988 but it did not start
flowing until January 1990.
iii)    Delivery of gas from Dakhni field w.as promnised
July 1988, was later revised to April 1989 but
actual delivery did noc start before December,
1989.
iv)    For that matter.even deliveries of gas from Adhi
fleld, belonging to PPL, did not commence before
July 1990 although promised March 1990.
3.  Purificailon Plant - procurement and construction
3.1 Installation of an additional Bank of Purification Plant at
SLi was a part of Project 5 configuration.
3.11 It had three major equipnment packages, namnely,
-    Purification Plant based on MlEA process, of
JO MIMCFD capacity (though actually a plant of 120
M4CFD was installed  with che consent of World
Bank).
-    Gas Dehvdration Plant based on TEG (Tri-ethylene
Glycol) process of 165 .>ICFD purified gas
capacity and
-    Steam Generation Boiler, of 100,000 lb./hour
capacity.
3.12 Apart from the three major packages enumerated above,
there were more than a dozen items cf other
ancillary!off-si..te equipmient, such as demineralisation
and sofrening plants for boiler water, exhaust steam
condenserr, pumps, etc., uhich were to be ordered and
iastalled.
3.33 The three major components of purificaticYn plant
enuwiierated at paras 3.11 above were to be
procured under designer-supplier arrangement to
perforumance specifications of the Company : the
erection/installation of the equip;ment was to be
uisdertaken by the Company's oum construction
crews. The Company lhad previousl.y procured and ins-



- 17 -
call-ed two such banks (Balks 8 & 9 ) in 1975-78 and
had adequate experience.
3.2  TiRe rime period for completion of purification weorks was
ori,inally envisaged April 1985 to Marcih 3987.  However, as
che cinstruction of pipelines Was reEchedtiled so was
pIiw.ureme3et and installation of purification plant : in
neom,hber, 1987 when Project S pipelines were scheduled for
'ezOtpletion b) JunL 1989(refer para 3. 175), the completion
of purific.ation plant was sat for April 19t39.
3.3  The installation of purification pi.nt W3s actually
completed as follows
3.31 Tr.G Dehydration Plaat - completed and commissioned in
June 1990.
3.32 Steamu Generation Boiler - completed and commissioned
in December, 1990.
3.33 HEA Purification Plant - completed first week March,
19991 but not commissioned due to strike of the local
tribal labour.
3.4  ThI factors responsible for the delayed conipletion of
puzification plant have been as follows
3.';1 There .s some genuine delay in prequalifyin-,
cont,act.ors and order for procurement of purification
plant. Bids were actually invited both for plants of
capaitry 60 MIICFD and 120 MMCFD and uipon being r,oticed
cliat the bigger capacity plant could 1te procured for a
lirtle (011) inciement in the cost. of smialler plait,
it. was decidied, with the World BanI's approval, to
nvder rIe bit;ger (120 1-D.CFD) plui.t.

3.425  The cause of late shipment of the plants enume-
rated at para 3.434 above, were work stoppages
at vendors worlks : the Boiler supplier,
particulary reported work stoppage on acccount
of a 6-month long labour srrike at his works.
The goods were invariably short-shippred.-too.
and the installation of the 1)1aitl unit suffered
del;Ay pending arrival of the srl  rt-shipped
material.
3.43 Anci.llary/off-site equipment, coo, most of it
imiiported, was received generally 6-7 montlhs lare  than
promiised deliveries.
3.44, Civil works of the plant - equLipr.ment foundations,pipe
rack supports, water cooling tower etc. - were awarded
to a local contractor whose performance proved far
from satisfactory in that work w.as never completed
on sclhedule delaying installatic-n of clependent
mechanical equipiiient.  Accoirtin4:1y, solxme of the civil
uiovhs like Boiler foundations, had to lie deleted from
the Contractor's assignrment and undertakten by the
Comnpany itself to rdinimise delay.  Part of cooling
totwer, too, has had to be completed by the Coinpany
itself.
3.45 The site of Sui Purification Plant is situated
in a tribal area twhich has become, over the past,
hil-hLy sensitive politically anti is infested with
political and tribal rivalries aind feuds of the local
l3bour Xnd their patrons. The ltjcal labour is capLi-
cious and unreasonably dewandinZ and has h.;l caused

6. Project Results
A. Direct Benefits
6.01     Additional gas purification, compression, and pipeline transmission
facilities have been added to the SNGPL system.   A modern telemetry/tele-
communications system has been installed.
6.02     The operations and management skills of SNGPL staff have been improved
so that the company is capable of planning and executing capital investment
projects with minimum outside technical assistance.
6.03     GOP has addressed the issues of tariff adjustment and asset revaluation.
Although more progress is required in this area, the framework is present that
will enable SNGPL to become more viable financially.
B. Economic Impact
6.04     At appraisal, the economic rate of return was estimated at 60% for the
base case, and at 42% if the project suffered a one-year delay. In fact, the
project completion was over four years behind schedule. The resulting economic
rate of return was 28%.
C. Studies/Training
6.05     A Natural Gas Utilization and Demand Management Study was completed.
6.06     Training in operations and management disciplines was undertaken in
conjunction with plant visits to gas companies and manufacturers in the U.S.
