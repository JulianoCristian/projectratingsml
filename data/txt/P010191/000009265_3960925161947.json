The\n            project achieved its objectives, its impact has been\n            significant, sustainability is likely, and both the Bank and\n            Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, it is important to\n            establish a procurement plan and schedule that is compatible\n            with the overall project schedule. Pre-qualification of\n            local contractors and preparation of well-defined equipment\n            specifications would be helpful in achieving project\n            schedule and quality objectives. Second, it is important to\n            establish a realistic implementation schedule in order to\n            avoid the danger of underestimating costs and overestimating\n            benefits. Also, a realistic schedule will eliminate the\n            unnecessary expenditure of administrative time to negotiate\n            and approve loan extensions. Lastly, co-financing represents\n            a significant source of external funds for energy projects."}, "docdt": "1991-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
