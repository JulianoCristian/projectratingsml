MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Turkey
Sir Hydropower Prolect (Loan 2750-TU)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Turkey - Sir Hydropower
Project (Loan 2750-TU)" prepared by the Europe and Central Asia Regional Office.
Part II of the report, contributed by the Beneficiary, mainly contains details
on the timetable of physical implementation of the project.
Project objectives were to assist the country in developing
indigenous hydroelectric resources; reduce dependency on imported oil; and
supplement public investment with private sector participation in expanding
Turkey's generation capacity.   These objectives were met by the successful
completion of the Sir 283 MW hydroelectric plant by Cukurova Elektrik A.S., CEAS,
a regional power generation and distribution company owned mainly by local
private shareholders, and its related power system studies and manpower training.
The implementation of the resettlement program was satisfactory.   Financial
covenants were complied with.
The project was completed 9 months behind original schedule at a cost
of US$ 306 million, a 18% cost overrun, mainly due to price increases double the
estimated 15% contingency. The Bank financed US$ 132 million and CEAS's internal
cash generation covered the balance. The project's rate of return is estimated
at 12.9%.
The overall project outcome is rated as satisfactory and its
sustainability as likely. The institutional development is rated as substantial.
The Project Completion Report contains a satisfactory and concise
account of the project implementation, its achievements and lessons. The project
provides a good example of how to prepare and implement a conventional
hydroelectric project with significant private participation and the Government
as financial intermediary of a Bank loan. No audit is planned.

SIR HYDROPOWER PROJECT (LOAN 2750-TU)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.          This project was the twentieth Bank operation in the power subsector
in Turkey and the fifth operation, dating back to 1963, that benefited Cukurova
Elektrik A.S. (CEAS) a regional power generation and distribution company
majority  owned  by  local  private  shareholders.    As  with  the  previous
credits/loans, funds were provided to the Government of Turkey, which onlent them
to CEAS. The $132.0 million Bank loan was to finance 100% of the foreign cost
of the Sir Hydropower Project, a 282.5 MW development.
ObWlectives
2.          The project was designed to assist the country in achieving certain
policy objectives: develop indigenous hydroelectric resources; reduce dependence
on imported oil; and supplement public investment with private sector
participation in expanding Turkey's generation capacity (PCR, Part I, para.
3.01).
Implementation Experience
3.          Approved in 1983 by the State Planning Organization and the Ministry
of Energy and Natural Resources, the Sir Hydropower development would double the
generating capacity of CEAS and increase, by almost 10 times, the company's net
assets.
4.          The project was well prepared by CEAS, with the assistance of its
engineering consultant, Coyne et Bellier of France. The procurement plan and
schedule was rigorously followed. Physical completion of the three turbine units
occurred only eight months behind the original schedule, which is an exemplary
achievement.
5.          CEAS worked closely with the Bank during project preparation and even
more closely during project implementation. Issues were identified and dealt
with in a straightforward and efficient manner.   In essence, there were few
surprises during implementation.
Results
6.          The project was essentially completed on time and within budget,
allowing for the relatively high price escalation in Turkey during project
implementation.



iii
7.          Through April 1993, the Sir Power Plant had generated 1,374 million
kWh of electricity, which had a potential revenue value of some $83 million.
SustainabilLty
8.          As a result of the project, CEAS developed a technical and managerial
capability that can be applied to future capital investment projects. CEAS has
the experience to operate an efficient power generation capacity. The project
proved to be an economically viable undertaking. The new Bank financed project,
Berke Hydropower Plant, clearly demonstrates the results achieved.
Findings and Lessons
9.          This project demonstrated that there is no shortcut to success and
that there can be no substitute for good management. In summary,
(a)   CEAS and its management had a commitment to cost and schedule
control,
(b)   There was close coordination and cooperation between the Bank and
the Borrower,
(c)   There was early and sustained involvement by the Bank,
(d)   Thorough project preparation was undertaken, and
(e)   There was early resolution of technical and procurement issues so
that project schedules were not adversely affected.

2.    Background
2.01 In every year from 1971 through Project Appraisal in 1985, the national
electricity supply was insufficient to meet demand; the shortfall averaged 9%
per annum over the period 1965-1985. As a result imports increased, supply
interruptions became more frequent, and a high cost was added to the economy.
Total demand was forecast to increase at about 10% per annum to 1990 and at
about 8% per annum beyond 1990.
2.02 To meet this increasing demand the country needed to bring on stream
three times more capacity in the 1980's than in the 1970's and to sustain that
momentum throughout most of the 1990's. To accomplish this, a major
coordinated effort was required from all the agencies in the power subsector.
2.03 The Government's Five Year Plan of 1985-89 placed priority on domestic
sources of energy, especially hydro and lignite. Another important issue was
an increased role for the private sector, particularly in the construction and
operation of power plants.
2.04 Law 3096, issued in December 1984, allows utilities and other companies,
designated as regional utilities, to construct and operate generating
facilities and to have full responsibility for electricity distribution and
sales within a designated service area.
2.05 Cukurova Elektrik A.S. (CEAS), a limited liability company subject to
the provisions of the Turkish Commercial Code, was granted a concession in
1953 for the supply of electricity in the Cukurova Region of Southern Turkey.
CEAS was initially formed to operate the power portion of the multipurpose
Seyhan Project, which was partially financed by Bank Loan 63-TU.
2.06 In 1983, CEAS received the approval of the State Planning Organization
(SPO) and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) to construct the
Sir Hydropower Project (Loan 2750-TU) and the Duzkesme-Berke Hydropower
Project, now known simply as Berke Hydropower Project (Loan 3476-TU). CEAS
subsequently applied to become a "regional utility", as provided for under Law
3096 (para. 2.04). By a Government of Turkey (GOT) decree of September 26,
1988, and an "Agreement of Entrustment" from MENR on October 19, 1988, CEAS
achieved "regional utility" status.



- 2 -
2.07 The Project was the twentieth Bank operation in the power subsector in
Turkey, of which four were credits/loans to GOT with onlending to CEAS. This
loan followed the same pattern, namely, a loan to GOT with onlending to CEAS.
3.    Proiect Objectives and Description
3.01 As mentioned earlier, GOT was encouraging greater participation of the
private sector in power investments (para. 2.03). Through involvement in this
Project, the Bank was to serve as a catalyst to enable one of the first power
plants in Turkey to be constructed and financed without public funds under the
new legislation. Bank involvement was to assist the country in achieving
certain policy objectives:
(a)   developing indigenous hydroelectric resources;
(b)   reducing the country's dependence on imported oil;
(c)   encouraging involvement of the private sector to supplement public
investment in expanding Turkey's generation capacity to meet the
demand; and
(d)   creating job opportunities in a less developed region
(Kahramanmaras) during the project construction period.
3.02 The Project had the following components:
(a)   thin concrete double curvature arch dam with a gross storage
reservoir capacity of 1,120 million m3, an associated powerhouse
of 282.5 MW (three 94.5 MW vertical Francis turbine generator
units), and a switchyard;
(b)   transmission line facilities to interconnect the Sir powerhouse
with TEK's 380-kV grid, and subtransmission lines and substation
facilities to efficiently transmit the Sir generation to the load
centers in the CEAS service area; and
(c)   technical assistance for studies to improve the existing
facilities of CEAS, a regional power transmission study including
"wheeling" of power over the National Grid System, training,
procurement of training equipment, and upgrading of existing
computer facilities.
(d)   Because of the reservoir impoundment, a resettlement program, or
provision of indemnification, was required for about 7,000 people
then living in the project area, including provision of
alternative adequate housing and other community and
infrastructure facilities.
3.03 The total cost of the Project, including physical and price
contingencies, but excluding interest during construction, was estimated at



- 3 -
$241 million, of which $114 was in foreign exchange. Interest during
construction was estimated at $18 million, bringing the total financing
required to $259 million.
3.04 The Bank loan of $132 million was to finance 100 percent of the foreign
cost including the $18 million for interest during construction. The
remaining $127 million of total cost were to be covered by $98 million from
CEAS' internal cash generation and $29 million from CEAS share capital.
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.01 Organization. For the dam and powerhouse, CEAS established a separate
Project Manager and associated support staff at its headquarters. This was
supplemented by a site organization consisting of a chief site engineer
assisted by civil, electrical, and mechanical engineers and surveyors.
4.02 Implementation of the transmission lines and substations and the
technical assistance components was the responsibility of CEAS' Project
Planning and Construction Divisions. Engineering services were provided by
ELTEM-TEK. As the operator of a regional transmission network, CEAS had
adequate experience in engineering and supervision during construction and
commissioning of transmission facilities, as well as in procuring materials
and equipment for subtransmission lines and substations.
4.03 An International Board of Experts was established (a) to advise on
design problems arising during construction and commissioning, (b) to review
construction progress, and (c) to monitor during construction the safety of
the dam and associated structures and the reservoir. The Board was
constituted of internationally known experts in the fields of rock mechanics,
engineering geology, design and construction of thin concrete arch dams, and
powerhouse equipment.
4.02 Design. CEAS appointed Coyne et Bellier (C&B) as international
engineering consultants. At Project Appraisal, C&B had completed the detailed
engineering and design for the dam and the powerhouse. Final design of the
transmission component was dependent on the results of the regional power
transmission study.
4.03 Procurement. All Bank-financed procurement for civil works, and supply
and installation of material and equipment was to be according to the Bank's
Procurement Guidelines. International competitive bidding was to be followed
for the major contract packages. The procurement plan and contract packages
were typical for a major hydroelectric project. At Project Appraisal
contracts had already been awarded for basic infrastructure facilities and
some of the preliminary works. Prequalification of the bidders for the main
civil works contract had been completed.
4.04 Training. The Sir Hydropower Project was essentially to double CEAS'
installed generating capacity. Therefore, training was planned for CEAS staff



- 4 -
in the areas of load dispatch, load management, computer system applications,
project planning, financial management, and manpower planning.
4.05 Resettlement. Land acquisition and the resettlement plan for 7,000
people were important elements of the overall project design. Without timely
execution of these elements the overall project schedule would have been in
jeopardy. At Appraisal CEAS had already formed a Real Estate and
Expropriation Works Department and had acquired the land required for the
start-up phase of the project. Turkish law is quite explicit on the
expropriation of land needed for public purposes. CEAS had to work closely
with the provincial Directorate of Real Estate and Expropriation to implement
a program for the Sir Project.
5.    Project Implementation
5.01 Implementation proceeded according to the original schedule with few
exceptions. Timely procurement decisions helped adhere to the schedule. For
example, the major contracts for civil works, turbine/generator sets, and
cranes/hoists were awarded on schedule.
5.02 The initial project schedule, submitted to the Bank in September 1986,
called for successive commissioning of the three turbine/generator units in
June, August, and December of 1990. A schedule forecast in September 1989
pushed these dates out until April 15, June 15, and August 15, 1991. Actual
commissioning occurred on April 17, July 14, and August 24, 1991.
5.03 As is the case with most large civil engineering projects, site
conditions frequently change the design, scope, and cost of the project from
those envisioned during the feasibility stage. The engineering consultants,
assisted by the International Board of Experts, made three significant design
changes that had positive effects. Modifications to the design of the
concrete arch dam resulted in less material, greater design efficiency, and
lower cost. Alternate placement of the powerhouse and switchyard increased
efficiency of the power complex and entailed reduced excavation. Soil and
rock conditions of the canyon walls necessitated relocation of the spillway
from the left bank to the right bank. This change was the most problematic
for ultimate project success.
5.04 The overall performance of the civil works contractor Italstrade-Recchi
was satisfactory. As is typical of large civil works contracts, disputes
arose around quantities, extra work, and additional compensation. By the
third quarter of 1987, the contractor was forecasting a three month schedule
slippage. In the second quarter of 1988 the forecast slippage had increased
to six months. During the first quarter of 1989 the civil works contractor
did not provide updated schedules as required and at one point suggested that
he would stop work. CEAS and Italstrade-Recchi were able to resolve the
conflict through a contract addendum that established new target dates for
commissioning and an increased payment to the contractor.



- 5 -
5.05 Although the September 1989 forecast provided for the commissioning of
the first unit on April 15, 1991, a plan was prepared to advance that date to
February 15. That would have been achieved except that the project was an
indirect casualty of the Gulf conflict. Construction activities at the site
were shut down for six weeks in January/February 1991.
5.06 The completion of the power system planning and "wheeling" study was
completed one year behind the original schedule. Because a cooperative and
coordinated effort with TEK was required to implement the study
recommendations, namely, connections at both 154-kV and 380-kV, this delay
could have had a negative effect on efficiently supplying electricity to the
grid. However, because of CEAS changed status as a "regional utility' and
because of delays in construction of TEK's 380-kV substation at Andirin, Sir
power generation was connected solely to CEAS' 154-kV transmission system, and
the concept of wheeling no longer applied.
5.07 The land acquisition/resettlement program was budgeted at $20 million.
Landowners were given the option of relocation or indemnification. The vast
majority chose indemnification. CEAS worked closely with provincial
authorities and village leaders to ensure a satisfactory outcome of this
program. The Bank closely monitored resettlement progress and engaged experts
in this field on the initial supervision missions. Cultural and antiquity
issues were also considered and the measures taken by the governmental
authorities and CEAS were acceptable to the Bank.
6.    Project Results
6.01 The first power plant in Turkey to be constructed and financed without
public funds under new legislation was successfully completed. This project
doubled the generating capacity of CEAS, as well as adding significantly to
Turkey's overall energy production capability. Electricity was generated only
eight months later than originally scheduled.
6.02 CEAS, as Project Manager, successfully implemented a major capital
investment project. This positive experience should carry over to the
construction of the Berke Hydropower Project (Loan 3476-TU).
6.03 An upgraded computer facility was installed.
6.04 A utility system training program was provided by a foreign utility
company, Southern Electric International.
6.05 The land acquisition/resettlement program was satisfactorily completed
with little apparent dissatisfaction on the part of the populace or the
government.



-6-
7.    Bank Performance
7.01 The Bank had an early and sustained involvement in the Sir Project.
Close coordination with CEAS led to early resolution of design review and
procurement issues. The design review resulted in a substantial cost
reduction (about 20%) on civil works.
7,02 The Bank utilized recognized international experts as consultants during
early missions to address some of the technical issues. This led to a
successful International Board of Experts during project implementation.
7.03 The Bank participated in a working session on procurement in Paris with
CEAS and Coyne et Bellier, engineering consultants for the project. This
meeting produced a coherent set of bidding documents for the civil works and
allowed key procurement dates to be met. Issues that can take months to
resolve through correspondence were dealt with in a matter of days.
7.04 Supervision missions were regularly undertaken and staffed with the
proper mix of technical specialists.
8.    Performance of the Borrower
8.01 Although the Borrower was technically the Government, CEAS, through
onlending, functioned in the capacity as Borrower. CEAS demonstrated a
sincere commitment to the Project and assigned the necessary resources to
successfully complete a major capital investment.
8.02 By establishing a separate Project Management organization, CEAS ensured
that daily operational issues of a "regional utility" would not interfere with
an investment that would double its generating capacity and increase its net
assets by ten-fold.
8.03 Except for minor upsets, CEAS maintained good working relationships with
its engineering consultant, its major contractors, and the Bank. Issues were
addressed in a timely manner, so that unacceptable schedule delays would not
occur.
8.04 CEAS supported the technical assistance components of the project and
ensured that key staff participated in the utility management systems training
program.
9.    Consulting Services
9.01 Performance of the engineering consultants, Coyne et Bellier was very
satisfactory. C&B was responsive to the CEAS, the International Board of
Experts, and the Bank.
9.02 Satisfactory results were obtained from two other consultants: Power
Technologies Inc. for the power system plapning study and Southern Electric



- 7 -
International for the data processing strategy plan and the utility management
systems training program.
10.   Findings and Lessons
10.1 The Sir Hydropower Project was a very successful operation. The keys to
success can be summarized as follows:
(a)   Commitment by the Borrower to cost and schedule control,
(b)   Well prepared and complete project preparation that was initiated
on time and that addressed all aspects of project implementation,
(c)   Establishment of a separate Project Management organization that
had the authority to implement the project with a minimum of
outside interference,
(d)   Early and sustained involvement by the Bank with close
coordination and cooperation with the Borrower, and
(e)   Early resolution of procurement issues so that project schedules
were not adversely affected.
10.2 In general, project preparation is key for successful project
implementation. Only a good balance between the attention that the Bank
devotes to project implementation issues during the preparation phase, and
that it devotes to and policy aspects can ensure that an operation is
successful.
10.3 In many respects, commitment of the borrower to the Bank's procurement
procedures and capacity to implement them is the key to successful project
implementation. The success of this project was largely due to the fact that
the Bank worked closely with the Borrower in the initial project phase to
develop a coherent and consistent project procurement plan and to develop
concise and complete bidding documents. This early investment paid large
dividends as the project was implemented.

PART II
CEAS's Comment on PCR
1.    Summary of Project Implementation
1.01 Construction ofthe Project (Part A, Dam and Powerhouse) actually started
by signing the contract for Consulting Engineering and Construction
Supervision Services on May 23, 1985 with Coyne et Bellier, France and Aknil
Engineers Consultants, Turkey. The Engineer C&B was responsible for:
(i) preparation of the bidding documents; (ii) assisting CEAS in examination
and evaluation of the bids received; (iii) inspection of the equipment during
manufacture; and (iv) providing advice to CEAS's project team on engineering
and technical supervision during construction and commissioning.
The preliminary studies and site works such as access roads and
bridges, social facilities, energy supply, communication system, service
bridge have been completed during the period July 1985 - December 1987.
The contract for the construction of the Diversion Tunnel was
signed on January 6, 1986 and construction was started actually by January 23,
1986 by local contractor Dogus Construction and Trading Company to complete
the works and divert the river on May 23, 1987. However, the contractor was
not completed the works in due time and the final river diversion was
completed on July 24, 1987.
Civil Works contract was awarded to Italstrade-Recchi SPA, Italy,
on November 1, 1986, including namely the construction of the arch dam,
spillway, powerhouse, tnnels and galleries, drainage and grouting, roads and

6. Project Results
A. Direct Benefits
(1) Job Creation
The Sir Dam and Power Plant employs 108 staff, including one
manager, three engineers, and twenty-one security personnel.
(2) Electricity and Revenue Generation
Through April 1993, the Sir Power Plant had generated 1,374
million kWh of electricity. Using a figure of six cents per kWh,
potential revenue was $82.5 million for the period.
(3) Increase in Generating Capacity
The project doubled the generating capacity of CEAS and increased
the company's net assets by about ten-fold.
(4) Technical and Management Capability
CEAS developed the technical and management capability that can
be applied to future projects.
B. Economic Impact
The rate of return analysis in the SAR was carried out on the basis that the
project was an integral part of the national 1985-1995 expansion program for
the power subsector. The program was estimated to have an economic rate of
return of 11.5%, compared to an opportunity cost of capital of 12%.
The rate of return for the Sir Hydro Project, as presented in the following
table, is estimated to be 12.9%. The key assumptions are:
(1)      Incremental revenues derived from investment were taken as the
benefits of the program. Electricity tariffs correspond to the price
at the bus bar, which was taken as 5.5 cents per kWh.



- 14 -
(2)      Electricity generation for the years 1991 and 1992 is actual.
Generation for the period 1993-2021 was estimated according to the
hydrology and development of the irrigation project at Menzelet site.
The decreasing rate of generation results from an increasing amount of
water being diverted for irrigation purposes.
(3)      The capital costs of the project are actual with the local component
multiplied by a conversion factor of 0.8 to reflect shadow prices.
Operation and maintenance costs were estimated at 1.0% of cumulative
capital costs for generation and transmission.

C. Financial Impact
CEAS was able to generate sufficient internal cash for the local cost portion
of the project. The project had no direct impact on the Government's debt
portfolio because no public funds were utilized. The only public assistance
took the form of tax reduction, investment incentives, and custom duty
exemption.
D. Studies
(1) Power System Planning
This study was to determine the most economic way of transmitting
Sir (and later Berke) power generation taking into consideration
CEAS future requirements for subtransmission lines and substation
facilities; TEK's existing and planned transmission facilities in
the vicinity of CEAS service region; and the possibility of
"wheeling" power over TEK's transmission lines.
The study recommended interconnecting Sir power generation with
the TEK system at both 154-kV and 380-kV. However, because of
CEAS changed status as a "regional utility" with excessive demand
for electricity and construction delays in completing TEK's 380-
kV substation at Andirin, Sir power generation was connected
solely to CEAS 154-kV system. The concept of "wheeeling" Sir
(and Berke) power no longer appears to be applicable.
(2) Data Processing Strategy Plan
This study, completed by an international utility, was to
determine an appropriate data processing strategy for CEAS as a
"regional utility" with respect to computer hardware and software
applications.
The study resulted in $1.3 million foreign cost and $0.7 million
local cost investment in upgraded hardware and software.
