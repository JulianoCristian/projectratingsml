                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation of the project continues to increase at a faster pace albeit from a low base, further enhanced with the September 30 2011 restructuring and extension of the closing
                         date for the project until March 2013. The incipient progress legal (financial and commercial) sector aspects, that started to become evident during the last ISR period has moved at a
                         faster pace, particularly with the guidance of the newly appointed Chief Justice and Attorney General. The project remains well underway to achieve its development objectives, as
                         indicated by the targets met for each of the development indicators at the time of the restructuring process, with the exception of the target for spreads that increased due to
                         macroeconomic pressures, international and other factors currently being addressed. Key items currently being supported at various agencies are expected to enable the automation
                         of (commercial and financial) courts, improving case management and records management including at land registry, which will reduce time and costs of legal services. The legal
                         framework continues to be strengthened, with additional key bills submitted to Parliament during this period and others being drafted. Overall prudential (focusing on risk based
                         supervision), regulatory and supervisory capacity as well as governance have been improving at all supervisory entities to help enhance the resilience of the financial sector and
                         ultimately broaden access to financial services, including at SASRA, the newest institution that has licensed more than 80 SACCOs. Debt and capital markets continue to be
                         developed, while the framework for public private partnership (PPP) to address long term financing for infrastructure is being further supported including an ongoing consultancy for
                         developing a PPP pipeline and safeguards frameworks. In addition, key elements to further enhance broader access to financial services are being implemented, including on mobile
                         banking and payments systems, credit bureau, and agency banking. Strategic aspects at both financial and legal sectors have also been developed, complementing comprehensive
                         strategies being implemented. The World Bank has also supported several key topics with technical missions to provide hands on advice to help achieve project objectives.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project restructuring was successfully completed and approved by September 30th 2011, with the news closing date extended to March 31 2013. The procurement plan has
                         been updated to incorporate recent status since the restructuring (and accounting for delay that these processes entail), which are being implemented with notable improvements on
                         legal sector components in addition to continued fast pace for financial sector compoents. These activities are being implemented at various levels, with enhanced capacity at the
                         project unit as well as more engaged role of beneficiaries.
