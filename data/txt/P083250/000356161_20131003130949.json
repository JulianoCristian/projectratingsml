Legal\n            Sector Technical Assistance Project (FLSTAP) for Kenya were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            strong analytical foundations are necessary to build\n            successful technical assistance operations. The\n            project's flexible design made it possible to\n            accommodate changing priorities and to include new issues\n            that were completely unforeseen at inception. Complex\n            technical assistance projects require extra resources.\n            FLSTAP covered a broad range of financial, legal and\n            judicial technical areas, which required the mobilization of\n            numerous experts. Supervision budgets exceeded bank\n            averages, and considerable additional funds were mobilized\n            and expertise leveraged including EFOs from co-financier\n            Department of International Development (DFID), without\n            which the project's development objectives may not have\n            been achieved and reform momentum could have been wasted.\n            Institutional development takes time and requires continuous\n            support. On the question of complexity and scope, it is not\n            easy to speculate about a counterfactual design that could\n            have settled, for example, with implementing two parallel\n            projects. Percentages in financing formulas for each\n            category of expenditures for each of the three project\n            funding sources was impractical and at times inconsistent\n            with targeted disbursement levels: allocating specific\n            percentages for the four expenditure categories (goods and\n            equipment, consulting services, training and workshops and\n            operating costs) that varied across categories, added\n            another level of complexity to the financial management of\n            the project."}, "docdt": "2013-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
