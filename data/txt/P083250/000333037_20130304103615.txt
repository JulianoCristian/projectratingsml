3.       Brief summary of project implementation progress:

         (i) As of February 13, 2013, out of the US$18 million IDA Credit (excluding
             exchange rate gains), US$10.43 million are disbursed (US$20.2 million for
             IDA, DFID and GoK) and US$7.5 million committed (including a number of
             ICT activities and goods), with a US$3.4 million contract (and 3 other smaller
             contracts) recently signed. The need to adjust the percentage of expenditures
             is required explicitly to be able to pay for this large contract, which under
             existing co-financing arrangements would not be possible. Please note that by
             contract, the goods and services will be delivered before March 31, 2013.

         (ii) The project’s performance in achieving the PDOs has been satisfactory and
              project implementation has benefited from the restructuring processes. The
              Recipient, DFID and the IDA project team are in agreement that despite the
              project’s structural complexities: (i) a large and critical set of activities has
              been completed with recognized impact by all implementing agencies, (ii)
              substantial progress has been made towards achievement of objectives, and
              (iii) all crucial activities planned are now under implementation (with the
              exception of one ICT related activity, which will not be completed).

4. The rational for the proposed reallocation is to facilitate completion of project
   activities and substantial achievement of development objectives by removing
   constraints related to the project’s co-financing structure reflected in the legal
   agreement. With DFID funds close to being depleted, and the GoK’s contribution
   exhausted, reallocating and increasing the portion financed by the IDA Credit, and
   increasing the special account ceiling, would allow for the full implementation of
   ongoing activities that were deemed crucial for the achievement of objectives. This
   notably includes the finalization of the automation and modernization of supervisory
   processes of all financial sector supervisors, as well as activities related to the legal
   sector.
