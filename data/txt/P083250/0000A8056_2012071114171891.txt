                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation of the project is satisfactory, enhanced by the September 30 2011 restructuring and extension of the closing date for the project until March 2013. This allows for the
                         completion of critical procurement, including on ICT related activities, that are crucial to the project objectives and are underway. The change in the leadership of legal and judicial
                         reform agenda led to a strategic review, which confirmed the activities under this project as priority. These activities are being implemented. The project remains well underway to
                         achieve its development objectives, as indicated by the targets met for each of the development indicators as of May 2012, with the exception of the target for spreads that has
                         started to decline after the effect of macroeconomic pressures, international and other factors started to subside by late 2011. Key items currently being supported at various
                         agencies are expected to set the basis for the automation of (commercial and financial) courts and improving case management and records management including at land registry,
                         which will reduce time and costs of legal services. Additional bills have been submitted to Parliament during this period, with some expected to be submitted shortly and others being
                         drafted. Overall prudential (focusing on risk based supervision), regulatory and supervisory capacity as well as governance has continued to improve at all supervisory entities to help
                         enhance the resilience of the financial sector and ultimately broaden access to financial services, including at SASRA, the newest institution that has licensed more than 122
                         SACCOs licensed (controlling 82% of SACCOs with Front Offices Services Activities) as at of end June 2012. Debt and capital markets continue to be developed, while the
                         framework for public private partnership (PPP) to address long term financing for infrastructure is being further supported including an ongoing consultancy for developing a PPP
                         pipeline and safeguards frameworks developed. In addition, key elements to further enhance broader access to financial services are being implemented, including on mobile banking
                         and payments systems, credit bureau, and agency banking. Strategic aspects at both financial and legal sectors have also been developed, complementing comprehensive strategies
                         being implemented. The World Bank has also supported several key topics with technical missions to provide hands on advice to help achieve project objectives.
