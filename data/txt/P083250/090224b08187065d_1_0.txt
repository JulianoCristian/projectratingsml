                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation of the project is satisfactory, enhanced by the September 30 2011 restructuring and extension of the closing date for the project until March 2013. The extension and
                         priority of key activities has allowed for the completion of critical procurement, including on ICT related activities, that are crucial to the project objectives and are either completed or
                         closed to completion. The project remains on track to achieve its development objectives, as indicated by the targets met for each of the development indicators as of October 2012,
                         with the exception of the target for spreads that has started to decline after the effect of macroeconomic pressures, international and other factors started to subside by late 2011.
                         Efforts to document achievements related to judicial reform have been consolidated, with additional information expected to be received before the closing date; this information will
                         serve as the basis for future reforms, some being supported by the newly approved Judicial Performance Improvement project.

                         Key items currently being supported at various agencies are expected to set the basis for the automation of (commercial and financial) courts and improving case management and
                         records management including at land registry, which will reduce time and costs of legal services. Additional bills have been submitted to Parliament during this period, with two
                         crucial bills approved on Counter-Financing of terrorism and on Public Private Partnerships; other bills are being reviewed. Overall prudential (focusing on risk based supervision),
                         regulatory and supervisory capacity as well as governance has continued to improve at all supervisory entities to help enhance the resilience of the financial sector and ultimately
                         broaden access to financial services, including at SASRA, the newest institution that has licensed virtually all SACCOs with Front Offices Services Activities. Debt and capital markets
                         continue to be developed, while the framework for public private partnership (PPP) to address long term financing for infrastructure is being further supported including a consultancy
                         completed for developing a potential PPP pipeline and safeguards frameworks developed. In addition, key elements to further enhance broader access to financial services are being
                         implemented, including on mobile banking, payments systems, credit bureau, and the use of land as collateral. Strategic aspects at both financial and legal sectors have also been
                         developed, complementing comprehensive strategies being implemented. The World Bank has also supported several key topics with technical missions to provide hands on advice
                         to help achieve project objectives.
