                   Target considered achieved as case clearance rates showed an overall
                   improvement. Baselines were determined by a report commissioned by
                   FLSTAP (2013), which collected and analyzed historical case clearance data,
                   enabled by reforms supported by the FLSTAP. Since the analysis of the case
                   clearance was not possible at appraisal, introduced at restructuring after
                   reforms had taken place, the team could not reformulate the indicator to be

                   improvement including training of Judges, Revision of Civil Procedures Act
                   2010, and equipment. These are reflected in clearance rates from 2009

                                  x
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1       Context at Appraisal

1.     Country and Sector background: After a decade of weak economic performance,
Kenya experienced a moderate rebound in economic activity in 2003/04 (July/June) and a drop
in domestic debt. However, inflation was on the rise, reaching 19 per cent in September 2004
from eight percent a year earlier, and the shilling was depreciating, after the Central Bank of
Kenya (CBK) had loosened monetary policy.

2.      A new Government had taken office in December 2002, and had demonstrated its
commitment to improving governance. It had prepared an Economic Recovery Strategy for
Wealth and Employment Creation (ERSWEC) which aimed to restore the economy to a path of
high growth. Within this framework, the government committed to maintaining a stable
macroeconomic framework, reforming the financial sector, implementing mechanisms for
private sector participation in the provision of infrastructure services, and establishing a
competitive environment able to attract increased private investment in productive sectors such
as tourism, trade and industry. The Government had entered into an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
3
  arrangement, and the first review had shown authorities to be responsive to reform advice,
which was not observed before 2003, where pervasive governance problems and weak political
commitment to economic reforms did not provide a favourable environment for the
implementation.

3.      State of the financial and legal sectors: A joint Bank-Fund Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) had been completed for Kenya in late-2003. It provided a broad overview of
financial sector vulnerabilities and developmental needs. The Kenyan banking system was well-
established in 2004, with 43 commercial banks, but with several constraints and vulnerabilities4
that prevented it from reaching its full potential in supporting the allocation of scarce economic
resources and promoting strong growth, including:
          (i)      High level of Non-performing loans (NPLs) threatening financial stability. Most
                   of the high level of NPLs of public banks were on account of old government-
                   intermediated credits, as well as from banks’ failure to enforce contracts under the
                   old regime because of legal, political, and judicial hurdles. Policies needed to
                   focus on the restructuring of public banks, including their privatization.5
          (ii)     Limited access to financial services by Kenyan households, notably in the rural
                   areas, and by private enterprises, especially micro, small and medium enterprises
                   (MSMEs).


3
  Implementation of Fund policy in four areas: governance, fiscal sustainability, financial sector, and poverty
reduction. Less successful in responding to the recommendations of the Fund and the Bank to reduce public sector
ownership of banks. The government has indicated that the slow progress in this area reflects primarily fears that
privatization may adversely affect financial intermediation in rural areas.

Requests for Augmentation of Access, Rephasing of the Arrangement, and Waiver of Performance Criteria”, December 6, 2004


                                                             1
       (iii)   Lack of competition with many weak banks unable to exert competitive pressure
               on the few strong banks.
       (iv)    Structural problems in the non-bank sector, including weak supervisory capability
               of the insurance sector.
       (v)     Limited coverage of the pension system, inadequate benefits, and high levels of
               unfunded liabilities.
       (vi)    Limited capacity of the Capital Markets Authority with no operational
               independence.
       (vii)   The legal framework for property rights, insolvency, and creditor rights was
               fragmented, outmoded, and incomplete, requiring comprehensive review of laws
               to make them more relevant to the needs of the Kenyan economy.
4.     In addition, the following constraints were evident in the legal/judiciary sector:
       (i)     Legal and judicial sector institutional issues, including weak capacity, corruption,
               and poor enforcement of laws.
       (ii)    The court system was operating inefficiently, with most of its operations handled
               manually. Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the court system was
               considered central to improving the functioning of the legal and judicial
               framework in general.
       (iii)   System for legal education suffered from neglect and had become largely
               inadequate for the rapidly growing needs of the Kenyan economy.

5.      In view of the above constraints, the Government was developing a financial sector
reform program to address policy, institutional and legal issues impeding the efficient operation
of the sector. In the medium term, the Government had indicated its intention to draw up a
financial sector development strategy that would provide the framework for measures necessary
for achievement of policy objectives. The Government asked the Bank for a Technical
Assistance Credit to assist in the implementation of its financial and legal sector reform program.

6.      Rationale for Bank Assistance: The Bank had initiated a reengagement with Kenya,
which was formalized by the presentation of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) to the Board
in May 2004. The CAS was aligned with the country’s ERSWEC, and the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP), which was discussed at the Bank and IMF Boards in early May 2004.
The Bank’s re-engagement followed two decades of economic mismanagement which had left
much of Kenya’s infrastructure in shambles and its institutions weakened. The CAS noted that
with the right investments and policy and institutional reforms, Kenya had significant potential
for growth. The CAS also highlighted the urgent need to rebuild Kenya’s institutional capacity,
and failure to do so would constitute a major area of risk.

7.     The approval of FLSTAP (Sep. 2004) closely followed the Bank’s strategy of re-
engagement with Kenya. FLSTAP aimed to provide technical expertise and capacity building in
support of the Government’s financial sector reform program and governance, justice, and law
and order sector program. The project was consistent with the second pillar of the CAS
(Reducing the cost of doing business and improving the investment climate).




                                                 2
8.      FLSTAP was the first financial sector loan in Kenya since 1994, and grew out of a
renewed dialogue initiated in 2003 around the need for financial sector reform. At the same time,
preparations also began for a joint Bank-Fund Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) to
conduct a comprehensive review of the financial system and identify weaknesses/vulnerabilities
and develop additional medium term reforms needed to support the development of the financial
sector. The FSAP was completed in late-2003. The Government requested Bank support to
address FSAP recommendations.
9.      In the legal sector, the Bank had been a leading donor and was at the time co-chairing the
legal sector donor coordinating group. In 1999 the Bank provided assistance to the Government
to develop a legal sector strategy. This strategy eventually became the Government’s medium
term Governance, Justice, and Law and Order Sector (GJLOS) reform strategy. The Bank and
the other members of the legal sector coordinating group had worked closely with the
Government on the development of the GJLOS reform strategy.

1.2       Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

10.    The overall development objective of the project, as stated in the original PAD, was to
create a sound financial system and strengthened legal and judicial capacity that will ensure
broad access to financial and related legal services.

11.     However, the PDO in the DCA was as follows: “Support the Borrower in carrying out
reforms to create a sound financial system and strengthened legal framework necessary to
implement the Borrower’s Program.” According to IEG guidelines, in this case the evaluation
will be based on the PDO in the DCA.

Key Performance Indicators at project approval included:
         Percentage of population with access to appropriate financial services increases by 20%.
         Increase in private credit provision relative to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 30%.
         The ratio of non-performing loans to the total loan portfolio of the banking system is
          reduced to less than 10%.
         Spread between average deposit rate and lending rate for prime customers decreased by
          30%.
         Reduction of backlog in commercial cases by 25%.
         Appropriate adoption of key commercial sector laws.
         Increase in measured satisfaction of the business community with the judiciary by 25%.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

12.     The PDO was not revised during the implementation period, but the Key Indicators were
revised during a Level Two restructuring on September 28, 2011. Though the restructuring did
not change the PDO given the pace of ongoing reforms, outcome indicators were revised to
increase their relevance and to ensure that they could be measured and monitored. For instance,
the original indicator on reducing backlog of commercial cases, which was not measurable, was
changed to reflect the rate of case clearance by the Milimani Commericial Courts, which became

                                                  3
measurable after reforms supported by the project had taken place. Hence, the revisions did not
reflect changes in project scope. According to the ICR guidelines, this entails the necessity to
conduct a split evaluation. The revised PDO indicators were as follows:
     The rate(s) of case clearances by the Milimani Commercial Courts, or in respect of major
        types of commercial cases, improves significantly by at least 5 percent annually from
        2011 (new)
     At least 15 new or upgraded Commercial/ Financial and related laws and subsidiary
        legislation developed, approved by Cabinet and published by the State Law Office
        (Attorney General’s Office) (New)
     Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) drop to eight percent of total loans (net of interest in
        suspense) by end of project. (Slightly revised)
     Interest rate spread between average deposit rates and lending rates falls below eight
        percent by end of project (Slightly revised)
     Credit extended to the private sector as a percentage of GDP increases to at least 37
        percent by end of project. (Slightly revised)
     Percentage of population with access to formal rural financial services increases to at
        least 40 percent by end of project (New)
     Percentage of population with access to formal financial services increases to 50 percent
        by end of project. (Revised)
     Number of accounts in the financial sector increases to 15 million accounts by project
        end. (New)

1.4       Main Beneficiaries

A list of the 22 beneficiary agencies is as follows (17 separate institutions):
         Component 1: Ministry of Finance – Economic Affairs Department (EAD), Kenya
          School of Monetary Studies, Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
         Component 2: Ministry of Finance – EAD Ministry of Finance
         Component 3: CBK – Bank Supervision Department (BSD), Capital Markets Authority
          (CMA), Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA), Retirement Benefits Authority (RBA),
          Deposit Protection Fund Board (DPFB), Ministry of Cooperative Development and
          Marketing (MoCD&M)/ Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization (SACCO) &
          SACCO Societies Regulatory Authority (SASRA)
         Component 4: MOF – Debt Management Department (DMD), CBK Debt Department,
          PPP Secretariat (MOF)
         Component 5: CBK – Payment Systems Department
         Component 6: CBK – BSD, MOF –EAD, Ministry of Lands, Registrar General (RG),
          Kenya Law Reform Commission (KLRC), Judiciary
         Component 7: State Law Office (SLO), Judiciary, KLRC, National Council for Law
          Reporting, Kenya School of Law, University of Nairobi

1.5    Original Components (as approved)
The project consisted of eight components, including project management (US$4.0 million):

                                                  4
13.     Component 1: Financial and Judicial Sector Strategy Development (US$0.8 million;
IDA: US$0.36 million). The Project aimed to support the formulation of a financial sector
strategy and the development of a strategy for the judiciary. The Project sought to support
relevant agencies in developing a framework for monitoring and evaluating progress in financial
sector development and judicial and legal reforms.

14.     Component 2: Restructuring and Privatization of Financial Institutions (US$3.3
million; IDA: US$1.8 million). The banking system had at the time a very high level of non-
performing loans concentrated in four commercial banks with state interests. Divesting the
Government’s stake in these institutions was expected to help strengthen competition and
improve stability, which could result in downward pressure on the high interest rate margins and
increase the incentives to reach underserved markets. The Project planned to support the
establishment of a specialist Bank Restructuring and Privatization Project (BRPP) within the
Ministry of Finance to guide the privatization process from the identification of strategic options
for divestiture. Areas of possible further support included the restructuring of: (i) the
Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), in line with the DFI strategy currently being developed,
and (ii) Kenya Post Office Savings Bank (KPOSB) and Co-operative Bank, two key institutions
for improving access to financial services.

15.      Component 3: Strengthening Financial Sector Regulators and the Deposit Protection
Fund Board (US$3.9 million; IDA: US$2.2 million). The primary role of the Government in the
financial sector is to provide the legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework that promotes
soundness and competition in the sector. The Project was designed to provide support for the
review, amendment and/or drafting of financial sector laws and regulations that govern all the
regulators and the DPF, with the objective of strengthening their effectiveness. It would also
support capacity building initiatives for these institutions, including needs assessment, training of
staff, the resident advisors, and the establishment of capacity to regulate and supervise the
microfinance and SACCOs sectors under the proposed new legislation. In addition,
improvements were planned to be made to the Management Information Systems (MIS) of these
institutions, including software upgrades and purchase of hardware.

16.     Component 4: Strengthening Debt Management and Debt Markets (US$1.5 million;
IDA: US$0.9 million). The updating of Government debt databases was being handled by
individual entities in the Ministry of Finance and CBK responsible for parts of debt management
with no coordination or consolidation of data. The Project intended to provide technical support
for setting up a unified and sustainable Debt Management Office, including review of relevant
legislation. The Project also was expected to support a number of technical improvements with a
view to enhancing the operation of the primary and secondary government debt markets.

17.    Component 5: Modernizing the National Payments System (US$3.1 million; IDA:
US$1.8 million). The Kenyan authorities recognized the existing deficiencies in the clearing and
settlement mechanisms and a task force produced a framework and strategy paper for the
modernization of the national payments system, introducing a Real Time Gross Settlement
System (RTGS). The Central Bank had already earmarked funds for the acquisition of a
standalone RTGS. The Project aimed to provide appropriate technical assistance and funding to
acquire a Scriptless Securities Settlement System/Central Depository System (CDS) to facilitate
the safe, secure and efficient clearance and settlement of funds and securities transfers (both
primary and secondary market transfers) in a manner consistent with best international practice.
In addition, the project intended to support the establishment of an appropriate legal and

                                                 5
oversight framework, and provision of expert technical advice and training for staff of the
Department of Payments System in the CBK. The Project would also fund a diagnostic study to
identify the needs for improvements in the mechanisms for low value payments transfers.

18.      Component 6: Improving the Lending Environment (US$2.3 million; IDA: US$1.4
million). One of the major impediments to growth in Kenya was insufficient access to credit for
large segments of the population and enterprises, especially micro, small and medium sized ones.
The Project sought to support: (i) improvements in the operation of the Department of the
Registrar General which includes: a) assistance to the Companies Register to enable the Registry
to clear the backlog in filing and allow for speedy and accurate information sharing of corporate
information and data; and b) combining of the Charges Register and the Chattel Mortgage
Register into one; moving the combined separate register (notification system) for
charges/pledges over movable assets out of the Companies Register and developing a new
Personal Property Securities Act (i.e., secured transactions framework) in line with international
best practices; (ii) improvements in the land registration system through digitizing land records;
(iii) establishment of a legal and regulatory framework for the operation of a credit reference
bureau that would facilitate the much needed information flow among the credit granting
institutions; and (iv) the review of impediments to the growth of the leasing industry, including
tax laws on leasing.

19.     Component 7: Legal and Judicial Reform (US$8.1 million; IDA: US$4.5 million). The
legal system in Kenya was facing major challenges in supporting effective financial
intermediation. Furthermore, the drafting, implementation and application of the legislative and
regulatory reforms, as described in Components 3 and 6 would require strong capacity in the
judiciary and in the legislative and executive offices charged with legislative drafting and law
revision. An effective legal education would ensure that the legal and judicial professions are
well placed to implement these reforms. This Component focused on the following three areas.

20.     Judicial reform: Activities in this subcomponent were expected to focus on establishing
the court and case management and records management systems and improving court registries.
Activities aimed at reducing the backlog of cases would include supporting alternative dispute
resolution (ADR) mechanisms for commercial law cases and introducing small claims court
procedures. Summary court procedures for uncontested debt enforcement would be introduced to
eliminate the frequent frustration of enforcement procedures. Support for a staff training program
and more effective human resource administration and management was also envisioned.

21.    Law reform: The Project sought to provide technical assistance to finalize the institutional
review and capacity building of law reform bodies, including the Law Reform Commission, the
Office of the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Service Commission.

22.     Legal Education: In order to strengthen the capacity of the legal profession and the
judiciary in the commercial and financial areas, it was considered necessary to enhance
education of judges and lawyers. Following a review of the institutional arrangements for basic
and continuing legal education, key legal education institutions would be provided with support
to strengthen facilities, review and develop teaching curricula and educational materials, update
libraries and research capabilities, and create new training and development opportunities for
both students and faculty.

1.6         Revised Components

23.    The original components were never revised during project implementation, though
minor adjustments were made during implementation. The comparison of expected versus actual
disbursements has a “crab’s claw” shape (see disbursement profile) which is rather typical of TA
operations, as implementation time is usually underestimated, and disbursements over-estimated.

24.     In terms of actual disbursements by component (Table 2), about one third of the funding
went to each of components 3 (Strengthening Financial Sector Regulators and the DPFB) and 7
(Legal and Judicial Reform). All components experienced a major jump in the last year of the
project, as per restructuring plan approved in 2011 because some procurement processes were
expected to take 1-2 years to complete.

25.     The project as a whole was divided in three phases: (i) Stagnation during the first two and
a half years since effectiveness; (ii) an intermediate phase following the mid-term review in 2009
during which a lot of work went into preparation of work plan activities and procurement that
would ultimately result in increased disbursement during 2011-13; and (iii) activity consolidation
and rapid acceleration in the last two years, but particularly in the year before the project’s
closing date when half of the loan was disbursed (2012/13) as procurement processes that had
been started during the second phase and expected to take 1-2 years were completed. By
component the concentration is particularly high for Components 3 and 7, for which more than
two-thirds of the funds were disbursed in the last year. This reflected the larger share of
equipment, as it entailed for component 3 setting up a number of supervisory agencies that had
not existed (SASRA) or that were mere units at the Ministry of Finance (IRA) at the beginning
of the project, plus courts covered under component 7.

1.7         Other significant changes

26.     Significant changes included a change in implementation arrangements, one informal
project extension and two Level II restructurings.

27.    Change in Implementation arrangements. The initial Project Implementing Unit (PIU)
in the Ministry of Finance, comprised of internationally recruited staff, was ineffective and
replaced in late 2006. The Ministry of Finance transferred project management responsibility to

                                                       7
the Economic Affairs department (EAD). Staffing for the PIU was completed by late 2007, after
two staff were seconded to the PIU by the Central Bank and State Law Office.

28.    Following implementation of the Mid-Term Review (MTR) recommendations, a
February 2010 informal restructuring extended the project’s closing date by 18 months to
September 30 2011 in order to provide sufficient time to implement the revised work plan given
the slow implementation. At the time the team proposed a revised work plan that would require
three years to complete. However, given the history of low disbursement of the project, a two-
stage approach was recommended to the team in which a second extension would be sought in
September 2011, pending successful implementation.

29.     As envisioned in the earlier restructuring, the project’s closing date was again extended
for another 18 months from September 30, 2011 to March 31, 2013 in order to ensure completion
of project activities, and to revise the Results Framework to improve attribution and
measurability. This enabled the completion of the three year plan proposed in 2011, but at the
cost of delays in some of the procurement processes that were carried over the initial extension
period, losses in PIU staff that left due to employment uncertainty, and other related delays.

30.     A final restructuring was approved in February 2013 in order to facilitate completion of
project activities and substantial achievement of development objectives by removing constraints
related to the project’s co-financing formula reflected in the legal agreement.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

31.    The election of a new reform minded Government in December 2007, committed to
improved governance, and to pursuing financial sector and judicial/legal reform, provided an
opportunity and strong rationale for the Bank to re-engage. From this context emerged a complex
technical assistance project based on a sound background analysis, but initially lacking an
implementation arrangement equal to the project’s scope and complexity. This section
summarizes the key factors during the preparation stage that affected implementation and
outcomes.

32.     Soundness of the background analysis. Though the Bank had been inactive in the
financial sector for several years, its participation in the 2003 Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) provided it with ample background analysis and recommendations of the policy
and technical issues facing the financial sector. FSAP provided a broad overview of potential
financial sector vulnerabilities and developmental needs, which were summarized in Section 1.
Furthermore, the Bank also conducted an assessment of relevant standards and codes (ROSCs),
including the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, the IOSCO Assessment
for Securities Regulation and the assessment of the framework for Anti-Money Laundering and
Combating the Financing of Terrorism, and the Insolvency and Creditors Rights ROSC.
Following the FSAP a series of follow-up analytical work had been initiated to move the reform
process closer to implementation, including a strategy paper for the reform of the banking sector,
analytical work on access to finance, and seminars on pension reform.

33.  Assessment of the project design. Based on the findings of the 2003 FSAP, the
FLSTAP design was highly relevant. The FSAP had identified potential vulnerabilities and

                                                8
developmental needs for the sector as well as the risks to macroeconomic stability from
weaknesses and shortcomings in the financial sector. Further, the FSAP highlighted the
constraints posed by these weaknesses to realizing the sector’s potential to deliver sufficient
credit to businesses, including SMEs. Based on this strong analytical foundation, the design of
FLSTAP appropriately intended to address these critical challenges. The Bank initially proposed
to support i) a Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC), covering key policy and institutional
reforms, including reducing the Government’s role in the financial sector; and ii) a Financial and
Legal Sector Technical Assistance Credit (FLSTAP), providing support for the implementation
of required reforms as well as other medium term upgrades in financial infrastructure. While this
mix of instruments was appropriate, the budget support operation never materialized because of
disagreement on the privatization of state-owned institutions. Without the anticipated policy
support, FLSTAP, Component 2 (Restructuring and Privatization of Financial Institutions)
became less viable in the early years of the project in terms of the end result (privatization), but
later materialized in terms of material changes in the policy agenda with legislation passed for
privatization and preparation for the privatization of three banks completed. Other components
were largely unaffected.

34.     Though the FSAP provided a clear diagnosis, it was not followed by a detailed, well-
sequenced, action plan with strong Government ownership. Indeed some of this planning was
envisioned to be supported by the project, including the development of the financial sector and
judicial strategies, which were completed under the project.

35.     At inception, the FLSTAP was an overly complex project with too many components (7)
and too many implementing agencies (22). Given the depth of the financial and judiciary/legal
reform agenda, the Bank could have taken a more cautious approach in designing a simpler
project with the possibility for an add-on. However, project complexity was overcome through
close supervision, and hands on support to the PIU to undertake stronger planning and
monitoring, particularly from the MTR to closure.

36.     Much of the complexity and scope of the project owed to management pressure at the
time of approval to avoid fragmented, smaller, and multiple technical assistance (TA) loans. At
the time of preparation, the Bank was considering a freestanding legal and judicial reform project,
but management decided to prepare only one operation for the financial sector combining
elements for legal and judicial reform related to the functioning of the financial sector. The
combination had a detrimental impact on the judicial side, particularly in the early years, as legal
resources in the PIU were insufficient while the project’s focus on the judicial/legal side did not
coincide with Ministry of Justice’s priorities at the time. These problems were resolved with the
appointment of a new PIU Project Manager, who having previously worked at the State Law
Office was able to define an agenda for the legal and judicial reform aspects of the project and
foster stronger Government ownership.

37.     While the FLSTAP financing mix, consisting of IDA, DFID (grant) co-financing (US$10
million), and Government counterpart funding (US$2 million), provided an attractive mix of
resources, the co-financing arrangement - instead of parallel financing – and the formula chosen
for disbursements was cumbersome and would pose substantial implementation challenges (see
next section). Each agency had different disbursement rules, different documentation, reporting
and fiscal years. Funds flow was complex characterized by slow replenishments, including
delays after the December 2007 election violence crisis that led to stalled disbursements for
DFID for about 6 months.

                                                 9
38.     Lessons learned, including the importance of a flexible design, were incorporated in
design. Indeed, the project’s flexibility was critical to adapt to changing environment.

39.      Implementation Arrangements: The complexity of FLSTAP posed implementation
challenges, including the fact that MoF had never implemented a Bank project. Due to prevailing
concerns over corruption, the PIU was initially staffed with external consultants as a means to
mitigate risk, while an annual audit was subcontracted to a private firm of auditors. A Steering
Committee Structure was established, chaired by a high level official of the Ministry of Finance
and comprising of senior representatives of the CBK, Ministry of Justice and Constitutional
Affairs, and the Association and DFID, as observers. This structure would turn out to face delays,
particularly in the early years6, due to the seniority of participants, resulting in ad-hoc delegation,
lack of continuity, and need for more consensus on decision-making across themes. Furthermore,
initially it was difficult to engage with the Ministry of Justice, as it was too busy with a broader
agenda and not focused on articulating needs to be financed under FLSTAP.

40.     Adequacy of government’s commitment. FLSTAP emerged from the findings of the
2003 FSAP, and the GoK requested FLSTAP to support its reform agenda. However, the initial
strong Government commitment did not carry through initial stages of project implementation,
as policy differences emerged that directly impacted the course of the project on the main initial
focal area, which was privatization of state-owned banks. Further, the MoF did not initially take
leadership of the PIU, nor assume with vigour its important coordinating role.

41.     Assessment of risks. The PAD identified risks as Substantial. Risks included failure to
maintain a stable macroeconomic environment, and others related to lack of Government
commitment and capacity to define and implement necessary policy reforms. Absent was the risk
of political instability, which materialized after the December 2007 elections and resulted in
further project delays. The PAD also identified project related risks including: limited technical
and absorptive capacity of the various implementing agencies and lack of collaboration and
coordination among government agencies, but the mitigating measures were insufficient or did
not materialize as envisioned early on. In particular, the lack of capacity at some “young”
implementing agencies was not adequately addressed, at least initially, in terms of providing
extra support on how to access FLSTAP funds and follow Bank procedures. The Bank should
have planned better for the complexity of the project to manage these risks better. In the end,
these risks were overcome, but at the high price of a three year project extension.

  The GoK made the following comment: “PSC was ineffective only during the early years. In the latter years,
delegation, which came with decision making authority did not hamper continuity of the project. Despite, at times,
the absence of key PSC members, meetings were held and decisions made without undue delay.”

2.2    Implementation

42.     FLSTAP experienced three distinct project implementation phases during the project’s
life. In the first phase, the project encountered several difficulties including a long delay in
setting up the PIU, and weak performance of the first PIU, which eventually led to its dismissal,
as well as election violence of December 2007 and ensuing delays. In the second phase, the
Ministry of Finance took over implementation directly and set up a strengthened PIU staffed
with Sr. personnel from the CBK, which laid the groundwork for future improved project
performance. In the third phase, from the MTR to project closure, project implementation
improved tremendously, through strong and effective project management, both from
Government/PIU and enhanced Bank supervision with the TTL in the field. This section
highlights the problems that emerged during these three phases and how they were resolved, as
well as other important issues that affected project implementation.

43.      Problems with the Project Implementation Unit. Project implementation was delayed
due to difficulties in establishing an effective PIU. The difficulties in setting up the PIU were due
to technical, procedural and managerial constraints. The initial PIU, comprised of external
consultants, failed to launch the project in any meaningful way, hampered by internal conflict,
but also by its inability to establish an effective relationship with the Implementing Agencies and
the Ministry of Finance, whose coordinating role was greatly needed given the breadth of the
project. A new PIU was not put in place until October 2007, partly due to the challenge of
contractual obligations with the first team of consultants, as well as finding the necessary breadth
of technical skills (financial to judiciary and legal) to manage this complex project. Then the
crisis of December 2007 took place, which led to further implementation delays. Treasury took
strong leadership of the process to restructure the project, starting with a decision to mainstream
implementation responsibilities within the Economic Affairs Department (EAD). This was
facilitated by the expansion of the Department to include two staff seconded from the Central
Bank and State Law Office reporting to the Economic Secretary, who among their duties,
assumed overall responsibility for the management of FLSTAP, reflecting increased Government
ownership of the project that was absent in the initial implementation phase.

44.     Though an effective PIU was eventually put in place, the project was hampered
throughout implementation by insufficient project staffing, particularly in fiduciary positions
and Monitoring & Evaluation. Bank management consistently raised staffing concerns to the
Authorities, and while they generally improved following the mid-term review, they were
nevertheless a constant challenge. Furthermore, low absorption rate of many of the implementing
agencies was a constant source of delay, as TORs took a long time to be completed due to lack of
capacity. Many of these institutions were quite young, such as SASRA, IRA, and RBA, and
consequently required enhanced support by the PIU/Bank. PIUs reported that delays were the
result of the Bank’s slow response on requests for no-objections, particularly in the early period
through the MTR. Notwithstanding the lack of resources, PIU performance, particularly in the
latter years and final year, where more than 50% of the credit was disbursed, was commendable.
The PIU managed dozens of procurement processes, more than half of which were complex
(ICT-related), while coordinating with 22 implementing agencies. The project completely
disbursed the DFID funds, and almost 92% of IDA funds.

45.    The project initially suffered from an insufficient strategic orientation of the PIU.
Project should have identified “champions” in each implementing agency in advance and
provided sufficient training/hand holding on WB project implementation and other related

                                                 11
aspects. This constraint was adequately addressed following the Mid-Term Review, described
below, as the PIU management took a more active role in working with agencies to identify
activities to support the reform process.

46.     A QAG review of Proactivity in Supervision of Problem Projects rated the overall
assessment of proactivity in supervision of this project as “Satisfactory.” The report agreed
with management identification of lack of capacity for procurement and project management as
the project’s major problem. Further, the assessment noted that management provided additional
resources in FY07 to intensify supervision efforts considering its problem status. Faced with
pressure to close the project due to weak implementation, the project undertook key actions to
maintain relevancy and improve implementation.

47.      The Mid-Term Review (MTR) was the critical turning point of the project. The
MTR was conducted during the period February 2-13, 2009, delayed by almost two years and
taking place 18 months following the restructuring of the PIU. At the time of the MTR, the
project remained highly relevant, had shown concrete results towards achieving the project’s
development objectives, but implementation continued to be weak. But most important, the MoF
had taken strong ownership over the project and was working well with a strengthened PIU. In
this context, the MTR recommended: (i) that a case be developed for the extension of the project;
(ii) that project activities be restructured with a greater focus on key strategic outcomes and an
overall simplification of the project, i.e. providing credible plans for the extension of projects;
and (iii) to establish more efficient processes through the strengthening of the PIU and the
drafting of a new procurement plan.

48.     Extension of the Closing Date – February 2010. Following the MTR, and based on
substantial progress in implementing MTR recommendations, management approved an 18
month extension of the closing date to September 30, 2011 in the context of a strategic plan of
three years, which was also presented. The action plan 7 noted that key implementation
challenges identified in the MTR (above) had since been addressed, and that the rationale for a
project extension was strong based on the continued relevance of the project to the Government
of Kenya and World Bank priorities, and the fact that project development objectives could be
achieved with the extension. The action plan noted that a three year extension would be required
for the project to complete the whole set of activities contained in the revised work plan - which
was designed based on re-focused priorities identified during the MTR. A two-stage approach
was recommended to the team, splitting the required extension into two blocks of one and a half
years each. Due to the age of the project, and other issues, the Bank sought a two-stage approach,
with the second extension contingent upon confirmation of significant implementation progress
and a clearer indication of increased likelihood of achieving the PDOs. This led to important
delays in procurement processes, but enabled the broader implementation to take place by
allowing the extensions to take place.

49.     Second extension of the closing date – September 2011. As envisioned in the previous
restructuring, a second 18 month extension was sought in order to complete project activities.
The restructuring included:



7
    This was not a “formal” restructuring.

                                                12
          Extension of the project closing date for an additional 18 months from September 30,
           2011 to March 31, 2013 to assure completion of a number of key activities;
          Revisions to the Project’s Results Framework involving minor modifications of a
           number of outcome and intermediate-level indicators and targets, with a view to
           improving their attribution and measurability;
          Re-allocation of funds between categories, particularly from unallocated, to assure
           availability of sufficient funding for planned expenditures and Revisions upwards of
           the percentage of Expenditures to be financed by IDA that had been defined
           somewhat arbitrarily at the beginning of the project (and led to substantial
           complications in implementation).

50.     Despite the challenges posed by splitting the project extension, the project exhibited
flexibility to accommodate emerging demands. In addition to the ICT infrastructure, the
project was flexible to add new government priorities: AML/CFT, PPPs, and macro-financial
analysis at central bank in the context of macroeconomic pressures that were affecting financial
sector developments.

51.     Lack of field presence and turnover of TTLs. During the ICR mission, these problems
were cited by Project management and implementing agencies as a key challenge. The project
had four (4) Bank task managers, three HQ based and one field based. The absence of key
Government policy decisions should have been a signal to the Bank to enhance supervision to
mitigate this risk. A fourth TTL, appointed in March 2009, was decentralized to the Nairobi
office since October 2008, enabling a more hands-on follow-up of day- to-day project activities
and constraints. This included not only technical aspects, but critically, pulling together the
country teams on procurement, financial management, and disbursement into a more hands-on
approach to support the last phase of the project. In addition, placing the TTL in the field helped
intensify the complex dialogue between the Bank and implementing agencies so the project
could provide them with support and speed up approvals.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

52.     As stated in the PAD, the overall development objective of the project was “to create a
sound financial system and strengthened legal framework and judicial capacity that will ensure
broad access to financial and related legal services”. However, as noted earlier, the PDO in the
DCA was stated differently: “The objective of the Project is to support the Borrower in carrying
out reforms to create a sound financial system and strengthened legal framework necessary to
implement the Borrower’s Program.” The PDO in the DCA was never formally adopted, nor
reflected in ISRs. However, efforts were made during the 2011 restructuring to formulate a more
appropriate PDO, but the team was unsuccessful, as the complexity of the project made it
difficult to distil the projects’ seven components into one PDO. According to IEG guidelines,
this evaluation will consider the PDO in the DCA.

53.     As was common at the time, the PDO, as reflected in the PAD, was high-level,
particularly related to the financial sector aspects, “to create a sound financial system”. The PDO
should not state any higher-level objective beyond what can be actually expected from the
project. However, the PDO in the DCA was more reasonable, since it emphasized supporting the
Borrower in carrying out reforms to achieve these higher goals. However, a better PDO could
have referred to enhancing the capacity of the financial, commercial and judicial institutions, and

                                                13
providing support to reform within the financial and legal sectors. This alternative would have
had a more direct causal link between FLSAP’s activities and the PDOs.

54.     A full M&E framework was not completed until two years into implementation. As
was common at the time of project preparation (2004), the PAD did not contain a comprehensive
results framework. It was not introduced until late 20078, supported by the Bank which provided
consultants to help design the M&E framework for results monitoring following baseline data
collection and identification of performance indicators. As a result, there was an increase in the
availability and quality of data on KPIs. However, gaps still remained on outcome indicators for
the legal sector component. PDO outcome indicators were changed several times during project
implementation, many in an ad-hoc fashion rather than through a formal restructuring process.
According to IEG guidelines, the evaluation will only consider official revisions to Outcome
Indicators.

55.     Following Bank assisted revision of the M&E framework, M&E performance
exhibited steady progress during the rest of project implementation. MTR recommended
that the M&E framework be integrated more closely with project implementation and thereby be
used as a tool of project management. This was generally carried out through updates of results
framework at the September 2011 restructuring and regular reporting to the project steering
committee.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

56.     Financial Management: There were challenges to put in place an effective financial
management system, robust enough to be able to meet high auditing standards. Only in the later
phase of the project were unqualified audit statements delivered, which was however the norm of
virtually the entire Kenya portfolio.

57.     Procurement: Managing and supervising dozens of procurement processes and even
larger number of live contracts, coordinating with 22 implementing agencies was a constant
challenge. Implementing agencies almost unanimously criticized the Bank for slow turnaround
of no-objections. The lack of experience (WB, Government, PIU and Implementing Agencies) in
the acquisition of complex ICT systems (software and hardware) posed a huge challenge in later
years, which was supported by the addition of an ICT expert to the WB team during the last three
years of implementation. It took a long time to develop TORs and technical specifications to
purchase complex ICT services and equipment. The lack of harmonization of GoK and WB
procurement requirements was another challenge. Strong support to this function in later years
with TTL in the field and timely mobilization of consultants helped overcome these challenges.

58.     Safeguards: The Project did not require any safeguard screening.




8
  But for purposes of this evaluation, the revised M&E framework was not formalized until the Sep. 28, 2011
restructuring.


                                                       14
2.5       Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

59.     Despite important donor support in key areas, with no phase-II FLSTAP currently
envisioned, the significant project achievements would be harder to leverage to further
advance the remaining agenda. Going forward, the Government has identified an ambitious
financial and related legal and judicial reform agenda for the next stage of development of these
key sectors, as articulated in the Draft Medium Term Plan 2013-2017 for the Financial Services
Sector. The vision for the sector is as follows: Create a vibrant and globally competitive
financial sector that will promote high level of savings to finance Kenya’s overall investment
needs. Indeed, the flagship project of the plan is to establish Nairobi as an International Financial
Centre and help Kenya gain a stronger presence in sub-Saharan Africa’s growing financial
services market.

60.     Supporting the Government’s ambitious agenda, including areas covered by FLSTAP, are
the following ongoing/potential donor supported activities:
         A World Bank Infrastructure Finance and PPP project covers a number of capital
          markets/infrastructure finance and PPP related agendas;
         Building on the Judiciary’s ICT and case management groundwork financed by the
          FLSTAP, the World Bank Judicial Performance Improvement (JPIP) project aims to
          improve the performance of the Judiciary to provide its services in the project areas in a
          more effective and accountable manner;
         Efficient Securities Markets Institutional Development (ESMID)/ Global Emerging
          Markets Local Currency Bond Program (GEMLOC) is providing ongoing support on
          capital markets, including on treasury mobile direct and other related areas;
         Ongoing support via Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSD) on key financial inclusion
          aspects.

61.     The Government has demonstrated commitment to ensuring completion and
sustainability of FLSTAP supported outputs, and to deepening the financial and judicial
sector reform agenda. Throughout the implementation period, GoK has provided financial
resources to cover planned FLSTAP activities that did not materialize due to Government
preference to use its own resources, failed or delayed procurements, and project closure. For
example, due to the delay in effectiveness of the FLSTAP, the Government funded the
establishment of the Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS), while the FLSTAP later
funded the back-up system in a remote location.

62.     However, and despite important efforts underway, this ambitious agenda lacks
adequate support to carry it forward. Interviews during the ICR mission with agencies
supported by FLSTAP and policy makers revealed a substantial unfinished agenda. While some
will continue to receive support, including through new Bank operations, and others which will
benefit from other donor projects, many agencies expressed concern about funding the remaining
agenda of institutional development and capacity building, as well as preserving the gains
already achieved. As the FLSTAP provided flexible and often timely responsive support to 22
agencies, its absence is likely to be felt. Among the critical needs identified during ICR mission
are as follows:
         Banking supervision capacity has been significantly strengthened, but challenges remain
          including the need to implement consolidated supervision, as cross-border banking
          becomes more important;
                                                 15
      While the increasing formalization of deposit-taking microfinance institutions (DTMs)
       and SACCOs is contributing to a stronger financial sector, much work remains to be done
       on building supervisory capacity for MFIs and SACCOs so that these financial
       institutions can play the expected role in increasing access to finance for households and
       businesses.
      Kenya’s capital markets have deepened substantially during the course of FLSTAP
       implementation, but much work remains to be done in order for the country to realize its
       ambitious goal to become a well-developed regional financial center for EAC.
      Despite significant advances in AML, the country remains on the Financial Action Task
       Force (FATF) grey list and will require further support to enhance its AML/FT
       compliance framework.
      While the insurance sector has seen strong growth, accompanied by a strengthened
       regulatory framework, the market remains thin and faces important challenges.
      The regulatory agency for the pension sector, RBA, needs to continue evolving, since
       they are still too much into a compliance rather than RBS mode.
      KDIC could benefit from further assistance to assess compliance with FSB’s “Key
       Attributes of effective Resolution Regimes” and further training of its staff, as well as a
       participation in a crisis simulation exercise to enhance coordination among the different
       agencies, particularly with CBK BSD.
      Kenya Law Reform Commission (KLRC) has played a critical role in drafting legislation
       particularly enhanced following the adoption of Kenya’s new Constitution; the
       Constitution needs to be fully implemented.

63.     The Bank’s dialogue going forward will be based on a financial sector strategy note,
currently under preparation, which will provide a medium-term framework for the on-going and
proposed policy dialogue and support for the Government of Kenya’s (GoK) financial sector
development agenda, by setting priorities and sequencing interventions. Despite some
uncertainty on the remaining agenda, the next section illustrates the significant institution
building that has taken place in Kenya’s financial, legal and judicial sectors, and assesses the
FLSTAPs contributions to it.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

64.     The assessment of outcomes will be performed on the basis of a split evaluation, since
key project outcome indicators were formally changed during the September 2011 Level 2
restructuring. The project outcomes will be assessed from project approval through September
2011, and then through project closure, weighted by disbursements. The first part of the split
evaluation spans the first two phases of project implementation and part of the final phase.

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Substantial

65.    The objectives and implementation of the FLSTAP were highly relevant at appraisal and
throughout implementation, and consistent with the Government’s development priorities and
the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy. However, shortcomings in the project’s design
contributed to difficult implementation.

Relevance of Original Objectives: High
Relevance of Revised Objectives: High

66.     Objectives: The project was one of the main and only comprehensive facilities for
addressing Kenya’s on-going financial and legal sector reforms, and continues to show
relevance in addressing emerging reform issues. The FLSTAP continues to be relevant to the
country’s long-term development plan, “Kenya Vision 2030”, which identified the financial
sector as a priority sector, and the latest Medium Term Plan (MTP) (20013- 2017), which
focuses on several areas covered by the FLSTAP including banking, payment systems, SACCOs,
insurance, and retirement benefits. The FLSTAP is aligned to the MTP objective of achieving:
“A vibrant and globally competitive financial sector driving high levels of savings and Kenya’s
investment needs”. The MTP, in turn, was informed by the FLSTAP supported Comprehensive
Financial Sector Reform & Development Strategy (CFSRD). On the legal and judiciary side, the
project remains relevant, and in fact was instrumental to the development of the Government’s
Judiciary Transformation Framework (2012-2016), an overarching blueprint for reforming and
repositioning of the Judiciary. This was based on the FLSTAP supported Judiciary Strategic Plan
2009 – 2013. Its relevance is further highlighted by the follow on project, JPIP. The FLSTAP
also continues to be relevant to the Bank’s program, as articulated in the Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS, FY10-13), where it is aligned with the CPS’ Pillar 1: Kenya’s Growth Potential.

Relevance of Original Design: Modest
Relevance of Revised Design: High

67.     Design: While the project design was well-aligned to project’s objectives to address
critical challenges in the finance and judicial/legal areas, there were shortcomings due to
complexity, implementing arrangements and weaker ownership in early stages. The
FLSTAP design reflected a comprehensive diagnosis of development priorities related to the
financial and judicial legal sectors. As noted, the initial project components were based on the
findings of the 2003 FSAP and Governance Justice, and Law and Order Sector Reform program.
As such, the FLSTAP design was highly relevant to important country priorities at the time of
appraisal. The combination of Bank SIL, grant funding by DFID, and Government counterpart
funding provided an attractive financing package for Government.

68.    However, shortcomings in the design would hamper early implementation. The project
was too ambitious, with too many components, and not realistic given implementation capacity
of the Ministry of Finance, which had never implemented a Bank project, and the multiple
implementing agencies, many of which had low absorptive capacity. These problems were
compounded by the staffing of the PIU with external consultants, who were mistrusted by
Government Authorities, and had performance issues, relatively low project readiness at
approval (a procurement plan covered 18-month, as required, but many implementing agencies
had challenges in preparing TORs and technical specifications for a number of activities). The

                                              17
complexity of the project was exacerbated by the Bank’s management decision, at the last
minute, to combine financial and judicial/legal elements in the same operation, which added 2.5
components and 9 additional implementing agencies.

69.    The relevance of project design was further validated by the FSAP update in 2009.
Among the FSAP’s key recommendations, most were receiving support by the FLSTAP, while
others would receive support later in project implementation, as discussed in the next section.

Relevance of Implementation against original PDO indicators: Substantial
Relevance of Implementation against revised PDO indicators: High

70.      Implementation: Following its rocky start that FLSTAP was able to achieve positive
results documented in Section 3.2 is a testament to the Bank/Government’s ability to resolve key
project constraints in order to get the project back on track. These adjustments included changing
implementation arrangements and importantly the secondment of two CBD and SLO staff (with
suitable replacements when each had to return to other duties) to bolster technical and
managerial skills in the PIU, locating the TTL in the field for closer supervision support, a
critical mid-term review and action plan followed by a September 2011 Level 2 restructuring and
strengthened planning and monitoring capacity for the PIU with hands on support. A common
theme through interviews was the huge importance of appointing project managers and locating
TTL in the field. These key actions laid the foundation for a turnaround of the project which had
begun before the MTR and accelerated notably after the September 2011 restructuring.

71.     The project exhibited a flexible approach to emerging needs. Following the 2003
FSAP Update, the MOF indicated that the FLSTAP would be the main channel through which to
support these reform actions, together with the Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSD) which
was created with DFID and IDA support (from another project) to focus more on direct market
interventions on financial inclusion. Indeed the FLSTAP responded to key 2009 FSAP update
recommendations by providing technical assistance in critical areas such as (i) crucial
governance issues in Kenya’s capital markets that have hampered its further development (e.g.
NSE demutualization), (ii) the strengthening of key regulators in the pension and insurance
sectors, thereby addressing major risks to the stability of Kenya’s financial system, such as high
contingent liabilities in the pensions sector and suspected major weaknesses in the insurance
sector, and (iii) the strengthening of safety nets, which were very much needed in the wake of the
financial crisis. Notably, the Bank was able to mobilize a wide range of expertise to support the
Government, with some missions including up to a dozen experts and a cadre of at least 22
technical experts available on a regular basis to cover different technical areas, as needed, and
some 15 operational experts providing hands on support. On the judicial and legal side, the
passing of a new Constitution in 2010 created a need to adapt both the legal framework and law-
related institutional settings, which was filled by FLSTAP support and helped set the basis for
the new reform agenda being implemented (and new project approved).

72.     The project development objective, as stated in the DCA, was to support the
Borrower in carrying out reforms to create a sound financial system and strengthened the
legal framework necessary to implement the Borrower’s Program. This objective would be
achieved through provision of technical expertise and building capacity to implement the
Government’s financial sector reform program and to supporting implementation of the relevant
key results areas of the GJLOS Reform Strategy.

73.     As demonstrated in the Results Framework, almost all of the PDO (and
intermediate) indicators have been achieved and in some cases even exceeded. According to
the Results Framework, half of the population has access to formal financial services, with 40
percent of the rural population having access to formal financial services. In addition, more than
17 million accounts have been registered up from 2.2 million in 2005. This seven-fold increase
in access (including accounts opened with DTMs) over seven years represents a transformational
increase in access to basic bank accounts which has been realized mainly by enhanced access by
the low income segment (previously unbanked and under-banked population). Private credit as a
percentage of GDP has grown to 38 percent of GDP and NPLs as a percentage of total loans
have fallen to 3.6 percent. The only indicator that remains to be achieved is the interest spread
which currently stands at 11.6 percent, requiring further compression in the future, partly
affected by macroeconomic pressures that took place since 2010 reverting the declining trend
that had been evidenced until then. Institutional and operational reform has been remarkable,
with all financial sector supervisors now independent, including a new supervisor for SACCOs,
as well as new enterprise development systems at each of them and commitment to RBS being
implemented by all at good pace with CBK at advanced stages. On the legal/judiary side,
achievements have been equally impressive, including substantially increasing the rate clearance
in the Millimani Commercial Courts and the extensive list of Regulations developed, amended or
supported by the project. Because of the achievements to date, progress towards achievement of
the PDO and overall implementation progress were rated at satisfactory in the last ISR.

74.      The FLSTAP has been instrumental in helping lay the foundations for the safe take-
off of the Kenyan financial sector. Indeed, according to the latest IMF report9 “the vibrant and
rapidly expanding financial sector constitutes a major asset to support economic growth and
reduce the vulnerabilities of low-income portions of the population”. FLSTAP was an important
vehicle that created reform momentum, by tackling multiple big issues in the Kenyan financial
system, a notable accomplishment for a TAL and one that is normally associated with a DPO. It
has had a catalytic impact, contributing to the acceleration in the reform agenda since 2010,
following the approval of the new Constitution and the development and approval of the CFSDS.
Legal reforms related to the financial sector were a major accomplishment of the Project (23
major Acts drafted or amended, see Annex 2). Components 6 & 7 (legal and judicial) lagged
until late in project implementation, but managed to achieve important milestones and the follow
on the JPIP will help ensure that investments and reform momentum are sustained.

75.     Despite typical problems of attribution, the project achieved its PDO to support the
Borrower in carrying out reforms to create a sound financial system and strengthened legal
framework necessary to implement the Borrower’s Program. In some cases, (interest
spreads) outcome indicators were dependent on macro factors and other sector developments (i.e.
competition), while the dramatic increase in access came about largely due to developments
supported by FLSTAP, but also important aspects not fully supported by the project, particularly
the development of M-pesa. However, while FLSTAP support was not the only factor that led to
reduced NPLs, it clearly contributed to the key elements that make up a sound financial system
and strengthened legal framework, as described below.

Improved access to financial services
          At project inception, the 2003 FSAP had identified the weak supervision and the legal
           framework, lack of information on borrowers, and an inefficient judiciary as major
           obstacles to access to finance by small- and medium size enterprises. From this base,
           access to financial services exploded during project implementation, from 2.6 million
           accounts in 2005 to 17.6 million in 2012. Though this dramatic increase in access to
           financial services was largely driven by small depositors in Equity Bank, this growth
           coincided with significant project support for the financial sector and overall institutional
           strengthening and enhanced enabling environment, in addition to more specific measures
           including (to mention a few) better Microfinance laws and regulations, new Sacco law
           and regulations, improved regulation among all regulators, better legislation passed under
           various laws, increased independence of the regulators, introduction of agent banking,
           introduction and licensing of eight (8) Deposit taking MFIs (DTMs), licensing of two
           Credit Reference Bureaus; strengthened debt management and functioning of debt
           markets and payments systems, continued robust deposit protection and strengthening the
           capacity and framework of DPFB.
          The project’s contributions to the modernization of commercial and financial legislation
           (the company and Partnership acts, and Insolvency Bill), have also contributed to
           improvement in the credit and legal environment.

Improved efficiency of financial services
          High interest rate spreads are a reflection of the structural problems in the financial
           sector10 as well as risks, costs, and macroeconomic factors. As such, the FLSTAP could
           reasonably only have an indirect impact on this outcome, which had materialized in the
           earlier part of the project implementation through reforms at state-owned banks. The
           gains were reversed when faced with macroeconomic pressures and changes in
           international markets, which were beyond the reach of the project. However the project
           had an important impact in improving the efficiency of financial services, beginning with
           its early work on preparing the privatization of state owned banks (see below), through
           payment systems and debt markets improvements, workflow and document imaging
           solutions at some regulatory agencies (reducing for instance, licensing time for CMA)11,

  As of 2011, there were 90 market intermediaries under the purview of CMA, growing more than 100 percent
during the previous 4 years.

       legal and judicial reforms setting the basis for faster case management, faster access to
       crucial legal information and broader increased operational efficiency.

Improved stability of the financial system
      According to the FSAP 2009 Update, Kenya had “made substantial progress in
       addressing the deficiencies highlighted in the 2003 FSAP”. Significant improvements
       have been seen in the stability of the banking system that have reduced NPLs over the
       project period to 3.6% (December 2012) from 25.5% (December 2005).
      A draft BCP assessment for Kenya under the new methodology (2013), which reflects the
       banking supervision practices of the Kenyan authorities, has concluded that Kenya has
       made substantial progress on most fronts since 2009 (and 2003). The key areas of
       progress include Consolidated Supervision (BCP12), Home-Host Relationships (BCP13),
       Corporate Governance (BCP14), Country and Transfer Risk (BCP21) and Market risk
       (BCP22), which had been highlighted by the 2009 FSAP update as non-compliant.
      Support to strengthen legal and regulatory frameworks in financial and related legal
       sector for its implementation;
      Strengthen capacity of the regulators (EAD, CBK, CMA, IRA, RBA, SASRA) and
       introduction of risk-based supervision coupled with strong project support.
      The introduction of a separate law and regulation for SACCOs has led to higher standards
       in the sector through clear guidelines regarding capital, liquidity, and provisioning,
       among others. This has been an important development for the stability of the Kenyan
       financial system, as some of the largest 20 SACCOs have reached the size of small banks
       and manage millions of uninsured deposit accounts of institutions without a lender of last
       resort in case of liquidity needs.
      An important achievement was the establishment of new independent regulators which
       were before under a ministry (IRA and SASRA). Sacco Societies Regulatory Authority
       (SASRA), established in 2008, oversees a sector with membership that has increased
       from 1.0 million to 2.1 million, with an average NPL ratio of 5.9 percent as of September
       2012 (down from 9.7 percent in 2011). Most likely SASRA could not have had a
       successful launch and the impressive progress achieved in the past three years without
       FLSTAP support. Support at the beginning of the FLSTAP to prepare the State-
       influenced banks for privatization and change the reform agenda in Kenya (including
       passing of Privatization Act with specific listing of the projects) and reports that set the
       basis for restructuring of these banks (and the consequential substantial steep reduction in
       NPLs) has been critical to the stability of the financial sector and it is a significant
       achievement.
      The introduction of Credit Reference Bureaus (Jun 2010) and CRB regulations drafted
       with project support (Feb 2009) contributed to the steady reduction of credit risks and
       NPLs, as well as improving access to credit.
      Financing of the remote back-up facility (hardware and software procurement) for the
       Real-Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) and drafting and passage of a payment
       systems law played a very important enabling role for the payments revolution
       experienced by Kenya.



                                               21
      Support to develop an AML/CFT compliance framework and the drafting of a new AML
       Act, as well as to develop an AML/CFT supervisory framework, development of
       regulations and staff training at the newly created specialized finance intelligence unit
       (Financial Reporting Center, FRC). With support from the Bank’s AML team, since
       October 2012 all institutions under CBK supervision are sending Suspicious Transactions
       Reports (STRs) on a regular basis to the FRC, which received important, targeted, TA
       under the FLSTAP (see Annex 2). In 2012-2013 Kenya took actions, with strong support
       from the project, to avoid being downgraded internationally in terms of AML/CFT,
       which would have led to substantial increase in costs of intermediation and reduce depth
       with some international banks facing constraints to operate in Kenya.

Commercial Justice is more efficient and effective
      The improvement of the judicial system in Kenya was one of the cornerstones of the
       project. FLSTAP funds were used to improve the court’s case management system and
       alleviate the backlog of cases that burdened the entire legal system; capacity building,
       dissemination and legal reform were all strongly supported by the project; legal resources
       were systematized and made publicly accessible; and specialization in commercial and
       financial law was fostered at undergraduate and postgraduate university levels as well as
       with the judiciary and Government staff.
      The most successful –and directly effective- part of this component of the project
       stemmed from the activity developed by the consultant specialist in legal drafting at the
       State Law Office. The consultant trained the staff and, more importantly, revised entirely
       the Company and Insolvency Bills. The final Bills were largely in accord with best
       international standards. They are bound to take Kenya’s commercial legal framework to
       the next level.
      The creation of the Judicial Training Institute (JTI), supported by FLSTAP, has been a
       remarkable achievement.
      The approval of new procedural rules and the training of the judiciary and court staff on
       the new legislation was also a very important part of the project’s input. The
       modernization of court rules is bound to have a big positive influence in the working of
       courts and in the enhancement of legal certainty.
      FLSTAP funded the technical retreats that finalized the draft Partnership Bill and related
       regulations, as well as other meetings with identified stakeholders to build consensus on
       the legal solutions proposed. The Bills were sent to Parliament in 2010, ans subsequently
       approved and enacted.
      The publication of all the laws of Kenya currently in force and its easy and inexpensive
       access by all stakeholders constitutes a great achievement. It is bound to increase
       transparency and legal certainty, improve the country’s body of jurisprudence and
       contribute to the general development of the system of justice in a country where lawyers
       and courts are poorly regarded by the population.
      Design and purchase of audio-visual system and visual recording of court proceedings
       and production of associated transcripts and digital records, set up in several (commercial
       and financial) courts. These are expected to set the basis for the completion of the long
       overdue automation of courts and improving case and records management, which will
       eventually reduce time of proceedings and costs of legal services, as well as the

                                               22
       transparency of the processes. These reforms will continue to be supported with the JPIP
       project.
      FLSTAP contributed significantly to the steady increase in the case clearance rate
       especially through the revision of Civil Procedures Act in 2010 and its implementation.
       The FLSTAP also had some individual and institutional capacity impacts which have
       directly or indirectly contributed to increased case clearance rate and reduced case
       backlog.
      The longer-term impact of the project lies also in the curriculum reforms and better
       training of lawyers and judges.

3.3    Efficiency
Rating of Efficiency - Original: Modest
Rating of Efficiency - Revised: Substantial

76.   As an economic analysis for FLSTAP was not included in PAD, we employ alternative
methods to evaluate efficiency of the project.

77.    Total funds disbursed was US$29.1 million, versus an estimate cost of US$30 million at
appraisal (project achieved objectives at lower cost), which represents a cost savings considering
that project objectives were achieved at a lower cost than envisioned (91.7% for IDA
(US$ equivalent 16.875 million, DFID 100% US$10 million), but somewhat larger participation
of the government (GOK 113.5% US$ equivalent 2.27 million) due to the early rules for
government contribution that were latter addressed in project restructuring that changed
financing parameters for each party and counterpart funding rules.

78.     Project implementation lasted nine years instead of five as initially foreseen. This delay
had a significant opportunity cost for Kenya and increased the Bank's operational costs. Total
Bank administrative costs for project supervision were high, averaging over US$190,000
throughout project implementation, compared to the Africa regional average of US$112,000.
While high, these high costs reflect the magnitude of the project, as demonstrated by the plethora
of technical and operational experts mobilized (40 in the last 4.5 years), as well as extensions of
the closing date.

79.    While Bank administration costs were higher than planned, PIU costs were US$2.2
million less than the US$4 million envisaged in the PAD, notwithstanding that project
implementation period was extended three years. This is due to the staffing of the PIU with
Kenyans following dismissal of the first PIU that entailed very large costs.

80.     The project effectively leveraged Bank and development partner resources, mainly a
US$10 million grant from DFID, but also parallel support by the FSD, its partner for financial
inclusion aspects. DFID also funded extra supervision budget in the latter years, particularly
focused on hands-on advice for the PIU and implementing agencies on operational aspects and
ICT thematic support, which allowed the project team to mobilize a broad team of experts, which
would not have been possible under the constraints of bank budgets.

81.    Despite the costs associated with the three year project extension, the project yielded
important benefits beyond what is normally associated with a TAL. After the accompanying
DPO operation failed to gain traction, the project became an important vehicle for policy

                                                23
dialogue, and in this manner contributed to important policy reforms. The huge advance in policy
reform during the project’s life is impressive, and was due in no small part to active engagement
of the reformulated PIU and field-based TTL with policy-makers. These costs were borne by the
project, not funded by DPO, and should be considered as added benefits.

82.    Further, the project’s contributions in the area of PPPs and judicial reform opened the
door for new operations, and in effect, partially funded project preparation for both. The benefits
of which will be borne by the country and captured in the efficiency analysis of the new projects.

83.    Finally, the project’s flexibility in responding to changing client priorities and conditions
ensured effective use of resources. For example, FLSTAP was able to re-align activities to
respond to the 2009 FSAP update recommendations, and support implementation of the new
Constitution of 2010.

84.    The rating for efficiency in the period before the 2011 restructuring is Modest, based on
the unsatisfactory early years followed by a substantial improvement. The rating for the final
period of project implementation is Substantial, with a generally satisfactory performance.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85.     According to the IMF, Kenya has achieved “a vibrant and rapidly expanding financial
sector”, and the FLSTAP did provide substantial support to GOK to achieve this, including the
strengthened legal and supervisory framework. As such, the project has substantially achieved its
PDO to support the Government in carrying out reforms to create a sound financial system and
strengthened the legal framework necessary The support was highly relevant at inception, based
on the 2003 FSAP findings, and remained so throughout project implementation, as evidenced
by the 2009 FSAP update, and was also aligned with three Bank CAS’. The FLSTAP provided
critical inputs to the development of both the financial sector and judicial strategies, early
support to the restructuring of banks and to their privatization process, supported development of
legal and regulatory framework with 23 bills enacted, provided capacity building to multiple
agencies in critical areas of need including staff training, equipment and RBS, which is under
full implementation at all financial sector regulators. In later years, the FLSTAP provided critical
ICT equipment to several agencies, (which typically take 1-3 years to procure), staff training,
study tours and consulting services.

86.     The project got off to a rocky start, owing to an overly complex design, and uncertain
policy framework on some aspects, further handicapped in one to two crucial areas by the
shelving of the DPL. Given this inauspicious beginning, difficulties in implementation were to
be expected. But as the primary vehicle to implement financial sector and judicial reform, the
Government and Bank made the necessary changes to ensure successful implementation. In the
absence of policy based lending to accompany the FLSTAP, the project also provided an
important platform to engage Government in policy areas, an area of support not necessarily
envisioned for the FLSTAP, but nonetheless critical. Among them, one critical area supported
indirectly by the project was related to possible restrictions on interest rates and spreads.
Analytical support via FLSTAP supervision, activities supported for the CBK and policy
dialogue helped avoid the introduction of these restrictions and provided options for alternative


                                                24
measures to achieve the goal of broader and more affordable market-based access to finance
(some of which had been supported by the project).

87.     The overall rating for the project is Moderately Satisfactory. This reflects the
achievement of PDO with moderate shortcomings, mostly related to design and efficiency. While
the targets for most outcome indicators, and intermediate outcome indicators, were met, the
causal link between these indicators and the FLSTAP activities was weak, necessitating
alternative methods to demonstrate the FLSTAP contribution to these higher objectives.
Breaking down the elements of a sound financial system and strengthened legal framework, as
was done in Section 3.2, into the outcomes that contribute to these goals, the causal link between
the FLSTAP activities and achievement of these outcomes is clearly evident.

88.    The change in outcome indicators at the 2011 Level 2 restructuring necessitates a split
evaluation, which entails evaluating project outcomes up to restructuring and at closure,
weighted by disbursements. Project performance from approval to restructuring was mixed, with
modest ratings on design, outcomes and efficiency. This performance is consistent with an MU
rating for the period up to 2011 restructuring. The period after exhibited Satisfactory
performance, with only minor shortcomings. The table below provides the weighted rating.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development n/a
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

89.      Among FLSTAPs biggest achievements was its contribution to institutional strengthening,
particularly smaller/supervisory/specialized agencies that have seen their autonomy and
institutional and technical capacity raised dramatically by the FLSTAP. Twenty two agencies
received support from FLSTAP, among which the following highlights can be noted:
            CBKs Banking Supervision Department benefited from significant FLSTAP support
             in capacity building through staff training in areas such as risk management,
             supervision, prompt corrective actions, micro-finance and crisis resolution
            At the Capital Markets Authority, enhanced supervisory capacity was seen thanks to
             FLSTAP which financed a resident advisor’, training and equipment.



                                               25
            IRA (insurance) and RBA (pension) Funding was used to migrate from a compliance-
             based supervisory framework to one risk-based, as well as to acquire ICT software
             and equipment
            FLSTAP supported the establishment of an independent Kenya Deposit Insurance
             Corporation (KDIC), assisting with the drafting of a new law (Kenya Deposit
             Insurance Act) and financing workshops to sensitize members of parliament prior to
             the discussion of the draft law12, as well as training from external advisors, including
             bank resolution.
            SASRA, new regulatory agency established in 2008, FLSTAP financed critical
             activities equipment (hardware and software), institutional strengthening and
             significant training and study tours abroad to its staff.
            FLSTAP supported the creation of the Judicial Training Institute for continuing legal
             education, and training of legal drafters, which will have a long term impact.

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

90.     The FLSTAP laid the groundwork for a sound financial system and judicial sector, the
impact of which is likely to be sustained. The FLSTAP support to strengthen legal and regulatory
frameworks in financial and related legal sector is likely to yield long-term benefits in addition to
those already materialized, as is the substantial strengthening of the various agencies’ regulatory
and supervisory capacity.

91.     Though challenges remain for the broader agenda, Government has consistently
prioritized the objectives underpinning the project. This is likely to be maintained through
political cycles. It was instrumental in helping the Government formulate strategies for these
sectors, which are currently under implementation. The Bank remains engaged in key areas
through new projects (IFPPP and JPIP), and is actively designing a strategy for future
engagement in the sectors in addition to targeted TA. A future FSAP Update in 2014/15 would
be important to confirm progress and identify emerging vulnerabilities.

  The KDIC has been established outside of the CBK, but only until the promulgation of the law it will become
independent.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

92.     Bank performance was initially weak due to the quality at entry problems, but exhibited
marked improvement after 2007, and indeed was strong in the final years of the project. The
overall rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

93.     The design of the FLSTAP, based on the findings of the 2003 FSAP, reflected was highly
relevant. However, project design was too complex and ambitious, particularly given the low
implementation capacity of the MoF, which had never implemented a Bank project and the other
21 implementing agencies. The decision to include judicial and legal reform only added to the
complexity. Selection of an externally-staffed PIU did not foster an effective working
relationship with GoK. Finally, project readiness in terms of preparation of an 18 month
procurement plan and staffing of PIU was weak early on. While the 18-month procurement plan
was in line with standards implemented in the region, the complexity of the project may have
granted extra efforts early on to do a more detailed plan, which was done at a later stage

94.    There was no QAG review of Quality at Entry.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

95.     Despite design shortcomings, Bank supervision was noteworthy for identification of
problems and introduction of corrective measures to ensure improvement. Quicker resolution of
these problems was often complicated by factors outside the Bank’s control, including
contractual issues with the initial PIU, identifying adequate skill set within Government, and the
post-election crisis in early 2008. QAG undertook a Review of Proactivity in Supervision of
Problem Projects in FY2007 and found the quality of Bank supervision to be Satisfactory as
supervision was intensified, and extra resources were provided by Bank management, when the
project entered into problem status. Nonetheless, the ISR ratings for IP were probably too
sanguine in the early phases of project implementation, as the project was rated Unsatisfactory
only for about 12 months between mid-2006 and mid-2007.

96.     Important adjustments made during and following the MTR, and with the September
2011 Level 2 restructuring, positioned the project to complete planned activities and achieve
development goals. Critical to supporting implementation of these changes was the placing of the
TTL in the field in late 2008 and providing a broader set of skills available to support both
technical and operational hands on advice to the PIU and implementing agencies. Interviews
with beneficiary agencies during the ICR mission highlighted the importance of this, as several
agencies noted the substantial improvement in Bank supervision and timeliness of non-
objections following this change.



                                               27
97.     Enhanced supervision, particularly in the last year of the project and post-closure, was
instrumental in completing complex ICT-related procurement and ensuring achievement of
remaining project objectives, including an ICT expert to help the implementing agencies with
technical specifications and related aspects. The team also handled a claim raised to the
Inspection Panel on one activity, which was eventually not supported as this emerged late in the
process. The due process started, but there was no time to fully implement it and it was dropped.
The CBK took over the procurement process with its own budget, but did not use earlier steps
completed and restarted it to ensure claims were addressed, even if not fully confirmed at that
period (nor rejected).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

98.     In line with other aspects of this evaluation, it is appropriate to assess Bank supervision
according to the distinct phases of project preparation and implementation. Consistent with the
findings in Section 3, there was a marked improvement in Bank supervision following the initial
phase of weak implementation. In justification of the overall Moderately Satisfactory (MS)
rating for Bank performance, less weight is given to the Quality of Entry and Supervision in
early years, while greater weight is accorded to the period following the MTR and in particular,
the period from the restructuring to project closure, where Bank supervision was Satisfactory.
Based on this analysis, and overall rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2    Borrower Performance

99.     Like Bank performance, the Government’s performance was similarly weaker in initial
years, but stronger in later years as changes made in implementation arrangements, staffing of
PIU, and Ministerial oversight contributed substantially to the achievement of project objectives.

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

100. The initial phase of implementation was characterized by weak Government ownership
of the project, which manifested itself in terms of weak oversight of the initial PIU and
leadership of the reform process upon which the project depended. Government took important
actions of seconding technical personnel from the CBK and the SLO to the new PIU, which also
managed the project. Further, following the findings of the 2009 FSAP, the Government
demonstrated heightened interest in the FLSTAP as the principal vehicle to implement
Government policies in the financial sector. Government ownership also noticeably improved as
key policy decisions were made on the role of the State in the financial sector. Counterpart
funding, a practice which the Bank subsequently moved away from, was also satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

101. Similar to the Government and Bank performance, the Implementing Agency got off to a
poor start characterized by managerial problems and infighting within the first PIU (staffed with

                                                28
external consultants). This translated into a very difficult relationship with the GOK and poor
project performance. However, following this poor beginning the MoF took charge of the PIU,
placing it in EAD, and eventually staffing it with adequate managerial, technical, procurement,
and financial management skills. Notwithstanding this improvement, the project suffered from a
persistent lack of adequate human resources throughout project implementation, particularly as
related to the procurement and monitoring and evaluation function. This was partly due to high
turnover in key support functions, but also in general to the challenge of allocating skilled
personnel in a low, albeit relatively strong compared to South Sahara Africa, capacity
environment. Also, the capacity of the many implementing agencies on these aspects was low in
most cases. This hindered the capacity for them to develop TORs and technical specifications, as
well as support in contract management

102. Following steady progress in implementation after building a new PIU, PIU performance
was exemplary in the later stages of the project. Particularly commendable, and critical to the
achievement of development objectives, was the PIU’s preparation period during the last three
years of the project and the PIUs performance during the last 6 months of project implementation,
where the PIU effectively finalized procurement of about 50 percent of the activities, building on
procurement processes prepared one to three years earlier. Further, the PIU was very effective in
promoting reforms, many which had lingered for years such as those in Ministry of Lands and
Judiciary, which are now in place. Based on this performance, the PIU at the MOF, was selected
to implement as well the new IFPPP project for the ministry and recognized as one of the
strongest teams to ever have managed projects in Kenya.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

103. An overall Moderately Satisfactory rating for Borrower performance is based on the
unsatisfactory performance through initial project implementation period, followed by
satisfactory performance in later phases. Following the initial three year period of weak
performance, the newly installed PIU made significant and successful strides in bringing the
project back on track and steering it to a successful achievement of its development objectives.

6. Lessons Learned

104. Strong analytical foundations are necessary to build successful technical assistance
operations. FLSTAP garnered strong Government support, with the exception of the politically
sensitive issue of State owned banks early on (that was later addressed), largely due to the
strength of the analytical foundation which underpinned it, the 2003 FSAP and the relevance of
reforms. After a long absence of reform programs supported by donors in the financial sector, the
operation provided a comprehensive vehicle through which to support the reform process as
recognized by the Authorities, and engage them throughout critical years of deep reforms. The
2009 FSAP validated FLSTAP and ensured its relevancy through the second half of
implementation, as the project showed flexibility to accommodate emerging issues, updating
reform agenda being supported.

105. The project’s flexible design made it possible to accommodate changing priorities and to
include new issues that were completely unforeseen at inception. A good example of the latter
has been the inclusion of PPPs in the last phase of the project.

                                               29
106. Complex technical assistance projects require extra resources. FLSTAP covered a broad
range of financial, legal and judicial technical areas, which required the mobilization of
numerous experts. Supervision budgets exceeded bank averages, and considerable additional
funds were mobilized and expertise leveraged including EFOs from co-financier DFID, without
which the project’s development objectives may not have been achieved and reform momentum
could have been wasted. Similarly, implementation agencies require a high degree of technical
expertise in order to drive implementation in a diverse and low capacity set of agencies, many
new or young, but at the same time, these are the ones that need the most help. FLSTAP
implementation stalled until highly qualified technical experts were seconded from CBK and
SLO to manage the project and provide technical guidance.

107. Institutional development takes time and requires continuous support. FLSTAP provided
critical support to many young, newly independent agencies that in some cases needed to be built
from scratch (SASRA) or very early stages (IRA). While such institutions had limited capacity to
tap project funds relative to other institutions, their institutional capacity building needs were
large and they managed to obtain substantial support that helped them achieve a more advanced
stage of development. The project resisted pressures to reduce scope at MTR at the strong
request of the Authorities, by cutting funding to such agencies, and instead provided extra
support to ensure that these institutions benefitted from FLSTAP given progress that had started
to become evident.

108. The critical aspects of prioritization and sequencing of reforms is always very difficult,
since legislation must be in place, as a critical foundation before new regulatory agencies and
other institutions (i.e.; FRC) are launched, followed by capacity building (usually a longer-term
endeavour), the drafting of secondary legislation and regulations, and the acquisition of
equipment. In some activities an ideal sequence could not be achieved as drafting and passing of
legislation, for example, took a longer time.

109. On the question of complexity and scope, it is not easy to speculate about a
counterfactual design that could have settled, for example, with implementing two parallel
projects (one financial reform and a separate legal reform project). Advantages of such approach
could have been more focus and maybe stronger ownership by fewer implementing agencies.
The risks would have included more difficult coordination and the risk of possible
inconsistencies. In addition, the reform agenda may have benefitted from more a focused
approach within each area, perhaps in a context of programmatic TA support.

110. Simplify financing arrangements. Percentages in financing formulas for each category of
expenditures for each of the three project funding sources (IDA, DFID and Government) was
impractical and at times inconsistent with targeted disbursement levels: allocating specific
percentages for the four expenditure categories (goods and equipment, consulting services,
training and workshops and operating costs) that varied across categories, added another level of
complexity to the financial management of the project. Moreover, due to binding constraints in
the use of the funds required by the formulas, during the two project extensions expenditure
category percentages for the project were modified, but it was not possible to adapt exactly the
percentages for each financier as it depended on the actual amount spent in each activities, only
known after the fact. This is the main reason why there was lower than 100 percent absorption of
IDA funds, but more importantly, it led to substantial delays during some periods because
disbursement requests had to wait until previous requests at both IDA and DFID had been duly
paid to proceed with the next, which sometimes took 3-4 months to complete, particularly at

                                               30
DFID. In addition, it required the last restructuring to take place barely two months before
closure once it became evident that DFID funds would run out and that pending activities being
implemented could not be paid for because the formula required a portion of DFID to be
included regardless of the fact that there were extra IDA funds. Changing the percentages
towards the end allowed the Government to benefit from additional funds from IDA that would
have otherwise have to come from their funds, given commitments.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The overall development objective of the project is to create a sound financial system and
strengthened legal and judicial capacity that will ensure broad access to financial and related
legal services. In this Annex the activities and outcomes under the seven components will be
discussed, with key features/conclusions reflected in the main body of the ICR.

Component 1: Financial and Judicial Sector Strategy Development.

111. The Project supported the formulation of a financial sector strategy involving broad
consultations among stakeholders and financed various studies on the financial sector. The
project also supported the development of a Strategy for the Judiciary as provided in the GJLOS,
which include the introduction of performance and service standards, a comprehensive training
program, and the introduction of a credible system for the selection, appointment, and
removal/discipline of judges and other judicial staff, and the strengthening the Judicial Service
Commission. The Project supported relevant agencies in developing a framework for monitoring
and evaluating progress in financial sector development and judicial and legal reforms.

(i) Develop an overall financial sector strategy (Implementing Agency MOF-EAD)

112. The project supported the preparation of a Comprehensive Financial Sector Reform and
Development Strategy (CFSRD) submitted to MOF (Oct.2011) , which was subsequently
adopted by MOF; and has been instrumental in guiding the development of the Medium Term
Plan 2013-2017 (MTP2) for the Financial Services Sector. The CFSRD is thus a critical Policy
paper guiding development of the Financial Services Sector.

113. Other areas supported under this sub-component included: (a) Capacity building in
financial sector analysis and reforms – a Comprehensive Report on the current Knowledge and
Skills Gaps in the financial sector completed, Strategic Planning Workshops for senior Officials
of DFIs was held; c) Promote efficiency and effectiveness of DFIs in Kenya – a draft
Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) Policy and Bill completed

(ii) Increase access to rural and term finance. In close collaboration with the FSD project and
FinAccess, this component also financed various workshops to discuss the findings of FinAccess
2009 and preparatory costs for the preparation of FinAccess 2011.

        1.2    CBK- Kenyan School of Monetary Studies (KSMS

114. Initially the KSMS, and its Management Development Centre (MDC), whose mandate is
to provide training and related support services to fulfil the needs of the financial sector, were
not directly covered under the project. However, given the prominent role human resource
capacity-building and professional training the CBK in the Vision 2030, the authorities decided
to provide financing for the School to contract two consulting assignments, which were finalized
in June and August of 2012.
   Capacity Building in Identification and Design of Value-Based Courses for the Financial
    Sector (June 2012): The TNA study aimed to identify gaps between current capacity and
    future needs. The report concluded that current training courses were too basic without
    sufficient available training to professional levels, too focused on CBK internal needs;

                                                33
    programs were weak on core programs such as ICT, business Intelligence and ethics.
    Recommendations included embedding certain courses in the career development paths of
    CBK staff; to initiate marketing of new programs to the various market segments (government
    ministries and agencies, insurance, pensions, etc.), by recruiting Academic Directors; to
    provide more sophisticated value-based courses and to operate distance and e-learning
    techniques; offer programs at the  executive level. In order to expand its involvement to
    broader financial sector market, the report recommended setting up a marketing unit within
    MDC and an in-house ICT function.
   Capacity Building in Identification and Design of Value-Based Courses for the Financial
    Sector August 2012: the consultants developed a Manual Course Design to serve the needs of
    structuring capacity building & training courses by KSMS/MDC for the financial sector. The
    goal of the manual was to provide the Management Development Centre (MDC) a
    comprehensive tool with the necessary information required to design, develop and conduct
    course program, followed by the Curriculum Booklet to finalize the project. MDCs goal is to
    position itself as a leading training institute in the financial sector in Kenya and the region. To
    reach that stage MDC is facing a strategic change management challenge. The application of
    the Manual Course Design provides the management tool to successfully face that challenge.

Component 2: Restructuring and Privatization of Financial Institutions

115. The objective of this component was to strengthening the banking system, including: (a)
carrying out of a bank restructuring and privatization project; (b) identification of strategic
options for divestiture; and (c) restructuring of development finance institutions, all through the
provision of legal and technical advisory services and audits. The banking system had at the time
a very high level of non-performing loans concentrated in four commercial banks with state
interests. Divesting the Government’s stake in these institutions was to help strengthen
competition and improve stability, resulting in downward pressure on the currently high interest
rate margins and increase the incentives to reach underserved markets. The Project supported the
establishment of a specialist Bank Restructuring and Privatization Project (BRPP) within the
Ministry of Finance to guide the privatization process for the identification of strategic options
for divestiture.

(i) Restructure and dispose of the Sate influenced share at the National Bank of Kenya
       Diagnostic and analytical work completed under the project’s Bank Restructuring and
        Privatization Unit (BRPU). Privatization Commission was set up and transaction adviser
        to privatize NBK hired using GoK funds.
       Privatization of at least two banks - transaction advisers were hired since 2008.
       Identification of strategic options for divestiture - Cabinet Memorandum setting out
        approach to restructure and privatize National Bank of Kenya (NBK) prepared with
        support from the project’s BRPU and approved by Cabinet.
       Restructuring of development finance institutions: Detailed analysis undertaken of each
        institution and draft DFI strategy prepared. DFIs have continued with efforts to adopt
        AADFI Standards in anticipation of the reforms recommended in the Draft Strategy.
       Strengthening the role and effectiveness of Cooperative Bank as a key institution for
        improving access to financial services and Kenya Post Office Savings Bank as a safe
        depository for low income and rural savers through the provision of legal and technical

                                                  34
       advisory services and audits - Shareholder strategy for reform of KPOSB prepared.
       Government gave the go ahead for the introduction of a new business model at KPOSB.

116. Component 3: Strengthening Financial Sector Regulators and the Deposit Protection
Fund Board. The primary role of the Government in the financial sector is to provide a legal,
regulatory, and supervisory framework that promotes soundness and competition in the sector.
The Project provided support for the review, amendment and/or drafting of financial sector laws
and regulations that govern all the regulators and the DPF, with the objective of strengthening
their effectiveness. It also supported capacity building initiatives for these institutions, including
training needs assessment, training of staff, resident advisors, and establishment of capacity to
regulate and supervise the microfinance and SACCOs sectors under the proposed new legislation.
In addition, improvements were made to the Management Information Systems (MIS) of these
institutions, including software upgrades and purchase of hardware.

117. The 2003 FSAP BCP assessment identified major flaws/gaps in CBK-BSD’s compliance
with international regulatory and supervisory standards. The poor ratings prompted CBK-BSD to
develop a regulatory reform strategy. With FLSTAP assistance a consultant was hired to assist in
reviewing the Banking Act, but this effort stopped in view of lack of support from the Attorney
General’s Office. The authorities decided from 2009 onwards to introduce piecemeal revisions to
the Act in the annual Finance Laws in the following years.

118. A second major area of attention was the establishment of the legal framework for the
operation of the Credit Bureaus. A consultant was identified and financed under the Project, but
it was not a satisfactory match and the contract was terminated. The project assisted with a
public education campaign to sensitize bank clients.

(i)    Effectiveness of financial sector regulators strengthened
       CBK- Banking Supervision Department (BSD)

119. The Project also funded significant capacity building through training of staff in Kenya
and abroad, in areas like risk management, supervision, prompt corrective actions, micro-finance
and crisis resolution.

120. The 2009 FSAP found new issues, although the overall BCP ratings improved. There
were warning signals on key areas showing weaknesses, particularly AML/FT weaknesses,
internal controls, consolidated and risk-based supervision, and capacity building in CBK’s BSD.

121. A 2013 BCP under new Basel framework found that Kenya did attain a Compliant or
Largely Compliant rating on at least 18 of the BCPs. Kenya has made substantial progress on
most fronts since 2009. The key areas of progress include Consolidated Supervision (BCP12),
Home-Host Relationships (BCP13), Corporate Governance (BCP14), Country and Transfer Risk
(BCP21) and Market risk (BCP22). (Though there has been progress in the area of AMLCFT
(BCP29), it remains work in progress.) However, a number of important new enhancements and
updates were implemented with effect from 1 January 2013 – consequently, it is still too early to
determine the quality of implementation in these areas.




                                                 35
(ii)       Establishment of an Anti-Money Laundering compliance framework
           AML/FT - Financial Reporting Center (FRC)

122. Kenya was under significant international pressure (FATF “grey list” and 2009 FSAP
Recommendations) to enhance its AML/FT compliance framework. Responding to conform to
higher international standards, Kenya passed a new AML/FT Law in 2009 (which became
effective in June 2010). Secondary legislation and regulations were developed to put in place a
stronger supervisory framework. Moreover, in 2012 Treasury decided to establish an
independent FRC acting as a Financial Intelligence Unit, reporting to a high level AML Board,
headed by a Sr. staff from the CBK. The FLSTAP financed a Board training workshop to assist
them in defining the policy agenda of the institution, as well as some study tours abroad (South
Africa, Qatar and Mauritius) for Board members and FRC staff.

123. The institutional strengthening provided by the Project was instrumental in assisting them
to develop a Strategy Implementation Plan and a new web page. FRC indicated that the visits
abroad were very effective, an “eye-opener” for Board members to understand what needed to be
done and the Board’s role. The Project financed local staff was trained in AML supervision, as
well as the drafting and dissemination by consultants of new AML regulations. Since October
2012 all institutions under CBK supervision are sending Suspicious Transactions Reports (STRs)
on a regular basis to the FRC. From July 2013 institutions supervised by the IRA and CMA will
also start reporting. Training was funded under the project for banks’ compliance officers and
other stakeholders. The late creation of the FRC precluded the financing of equipment before the
closing date of the loan.

124. The FRC analyses the STRs, which are filed in a database. Those requiring further action
are reported to a special section of the law enforcement agencies, leading eventually to public
prosecution and actions from the judicial system and the Asset Recovery Agency.

125. The FRC indicated five priority areas going forward: (i) Development of the asset
freezing mechanism foreseen in the AML Law; (ii) development of a robust dissuasive and
sanction regime; (iii) further institutional development of the FRC; (iv) development of
delegated powers to the financial regulatory agencies; and (v) criminalization of FT financing
which requires amendments to the AML Law.

126. Kenya has made significant progress in this area, as reported in the June 2013 FATF
Report.

(iii)      Strengthen autonomy of Capital markets Authority
           Capital markets Authority (CMA)

127. CMA was a significant user of FLSTAP funds with about US$2.5 million in support of
numerous activities in the following areas:
          Drafting of Legislation, including the CMA Act of 2011 and the Securities Investment
           Act (2011). Workshops were organized to explain the laws to stakeholders, but the final
           versions have not yet been presented to Parliament, since, like in the case of the Banking
           Act the authorities decided to go for a piecemeal approach including amendments in the
           annual Budget Laws;


                                                  36
          o Demutualization of the Nairobi Stock Exchange, supported by consulting services
            to split management from ownership. The CMA expects to complete by the end of
            2013 the demutualization process.
          o Real Estate Investment Trusts, including consulting and training;
          o Training included 23 staff trained abroad in three different events.
      Migrating to risk-based supervision (RBS), including the following activities:
          o Diagnosis of CMA supervisory process;
          o A quantitative impact study related to the adequacy of new capital requirements;
          o Drafting of RBS manuals;
          o Funding of a resident advisor for a 6 month period (2010-11);
          o Drafting of conduct of business rules;
          o Electronic financial reporting (pending); and
          o Drafting new governance rules to be followed by new enforcement rules and
            practices.
      Document imaging system, including a digitized registry, security and disaster recovery,
       automated workflow.
      Enterprise resources program (ERP) which included the acquisition of a system
       (software) and equipment (hardware), including finance, HR and procurement, as well as
       the automation of CMA core functions.
      Acquisition of a RBS system to automate the market oversight function and the
       integration of CMA’s systems;
      Procurement ERP/RBS hardware, to enhance CMA’s network and data centre.
      Capacity building, which financed a number of study tours to Malaysia, Nigeria, South
       Africa China and Washington; as well as local training by the US SEC, an IOSCO self-
       assessment (2007) for Kenya and the EAC and the development of an action plan,
       assessment of the new eight IOSCO principles, and a CPSS-IOSCO self-assessment (on-
       going).
128. The CMA mentioned that following the closing of the FLSTAP they are getting financing
from the project for Financial sector Deepening Trust (FSD)
       Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA)
129. The IRA received significant support from the Project following the 2009 FSAP
diagnostic of the issues in Kenya’s insurance sector. Funding was used to migrate from a
compliance-based supervisory framework to one risk-based, as well as to acquire ICT software
and equipment
      Looking to reform of the Insurance Act, IRA hired in 2009 a consulting consortium to
       undertake a comprehensive review of the Insurance Act Draft insurance bill. However,
       the draft submitted in 2011 was unsatisfactory, particularly since it did not contemplate
       moving to a RBS system, nor addressed some of the 2009 FSAP recommendations.
       Furthermore, there was no buy-in from the insurance industry as a key stakeholder. As a
       result, the new draft Act did not move forward. In 2011 a new consultant was hired to
       review the draft Act and produce a new version. The latter came too late to be financed

                                               37
           under the Project. However, the work has continued and an RBS manual and guidelines
           have been drafted. Like in other cases, the Insurance Act has not been amended in full,
           but piecemeal reforms have been attached to the annual Budget Law. The IRA expects
           that a new Insurance Act might be finally approved during the first quarter of 2014.
          The Project financed an earlier work by a consultant in 2010, which prepared a
           comprehensive diagnostic study of the sector and the IRA.
          With Project assistance a consultant advised the IRA and drafted guidelines to reform
           Motor Insurance Financial reporting by insurance companies.
          IRA has continued to enhance the regulatory and supervisory insurance framework.
           Several guidelines have been issued, including: market conduct for insurance
           investigators and motor assessors, new insurance products, insurance claims’ settlement,
           rating guidelines for group life listed risks, submission of unaudited quarterly returns and
           IRA Strategic Plan.
          Offsite and onsite surveillance RBS compliant have been implemented.
          An Insurance Fraud Investigation Unit was established (in partnership with the
           Commissioner of Police) to tackle issues of insurance fraud.
          Further, standardization of policy contracts to deal with issues of “fine print” initiated and
           will roll over to the nest MTP period.
          IRA has promoted other regulatory reforms, undertaking benchmarking studies and
           proposals made to Treasury on policy reforms on the sector, manual on public
           procurement of insurance services developed, draft micro insurance policy developed and
           the first insurance company was licensed;
          The Project assisted IRA to improve staff skills, as well as to conduct workshops with the
           industry on a number of emerging issues, such as Micro-insurance, ALM/FT and Risk
           Based Supervision. Further, a scholarship program was launched to expand capacity of
           the actuarial profession and other workshops were held for all categories of regulated
           entities.
          Efforts to improve consumer education and financial literacy of the general population.
          IRA is aiming to rationalize the size and the structure of the sector by raising the
           minimum levels of capitalization, as well as issuing new measures to enhance corporate
           governance.

(iv)       Strengthen the Capacity of Retirement Benefits Authority (RBA)

130. Since the Authority came into full operation in 2000, the retirement benefits sector in
Kenya has grown tremendously both in membership and assets.

131. The Kenyan pensions system manages assets of about 17 percent of GDP and is
dominated by the National Social Security Fund (NSSF). The Retirement Benefits Authority
(RBA) regulates and supervises about 1,262 retirement benefits schemes (occupational and
individual), 16 fund managers, 12 custodians, and 26 registered external administrators in 2011.
Total assets of the industry in 2011 amounted to KSh 432 billion, with the NSSF accounting for
23 percent. There are around 1.7 million active members in the various retirement benefit
schemes, of whom 1.3 million are members of NSSF.

                                                    38
132. Government Securities constituted the largest share of industry assets with 34%, followed
by Quoted Equities with 21%, Immovable Property with 20% and Guaranteed Fund investments
with 11%.

133. The Retirement benefits industry in Kenya can be categorized into four distinct categories
of schemes:
       i)     National Social Security Fund (NSSF): this is a mandatory scheme where
              employers and employees are mandated to make joint monthly contributions with
              the employer and employee making flat contributions. The Fund is a funded
              provident fund. The benefits are locked/preserved until age 50 when workers can
              opt for early retirement. The contribution rates and coverage of workers in the
              informal sector.
       ii)    Occupational Retirement Benefits Schemes: these are employment based and are
              voluntary basis established by employers. The schemes are funded through
              contributions from employers and employees. The contribution rates vary from
              one scheme to the other. Similarly the contributions from employer and
              employees also differ. The Design and type also varies from one scheme to
              another. However, majority of schemes are Defined Contribution Pension
              schemes.
       iii)   Individual Retirement Benefits Scheme: The Individual Retirement Benefits
              Schemes though relatively new, has been one of the fastest growing components
              of the retirement benefits industry. Individual retirement benefit schemes are
              schemes operated by independent financial institutions, mostly insurance firms
              and membership is open to anyone who wants to save for retirement. This
              contrasts to the traditional Occupational Retirement Benefits Schemes whose
              membership is only open to employees of the company establishing the scheme.
              Currently there are around 19 registered Individual Retirement Benefits Scheme.
       iv)    Civil Service Pension Scheme: the scheme is established under an act of
              Parliament to provide retirement benefits for all civil servants employed by the
              government. Currently, the scheme is a Pay as You Go non-funded and non-
              contributory scheme. The scheme is funded from Government revenue collections.
              The Schemes currently covers over 400,000 civil servants.

FLSTAP contributions

134. The Pension’s regulator received assistance from the Project to: (i) improve financial
literacy in Kenya; (ii) to enhance its supervisory functions, including moving to a risk-based
supervision framework (with consulting services); (iii) funding of significant investments in
software and hardware (ICT) to modernize its internal processes including finance,
administration, HR and procurement, as well as data collection, management and analysis with
new ICT equipment; and (iv) training of pension supervisors in Kenya and abroad (Australia,
Armenia and Chile), as well as the ICT team.

135. Like other FLSTAP implementing agencies, RBA had difficulties in defining the
technical specifications of the services and equipment required, as well as with the overall
procurement process. It was also challenging to integrate the purchase of the software with the

                                              39
hardware, as multiple companies were involved in the enterprise resources program (ERP)
procurement process (3). Customization of both to meet RBA’s needs was also complex, as their
tasks involve managing information from about 1,200 occupational retirement funds and 98
individual pension schemes, managed by 16 pension funds and two external scheme
administrators (which handle about 85 percent of the funds, while the remainder is managed in-
house by the pension funds), for a pension system that has already collected contributions in
excess of US$6 billion (about 17 percent of GDP) in predominantly defined contribution
schemes, out of which the National Social Security System represents about 30 percent and the
remainder (70 percent) are long-term savings managed by private pension funds (excluding the
civil service, which is managed separately).

(v)    Strengthen the autonomy and effectiveness of CBK- Deposit Protection Fund (DPFB)

136. Background: The DPFB did not exist as an independent entity, but it was a department
within the CBK. The FLSTAP supported the establishment of an independent Kenya Deposit
Insurance Corporation (KDIC), assisting with the drafting of a new law (Kenya Deposit
Insurance Act) and financing workshops to sensitize members of parliament prior to the
discussion of the draft law. The Act sets a minimum contribution to the insurance fund of no less
than 0.15 percent of average total deposit liabilities, foreseeing additional risk-based charges
according to the methodology developed by KDIC. The project financed the development of the
latter. The KDIC has been established outside of the CBK, but only until the promulgation of the
law it will become independent.

FLSTAP Contributions

137. The Project assisted in launching KDIC, establishing the new regulatory framework and
providing significant training and capacity building, IT systems, financing an assisted assessment
of the IADI principles, and financed a specialized library. Critically, the project financed external
consultant services to transform DPFB from a simple “pay box” into an active deposit insurance
corporation with special examination powers and a bank resolution agency with receivership and
liquidator functions, as defined in Parts IV and V of the new Act. In the event of notification of a
bank’s non-viability, CBK will inform KDIC of the suspension of a bank’s activities, appointing
it as receiver (with or without suspension of the bank’s activities). The Act authorizes KDIC to
ask bank shareholders to provide sufficient resources to restore its financial condition within a
stated period. Failing this, KDIC can initiate the transfer of all or part of the assets and deposits
to another solvent bank via a special purpose vehicle, which will fill any gap between assets and
deposits with a KDIC bond issued to the institution(s) receiving the deposits. Once the
receivership is finalized, KDIC will start the liquidation process of the residual balance sheet of
the bank.

138. Project support for one ICT activity was impacted by a claim raised to the Inspection
Panel, which was eventually not supported as this emerged late in the process. The due process
started, but there was no time to fully implement it and it was dropped. The CBK took over the
procurement process with its own budget, but did not use earlier steps completed and restarted it
to ensure claims were addressed, even if not fully confirmed at that period (nor rejected)

139. KDIC expressed great satisfaction with the work performed by project-financed
consultants, particularly the training offered on bank resolution proceedings.

(vi)    Introduce regulation of the SACCO sector : SASRA (Sacco Societies Regulatory
        Agency)

140. Background: The Savings and Credit Cooperative (SACCO) sector has become
increasingly formalized, facilitated by the establishment of the Sacco Societies Regulatory
Authority (SASRA) in 2008. Before that the sector was not supervised at all. As of January 2013,
123 out of 215 deposit-taking SACCOs had been licensed (130 licensed as of June, 2013).
Membership of the licensed SACCOs has increased from 1.0 million to 2.1 million. As of
September 2012, the NPL ratio was 5.9 percent (down from 9.7 percent in December 2011). The
SACCOs have approximately 550 branches distributed across the country with 148 SACCOs
linked through the Co-operative Bank’s Sacco Link network (which is itself connected to the
Visa system). The introduction of a separate regulation for SACCOs has led to higher standards
in the sector through clear guidelines regarding capital, liquidity, and provisioning, among others.
This has been an important development for the stability of the Kenyan financial system, as some
of the largest 20 SACCOs have reached the size of small banks and manage millions of
uninsured deposit accounts of institutions without a lender of last resort in case of liquidity needs.
The requirement to report regularly to SASRA has led to improvements in the IT infrastructure
necessary for accurate reporting, therewith contributing to higher operational effectiveness as
well. Licensed SACCOs report their monthly financial information to SASRA, on an excel basis,
electronically, information which is analysed largely off-site by SASRA’s 55 staff (out of which
75% are professionals). SACCOs offer to their customers debit but not credit cards.13

141. In addition to the deposit-taking SACCOs, over 3,000 non deposit-taking SACCOs are
operating in Kenya, accounting only for about 20 percent of total assets, loans, and deposits held
in the system.

FLSTAP contributions to SASRA

142. The FLSTAP financed a number of critical activities for SASRA, including: equipment
(hardware and software), institutional strengthening and significant training and study tours
abroad to its staff. Training was particularly important since SASRA is a new regulatory agency
established three years ago, without any experience in prudential oversight of the sub-sector.
SASRA considered the project support to have been invaluable.

143. The project funded the development of a SACCO strategy paper and a number of
stakeholder workshops to sensitize participants on the new legal and regulatory mechanisms.
These activities were complemented with training Board members and staff to discharge their
functions and at the working level training on on-site and off-site supervisory tasks, as well as
with the funding of a resident advisor to assist the staff in developing data bases, to assess the
financial condition and risks of supervised institutions, develop supervisory methodologies and
approaches, collect and analyse statistics and rate licensed SACCOs, using a CAMEL-type
system. The project funded the IT needs assessment of the Agency and IT and MIS equipment
and systems. A number of consulting services were financed to assist SASRA in formulating a
supervisory plan and a medium-term strategic plan.


                                                     42
144. Most likely SASRA could not have had a successful launch and the impressive progress
achieved in the past three years without FLSTAP support. This is openly recognized by the
agency.

145. Component 4: Strengthening Debt Management and Debt Markets. At the time of
project appraisal, the updating of Government debt databases was handled by individual entities
in the Ministry of Finance and CBK responsible for parts of debt management and there was no
coordination or consolidation of data. The Project sought to provide technical support for setting
up a unified and sustainable Debt Management Office, including review of relevant legislation.
The Project also intended to support a number of technical improvements with a view to
enhancing the operation of the primary and secondary government debt markets. These include:
(i) designing a benchmark issuance strategy; (ii) taking measures to improve transparency in
funding operations; (iii) facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) trading in Government securities;
and (iv) establishing a Repurchase Market in Government securities

MOF- Debt Management Department (DMD)

146.   FLSTAP supported capacity building and ICT equipment.

147. The Debt Management Office (DMO) of the MoF was supported for several activities,
including ICT equipment, and later elected to fund training activities through the PFM project.

CBK- Domestic Debt Markets (Financial Markets Department)

148. FLSTAP support to CBK’s Debt Management Department focused on strengthening the
structure of debt markets in Kenya. The component involved three phases:

149. Phase I: Pre-procurement stage including a market survey to identify key players in the
Kenyan financial market, investor base review, legal and operational frameworks, infrastructure
systems, assessment of technical capacity needs of the staffs. The output was a Market Survey
Report. This was contained in Report I dubbed: Revamping Kenya’s Government Bond Markets:
Investor Survey General Findings and Recommendations submitted by Crown Agents in
February 2009.

150. Phase II: Included review of current primary and secondary markets structures with a
view of making appropriate recommendations for modernization using the Market Survey Report
produced from Phase I. It provided proposals on Primary Dealership, Bond and Money Markets
Indices, Benchmark Bonds Program, Yield Curve Estimation and Analyses, Over-the-Counter
(OTC) trading platform, electronic trading platform, and modernization of auction processes as
well as review of institutional arrangement. These were contained in Report II: (Framework to
Establish a Robust Primary Market for Debt Securities in Kenya) and Report III (Proposed
Framework for the Secondary Market & Review of Legal and Regulatory Framework) which
were submitted in 2011.

151.   Phase I and II were completed in 2009 and 2010 respectively.

152. Phase III: The third phase of the project covered the implementation of the
recommendations made in Phase II. It also involves enhancement of technical capacity of staff as


                                               43
well as provision of equipment. The following is the status of progress of activities under Phase
III of the project:
           In March 2009 consultants conducted a stakeholder induction workshop to appraise all
            stakeholders on the project and the consultancy.
           In May 2009, the Project Consultants facilitated sensitization workshop for financial
            market stakeholders held at Kenya School of Monetary Studies (KSMS). The workshop
            focused on the taking stock of the project activities that had been carried out. The
            workshop discussed Report II findings and recommendations as well as capacity building
            initiatives. Participation was drawn from CBK, Treasury, CMA, NSE, CMA, RBA,
            CDSC and IRA.
           In May 2010, a consultant conducted an in-house training on the construction of Bond
            Indices and the Yield Curve. Consultative meetings with Reuters, Nairobi Securities
            Exchange and National Debt Management were held to understand the structure and
            dynamics of the Kenyan market. A draft report was submitted on how to put in place
            accurate and reliable pricing tools for the bond market namely the yield curve and bond
            indices.
           As part of the project recommendations, the Department has also received two printers,
            two laptops and five computers from FLSTAP.
           Two staff members have been funded for overseas courses on developing debt markets,
            while another three were sent to the National Bank of Poland.

153. CBK has implemented and continues to put in place a number of recommendations
outlined in Reports II & III as described in the matrix below:

MOF- PPP Secretariat

154. The Office charged with developing within the Treasury the private-public partnerships
program started in 2010 with the appointment of a Sr. and highly respected Treasury official. His
office requested World Bank support and he was included as a user of the FLSTAP funds. With
Project assistance a PPP Act was prepared and approved in 2012. At present the WB, outside of
the Project, is working on the preparation of secondary legislation and regulations to implement
the Act under the auspices of a new project.



                                                   47
155. With FLSTAP support a consulting company was hired to examine the pipeline of
government investment projects to screen a subset of them that could be suitable for PPP
financing. The consultant’s report was finalized in October 2012. The second phase of the
consulting assignment included the preparation of pre-feasibility studies for five projects,
including their technical and financial viability. In this sense the FLSTAP was instrumental in
saving about one year of preparation time for the launching of the PPP project (US$40 million),
assisting in a way similar to the Bank’s project preparation facilities. At present treasury is
looking for a Transaction Advisor prior to going to the market to seek interested investors. A
second advantage for the new WB project is that the already experienced and efficient PIU
handling the FLSTAP will also be charged to manage the new project on behalf of Treasury. The
PPP project will also benefit from advances in the local capital market and at the same time
foster its further development as some of the PPP projects will seek at least partial local
financing, including from the pension funds. These synergies are additional benefits derived
from the FLSTAP.

156. The FLSTAP also financed a number of workshops to explain the new legislation and
objectives of the PPP Secretariat.

157. Component 5: Modernizing the National Payments System. At appraisal, the Kenyan
authorities recognized the existing deficiencies in the clearing and settlement mechanisms and a
task force had produced a framework and strategy paper for the modernization of the national
payments system which recommended, among other things, introduction of a Real Time Gross
Settlement System (RTGS). The Central Bank had already earmarked funds for the acquisition of
a stand-alone RTGS. The Project intended to provide appropriate technical assistance and
funding to acquire a Scripless Securities Settlement System/Central Depository System (CDS) to
facilitate the safe, secure and efficient clearance and settlement of funds and securities transfers
(both primary and secondary market transfers) in a manner consistent with best international
practice. In addition, the project intended to support the establishment of an appropriate legal and
oversight framework, and provision of expert technical advice and training for staff of the
Department of Payments System in the CBK. The Project also planned to fund a diagnostic study
to identify the needs for improvements in the mechanisms for low value payments transfers.

CBK- National Payment Systems (NPS)

158. Background: The CBK has been reforming and modernizing the country’s payment
systems since the late 1990s, with the full automation of the Nairobi Clearing House in 1998.
The following years saw progress in terms of adding a second clearing session in 1999, as well
as the promulgation of new Acts to provide the legal basis for electronic payment instruments. In
2002-20003 the Clearing House moved to receive electronic data transmission from banks, CBK
introduced the one-day high value clearing and the Kenswitch went live, as well as the direct
debit system. Foreign exchange clearing went live only in 2004. In spite of all this progress,
Kenya was falling behind with other countries in the region by not having an RTGS system.
There was significant pressure on CBK to acquire an RTGS and CBK decided it could not wait
for the lengthy and complex World Bank procurement process and decided to use its own funds
hiring a US specialized provider (Montran) and implementing the system in July 2005,
completing the installation in six months.

159. Since then, noticeable improvements have been achieved in the National Payments
System, both at the wholesale and at the retail level. The National Payment System (NPS)

                                                48
consists of the Kenya Electronic Payments and Settlement System (KEPSS), a multi-currency
real time gross settlement system (RTGS) owned and operated by CBK, and the Nairobi
Automatic Clearing House (ACH), which is owned and operated by the Kenya Bankers
Association (KBA). The number of transactions handled by KEPSS has increased from 180,312
in 2007 to 1,406,886 as of June 2012. Total transactions amounted to Ksh 20,886 billion in the
year to June 2012. A value cap was introduced requiring all large value payments (KSh 1 million
and higher) to be cleared and settled through KEPPS, which has led to an increase in the number
of transactions. The ACH handled 27.63 million transactions with a value of Ksh 2,497 billion.
The efficiency of cheques as a payments instrument was improved through cheque truncation,
allowing a reduction in the time to clear cheques from T+3 to T+2. Simultaneously, there has
been a significant shift to the use of other electronic forms of retail payment. Electronic Funds
Transfer (EFT) transactions stood at Ksh 363 billion as of June 2012 and the total number of
cards in use increased from 8.6 million cards in June 2011 to 9.9 million cards in June 2012.
Mobile phone based payments have dramatically changed the landscape of retail payments and
transfers. Introduced by Safaricom’s M-Pesa, the customer base of mobile money transfer
services stood at 19.8 million customers at end June 2012. The number of mobile money
transactions amounted to 507.9 million at year-end June 2012 with a total volume of Ksh
1,375.83 billion. Correspondingly, the total number of agents increased to 61,313.

FLSTAP Contributions

160. CBK indicated that time pressure and low internal absorption capacity were obstacles for
an earlier use of the project funds to finance the RTGS. However, CBK made good use of the
FLSTAP to finance a number of critical consulting services starting in mid-2009, to establish the
legal basis and the regulatory and oversight functions for e-payment and m-payment systems, in
support of the explosion of mobile payments (M-Pesa, Yu Cash, Zap (Airtel money), and others),
as well as the increasing flow of international payments and remittances (M-Pesa and Western
Union). Project funded consulting services were provided over an extended period (2009-2011),
including a number of critical workshops for stakeholders. The Project also supported workshops
to explain the National Payment System Act of 2011 and the following regulations, including
Designation of Payment System, Designation of Payment Instruments, and ALM Regulations for
Mobile Payment Providers. All these activities have played a very important enabling role for the
payments revolution experienced by Kenya. The project also funded workshops and study tours
of key CBK personnel abroad.

161. The project financed a critical missing piece of infrastructure (hardware, communication,
and security requirements) for the RTGS in the form of a remote disaster recovery site, providing
critical back up for the safe operation of the large value payment system in the country.

162. The project also funded a review of existing switching mechanisms to enhance the
efficiency of the payment card infrastructure (Master Card Advisors). Consulting services for the
design of an efficient paperless security settlement services came too late for the project to
finance prior to its closing date. All the activities financed under the Project were deemed by
CBK to have been of critical importance to enhance the efficiency and security of electronic
payments in Kenya. Efficiency gains and security enhancements of the RTGS system were
confirmed through interviews of payment system users (NBK).

163. Component 6: Improving the Lending Environment. The Project will support: (i)
improvements in the operation of the Department of the Registrar General which includes: a)

                                               49
assistance to the Companies Register to enable the Registry clear the backlog in filing and allow
for speedy and accurate information sharing of corporate information and data; and b) combining
of the Charges Register and the Chattel Mortgage Register into one; moving the combined
separate register (notification system) for charges/pledges over movable assets out of the
Companies Register and developing a new Personal Property Securities Act (i.e., secured
transactions framework) in line with international best practices; (ii) improvements in the land
registration system through digitizing land records; (iii) establishment of a legal and regulatory
framework for the operation of a credit reference bureau that would facilitate the much needed
information flow among the credit granting institutions; and (iv) the review of impediments to
the growth of the leasing industry, including tax laws on leasing.

CBK- Banking Supervision Department (BSD)

164. Credit reference bureaus licensed and operational (Implementing Agency: CBK-BSD):
FLSTAP funded a consultancy to support BSD staff in licencing CRBs, workshops on CRBs,
capacity building of BSD staff, and purchase of ICT office equipment. The introduction of two
Credit Reference Bureaus (Jun 2010) and CRB regulations drafted with project support (Feb
2009) contributed to the steady reduction of credit risks and NPLs.

165. Comprehensive legal and regulatory framework. FLSTAP financed a consultant to assist
EAD in preparing a draft policy paper and Consumer Protection Law 2012. The project also
financed a market survey and preparation of proposals for increasing access to lease financing. to
further enhance broader access to financial services

Transform manual system of land records to a digitized recording and storage system
(Implementing Agency: Ministry of Lands)

166. The ICR ROSC Update for Kenya found the land registry of Kenya to be inefficient,
outdated and burdened with inadequate practices. The improvement of the situation in terms of
organization, technical capacity, record keeping, access to information and general efficiency
was regarded as key to increase confidence in the system of secured transactions. An improved
system of land registration is bound to increase legal certainty, reduce risks in lending operations
and, as a consequence, to allow for more and cheaper credit to flow. In order to move in this
direction, the FLSTAP set clear, ambitious and important objectives to be achieved by the
Ministry of Lands as implementing agency: (i) to transform the manual system of land records to
a digitized recording and storage system; (ii) to build the necessary capacity to safeguard land
records in appropriate archives and create digital archives to enable easy access to records in
Mombasa; (iii) to carry out an appraisal of records due to be disposed of; and (iv) to conduct a
review of the land laws that relate to land as collateral for financial transactions.

167. The project provided (financed) the following input: (a) in the context of building
capacity to safeguard land records, the interaction and travel of MoL technical working group
and officers from and to Mombasa; (b) storage materials were provided; (c) software and
hardware were provided, including workstations, tables, trolleys, etc.; and (d) consultants were
hired to carry out a review of the existing land laws and a workshop with stakeholders was held.
With the exception of input (a), which was conducted in 2011, the rest of the inputs happened in
2013.



                                                50
168. The input produced was minimal in comparison with the initial objectives (although not
so given the difficulties posed by the context). The legal review (coupled with other previous
analysis carried out by the WB and other donors) may provide a useful tool to base a future
modernization of the legal framework. Both the staff at the PIU and the WB staff related to the
project expressed the inadequate relationship with the Ministry of Lands, which showed lack of
interest or, at least, the inability to identify the needs according to a sound strategy.

Registrar General

169. An improvement of the functioning of the Office of the Registrar General (RG) would
also be of the highest importance. As in the case of the MoL, the RG is in charge of a most
relevant part of the realm of secured transactions. It hosts and manages the Registry of Chattels.
But not only so, the RG is also in charge of the more general Registry of Companies, which, if
working properly, constitutes one of the main sources of information to the market. Previous
assessments of the RG found inefficiencies in its functioning as well as a need for capacity
building and more funds and staff. The objectives of the FLSTAP concerning the RG was the
general improvement of the registry of operations by means of (i) a modernization and
improvement of the Chattels Transfer Registry, (ii) the decentralization of the services rendered
by the Companies Registry to Mombasa and Kisumu, and (iii) the development of rules and
regulations concerning Partnership Laws.

170. The project provided the following input: (a) a workshop was organized for staff of the
RG and key stakeholders to review the registration requirements and its process; (b) computers,
printers and other equipment was provided; (c) the staff of the Companies Registry were
instructed on IT skills, data entry, etc.; and (d) a technical drafting retreat was organized. All of it
was conducted between 2009 and 2013.

171. According to the implementing agency, the hardware and equipment received was in
good shape and it is now fully operative and incorporated into the system. A server did not fit the
system and was returned. They made other equipment requests that were not satisfied.
Concerning capacity building, they were very appreciative of the training programmes received
by their staff, which they considered highly beneficial and bespoke to their needs. With the
provision of capacity building, the FLSTAP was filling the gap existing due to the Government’s
alleged lack of support in this regard.

Kenya Law Reform Commission

172. The objective set for the implementing agency was to review the commercial and
financial legislation. Such a broad-encompassing and important task was divided into three
different types of activities: (i) the review, development and publication of the legislation on
companies and insolvency; (ii) the review, development and publication of the legislation
concerning partnerships; and (iii) the review of a number of commercial and financial laws,
which would comprise almost the entire private legal system (stemming from Sales of Goods Act
and the Hire Purchase Act to Contract or Competition law).

173. The results achieved by the project can only be positively valued. The FLSTAP funded
technical retreats to finalize the companies and insolvency drafts that were finished and sent to
Parliament. Due to the need for further improvement, both drafts were withdrawn from
Parliament for fine-tuning. Although the final draft (now again in Parliament) was done by the

                                                  51
Attorney General’s Office, the initial draft served well its purpose as initial text to build upon.
The project also funded workshops with relevant stakeholders and technical retreats that helped
refine the drafts. The FLSTAP also funded the technical retreats that finalized the draft
Partnership Bill and related regulations, as well as other meetings with identified stakeholders to
build consensus on the legal solutions proposed. The Bills were sent to Parliament in 2010 and
were approved. They have been enacted. The project’s input included funding capacity building
for members of the KLRC on legislative design of PPPs. Selected members of the KLRC also
benefited from study trips to international legislations.

174. The importance of the modernization of company and partnership law cannot be
overestimated. The Insolvency Bill is still in Parliament, but its final approval would constitute a
fantastic achievement. Although the direct impact of these events in the improvement of credit
and in the economy as a whole is difficult to quantify, their contribution to the improvement of
the legal environment cannot be denied. As to the appraisal of the implementing agency’s
activity, credit should be given to them once the bill is sent to Parliament, since its final
enactment is out of their reach. The project’s support of this activity (and of this and other
implementing agencies involved) has been most relevant and the results highly satisfactory.

175. The new Constitution of Kenya needs to be fully implemented. This implies a need to
review and revise legislation to ensure consistency with the country’s Supreme norm. This will
be a difficult task, and the KLRC will have to play a vital role. It can act as a focal point for legal
reform that will be of much use in future efforts to continue to modernize Kenya’s commercial
and financial legal frameworks.

COMPONENT 7. Legal and Judicial Reform.

176.    The description of Component 7 states the following:

a) Judicial Reform: activities in this subcomponent will focus on establishing the court and case
management and records management systems and improving court registries. Activities aimed
at reducing the backlog of cases will include supporting alternative dispute resolution (ADR)
mechanisms for commercial law cases and introducing small claims court procedures. Summary
court procedures for uncontested debt enforcement will be introduced to eliminate the frequent
frustration of enforcement procedures. Support for a staff training program and more effective
human resource administration and management will also be provided.

b)      Law reform: The Project will provide technical assistance to finalize the institutional
review and capacity building of law reform bodies, including the Law Reform Commission, the
Office of the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Service Commission. These institutions
will also be supported in carrying out the review, harmonization and drafting of priority laws in
the financial and commercial sectors in Kenya, having regard to the development of regional
trade institutions and initiatives such as the East Africa Customs Union.

c)      Legal Education: In order to strengthen the capacity of the legal profession and the
judiciary in the commercial and financial areas. It will be necessary to enhance education of
judges and lawyers. Following a review of the institutional arrangements for basic and

                                               53
continuing legal education, key legal education institutions will be provided with support to
strengthen facilities, review and develop teaching curricula and educational materials, update
libraries and research capabilities, and create new training and development opportunities for
both students and faculty.”

177. The main elements of the description transcribed above were developed successfully by
the project. FLSTAP funds were used to improve the case management system and alleviate the
backlog of cases that burdened the entire legal system; capacity building, dissemination and legal
reform were all strongly supported by the project; legal resources were systematized and made
publicly accessible; and specialization in commercial and financial law was fostered at
undergraduate and postgraduate university levels as well as with the judiciary and Government
staff. The degree of implementation and the results achieved under Component 7 can only be
valued as satisfactory.

STATE LAW OFFICE

178. [Prev.: The State Law Office (SLO), also known as Office of the Attorney General, is the
main Governmental institution in charge of legal affairs. As such, it is tasked with legal drafting
matters as well as with the organization and management of Registries. As a consequence, the
analysis and feedback included in this section is to be completed with the sections of the
Registrar General and the Kenya Law Reform Commission included above under Component 6,
and the section on the National Council for Law Reporting, under Component 7, below]

179. The FLSTAP included three objectives concerning the SLO: (i) the enhancement of the
technical level of the staff and the efficiency of their performance by providing training in legal
drafting, improving the funds of the library and acquiring new equipment; (ii) the provision of
technical assistance to the Legislative Drafting Department; and (iii) reviewing the institutional
structure of the SLP.

180. The main activities developed under the umbrella of the project were the following: (a)
the provision of training on legislative drafting to the SLO’s staff, including funding a course
overseas on PPPs; (b) the provision of books, periodicals and journals for the library; (c) the
provision of equipment; (d) an specialized consultant on legal drafting was hired; and (e) a
consultant was hired to undertake an institutional review, which produced a report identifying
recommendations and key action areas. The actions were executed in the period 2007-2013,
although the main activities (in terms of both importance and money spent) took place in 2012
and 2013. In general, the SLO (Parliamentary Counsel of the Attorney General’s Office) regards
the assistance as very timely, because it coincided with the needs deriving from the
implementation of the constitution. The implementing agency seemed content with the amount
of support received concerning capacity building (courses, books and equipment), although,
concerning equipment, they expressed discontent at the amount of computers and workstations
provided, which did not meet the needs of the Office. The implementing agency had high regard
for the work done by the PIU, and, especially, with the work done by C. Agimba. As other
Agencies expressed, the appointment of SLO staff member to the PIU was the milestone of the
project. Everything started to work once she was in office. Complaints about the procurement
system and the slow response by the WB to issue “no-objections” also apply to the SLO.

181. The most successful –and directly effective- part of the project stemmed from the activity
developed by the consultant specialist in legal drafting. The consultant trained the staff and, more

                                                54
importantly, revised entirely the Company and Insolvency Bills. The final Bills were largely in
accord with best international standards. They are bound to take Kenya’s commercial legal
framework to the next level. The entity of this outcome alone would suffice to consider the
FLSTAP’s implementation as satisfactory. Furthermore, the implementation of the
recommendations included in the report on the institutional review of the SLO should streamline
the functioning of the institution. The benefits of this consultancy may then be received in the
future.

THE JUDICIARY

182. The improvement of the judicial system in Kenya was one of the cornerstones of the
project. The adequate functioning of the judiciary is a precondition for the implementation of the
entire legal system. In the moment the project started, as is the case now, the Kenyan judicial
system was in need of a major overhaul. In 2011, the ICR ROSC Update provided a bleak
picture of the situation. It reported a clear market perception that the judicial system did not work
properly. Claims took too long to be decided, and remained tangled in courts, often for years.
The technical level of judgments was perceived as inadequate, and market participants
complained about excessive judicial discretion. The system did not seem to possess enough
material resources to handle the number of on-going cases. Judges and magistrates was that there
was excessive political influence in the appointment of members of the judiciary that the
mechanisms of selection were obscure and the result was an inadequate level of technical skills
on the various benches. The FLSTAP faced the shortcomings in the judicial system by setting the
following objectives: (i) to improve the case management system; (ii) to increase the technical
level of the judiciary (judges, magistrates and staff) by providing a judicial education programme
in commercial and financial law as well as by the provision of continuous legal education; (iii)
and the revision and update of the rules on civil procedure, incorporating alternative dispute
resolution mechanisms. The objectives were right on target, and addressed the main
shortcomings of the Kenyan judiciary.

183. The achievement of objective (i) would reduce the backlog of cases and reduce the
possibility of dishonest behaviour. It was worked through a number of measures: (a) a consultant
was hired to develop the ICT policy and strategy, and technical retreats were held; (b) a
consultant was hired to assess the rate of case clearance of the judiciary, another one was tasked
with the revision of the Judiciary Policy and Strategy Plan 2011-2013, and a third one designed
and helped implement the audio-recording systems; (c) state of the art audio-visual equipment
was acquired and installed in courts. All of this was done through the period 2010-2013.

184. One of the most efficient ways to raise the level of the judiciary is through an intense,
wide-ranging programme of capacity building. In order to achieve Objective (ii), the FLSTAP
hired a consultant to design the curriculum for commercial and financial law for the judicial
education programme. In line with this, training in specialized areas of commercial and financial
law was provided by means of workshops and judges colloquia. The creation of the Judicial
Training Institute (JTI) had been a remarkable achievement. This Institute had not been
adequately funded and had to contend with insufficient personnel and material resources. In
order to tackle this issue, the project funded the acquisition of equipment and books journals and
periodicals for the JTI. Similarly, equipment and books were provided to the Commercial/Civil
Division of the High Court. The approval of new procedural rules and the training of the
judiciary and court staff on the new legislation was also a very important part of the project’s


                                                 55
input. The modernization of court rules is bound to have a big positive influence in the working
of courts and in the enhancement of legal certainty.

185. The case clearance rates were calculated based on a study commissioned by FLSTAP,
and are depicted in the graphs below. FLSTAP contributed to this improvement especially
through the revision of Civil Procedures Act in 2010, but also through judicial training and
equipment. In addition to the revision of the Civil Procedures Act in 2010 and its implementation,
the causes for improvements in case clearance rates in 2012 (418% clearance rate), were reported
to include;

    o Substantial Government resources were provided to the Division Commercial though the
      Rapid Results Initiative (RRI) in 2012 where many old cases were reviewed and
      determined.

    o Training of Judges and facilitation of study tours by the FLSTAP had positive effects
      due to possible increase in morale of Judges.

    o The number of Judges placed in Commercial Court was increased in Oct 2011

    o When the Chief Justice picked judges in only picked those with commercial background
      and especially from 2011 to 2012.

    o The clear demarcation may have ensured new cases were filled correctly e.g. land cases
      were not placed in the Commercial Division as it would happen before

    o Strong/functional Bar-Bench committees that meet regularly.

186. And lastly, reference must be made to the project’s financing of a consultancy to carry
out a forensic audit for the judicial financial systems. The forensic audit found a number of
important problems in the management of funds and accountability. This report might be a key in
the future implementation of WB projects. As an example, the new JT project will channel the
funds through a fiduciary placed within the judiciary.

187. The overall valuation of the project is satisfactory. Despite the remaining problems in the
judiciary, the improvements have been considerable: there is a new case management system in
place; a modernization of the equipment has been achieved; a permanent institution for
continuing legal education has been created and training has been provided to judges and court
staff; specialization has increased; very relevant elements of a new legal framework have been
enacted; and financial problems and malfunctions have been identified and remedied for future
projects.

188. Problems have also arisen during the implementation of the project. Implementing
agencies, donors and stakeholders have complained about the communication with the judiciary,
not uncommonly difficult and slow. Although it is unclear, it does not seem to be a problem of
the project, but rather of the idiosyncratic nature of the judiciary. For future projects, a champion
should be identified and dialogue should be frequent in order to streamline procedures. Another
shortcoming would seem to lie with sustainability (maintenance). An example could illustrate. A
bench hotline was set up under the FLSTAP (2007 or 2008). It consisted of judges calling
students to assist them with research, etc. It allegedly worked well, but it was stopped, although,
as stated above, in 2011 the ICR ROSC found that judges needed assistance.

KENYA LAW REFORM COMMISSION [See the Kenya Law Reform Commission above in
Component 6]


                                                 57
NATIONAL COUNCIL OF LAW REPORTING

189. It is not uncommon in African jurisdictions to find a fragmented legal system, where the
new laws coexist with old colonial legislation and with customary rules. This situation, a
problem in Kenya for decades, generates severe legal uncertainty both in market players and
those institutions tasked with the implementation of the law. In this context, the project’s support
of The National Council of Law Reporting (NCLR), which is the institution placed in a better
position to systematize and disseminate the legal framework in place, must be commended. The
NCLR has received extensive financial support from the FLSTAP. The implementing agency has
fully complied with the objectives foreseen and there seems to be consensus in considering it as
one of the most successful components of the legal and judicial part of the FLSTAP.

190. The main objective set by the project was to increase accessibility of up to date legal
information to the public and private sector. In order to achieve this aim, the FLSTAP has funded
the provision of materials for the library used by judges and magistrates; the publication of the
revised version of the Laws of Kenya in book volumes and CD ROM; and the creation and
online publication of the Kenya Treatise Series. These activities have been backed up by new
equipment, training and some specialized capacity building for relevant staff. All operations have
been successfully completed, with special intensity in the years 2012 and 2013.

191. The publication of all the laws of Kenya currently in force and its easy and inexpensive
access by all stakeholders constitutes a great achievement. It is bound to increase legal certainty,
improve the country’s body of jurisprudence and contribute to the general development of the
system of justice in a country where lawyers and courts are poorly regarded by the population.
This component of the project must be valued as highly satisfactory.

UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI

192. Much like in the case of the Kenya School of Law, the University of Nairobi bears the
social responsibility to educate legal professionals. A legal system is built from its foundations.
The knowledge of commercial and financial matters has to be included in the curriculum from
the university level. The more complete the education, the higher the technical level of lawyers
and judges. In line with these ideas, the project focused on the review of the legal curriculum and
the development of specialized education in financial and commercial matters as main objectives.

193. In order to achieve the objectives, the FLSTAP funded the celebration of workshops and
retreats to redesign the curriculum, financed the acquisition of books and legal periodicals,
provided equipment and organized specialized seminars and workshops on commercial and
financial matters. According to the implementing agency, the key element of the project’s
support was the review of the legal curriculum. The enactment of the Constitution in 2010 and
the Government’s Vision 2030 created the need to adapt the legal studies to the new framework.
The FLSTAP funds were geared towards commercial and financial laws, areas where the school
had –admittedly- its weakest side.

194. The implementing agency had an overall positive impression of the project. They
identified a number of areas where there remained room for improvement: there exist an
excessive number of steps between the implementing agency and the PIU; agencies do not have
enough control; the procurement process is slow and delays measures in an unjustified manner.
Looking to future projects, the implementing agency mentioned the establishment of a

                                                58
specialized commercial and financial law centre, which would be linked, inter alia, to the
development of the capacity of lecturers.

195. Overall, given the importance of the result and the small amount of funds used, this
component could be rated as satisfactory.

KENYA SCHOOL OF LAW

196. The Kenya School of law is equivalent to the bar in other Common Law jurisdictions.
Action taken at the University Level (above) had to be complemented with action at the
postgraduate/professional level to be fully effective.

197. As a consequence, the objectives set by the FLSTAP, very much in line with those
described above for the University of Nairobi, were (i) the implementation of a programme of
continuing legal education in commercial and financial law, (ii) building capacity of the faculty
to deliver the specialized courses of the said programme, and (iii) the enhancement of library
facilities and research capabilities to support training in financial and commercial law.

198. The FLSTAP hired 2 consultants to design the CPD (continued legal and professional
education) in the area of financial and commercial law, and sponsored a workshop on the matter
(dissemination). Since 2009, the project supported the organization of courses on secured
transactions, capital markets, treaty making and international state obligations, PPPs, etc. The
FLSTAP also funded the use of resources of the KSL for the training of the State Law office.
Support was also given in the form of TA/capacity building, equipment and the acquisition of
about 250 books.

199. The implementing agency values positively the support given by the project. In their
opinion, the support came in very timely and the programmes that were started with FLSTAP
funds remain in place, so there is stability. Given the opinion of the implementing agency, the
limited amount of funds spent and the importance of the task, this component could be valued as
satisfactory.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The project was a technical assistance project and the Project Appraisal Document did not
include an economic analysis. Therefore, alternative considerations are used to substantiate the
different aspects of project efficiency. This is discussed in Section 3.3 (Efficiency) of the ICR.
