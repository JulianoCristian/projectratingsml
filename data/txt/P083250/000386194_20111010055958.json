development objective of the\n            Financial and Legal Sector Technical Assistance Project, is\n            to create a sound financial system, and a strengthened legal\n            framework and judicial capacity that will ensure broad\n            access to financial, and related legal services. The\n            restructuring covers: a) revision of the Project's\n            Development Objectives (PDO)-level outcome indicators and\n            intermediate-level indicators, which will include\n            replacement and modification of a number of indicators in\n            the project's results framework, but not the PDO, and\n            with no effect on the likelihood of achieving the\n            objectives; b) the second extension of the project's\n            closing date by 18 months, as anticipated in the 3-year plan\n            presented during the first extension request; c) re-\n            allocation of funds from a number of categories to other\n            categories in order to ensure sufficient funds are available\n            in each category of expenditure; and d) an upward revision\n            of the percentage of expenditures to be financed by the\n            International Development Association Credit (IDA) to ensure\n            full funding of committed and anticipated expenditures. The\n            closing date is extended for the second time and for a\n            period of 18 months to March 31, 2013."}, "docdt": "2011-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
