The rational for the proposed\n            reallocation is to facilitate completion of project\n            activities and substantial achievement of development\n            objectives by removing constraints related to the\n            project's co-financing structure reflected in the legal\n            agreement. With Department for International Development\n            (DFID) funds close to being depleted, and the Government of\n            Kenya (GoK's) contribution exhausted, reallocating and\n            increasing the portion financed by the International\n            Development Association (IDA) credit, and increasing the\n            special account ceiling, would allow for the full\n            implementation of ongoing activities that were deemed\n            crucial for the achievement of objectives. This notably\n            includes the finalization of the automation and\n            modernization of supervisory processes of all financial\n            sector supervisors, as well as activities related to the\n            legal sector."}, "docdt": "2013-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
