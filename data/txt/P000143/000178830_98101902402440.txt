POWER PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:        Botswana Power Corporation.
Guarantor:       Republic of Botswana.
Amount:          US$32.5 million, including a capitalized front-end fee.
Terms:           17 years repayment, including 4 years' grace, standard
variable interest rate.
Project
Description:    The Project consists of a 90-MW coal-fired pithead power
plant and related transmission and control facilities to
create an integrated national electric power system for
Botswana. It also includes tariff and organizational
studies, training and coal drilling programs and engineering
consultancy services. The proposed plant's economies of
scale and the substitution of plentiful indigenous coal for
imported petroleum products would lower the cost of
supplying electricity while increasing security of supply
and energy independence and improving Botswana's balance of
payments. The Project would create about 1,200 jobs during
its construction period, and about 120 permanent positions.
Project Risks:   While the Project has no special technical risks, the
dependence of the power company on demand from a few large
mining users makes the Project sensitive to international
market conditions for nickel, copper, and diamonds.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE BOTSWANA POWER CORPORATION
FOR A POWER PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Botswana Power Corporation for the equivalent of US$32.5 million,
including a capitalized front-end fee of 1.5 percent to help finance a Power
Project. The loan would have a term of 17 years, including 4 years of grace,
with a variable interest rate, and would be guaranteed by the Republic of
Botswana. Additional official external financing totalling about US$81.0
million would be provided by the African Development Bank, Arab Bank for
Economic Development in Africa, Commonwealth Development Corporation,
European Investment Bank, and the Kuwait and Saudi Funds. The project would
employ about US$35 million in export credits.
PART I - THE ECONOMY'
2.       Botswana is a landlocked country in Southern Africa, bordered by the
Republic of South Africa, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. With an area of
570,000 sq km and an estimated population of 936,600 (1981)2, it is not
densely populated. Over 80 percent of the population is concentrated along
the relatively fertile eastern third of the country, however, as two thirds
of the country is covered by the Kalahari Desert. Rainfall is erratic and
drought frequent.
3.       Botswana's economy has historically been centered on the livestock
industry, which has been the principal source of income in rural Botswana.
Social institutions have guaranteed access to communal grazing lands and
established cattle ownership as a symbol of status. Manufacturing is
dominated by beef-processing and the use of animal by-products. Although
supported by preferential access to the lucrative European Economic Community
market, the livestock industry has been plagued in recent years by outbreaks
of hoof and mouth disease and both livestock and crop farming have been
periodically devastated by drought.
1The most recent economic memorandum on Botswana (Report No. 3647-BT)
was distributed to the Executive Directors in August 1982.
2This is a preliminary estimate based on the 1981 Population Census.
It is substantially higher than earlier estimates, which are thought to have
underestimated the population.



-2-
4.       The 1970s were a decade of rapid economic growth and budgetary and
balance of payments stability. The mining of diamonds and nickel/copper,
which started in the early 1970s, led to real increases in GDP of 10 percent
a year during the decade. As a result, per capita GNP 3 rose from US$110
in 1970 to about US$910 in 1980. Increased receipts from the Customs
Union, 4  direct taxes and mineral royalties caused recurrent revenue to
rise nearly 33 percent a year, which was substantially in excess of the
growth in recurrent expenditure. Recurrent budgetary surpluses, together
with grants, covered nearly half of the steadily growing capital
expenditures, and since external borrowing exceeded requirements, the
Government became a net creditor of the banking system. The economy has also
shown overall surpluses in the balance of payments, due primarily to the
rapid rise in exports and to large private capital inflows associated with
mining investments. By the end of December 1980, net international reserves
had risen to about US$261 million, equivalent to more than five months
merchandise imports. Inflation was moderate throughout most of the past
decade; however, instability in the world economy caused domestic prices to
increase more rapidly in recent years. The pula was revalued on several
occasions in 1979 and 1980 in an effort to reduce the impact on the domestic
economy of external price increases.
5.       In the second half of 1981, however, the slump in world mineral and
metal prices started to have major repercussions on Botswana's mineral-led,
export-dependent economy. Real GDP growth in 1981 slowed markedly to about 5
percent and both exports and foreign reserves started to fall rapidly as the
large diamond mines began stockpiling part of their production. Receipts
from nickel/copper exports continued to fall, causing the mining company to
call for a third finncial restructuring to avoid an impending f'nancia'
crises and termination of production. 5
6.       Total export receipts in 1981 were 12 percent below the 1980 level,
whereas imports continued to grow. The resulting trade deficit was not
sufficiently covered by inflows on services and capital account and, for the
first time in over a decade, Botswana recorded an overall balance of payments
deficit. Foreign reserves had fallen to about 3-1/2 months of imports by the
end of December 1981.
3 Calculated by the Bank Atlas method.
4 The Southern Africa Customs Union, comprising Botswana, Lesotho,
Swaziland and RSA, is administered by South Africa. Import duties and excise
taxes are levied and collected by South Africa, deposited into a common pool
and then distributed to the members based on each country's share in
production and trade.
5 All parties involved agreed to the restructuring in late June
1982. The Bank's participation in this restructuring was approved by the
Executive Directors on June 21, 1982 on a no objection basis (R82-191).



7.       Similarly, in FY81/82 6  the Government budget registered a large
overall deficit of about P 57 million, or 7 percent of GDP, caused by
continued growth of expenditures but only a very small increase in revenue.
The minimal growth of Customs Union receipts, the single most important
revenue source, and a significant decline in mineral revenues largely explain
the budgetary deterioration. The deficit was financed partly by external
borrowing and partly by running down government cash balances at the Bank of
Botswana.
8.       The current year is likely to be a year of very low growth and
further budgetary and balance of payments deficits. No immediate recovery of
the diamond market is foreseen and stockpiling of a significant portion of
Botswana's output will continue. This includes part of the additional output
from the new (third) diamond mine at Jwaneng, which started operations in
early 1982. To cope with the current economic strain, the Government has
adopted several measures in recent months designed to control the growth of
aggregate demand. Interest rates have been raised several times since
mid-1981, a general wage freeze was imposed in early 1982 on public sector
salaries, the pula was devalued by 10 percent in May 1982 and the 1982/83
budget, which originally proposed an overall deficit of P 77 million, is
likely to be cut by at least 20 percent. Furthermore, the Government is
currently preparing for a mid-term review of its Fifth National Development
Plan, 1979-1985, which was prepared at a time of brighter macro-economic
prospects, and wherein expanding production and exports from the new mine at
Jwaneng were expected to continue fueling rapid overall growth (about 10
percent a year) and to maintain strong balance of payments and public finance
positions. The planned review will pay particular attention to the fiscal
and balance of payments implications of the current recession and the size
and composition of the public investment program during the remaining years
of the Plan.
9.       Despite very rapid growth during the 1970s, Botswana s economy is
still at an early stage of development, and this is currently being
highlighted in the rapid deterioration in overall economic performance. The
mineral-led development has not encouraged the building up of linkages within
the economy and only modestly increased the number of employment
opportunities for Botswana's labor force. Traditional agriculture,
particularly cattle raising, has remained the main economic activity for
about 80 percent of the population. However, an increasing concentration of
cattle ownership, resulting, inter alia, from widespread drought-related
cattle deaths which affected mainly small herd owners, has reduced the
options for about 50 percent of the population to make a reasonable living
from agriculture alone.
10.      The major challenge for the Government in the present decade is,
therefore, to provide the infrastructure and services required by the more
labor-intensive productive sectors to foster linkages and to create lasting
6 April 1, 1981 - March 30, 1982.



- 4 -
employment opportunities for Botswana's labor force, which is growing at over
3 percent a year. 7 These sectors, however, face formidable constraints,
and diversifying the economy's productive base and generating a sufficient
number of attractive work opportunities will not be an easy task.
11.      One of the most serious constraints on growth of the productive
sectors is the severe shortage of skilled technical, managerial and profes-
sional manpower, which greatly impairs the country's absorptive capacity,
encourages the use of capital intensive technology, raises production costs,
and stifles investment. A high proportion of skilled and professional
positions are filled by expatriates and many posts in Government and the
private sector are inadequately staffed. The manufacturing sector is further
constrained by the small domestic market, the country's limited raw materials
base and landlocked position, and competition from South Africa and Zimbabwe.
12.      It is the agricultural sector that is looked upon as the main source
for employment. However, at present productivity in agriculture is very low.
Crop farming is circumscribed by the limited availability of suitable land,
by sparse and erratic rainfall, by lack of draught power and by low farm-gate
prices. Appropriate policy changes are needed to help overcome some of these
constraints and enhance production and employment. Nevertheless, the
sector's ability to support additional labor may always remain limited as
ecological conditions render most parts of the country more favorable to
livestock than crop production. Cattle raising, however, does not require
high labor inputs.  Moreover, the system of communal grazing, the traditional
values associated with cattle and the granting of substantial subsidies to
cattle owners, have given rise to overstocking and progressive land
degradation. If sustained, this trend could further reduce the sector's
growth and employment opportunities.
13.      The Government is moving ahead with programs to deal with these
constraints. The Fifth National Development Plan accords high priority to
education, with emphasis on primary education, as a means of alleviating the
country-s manpower constraint. Industry is being supported through
promotional activities by the Botswana Development Corporation and through
the provision of tax breaks, preference in bidding for government contracts,
favorable interest rates, seed capital for investors, and payroll and train-
ing grants. A Tribal Grazing Lands Program (TGLP), with the primary aim of
controlling overstocking and range degradation, while at the same time
increasing incomes from cattle raising by improving herd quality, enhancing
range management and boosting operating efficiency, has been underway since
1975. An Arable Lands Development Program (ALDEP), a multi-faceted program
designed to raise productivity in crop farming, was introduced in 1979. Both
ALDEP and TGLP are expected to permit more labor intensive use of the land.
However, TGLP has not yet been successful in rationalizing government
7 Reductions in employment opportunities for Batswana in RSA may
compound the problem.



investment and pricing policies in the livestock industry and has focused
largely on commercial ranching much to the neglect of improving the
productivity of cattle smallholders. The ALDEP program is just getting
started. Efforts to identify labor-intensive investments will have to
continue, however, if the country is to avoid serious unemployment and
maintain stable growth.
14.      Multi- and bilateral agencies have extended substantial assistance
to Botswana on highly concessional terms. The Bank Group has been the main
multilateral source, but the EEC, the African Development Bank and OPEC
sources have also been active. Bilateral assistance has come from several
sources. In 1978, almost two-thirds of Botswana's outstanding bilateral debt
was converted into grants. At the end of 1981, total external debt
outstanding and disbursed amounted to US$164.4 million, debt service payments
were US$8.8 million and the debt service ratio 0.9 percent. Botswana's
future external capital requirements will depend heavily on the evolution of
the world mineral market and the outlook for diamonds in particular. While
Botswana is expected to continue to receive substantial assistance from
bilateral and multilateral sources on grant or concessional terms, these may
have to be supplemented by loans from commercial sources should current
account deficits continue to rise. However, diamond exports are expected to
recover within the near future and Botswana should remain creditworthy for
the required borrowing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BOTSWANA
15.      The Bank Group began operations in what was then Bechuanaland in
1964, and has approved six credits (US$14.7 million) and twelve loans
(US$142.7 million, including US$43.5 million on Third Window terms) for a
total of US$157.4 million (net of cancellations). These loans and credits
have financed five roads projects, three education projects, two livestock
projects, two urban projects, two water supply projects and one development
finance corporation project. Two loans and one engineering credit have been
made to finance part of an infrastructure project consisting of power, water,
transport and township facilities constructed between 1971 and 1974 to
support the Shashe nickel/copper mining development. The Bank loans helped
to finance township, water and transportation facilities and engineering
studies as well as interest during construction on the Bank Loan.
Co-financing was provided by the Canadian International Development Agency
and USAID. IFC has had one investment in Botswana, a US$370,000 equity
participation in the Botswana Development Corporation, approved in March
1979. Summary statements of Bank Group Operations in Botswana are provided
in Annex II. The Bank aims to continue assisting Botswana with education,
water supply and DFC projects and is developing a project in Population,
Health and Nutrition.
16.      The Bank Group's share of Botswana-s external debt (disbursed and
outstanding) at the end of 1981 was about 45 percent (IBRD - 36 percent, IDA
- 9 percent), and its share in debt service was about 69 percent.



- 6 -
17.      Botswana's project planning and execution have been good.  Bank
Group-assisted projects have encountered relatively few problems, with the
exception of the two livestock projects (Credit 325-BT and Loan 1497-BT).
While the first project has been completed, and the credit closed, many of
its original objectives were not reached: most of the ranches developed
under the project continue to be overstocked and poorly managed, the control
and use of water resources remains inadequate, and extension services have
been unable to improve inefficient traditional stocking patterns. The second
project, while successful in improving livestock marketing systems by
upgrading trek routes, holding areas and railway sidings, has not yet been
successful in raising offtake rates and increasing beef production, or in
alleviating overstocking and range degradation. The Government is pursuing
proposals to alleviate these problems.
18.      Another project with which the Bank has been associated, the ShashE
Nickel/Copper Mining Complex, has also faced severe problems, although the
infrastructure works partially financed with the Bank loans (US$37.5 millior.
Loans 776-BT and 776-2-BT) were completed on schedule in 1976. The overall
mining project, however, has faced persistent problems that have forced thrce
restructurings of its financial base the latest of which was approved by thE.
Executive Directors in June 1982 (R82-191). This restructuring, brought on
by low metals prices resulting from the international economic slowdown of
recent years, is designed to reduce the mining company's debt burden by
continuing deferrals of interest and principal payments and converting a
large proportion of senior debt to subordinated debt. In addition, existing
subordinated debt is converted to preference shares. The restructuring also
provides for injections of working capital to tide the mining firm over unti.l
metals prices improve.
Disbursements
19.      Botswana's overall disbursement performance has been quite good,
though it was weakened in recent years because of difficulties in moving
funds under the Livestock II and DFC projects and delays in effectiveness oil
Urban II. Over the 1970-80 decade, the disbursement profile for the nine
loans in that period show that 89 percent of the funds committed were
disbursed within five years after loan effectiveness. Corresponding figure:;
for the Eastern Africa Region and the Bank as a whole are 78 and 76 percent,
respectively.
PART III - THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources and Requirements
20.      Botswana is rich in mineral resources, including large deposits of
coal, but has no hydroelectric or known geothermal potential. Firewood
resources, which were once plentiful, are fast being depleted through heavy
use, particularly by rural inhabitants. Both solar and wind energy are being



experimented with and used on a small scale, and there are indications of oil
deposits in southwestern Botswana on which seismic exploration is expected to
begin in the near future.
21.      The country s recoverable coal resources are estimated at 17 billion
tons, about 9.5 billion tons of oil equivalent (t.o.e.). Some 10 billion
tons (60 percent) of these are located in two major deposits, at Morupule and
Mmamabula. The Morupule deposits are well known, having been exploited for
domestic use by Morupule Colliery (a subsidiary of Anglo American
Corporation) since 1973. Later this year, Shell Coal International will
begin a detailed study of the feasibility of exporting coal from the Serowe
deposits, which are in the same coal fields as the Morupule deposits.
Exports are expected to reach 5 million tons p.a. in the first phase of this
project, using South African ports, and increase to 10-15 million tons p.a.
in the second phase, using a port to be constructed near Walvis Bay on the
western coast of Africa. This latter phase would require construction of a
railroad across the Kalahari Desert in Botswana and across Namibia.
22.      Energy consumption in 1980 is estimated at 754,000 t.o.e. (including
losses); of which firewood supplies 51 percent, oil products 20 percent and
coal 29 percent. All of the oil products consumed and a small amount of coal
were imported from South Africa. Most of the coal and oil consumed were used
to produce electricity for use in industry, with the mining industry the
major consumer. A high proportion of the oil used in generating electricity
was consumed by diesel plants owned and operated by the mining firms
themselves. Although the demand for electricity grew rapidly during the past
decade as the mining industry expanded, installed generating capacity
generally kept up with demand. In 1981, an interconnection with South
Africa's grid was completed to provide interim power supply while additional
capacity is being constructed. Most (70 percent) of the growth in energy
demand during the present decade is expected to come from the mining sector
and take the form of demand for electricity.
Energy Development Objectives and Strategy
23.      Although no detailed energy master plan has yet been prepared, the
Botswana Government has established the objective of substituting, to the
maximum extent possible, the use of indigenous energy resources for imported
oil. Achievement of this objective would significantly lower the cost of
energy to the nation and reduce the drain on the balance of payments. The
strategy being pursued to reach this goal is to develop an integrated power
system covering the entire country based on the use of abundant domestic coal
resources.  Other objectives established by the Government are those of
conserving on domestic forest resources and preventing denuding and
consequent erosion of the land. These objectives are being sought through
the design of fuel-efficient wood burning stoves and the development of
commercial woodlots to supply the country's firewood needs. Although some
progress has been made in setting objectives, energy planning in Botswana is
at an early stage of development



-8-
The Power Sector and BPC
24.      The total consumption of electrical energy in Botswana for FY81 was
393 GWh, or about 480 kWh per capita. This is among the highest per capita
consumption levels in the Eastern Africa region. The Government has given
high priority to industrial and urban electrification for many years, and byr
1981 some 97,000 persons, or 11 percent of the population, had access to
electricity. The Botswana Power Corporation (BPC) supplies about 95 perceni:
of the country's requirements, with the rest generated by self-producers. 3.n
the past 10 years, BPC's sales of electricity increased at an average annua:.
rate of 44 percent, representing mainly growth in mining industry loads.
However, non-mining industry sales also grew rapidly, averaging 23 percent
per annum growth during this same period. Over the remainder of the preseni:
decade, BPC's sales are expected to increase by 12 percent per annum, part of
which will result from the replacement of existing self-producer supplies.
25.      The Botswana Power Corporation was established in 1970 as the
country's sole public sector generator and distributor of electricity. BPC
is Government-owned and managed by a competent chief executive officer.  Its
Board acts with complete freedom on policy maters, although government
approval is needed for tariff changes. BPC has a competent staff. However,
the country's shortage of professional manpower (para. 11) has limited the
localization of upper level jobs, despite extensive training programs.
Consequently, most of BPC's managerial and top-level technical staff is sti:l
foreign. Trained Batswana to fill these positions are not expected to be
available until the end of this decade. BPC's training program would be
continued under this Project.
26.      BPC historically has operated two separate power facilities, the
Southern and Northern Divisions. The smaller Southern Division (25 MW
installed capacity) serves Gaborone, the capital, and surrounding towns;
while the Northern Division (63 MW installed capacity) serves Selebi-Phikwe
and surrounding towns, where the main consumer - BCL's nickel/copper mining
operation - accounts for 86 percent of the electricity sold by the Division.
Of BPC's total generating capacity, 76 MW is generated by coal-fired steam
power plants and the remainder by diesel plants. Under the propsed project,
these systems will be interconnected and their management and accounting
systems consolidated.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background and Objectives
27.      The project, prepared by BPC with the assistance of consultants,
would provide for Botswana's power needs through FY88 and would develop
indigenous energy resources to substitute for high-cost imported oil in the
generation of electricity. The project was appraised by the Bank in
August/September 1981. Negotiations were held during the week of July 26-30),



- 9 -
1982 in Washington, with a Botswana Delegation led by Messrs. B. Gaolathe,
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, and
Mr. E.D. Bell, Chief Executive Officer of BPC.  Project objectives are to:
(i) satisfy Botswana's forecast demand for power through FY88 at least cost
by tapping the country's large coal potential; (ii) improve operations and
security of the country's power system through integrating the Northern and
Southern Divisions, constructing a new control center, reorganizing BPC's
operations to meet the demands of the integrated system and providing related
training; and (iii) improve BPC's tariff policy. The power plant would be
built adjacent to an existing coal mine, and amendment of the existing coal
supply agreement between BPC and Morupule Colliery, obligating the latter to
produce 600,000 tons of coal per annum and to supply sufficient coal to the
power plant for the first three years of operation, would be a condition of
effectiveness of the Bank loan (Section 7.01(c) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Project Description
28.      The project comprises:
(a) construction of a coal-fired pithead power plant with three
30-MW steam units and a 50-km water pipeline;
(b) construction of about 385 km of 220 and 132 kV of power
transmission lines and associated substations;
(c) construction of a system control center;
(d) tariff and reorganization studies, coal drilling and training
programs; and
(e) provision of engineering consultancy services.
The project is expected to be completed and the power plant in operation by
June 1986. BPC expects to begin construction in that year a second phase of
the power plant, now estimated at a further 90-MW capacity, at the same site
to meet the country's needs after FY88.
Physical Facilities
29.      The power plant will be located at Morupule, adjacent to the
existing coal mine. It will consist of three 30-MW steam turbo generator
units, three 150 ton/hour capacity pulverized coal-fired boilers, plant
auxiliaries, a 220-kV switchyard, coal and water storage facilities, a
material and spare part storage house and an administration building. The
plant will be based on the dry cooling system to minimize the use of water.
A 50-km pipeline will be constructed to convey water to the plant from a
proposed well-field near Mabeleapodi. The 220-kV transmission lines will
connect the power plant to BPC's Northern and Southern Divisions, thereby
integrating the entire system into a national power grid. The control
center, to be constructed, will be needed for load dispatching, switching,
frequency and voltage regulations, etc.

Tariff and Reorganization Studies and Training Program
30.      BPC has agreed to revalue its fixed assets yearly on the basis of a
method acceptable to the Bank (Section 5.05 of the draft Loan Agreement) and
to set tariffs at a level: (i) to yield in FY84 and onwards an annual return
of not less than 8 percent of average net assets in operation, and (ii) to
generate for its Fiscal Years 82 through 87 funds from internal sources
equivalent to not less than 20 percent of its aggregate capital expenditures
(Section 5.04 (a) of the draft Loan Agreement). A study of the adequacy of
BPC's tariff structure will be carried out as part of the Project.
31.      One factor constraining the power corporation's ability to generate
revenues through tariffs is a 25-year agreement it entered into in 1972 with
BCL (the Shashe nickel/copper mining Company) that requires it to furnish the
mining firm with up to 45-MW of power at tariffs generating an 8 percent rats
of return on its capital investment in the 60-MW Power Plant, amortized on a
Sinking-fund basis over 25 years, and revalued to reflect changes in the
foreign currencies (Canadian Dollars) spent in building the facilities. Thi3
arrangement was based on the assumption that power for the Shashe mine would
be supplied from the plant, with the expectation that cash requirements for
future development would be minimal. Tariffs charged the mining complex for
its first 45-MW of power will have to be based on a lower rate of return than
that for BPC's overall system. This is not expected to seriously constrain
BPC's financial performance, however, since the growth of demand from other
users is rapidly eroding the nickel-copper mine's position as the dominant
source of electrlelty demand. The proDortion of BPC's revenues attributable
to the Shashe mining complex has alredy dropped from 62 percent in 1977 to 50
percent in 1981, and is expected to be only 12 percent in 1990.
32.      The establishment of an integrated national electricity generation
and transmission network to replace BPC's separately operated Northern and
Southern Divisions will require significant changes in the utility's
management, accounting, and organizational structure. BPC will carry out a
study of its organizational structure and management functions as a part of
the Project. The changes required in BPC's organizational structure,
management, etc. as well as the introduction of new equipment for controlling
the integrated power sytem will necessitate new expertise on the part of the
utility's manpower. Consequently, by June 30, 1983, BPC will prepare and
furnish to the Bank for its approval a training program to meet these needs
(Section 3.06 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Coal Drilling Program
33.      Proven coal reserves at the Morupule Colliery are sufficient to
supply the new power plants' needs until 1988. By that time, additional coal
reserves will have to be proved out to firmly establish reserves for
subsequent years. The Botswana Government has recently signed a contract
with Shell Coal for a full feasibility study of possible exploitation for
export of coal from the Serowe Deposits, which are the same coal field. This
contract, inter alia, obligates Shell to undertake an extensive drilling



program to determine the exact locatton of the mine and the method of
mining. If the export of coal from Serowe is feasible, a large amount of
middlings will be produced as a by-product. These middlings would be a very
low cost source of coal for the Morupule Power Plant and would reduce the
cost of generating electricity at the plant. Moreover, use of these
middlings by the plant would substantially reduce the problem and cost of
disposing of this waste product. The boilers used in the plant will be
designed to use these middlings. Should it turn out that the exploitation of
the Serowe deposits for export would not be feasible, the Government would
carry out a drilling program under the Project to prove out additional
reserves on a site adjacent to the existing coal mine. By December 31, 1984,
or such other date as the Bank may agree, the Government and the Bank would
agree whether the drilling program in the Serowe area had established
sufficient coal resources to meet BPC's future needs (Section 3.02 of the
draft Guarantee Agreement).
Costs and Financing
34.      Project cost, without duties (US$15.4 million), interest during
construction (US$33.5 million), and the Bank's US$0.5 million front-end fee
is estimated at US$199.8 million, of which US$158.1 million (79 percent)
would be foreign exchange. The total financing requirement, including
duties, interest during construction, and the Bank's front-end fee is
estimated at US$249.2 million. The base costs are expressed in January 1982
prices, and physical contingencies ranging from 8 to 15 percent for different
project components have been added. Price contingencies assume foreign cost
rises of 8.5 percent in FY83, 7.5 percent in each of the next three years,
and 6 percent thereafter. For local costs, escalation has been assumed at 12
percent in FY83 and FY84, and 10 percent thereafter.
35.      Official external financing totalling US$113.4 million (46 percent
of total financing required and 61 percent of foreign exchange cost) would be
provided by the Bank (US$32.5 million) and six other lenders: the African
Development Bank (US$22.7 million); the Arab Bank for Economic Development in
Africa (US$10.0 million); the Commonwealth Development Corporation (US$12.5
million); the European Investment Bank (US$15.5 million); the Kuwait Fund
(US$10.0 million), and the Saudi Fund (US$10.2 million). The Government and
BPC will provide an additional US$101.0 million. This would consist of loans
and other funds from Government totalling US$59.6 million to cover the
foreign exchange costs of civil works and water supply contracts, duties, and
interest during construction and internal cash generation from BPC of US$41.4
million.  The remaining financing (US$34.8 million, or 14 percent of total
project cost) would be in the form of export credits.8 Government and BPC's
8Export credit agencies and commercial banks in several countries
have expressed interest in providing financing for various project
components, should firms from their countries win bids for project
components. The countries include Canada, United States, France, Federal
Republic of Germany, Japan, Sweden, and Norway. The need for export credit
finance would be reduced by a US$10 million equivalent grant from FRG
(through KfW) if the builder contract were awarded to an FRG supplier.



- 12 -
meeting the conditions of effectiveness of the other project loans and making
final arrangements for the export credit financing required will be
conditions of effectiveness of the proposed Bank Loan (Section 7.01 of the
Loan Agreement).
36.      The Bank's loan of US$32.5 million (including a capitalized
front-end fee of US$0.5 million) would finance civil works, equipment
studies, and training. Almost all financing will be in parallel, however,
the European Investment Bank loan and export credit financing may be used
jointly for the boiler contract. The conditions of other direct official
project financing available to BPC vary from 15 to 18 years terms, with
interest rates from 8 percent to 11.6 percent, and grace periods from 3.5 to
4 years. The Government loan to BPC will carry an interest rate of 10
percent over 25 years, including four years  grace.
Project Execution
37.      The Botswana Power Corporation will carry out the project (except
for the coal drilling program), assisted by enginering consultants whose
qualifications, experience, and employment terms are satisfactory to the Bank
(Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement). These consultants (Kennedy and
Donkin; Watermeyer, Legge, Piesold and Uhlmann; both of the UK) prepared the
project feasibility study and have been contracted to prepare bid documents,
evaluate bids, and supervise construction. The project is expected to
require about 1800 man-months of engineering consulting services costing
about US$9.9 million, or about US$6,800 a man-month, including salaries,
travel, subsistence and contingencies. About 32 man-months of additional
consulting services -- costing US$300,000 or US$9,500 a man-month -- are
expected to be needed for studies connected with the project. The Government
will finance and carry out the coal drilling program, if needed (Section 3.03
of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
38.      Final engineering designs for the project were completed in December
1981, and contracts for water supply and site preparation were awarded in
March 1982. These contracts are being financed by BPC and the Government.
Bid documents for the main civil, mechanical, and electrical project works
were issued in May 1982 and closed in September; the main civil works
contract is expected to be awarded and construction to begin in December
1982.
39.     BPC has experience in building coal-fired generating plants and
transmission and distribution facilities. It has an established construction
supervision unit, headed by an experienced Project Manager, that, with the
assistance of consultants, is competent to implement the project.
Procurement and Disbursement
40.      The Bank loan of US$32.5 million would help finance equipment
costing US$24 million and buildings and other civil works costing US$37
million, both figures including contingencies. These contracts would be
grouped into appropriate packages and let by international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines. Miscellaneous



- 13 -
smaller equipment items in packages of less than US$100,000 (expected to
total about US$500,000), and minor civil works unlikely to attract foreign
bidders will be procured by local competitive bidding procedures open to
foreign bidders. These procedures have been examined and found to be
satisfactory to the Bank. Bank-financed procurement for packages of more
than US$1.5 million -- an estimated 85 percent of procurement -- will be
reviewed by the Bank before contracts are awarded; the remainder will be
reviewed after award on a random basis. Procurement on contracts financed in
parallel by other financers will be in accordance with their guidelines.
41.      Bank funds will be disbursed against the full foreign costs of
equipment, studies and training, and 60 percent of the cost of civil works.
Disbursement is expected to be completed by June 30, 1987, the project
closing date.
Monitoring and Evaluation
42.      Access to the reports and records needed to monitor project
progress during implementation were agreed upon during negotiations and
project monitoring guidelines have been established. BPC will submit a
completion report based on an agreed outline within six months of project
completion (Section 3.04 (e) of the draft Loan Agreement).
BPC's Finances
43.      While BPC's technical and financial management is good, its
financial performance has been only moderate. This has been the result, in
part, of its being locked into a long-term supply contract with BCL, which
does not recover from BCL an adequate coverage on the current value of that
portion of BPC's assets used to supply the mining operation (para. 31).
44.      Another factor contributing to BPC's moderate financial performance
has been the high cost of generating power in the Southern Division using
small diesel units. Despite significant increases in tariffs, revenues have
barely covered operating expenses of these units. When the proposed power
plant comes on line, these units will be retired from service. In 1979, the
Government assisted the Southern Division of BPC by converting US$8.5 million
of debt into equity, and since then, the Division has had small yearly
operating surpluses. BPC was able to earn a rate of return in recent years
on the historical cost of its assets of 8.6 percent and 8.2 percent,
respectively, in fiscal years 1980 and 1981.  Its return based on assets
valued at replacement cost was marginally negative in 1981, however.
45.      The proposed project is expected to be a major factor in turning
around BPC's marginal financial performance. Also, this would be due largely
to the strong growth in sales projected for the remainder of this decade. By
substituting an interconnected electricity generation and distribution
network based on low-cost indigenous coal supplies, the project would allow
economies of scale that are expected to significantly reduce BPC's unit
generating costs. The new system, with its increased capacity, would also



- 14 -
enable several major industrial users that now must generate their own power
to connect into the BPC grid, thus reducing the utility's present dependence
on BCL as a major source of demand. The Bank's financial projections show
that, on the basis of anticipated loads, BPC should be able to earn an 8
percent, or better, rate of return on revalued assets from FY84 to FY87 while
keeping average tariffs essentially unchanged in real terms.
46.      The utility's present financial position is satisfactory.  At March
31, 1981, it had total assets of US$86.4 million, including net fixed assets
at estimated replacement cost of US$83.8 million, a current ratio of 1.3 and
a debt/equity ratio of 36/64. Accumulated earnings for investment were
minimal, however. Outstanding loans, mainly from the Government totalled
US$31.3 million. BPC's accounting records are well maintained, expenditures
carefully planned, and close attention is given to future cash needs. Annual
external audits have been of a good standard. Under the proposed project,
BPC will have its accounts audited by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank and will submit audited financial statements to the Bank within five
months after the close of each fiscal year (Section 5.02 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
47.      During 1982-87, BPC expects to finance at least US$85 million from
internal cash generation towards its capital spending program, which is
expected to total US$416 million. As a first step towards this objective,
the utility raised tariffs (other than those to BCL, see para. 31) 15 percent
on April 1, 1982. To meet its goal of generating 20 percent of its capital
needs, it is expected that further tariff increases of 12 percent in fiscal
years 1984-85, and 10 percent in the next two years, will be needed. These
increases are roughly in line with anticipated inflation.
48.      BPC's future financial performance should be good.  Revenues are
expected to increase more than sevenfold between its fiscal years 1982 and
1990, while expenses increase fourfold. Net income is expected to grow
enough to enable the utility to contribute substantially to its capital
expansion program. To protect the utility's financial viability, BPC has
agreed not to incur future long-term debt, without the Bank's consent, unless
net income before interest and depreciation is at leat 1.4 times future debt
service, including proposed new borrowing (Section 5.06 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
49.      The proposed project would be the first step in the least-cost
program for meeting Botswana's power needs to the year 2000. Further steps
in the program include the construction of a further 320 km of transmission
lines and three additional 30 MW units at Moropule. BPC's consultants have
analyzed this program against alternative combinations of domestic generaticn
and imports from neighboring South Africa. Since this analysis assumed that
the cost of imported electricity would remain constant, any increases in
South Africa's tariffs -- which have already risen 21 percent in nominal
terms, while the cost of the proposed project was reduced by 6 percent --
would make the proposed project even more attractive.



- 15 -
50.      The project's economic rate of return, calculated over a 30-year
useful life after its four-year construction period, is estimated at 18
percent. Its benefits are measured in terms of incremental revenues, with
its costs including capital, operating and maintenance costs. Additional
benefits including consumer surpluses and foreign exchange savings from not
having to import oil to generate electricity are excluded from this
calculation. In addition, the project would provide for the creation of
about 1,200 jobs during the construction period and about 120 permanent jobs
thereafter, and increased energy security and independence for Botswana. The
creation of a unified, integrated power system will increase operating
efficiency, as will the improved managerial and technical performance brought
about by the reorganization and the training programs. Improvement in the
tariff structure should better BPC's pricing policy and provide for equity
among power consumers.
51.      The project has no foreseeable technical risks and BPC and its
consultants have the experience and qualifications to carry it out
successfully. The history of financial problems experienced by BPC's largest
customer -- the Shashe Nickel/Copper Mine (para. 18) -- and the present
downturn in the world diamond market have, however, made the utility very
aware of the importance of the appropriateness of its demand forecasts. BPC
and its consultants have, therefore, calculated the effects that lower than
expected mining demand would have on the project's rate of return. These
calculations show that either a full shutdown of the nickel/copper mine, or a
cessation of diamond mining would still result in an economic rate of return
for the project of about 15 percent. Should the copper/nickel mine close
completely. demand for power by the diamond industry would have to drop to 58
percent of its forecast level before the economic rate of return would fall
to 10 percent. Such a scenario is extremely unlikely, and the project, thus,
faces relatively small demand-side risks.
Ecology
52.      The project is not expected to be detrimental to Botswana's
ecology. The proposed power station, even including its expected second
90-MW stage, is relatively small and situated far from populous or
agricultural areas. Consultants have reviewed its ecological impact in the
context of Botswana's 1971 atmospheric pollution law and found its design
adequate to maintain emissions within acceptable limits as set by both
Botswana and the Bank guidelines. These findings will be checked during the
final design stage, and any necessary adjustments made. The dry cooling
system chosen for the power plant's boilers will minimize water usage, and
liquid-borne effluents will be drained into impermeable evaporating pans to
prevent ground water pollution.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.      The Draft Loan Agreement between the Botswana Power Corporation and
the Bank, the Draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Botswana and
the Bank, and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank are being
distributed to the Executive Directors, separately.
54.      Government and BPC's meeting the conditions of effectiveness of the
other project loans, including the loan from Government to BPC, making final
arrangements for the provision of other external financing and entering into
a coal supply agreement covering the first three years of the power plant's
operations will be special conditions of effectiveness for the proposed Bank
loan (Section 7.01 of the draft Loan Agreement).
55.      Certain provisions of the loan and guarantee agreements for the
proposed project are inconsistent with certain provisions of the March 15,
1978 Amended Loan Agreement for the Shashe Project (776-BT). Provision has
been made for suspension of the inconsistent provisions in the earlier
agreements. These provisions deal with accounting, auditing, the debt
limitation and the rate of return (Sections 4.01 (c), 4.02 (d), 4.10 and
4.12, respectively, of the amended Shashe Loan Agreement). This has been
agreed with the Government and the other interested parties have been
notified (Section 4.01 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
56.      Special Conditions of the loan are listed in Section III of Annex
III of this report.
57.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
58.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
AS OF MAY 31, 1982
Loan No. 1174-BT      Third Road Project, US$5.8 Million Loan of November 21,
1975; Effectiveness Date: January 12, 1976;
Closing Date: August 31, 1982
The project was amended in 1978 to include additional components to
utilize surplus funds. The Gaborone-Molepolole Road was completed satisfac-
torily in 1979 and only implementation of the District Roads Maintenance Pilat
Program remains to be finished. Project completion is expected to be one yeir
behind schedule because of a delay in recruiting technical assistance staff
with appropriate expertise to implement the pilot program.
Loan No. 1408-BT      Fourth Road Project; US$420.0 Million Loan of May 20,
1977; Effectiveness Date: August 18, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The project was amended in 1978 to use savings to pave an additional
17 km of roadway. The construction and studies components are proceeding on
schedule.
Loan No. 1497-BT      Second Livestock Project; US$6.5 Million Loan of December
30, 1977; Effectiveness Date: November 27, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983
The project is being intensively reviewed by the Bank and Government
in the light of poor performance in increasing cattle production and offtake
and reversing overgrazing trends through the establishment of commercial
ranches and communal grazing areas. Preliminary findings suggest that the
project was based on insufficient understanding of the economic and social
implications of the Government's Tribal Grazing Lands Policy, which it was
designed to support. Measures to improve livestock marketing by upgrading
trek routes, railway sidings and holding areas are, however, proceeding
extremely well.
Loan No. 1584-BT      Second Urban Project; US$8.0 Million Loan of September
11, 1978; Effectiveness Date: June 20, 1979; Closing
Date: December 31, 1982
Implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. Site improvements have
begun while legislation enabling town councils to recover service levies is
improving the cost recovery picture.

Implementation is proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1828-BT      Second Education Project;  US$10.0 Million of April 16,
1980; Effectiveness Date: June 13, 1980;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985
Implementation is proceeding satisfactorily.
