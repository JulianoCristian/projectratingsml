coal-fired pithead power plant and related transmission and\n            control facilities to create an integrated national electric\n            power system for Botswana. It also includes tariff and\n            organizational studies, training and coal drilling programs\n            and engineering consultancy services. The proposed\n            plan's economies of scale and the substitution of\n            plentiful indigenous coal for imported petroleum products\n            would lower the cost of supplying electricity while\n            increasing security of supply and energy independence and\n            improving Botswana's balance of payments. The project\n            would create about 1,200 jobs during its construction\n            period, and about 120 permanent positions. A map is included."}, "docdt": "1982-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
