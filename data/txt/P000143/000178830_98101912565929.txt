I. THE ENERGY AND POWIER SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01         Botswana is rich in mineral resources,  including major coal
fields.    Of  the  few which have  been ex:lored,  Morupule  and Mmamabula
contain about 10 billion tons of recoverable resources out of 17 billion in
the country (equivalent to some 9.5 billior tons of oil equivalent (toe)).
Firewood is the major energy source for domestic use, particularly in the
rural areas.  No hydroelectric or known geothermal potential exists in the
country, but there are indications of possible oil deposits in the south-
western area and ESSO is expected to start a program of seismic exploration
in the area shortly.
_Renewable Energy
1.02       Firewood is the major source of domestic energy in Botswana and
methods of conserving and reducing the depletion of firewood resources
through the improved design of wood stoves, and the establishment of
managed commercial wood lots are being investigated.   The first of such
lots will shortly be established on a small scale at the new township of
Jwaneng.   otner torms ot renewable energy are already being utilizea on a
small scale, through the use of solar energy tor some domestic purposes and
windmill power for limited water pumping applications.   The Government of
Botswana, for example, through specifying solar heating for its housing and
ottler programs, is encouraging the use of solar energy, but any significant
utilization is limited by the present high cost of the existing
technology.  Further major substitution of wind pumping for diesel pumping
is also inhibited by technology problems and by sketchy data on wind
characteristics at appropriate heights above ground level.  The Government
is starting a program to measure the velocities, at these heights,
initially in the Eastern regions, and is also investigating the potential
of the improved designs of windmills, necessary to meet the water pumping
needs  of  the  relatively  deep  wells  in  Botswana.    Other  small  scale
investigations in progress include possible methods of using producer gas
or, at cattle stations, biogas as a substitute for diesel engines.    A
small-scale project financed by USAID and the Government is also due to
start in 1982 to pursue the study, implementation and uses of renewable
energy.
Energy Balance 1980
1.03       The Ministry of Mineral Resources and Water Affairs (MMRWA) has
estimated the 1980 energy usage in Botswana to be of the order of 627,000
toe.1/  This comprised 84,000 toe coal, 116,000 toe oil products, 43,000
toe electricity,2/ 2,000 toe liquic petroleum gas, and an estimated
382,000 toe firewood (a very approximate estimation of the consumption of
firewood in ±iotswana).   Soiue 127,000 toe <3520 of tthe total 1980 coal and
oil supply) were estimated to be lost during conversion into electrical

Sources of Energy held in Nairobi, Kenya in August 1981.

energy. No energy has been exported to date and 79% of all local energy
consumption was provided from coal and firewood.  Coal is essentially used
for electricity production for industry and, except in the towns, firewood
is mainly used for domestic fuel.  The remaining 21% of the energy used in
1980 was i. ported under the regulation of the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry (MCI), almost entirely in the form of refined oil products from
the Republic of South Africa (RSA).  Details of energy consumption in 1980
are as follows:

Energy Prices
1.04      The cost of oil products are controlled throughout the country by
the MCI at prices based on the imported cost plus transportation and a
marginal excise levy.   Within the Botswana Power Corporation (BPC),  the
average domestic electricity tariff in its Southern Division (12.17 th/kWh)



- 3 -
is higher than that of the Northern (Shashe) Division) (9.6 th/kWh) because
of the relative higher cost of generation tby smaller size units fired by
oil (9%) or by coal (91%) (para. 1.12). However, the overall average price
(3.24 th/kWh) in the Northern Division will continue to be dominated by the
large proportion of electricity supplied to the copper-nickel mine, BCL
(formerly Bamangwato Concessions, Ltd.) whici amounted to 95% in FY80. The
following table compares September 1981 energy prices; all prices except
those for electricity are the Gaborone retail price:

Coal Suppliesi
1.05        The Morupule coal resources are the best known and are far in
excess  of  the needs  foreseen  in the  current power  expansion  studies.
M4orupule  Colliery  (a  subsidiary  of  Anglo-American  Corporation)  was
established in 1973 after the completion of the field investigations
carried out between 1967 and 1970.   Since 1974 an area to the immediate
west of the Anglo mining lease area has been prospected in detail by Shell
International.    The  proposed  power  plant  will  initially  use  Morupule
Colliery coal, which will be exploited in a two-stage expansion program to
imeet the future  demand.   The  production  capability  is currently  being
increased from 360,000 tonne/year to 480,000 at an estimated cost of P 1.52
million (US$1.38 million), to meet the requirement of the 2x3 MW Gaborone
power plant and the additional 20 MW set presently being installed at
Selebi-Phikwe. A second 120,000 t.p.a. expansion, at an estimated cost of
P 5.8 million (US$5.3 million) currently uncer negotiation between BPC and
the colliery will increase coal production to 600,000 in 1983 and will meet
the needs of the proposed power plant until about 1989. Signing of a coal
supply agreement satisfactory to the Bank will be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed Loan.   To prDduce additional coal supplies
when BPC expands the capacity of the propDsed power plant, possibly in
1989, the Bank recommends that BPC investigaLe the possible use of low cost



- 4 -
residual coal which might be produced from a planned coal export project
(para. 1.06) at Serowe for which a drilling program is to be undertaken.
During negotiations it was agreed that by December 31, 1984 Government and
the Bank will agree whether the drilling program in Serowe establishes
sufficient coal to meet BPC's future coal requirements. If this is not the
case, provision has been included in the project for a drilling program to
prove the exact location for future coal development in the Morupule area.
Coal Exports
1.06      The Government plans to export substantial quantities of coal and
discussions are currently underway with Shell Coal International and the
Republic of South Africa (RSA) with a view to achieving an initial annual
export of 5 million tons of coal by 1986/87. Ultimate exports in excess of
10 million tons annually are envisaged (Annex 1).
Energy Planning
1.07      While the Government has stated its objective of substituting, to
the greatest extent possible, the usage of imported oil by alternative
indigenous energy resources, no detailed energy master plan has been
prepared.    Energy  planning  and  control  is hampered  because no  single
ministry bears overall responsibility for energy. The MMRWA is responsible
for coal and electricity, the MCI for the importation, storage and price
control of oil related products, which are all imported through RSA, and
other ministries are also involved in the various renewable energy
projects,trials and applications. The MMRWA has overall responsibility for
coordinating efforts towards achieving the Government's general objective
and chairs a separate committee for coordinating the various renewable
energy programs (para. 1.02).
1.08      Apart from the export of coal the major expansion of energy usage
is  likely  to  be  lumpy.   Major energy  consumers  are expected  to use
electricity.  Apart from minor general growth due to population increase,
70% of the total increases of electricity is likely to be determined by the
requirements for power for the mineral mining sector; the timing of the
increased requirements will be determined by when individual large mining
consumers come on stream.   On completion of the proposed interconnected
power system, the availability of energy is not expected to be a constraint
on the expansion of the mining sector in view of the abundant availability
of coal; and the timing of the future mines is likely to be determined by
other factors such as the market potential for the product.
Power Sector
1.09       The total electrical energy consumption of the country in FY81
was 393 GWh, which corresponds to a per capita energy use of about 480
kWh/year, and is among the highest in the Eastern Africa Region, reflecting
the level of mining activity. For example, annual electricity consumption
per capita in other East African countries is as follows: Kenya 100 kWh;
Madagascar 50 kWh; Mauritius 460 kWh; and Sudan 50 kWh. BPC generates and
supplies about 95% of Botswana's  electricity  requirement.   In Botswana



- 5 -
power is also generated by private comparies using diesel sets to meet
their own requirements such as the operation of diamond and coal mines. Of
these Jwaneng is being supplied by BPC through its ESCOM (RSA) link and
Orapa will be partially supplied through the Selebi-Phikwe transmission
line  from  1983.   All  autoproducers  will  be  supplied  by BPC over its
proposed  interconnected  system  when  it  is  completed  in  1986.    BPC's
electricity generation and installed capacity (FY77-81) are given in
Annex 2.
1.10       Between FY72 and FY81, BPC's electricity sales increased at an
average of 44% annually from 13.6 GWh to 364 GWh. This high percentage is
because of the connection of BCL in FY73.   BPC's average sales increase,
excluding mining loads, was also high, averaging 23% p.a. from FY72 to
FY81.   System capacity also  increased  about  100% in  this  period,  and
installed capacity meets aemand in all its service areas.
Existing F'acilities of the Botswana Power Corporation
1.11          BPC has,  at present,  two separate power facilities in the
country,  i.e. Southern and Northern (Shaslie) Divisions  (Annex 3).   The
Southern Division serves mainly the capital city, Gaborone, and surrounding
towns, i.e. Lobatse, Molepolole, Thamaga, Kanye, Mochudi and Jwaneng. The
Northern Division serves mainly Selebi-Phikwe about 400 km from Gaborone,
where the main consumers are BCL, Francistown and other smaller towns. The
two divisions  are not yet interconnected.   As  a part of the proposed
project, they will be interconnected by a 220-kV power transmission line in
1986.
1.12           The BPC  power  facilities  (nap  IBRD  16099)  comprises  the
corporation's two coal-fired power plants, i.e. Gaborone and Selebi-Phikwe,
a diesel generating plant at Gaborone, four small diesel stations at Maun,
Malapye, Palapye and Serowe, a 132-kV liik from Gaborone to Spitskop,
RSA,with a capacity of 31 MW for importation of power from RSA's
Electricity  Supply  Commission   (ESCOM)   and   other   transmission   and
distribution facilities. BPC' s present total generating capacity is about
89 MW, of which 76 MW is generated by coal-iired steam power plants and 13
MW by diesel plants (Annex 5).
1.13      Generation in the Southern Division is centered in Gaborone where
installed  capacity is about  25 MW.   Two  3-MW  coal-fired  steam  units,
financed Dy the Commonwealth Development. Corporation kCDC) and the
Government, were commissioned in April 1981 and the ESCOM link (31 MW) in
November 19b1. In the Northern Division, total generating capacity is 63.1
MW.   An additional 20-MW boiler was  commissioned in February 1981 and
tenders have been received for a 20-MW steam turbo generator unit due for
completion in 1983.
1.14      At present, BPC has a 66-kV transriission network in the Northern
Division and 33-kV in the Southern Division. The Southern Division is also
connected to ESCOM's system by the 132-kV power link.  BPC's distribution
voltage is 11 kV, 6 kV and 400 volts.   System frequency is 50 Hz.   For
statistical data on BPC's transmission and distribution system in 1981, see



-6-
Annex 2. BPC's existing transmission system has not sufficient capacity to
carry the additional electricity to be generated  by  the project.   The
project therefore includes the 220-kV transmission liaes necessary to
connect the two systems (para. 3.06 (c, d and e), while the remainder will
be financed from other sources (para. 4.15).
Access to Service and Electrification of Rural Areas
1.15        The Government has given high priority to industrial and urban
electrification for many years.   BPC  supplies  about  6,500 connections,
which includes bulk sales conections to municipalities and mining towns,
and supplies electricity to 97,000, or 11% of the total population.  This
iB one of the highest percentages in the Eastern Africa Region.3/
1.16      The Government has a rural electrification program limited to its
offices, and buildings such as schools, hospitals, clinics, staff houses,
etc. in the rural areas.   MMWRA has already constructed and now operates
about 200 diesel sets at about 100 locations of which total capacity is
about 10 MW.   Total estimated electric energy production of these diesel
sets is about 15 GWh/year.  The Government is considering the possibility
of extending some rural electrification in areas remote from the BPC grid
by  connecting  minor  consumers  (abbatoirs,  etc.)  to  the  government
generators which primarily supply the government buildings.
1.17       Production cost of these diesel sets in the rural areas is high,
about  30  to 40  th/kWh,  and  the  Government  sells  electricity  to  the
community at cost, it surplus supply capacity exists.   one pilot rural
electrification program has been undertaken by BPC on behalf of MMWRA and
the results are being evaluated.   The MMWRA program has about 90 ongoing
rural electrification projects consisting of construction of diesel sets
with a small distribution tacility, most of which are located in the
isolated rural areas and are not under the administration of BPC.   In
general, these projects are tinanced by SIDA, KfW, AfDB and other,
bilateral agencies on soft terms.  Government contributes about P 500,000
(US$0.6 million) per year towards the cost of construction.
II. THE BORROWER AND EXECUTING AGENCY
The Borrower
2.01          The Botswana Power Corporation  (BPC)  is  the  sole  utility
responsible for public power supply. It was established in 1970, with Bank
Group assistance, as one of the steps leading to the financing of the
Shashe Infrastructure Project (Credit 172-BT and Loan 776-BT), serving the
copper/nickel mining complex at Selebi-Phikwe. The US$37.5 million Shashe
Bank loans were mainly used to help finance a township, road and rail
facilities, water supply, engineering and administration, but a small
amount was used to finance the power distribution system in the township.
The Bank played an important role in the preparation of the project and in
coordinating negotiations between the parties to the agreements relating to

the  mining  and  infrastructure  projects.        The  BPC  Act  directs  the
corporation to operate on sound commercial lines and to produce a fair rate
of return on assets.
2.02        BPC would be the borrower and executing agency of the proposed
project. BPO is a parastatal corporation owned by the Government and
responsible to the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Water Affairs.  BPC
was established as an incorporated body by the Botswana Power Corporation
Act 1970, as amended in 1974.   BPC's respousibilities incluae generation,
ltransmission and distribution of electricity in areas approved by the
Government. It also determines tariffs with Government approval. Certain
major isolated consumers are not yet connected to the BPC facilities and
generate their own electricity for their own use (para. 1.09).
Organization
2.03        BPC - Board and Senior Managemenlt.  BPC's board of directors,
comprising a chairman and between six to e:.ght members, are appointed by
the Government;  the chairman for a term of three years and the directors
for four years.   Directors  include  representation  of  the Commonwealth
Development  Corporation  (CDC)  and  of  local  and  foreign  commerce  and
industry.  All are eligible for reappointment at the end of their terms.
The board appoints the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) with the approval of
the Government, who is responsible to the board for the running and
operation of BPC. The CEO, who participates in board meetings but does not
vote, is responsible for the appointment or dismissal of all staff other
than senior staff who are appointed or dismissed by the board on CEO's
recommendations.  In practice, the recommencations of the present CEO, who
was appointed in 1978, have an important infLuence on the board's decisions
since he is both competent  and effective.   During negotiations  it was
agreed  that  BPC would  consult  with  the Isank before making any  future
appointments to the position of CEO.
2.04          BPC - General  Organization.    BPC's  Northern  and Southern
Divisions are geographically widely separate1 and, except for tarifts which
are subject to ministerial approval, both have a substantial deg-ee of
operating and administrative autonomy. The Northern Division's operations
are  dominated  by  the  requirements  of its  major consumer, BCL.   Both
regional managers and their senior staff are competent, and most of them
are expatriates.  Annex 3 shows the present BPC organization, but this will
need to be reorganized after regional interconnection is achieved under the
project. BPC intends to employ an experienced control engineer some 18
months prior to the start of the interconnected operations; he will assist
the CEO to organize the new control center operations, procedures and
safety practices that BPC will need.  BPC's management would be capable of
carrying out and implementing a satisfactory organizational study.   Funds
will, however, be provided under the project for the employment of
consultants to assist BPC in this reorganization should BPC not find
sufficient time to do this due to the increased activities arising from the
proposed  interconnection.    During  negotiations  it  was  agreed  that  by
December 31, 1983, BPC will furnish to, and exchadge views with the Bank on
the recommendations of the study and take all such actions as are
appropriate taking into account any comments of the Bank.



-8-
2.05      BPC Staffing.  The existing BPC's consumer-staff ratio of about 8
consumers per employee is low compared to similar levels in other African
countries4/ but this is due to the high proportion of major load
consumers, e.g. BCL, which is one consumer served by about 200 BPC
employees working on the power plant and other facilities.  Eight percent
of total staff are expatriate and are engaged by BPC on contract terms.
Despite the Government's and BPC's continuing efforts in training, an acute
shortage   exists   of   professionally   qualified   personnel,   including
appropriately qualified and experienced engineers and accountants.   This
shortage derives from the difficulty of identifying sufficient candidates
with adequate educational backgrounds to qualify for further education and
professional  training.   BPC has had  to employ expatriate engineers and
accountants in almost all cases, although one Tswana graduate engineer and
one accountant are presently uncergoing further training in UK. Currently
63 out of a total 882 employees are expatriates, and the additional
technical, protessional and supervisory positions needed to staft and
operate the project are also expected to be fillea by contract expatriates
at least until the end of the decade.  BPC intends to utilize the services
of blI to fill these positions should it encounter ditficulties in
recruiting such staff directly.  BPC has recruited an engineer to manage a
unit to supervise and administer tne project (para. 3.20).
Accounting and Auditing
2.06         BPC's principles of financial operation are laid down by the
Botswana Power Corporation Act, which requires the Corporation to conduct
its affairs on sound commercial lines and to set electricity charges to
produce on the "fair value of its assets a reasonable return ... by taking
its net operating income as a percentage of the fair value of its fixed
assets in operation plus an appropriate allowance for working capital."
The Corporation is required to prepare annual income and expenditure
accounts and balance sheets which are to be audited within four months of
the end of each financial year by auditors to be appointed by the
Corporation with the approval of the Minister.
2.07       BPC conducts its financial operations through two divisions, the
Northern Division, which accounted for 61% of its FY81 revenues and the
Southern Division which accounted for the remaining 39% (para. 4.01).
Section 4.02 of the Loan Agreement tor Loan 776-BT between the Bank
andBotswana requires.BPC to maintain separate accounts for its
Northern Division.  JVC will continue to prepare separate statements of
reveniues   and   expenses   covering   its   Northern   Division   until   the
interconnected system comes into operation.   Atter tflis tne matching of
divisional revenues and expenses will no longer be meaningful.  From FY84
(para. 4.11) BPC's financial performance will be evaluateca on the basis of
4/  Malawi 12, Zaire 21, Swaziland 23, Sudan 24, Madagascar 38, Kenya 40.



- 9 -
its entire operations and complete divisional accounts (balance sheets,
income statements and source and application of funds statements) treating
the Northern Division as a financially i.ndependant operation are not
relevant.   Therefore,  the foregoing provisLons of Loan 776 BT would be
suspended.
2.08       BPC's financial management is satisfactory and its accounting is
effective.    Accounting  records  are  well  maintained  and  expenditures
carefully planned, recorded and monitored. BPC's Chief Accountant and the
two divisional accountants hold internatLonally recognized accounting
qualifications  and the support  staff  is g;enerally adequate.   With the
exception of billings and collections, accounts are maintained manually
although  some  consideration  is  being  given  to  further  accounting
applications using the Government computer (:para. 2.10).
2.09       BPC's audits are carried out by a well known international firm
of public accountants and these arrangements are satisfactory.  Its recent
record  of  compliance  with  the  existing  audit  covenant  has  been  good.
During  negotiations  it  was  agreed  that  BPC  will  have  its  financial
statements audited by independent auditors a.cceptable to the Bank and that
these audited financial statements will be submitted to the Bank within
five months after the close of BPC's fiscal year.
Billing and Collection
2.10       BPC's billing system has been computerized, using the Government
computer, since mid 1980.   Billings and related receivables reports and
statistical information are printed at the Government bureau. The current
status and records of customer accounts can be obtained on visual display
screens in BPC's offices. The system works effectively. Billings are made
promptly and disconnections for non-payment made within six weeks of bills
being rendered.  Bad debts have been negligible and the current level of
accounts receivable is at a satisfactory level equivalent to about 40 days
sales.
Training
2.11        BPC operates very good training programs for its lower level
staff, both in the Northern and Southern Divisions.  These are aimed at
producing practical training for technicians in the various generation,
transmission, distribution and bookkeeping skills needed by BPC for its
operations. Such training is effectively carried out under the control of
expatriate  training  officers  and  adequately  meets  the  present  BPC
requirements.  To safeguard continuity of training programs and to provide
appropriate numbers of qualified personnel for the operation of the
proposed project, BPC will submit to the Bark for its approval by June 30,
1983, a suitable training program to cover power plant and control center
operations, maintenance and testing.

Insurance
2.12         BPC maintains a satisfactory comprehensive insurance programs
including third party coverage, with a private insurance company which is
reviewed annually with the insurers to ensure continuing adequacy.   The
project would carry no unusual insurance risks.
III. DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
Demand and Market
3.01      BPC sales have almost doubled over the last five years, achieving
an average growth rate of about 14% per annum.   Energy consumption and
average yearly growth rates by BPC consumer groups are as follows:
Consumption     Average Growth
% of Total     Rate (%) between
Consumer Groups                (1980)           FY75-8U

3.02           A  comprehensive  load  forecast  study  covering  the  period
1981-2000 was carried out in 1981 by BPC's engineering consultants, Kennedy
and Donkin (UK), Watermeyer, Legge, Piesold and Uhlmann (UK), in
association with Coopers and Lybrand Associates,  Limited (UK).   It was
mainly based on historical growth trends for domestic and small consumers
and on projected individual growth for mining and other major consumers.
The load forecast was reviewed and updated during the appraisal.
3.03        The load forecast study estimates average yearly growth from
FY81 to FY86 at 14%, followed by a decline to 11% from FY86 to FY90 and to
6% thereafter (Annex 4).   The projected higher load growth for initial
years of the forecast is due to relatively large additions to existing
mining consumption because of the expected connection of additional mining
operations and the expected growth of existing industrial consumption.
Thereafter, growth in mining and industrial usage is expected to taper off
as there are no firm plans for other large mining and industrial projects.
3.04        The high load growth througti FY86 is due to increased supplies
among the largest industrial consumers.  BCL is expected to take an extra
42 GWh but, more signiticantly, sales to other large users of electricity
are forecast to increase from 8 GWh in FY80 to 180 GWh in FY86. This sharp
rise is largely caused by the connection to the BPC's system of existing
consumers, who are currently autoproducers, e.g. Orapa-Letleknane and
Jwaneng diamond mines, Botswana Meat Corporation BMEC) and the Morupule



- 11 -
coal mines.   Those four loads alone accouni: for 55 MW of the FY86 152 tHW
system peak demand forecast.   Other loaas  tor potential  new industrial
developments incluae the expected opening of a new copper mine based oni the
Bushman/latsitama  deposits  (4  MIN),  and  a  new  abattoir  (3  MW)  at
Francistown.
3.05        Between FY86 and FY90, the total eLiergy sales are torecast to
grow at an annual rate of 11X.  However, tLis growth is heavily dependent
on the turther development of industry, mainly mining loads associated with
new  projects.    Without  these  industrial  loads,  whose  exact  timing  is
uncertain, overall growth in sales would be equivalent to about 5% p.a.
This is because the BCL load, which even in 1989/90 is expected to be 29%
of the total,  is expected  to begin to decline during the period.   The
forecast industrial growth in this period (FY86 through FY90) for new
projects mainly comprises demands of 6 MW (20 GWh) for Kgalagadi precious
stone mine; 6 MW (20 GWh) for the development of Mmamabula coal mine; 15 MW
(60 GWh) for Serowe coal mine, 2 MW (10 GWh) for Nora gold mine, and 5 MW
(17 GWh) for Sua Pan soda ash mine.  None of these developments, however,
is included before FY85, nor do they play a major role in regard to the
project capacity or timing.   The urban load is forecast to grow in total
at about 10% p.a. between FY80 and FY2000, thus maintaining its trend in
the overall total forecast.
Development Program
3.06           Based  on  the  load  forecast  study mentioned  above,  BPC's
consultants have recommended a transmission and generation development
program which will interconnect BPC's Northern and Southern Divisions as
follows:
lo be commissioned in HbY4
a.  Orapa - Selebi-Phikwe 155 km, 220-kN' powerllile.
b.  Gaborone - Lobatse, 75 km, 132-kV pciwerline.
To be commissioned in FY85
c.  Morupule - Selebi-Phikwe 110 km, 22C-kV powerline.
d.  Morupule - Segoditshane 262 km, 220-kV powerline.
e.  Segoditshane - Gaborone, 13 km, 132 kV powerline.
To be commissioned in FY86
f.   Morupule power plant, 90 MW coal-fired steam plant.
g.   Junction - Matsitama, 50 km, 132-kV powerline
To be commissioned in FY89
h.  Junction - Sua Pan, 40 km, 132-kV powerline.
i.  Jwaneng - Kgalagadi, 230 km, 132-kV powerline.
3.07          In FY86, BPC's  total  firm capacity (including the proposed
project) will increase to about 229 MW, whi-h will be sufficient to meet
the expected system maximum demand of about 192 MW until FY88 with a
minimum  system  reserve  (Annex  5).    If  the  tuture  industrial  loads
materialize (para. 3.05), BPC will need to construct an additional



- 12 _'
generating  capacity in 1987 to meet the demand in 1988 (213 MW).   This
program optimizes the development by giving flexibility for the timely
construction of the various generation and transmission additions needed to
meet the development of future major industrial load as they firm up.
3.08        The consultants have also carried out studies to evaluate the
future performance of BPC's 220-kV, 132-kV and lower voltage transmission
systems, and have recommended various system compensation components to
obtain better reactive power supply, voltage regulation and lower system
losses. A system control center, to be constructed in Gaborone, has also
been recommended.   The control center is a part of the proposed project.
All of the recommendations of the consultants have been included in BPC's
generation/transmission/distribution long term construction program.
Project Objectives
3.09          The main  objective  of  the proposed  project  is to provide
generating capacity to meet BPC's total demand through FY88.  The project
would develop indigenous energy resources and would create new job
opportunities temporarily for the initial construction and thereafter for
the operation of the power station and for the resulting increased mining
activity.  The improvement of BPC's tariff policy is an objective of the
project, as is improvement of operations through reorganization and the
construction of the new control center and through related training
programs.
Project Description
3.10      The description of the proposed project is as follows:
(a)  construction of a coal-fired pithead power plant with three 30-MW
steam units at Morupule, together with 50-km long water pipeline;
(b)  construction of about 385 km of 220 and 132 kV power transmission
lines and associated substations  connecting  the power plant to
BPC's Southern and Northern Divisions (para. 3.06, c, d and e);
(c)  construction of a system control center;
(d)  provision  of  tariff  and  reorganization  studies,  and  a  coal
drilling and a training program; and
(e)  provision of engineering consultancy services for preparation of
bid documents, evaluation of bids and construction supervision.
3.11        The power plant will be located at Morupule, adjacent to the
existing coal mine.  Very good rail and roads provide access to the site,
which lies some 10 km west of Palapye and 1 km north of the main
Palapye-Serowe  road.  The power plant will consist of three 30-MW steam
turbo generator units, three 150 ton/hour capacity pulverized coal-fired



- 13 -
boilers, plant auxiliaries, a 220-kV switchyard, coal and water storage
facilities, a material and spare part storage house, and an administration
building.   The power plant will be based on a dry cooling system, which
would  satisfy environmental consideratiors concerning water usage (para.
3.31).   A 50-km long water pipeline will be constructed from a proposed
well field, at the escarpment sandstones near Mabeleapodi, to the power
plant to supply water for the mine operations, boiler make-up and internal
use of the project.
3.12       The 220-kV power transmission lines are required to connect the
power  plant  to  the  BPC's  Southern  and  Northern  Divisions,  thereby
establishing the backbone of the national interconnected system in Botswana
(para. 3.06).   This is recommended by the consultants as the least cost
solution  to meet  the  future  demand  in  these  divisions.    The  220-kV
powerline will be steel-lattice, guy towe:^s with two earthwires, suitable
to the local conditions.
3.13      BPC's Northern and Southern Divisions are not yet interconnected
and thus no system control center for load dispatching, switching,
frequency and voltage regulation is presently needed. The proposed project
would, however, establish an interconnected system and a system control
center, which would be located in Gaborone and would communicate with all
power plants and major substations as rezommended by the consultants to
BPC. A more detailed description of the project is given in Annex 6.
Cost Estimates
3.14      The estimated project cost, without interest during construction,
is P 237 million (US$215 million), of which about 77% amounting to P 191
million (US$173 million) is in foreign exchange costs. The total financing
requirement, including interest during construction, is estimated to be
P 275 million (US$249 million).   The foreign costs include about P 16.9
million (US$15.4 million), 10% of the total base cost, for import duties to
be paid to South African Customs Union (SACU) for goods imported from
outside the SACU area. The cost estimates (Annex 7) are summarized below:

3.15        The Cost estimates were prepared by BPC's consultants and are
based on contractors' offers for recent similar civil, mechanical and
electrical  works  in Europe  and RSA.   The base  costs  are expressed  in
January 1982 prices.  During the appraisal mission, the project costs were
revised to take into account the major revised design aspects.   Physical
contingencies for different project components, ranging from 8% to 15% on
the base cost, have been added.  The cost estimates are based on the price
escalation shown in the following table 5/:
FY87 and

To minimize the risks of cost overruns on the main IBRD and other project
components (civil works, boilers, turbine-; and generators), bids for the
Morupule project were received before Board presentation and are within
cost estimates shown in this report.
Project Financing
3.16       The project would be co-financed by IBRD, AfDB, BADEA, CDC, EIB,
the Kuwait Fund, the Saudi Fund, and export: credits.  Co-lender finance is
at various stages of the process leading to final approval and, combined
with export credit finance is expected to cover about 74% of the project
foreign exchange requirements of US$201.5 million with the remaining 26%
being provided by Government. The proposed US$32.5 million Bank loan would
finance about 13% of the total project financing requirement and about 16%
of the estimated foreign exchange costs.   It would be used to finance the
foreign exchange costs of specific civil works and equipment contracts 6/,
studies and training as well as the US$.48 million front end fee on the
Bank loan. As a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan all conditions
of effectiveness of the co-lenders should be met as well as completion of
export credit financing arrangements.
3.17        The project would be mainly financed under parallel financing
arrangements agreed between the co-lenders.   However, there will be some
joint  financing  arrangements.    The  boilEr  contract  is  expected  to  be
financed jointly by EIB and export credit finance.   The need for export
credit finance would be reduced by a US$10 million equivalent grant from
FRG (through KfW) if the condenser contract were awarded to an FRG
supplier. Foreign exchange costs relating to the awarded preliminary water
supply and civil works contracts and in:erest during construction and
duties would be financed by Government.   BPC would substantially finance
the project's local costs.

Engineering, Consultants' Services and Project Implementation
3.19        Except for one minor element of the project, the coal drilling
program (paragraph 1.05), BPC would be responsible for implementation,
assisted by the engineering consultants, whc were responsible for preparing
the  feasibility  study  (para.  3.02).   BPC has  entered  into  a separate
contract with these consultants for the preparation of bid documents, the
evaluation of bids and construction supervision.  The cost of consultants'
services is estimated at about US$11 million.   The average man-month cost
(including about 1,800 man-months of salary, international travel and
subsistence)  is estimated at about US$6,8')0.   Consultants'  services  for
additional studies are estimated to cost IJS$0.3 million.   The estimated
average man-month costs for these additional  services  is US$9,500.   BPC
will continue to employ its engineering consultants to supervise project
construction.
3.20            BPC  staff  have  some  experience  in  the  construction  of
transmission  and  distribution  facilities,  and  coal-fired  steam  power
plants.   BPC have set up a construction supervision unit consisting of a
project manager, engineers and technicians to manage its construction
program including the project.
3.21        Preliminary engineering design of the project was completed in
March 1981 and certain revisions to parts cf this design were made during
appraisal in August 1981. Final design was completed in December 1981. In
order to meet BPC's timetable, bid documents for the water supply and for
the site preparation (including housing for BPC staff) were issued in
November 1981 and contracts awarded in March 1982. These contracts will be
financed by BPC and the Government.   Bid documents for the main civil,
mechanical and electrical works to be included in the project were issued
in June 1982, with bid closing in September 1982 . Main contracts will be
awarded in December 1982.   Construction is expected to begin in December
1982 and to be completed by June 1986 (Annex 8).
Procurement
3.22        Works.   Contracts for the construction of major buildings and
roads, totalling US$37 million including contingencies, to be financed by
the proposed Bank loan, would be procured by ICB in accordance with the
Bank's  guidelines.    Contracts  for  the  balance  of  construction  to  be
financed under the project consist of minor works and buildings of
estimated contract size less than US$0.5 million scattered throughout
the country and are not likely to interest foreign bidders. These works
would be procured by local competitive bidding procedures (regional
competitive bidding), which have been examined and found to be satisfactory
to the Bank, with foreign bidders having the opportunity to participate.
3.23           Goods.    Equipment  totalling  to US$  24 million  including
contingencies to be financed from the propcsed Bank loan would be grouped
in appropriate bidding packages and procured by ICB in accordance with Bank
guidelines.    Miscellaneous  items  of  equipment,  in  packages  less  than
US$100,000 and totalling U$500,000 approximately, would be procured under
competitive local procedures (regional competitive bidding), which have
been examined and found to be satisfactory to the Bank.

would  be  procured  by  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  (regional
competitive bidding), which have been examined and found to be satisfactory
to the Bank, with foreign bidders having the opportunity to participate.
3.24        Contracts to be financed by other colenders will  e awarded on
the basis of their individual procurement procedures.   Locally financed
contrcts will be procured by local competitive bidding procedures (regional
competitive bidding) acceptable to the Bank.
3.25        Contract Review.  All bidding packages for estimated cost over
US$1.5 million equivalent would be subject to the Bank's prior review of
procurement documentation resulting in a coverage of about 85% of the total
estimated value of contracts.  The balance of contracts would be subject to
random post review by the Bank after contract award.
Disbursement
3.26       Bank funds would be disbursed against:   (a) 100% of the total
foreign costs of equipment, studies and training; and (b) 60% of the total
cost of civil works.
3.27         If any of the Bank  funds  remain undisbursed  after  project
completion,  they would be cancelled.   The proposed closing date would be
June 30, 1987, about fifteen months after the expected project completion
date.   A disbursement  schedule,  which  is  in accordance with  the  Bank
disbursement profile for the power sector, is given in Annex 9.
Project Monitoring and Evaluation
3.28      During negotiations the reports and records necessary to monitor
progress of the project and its evaluation on completion were agreed.
Proposed guidelines for a project monitoring system are given in Annex 10.
It was agreed during negotiation that, within six months of the project
completion, BPC will submit a completion report to the Bank, based on an
outline to be agreed with the Bank.
Environment
3.29        The site is located on a plain which dips gently to the east
bounded by the low valley of the Lotsane/Morupule rivers.   Vegetation is
mostly scrub. The rivers are seasonal with a fairly deeply incised channel
into the alluvium of the flood plain.   There is little agriculture in the
area; farming is limited to cattle which roam at random in the surrounding
bush.  The only industry is provided by the coal mine.  The power station
even at its full output of all phases (180 MW), is a relatively small one;
thus, the total fallout of pollutants will not be high. As required by the
Botswana   Act   "Atmospheric   Pollution   (Prevention),   Chapter   65:04"
(commencement date May 14, 1971), an ecological report regarding possible
impacts  of  emissions  was  prepared  in  1980  by  the  consultants  in
collaboration  with  the  Department  of  Mines.    The  report  reviews  the
preliminary design of the power plant and concludes that the design is
acceptable to keep the three main pollutants (i.e. sulphur and nitrous



- 19 -
oxides and fly ash) within normally accepted limits.   During the final
design, the consultants will recheck the designs and recalculate the height
of the chimney to ensure that the pollutants will be within normally
acceptable  limits  and  in  accordance  with  the  Bank  guidelines.    The
prevailing winds would not blow the emission towards any major centers of
population or important power plant equipment and its operators.
3.30      Consultants to BPC (Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners of UK) proved
that there is sufficient underground water in the surrounding area of
Morupule to run the power plant with a wet cooling system, which require
about 5,000 m3/day of water.  However, on the basis of the recommendations
of BPC's consultants (Kennedy and Donkin) and of the Bank environmental
specialists, a dry cooling system, requiring only about 600 m3/day of water
has been chosen.  In the case of Morupule, the dry cooling system will be
as economic and reliable as the wet cooling system ana, additionally, any
potential   adverse environmental impact caulsed by the possibile aepletion
of water, which coula have other uses (i.e. irrigation ana innustry), has
been substantially reduced.
3.31         Noxious and toxic effluents  from the power station will be
collectea  and  dischargea  into  impervious  evaporating  pans  in orcer  to
prevent their residual high concentrations ct salt trom polluting any water
sources.
3.32        Fly ash trom the plant, which is a potential pollutant of the
atmosphere, will be processed from the boilers through high efficiency
electrostatic precipitators and conducted to permanent dams near the power
plant. Ash water will be drained into evap3rating pans and thus prevented
from polluting water sources.
3.33        The nearest major population centers, Palapye and Serowe, are
sufficiently distant (10 km) from the power station for the effect of its
noise to be insignificant.   The noise would be noticeable at the Morupule
mine village, but would be slight and any loss of amenity would be
minimal.  It is also not expected that the project will unduly expand the
population density of the Morupule area.
IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Financial Results
4.01           The  results  of bPC's  kY77-b1    financial  performance  are
summarized  uelow.    Although  not  matched  by  significant  increases  in
operating income, BPC's revenue growth between kY71 ana FYT1 was strong
with  total  revenues  increasing  by 76%.   The  operating  income  of  the
Northern Division, which accounts tor about 61/. ot bPC's total sales, has
been substantially limited by the pricing provisions of the power sales
agreement with )3CL (paragraph 4.UW), but revenues have been adequate to
meet operating expenses and debt service.   In the case of the Southern
Division production costs have been exceptionally high because ot diesel



- 20 -
fuel costs and small sized generating units and, despite tarift increases,
the divisional financial performance has been poor with revenues barely
covering  operating  expenses.         BPC's  overall  financial  performance,
combining its two divisions, has not been as strong as it would have been
without these two overriding constraints.   To help avoid annual Southern
Division accounting losses and strengthen BPC's financial position, P 8.5
million of indebtedness to Government was converted to equity in FY79.
Substantially, as a consequence of this, the division has been able to
achieve small annual operating surpluses, after charging interest.

Tariffs and Rate of Return
4.05        A substantial portion of BPC's sales has been priced under the
terms of a 25 year power agreement entered into with BCL, in 1972. In FY77
sales to BCL accounted for 62% of BPC's revenues, but this declined to
about 50% in FY81.  Under the agreement BPC is contractually bound to meet
BPC's power requirements up to a declared maximum demand of 45 MW.    The
pricing formula under the agreement allows BPC to recover capital charges
and operating costs.   Capital charges  include a return of 8% per annum on
BPC's investment in the Shashe power facilities 8/ amortized on a sinking
fund basis over the expected useful life of the facilities. The use of the
sinking fund basis has a levelling influence on the tariff to BCL.   The
Shashe power facilities were constructed primarily for the BCL mining
development with its limited life and with the expectation that cash
requirements for future development would te minimal.   Capital charges to
BCL are revised to reflect currency revalucations, and include a provision
for working capital equal to 1% of the gross fixed assets in service.
Capital charges and operating costs payable by BCL are based on its
proportionate use of the Shashe power (Northern Division) facilities 9/.
Essentially, BPC's rate of return on its sales to BCL is based on the
nominal capital used to finance the facilities, and not its current value.
While the high proportion of BPC's sales to BCL has had a limiting effect
on BPC's financial performance, this will be of declining importance in the
future as the demand from other consumers' increases; by FY90, the
proportion of BPC's revenues from BCL is expected to decline to about 12%.
4.06       Section 4.12  (c) of  the  Shashe Project Loan Agreement 776-BT
provides that the basis of charges under tha power agreement shall not be
changed without the consent of the Bank.  When the central power station
comes into operation in 1986, most of the power supplied to BCL will no
longer be generated from the Shashe power etation and some changes to the
agreement will be necessary.   BPC expects  to enter into discussions with
BCL within the next few months about the zhanges to the agreement which
will be required in 1986.  The only anticipated change is that related to
the variable operating costs for power supply to BCL under the agreement,
in the case of power supplied from the central power station, which would
probably be based on the notional cost of power supply to BCL from the
Shashe power station.
8/ The power facilities were largely financed by the Canadian International
Development   Agency   (CIDA).      The   facilities  were   part   of  an
infrastructure project, constructed with the assistance of Bank loans
of US$37.5 million, to support the copper/'nickel mining development.
9/ Under a second supplementary power agreement BCL will pay 100% of the
capital charges from 1983/84 onwards.



- 24 -
4.07       Section 4.12 of Loan 776-BT requires Government, inter alia, to
cause BPC to earn a 7-1/2 % annual rate of return for FY75 through FY78 and
8% thereafter on the Shashe (Northern Division) gross fixed assets in
operation (at historical cost), adjusted for currency realignments, plus an
appropriate allowance for working capital.   Since the division came into
operation, revenues from BCL have accounted for the major portion of the
Northern Division revenues and amounted to about 82% of these revenues in
FY81. The pricing agreement assures the appropriate rate of return on the
Northern Division sales to BCL.  BPC has achieved its divisional financial
objective for the remaining Northern Division sales by maintaining tariffs
at a level which have met the foregoing rate of return requirements.
Recent rates of return on the foregoing basis have been:  1981 9.09%; 1980
9.13%, 1979 8.31%.
4.08       As noted in paragraph 4.01, the production costs of the Southern
Division have been high, but BPC's  revenue objectives for the division of
meeting operating expenses, including depreciation based on historic cost,
and interest charges have latterly been met.  The FY81 average tariff of
P 11.1 cents (US$12.4 cents) per kilowatt hour is one of the highest in the
Eastern Africa Region. 10/
4.09       With the expected 14% average annual growth in the quantity of
electricity sold during the FY82 to FY87 financing period, the reduction of
real electricity supply costs through the introduction of more efficient
coal generating capacity and the ixiport of power from RSA in 1982, BPC's
internal cash generation will increase substantially over its past low
levels.   BPC's objective during this period will be to meet 20% of its
total capital spending, including the proposed project, from internal cash
generation.   Given  the expected  size  of  the FY82-87  capital  spending
program, which will increase BPC's fixed assets more than four times and
the revenue limiting effect of the BCL pricing agreement on a significant
but declining part of its electricity sales during this period, the 20%
objective is reasonable. During negotiations, it was agreed that BPC would
contribute from net internal cash generation not less than 20% of its total
capital expenditures from FY82 to FY87.  It was also agreed that BPC would
annually review the adequacy of its tariffs for meeting the 20% cash
generation objective on the basis of forecasts prepared in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank.
4.10           BPC has  expressed  its preference  for the  foregoing  cash
generation objective to be met through annual tariff increases. As a first
step BPC increased its tariffs (except on sales to BCL under the pricing
agreement)  by  15% from April  1,  1982.   To meet  the  cash generation
objective, it is estimated that the following further nominal annual tariff
increases approximately in line with estimated inflation, wouLd be
required:  FY84-85 12%, FY86-87 10%.  BPC's last tariff increase prior to
that in April 1982 was 10% in April 1979 when a fuel adjustment charge was
also introduced.  Increases of 30% and 12% were also made in the Southern
Division in 1977 and 1976 respectively.
10/ Other recent examples of tariffs per kilowatt hour sold expressed in
US cents are:  Swaziland 3.87, Malawi 5.3, Kenya 6.5, Sudan 10 (based
on prevailing official exchange rates).



- 25 -
4.11        In addition to the cash contribt.tion requirements referred to in
paragraph 4.09, to ensure that BPC earns a reasonable rate of return on
capital employed, it was also agreed at negotiations that BPC would earn an
annual minimum 8% rate of return on average revalued net fixed assets in
operation  from  FY84  and  thereafter.          The  present  rate  of  return
requirements under Loan 776-BT (paragraph 4.07) would be rescinded.
4.12       A systematic review of the economic and social aspects of BPC's
tariff structure needs to be made taking into account both long-run
marginal supply costs to different types of consumers as well as BPC's
financial needs.  It was expected that BPC could carry out this review but
provision for the cost of assistance has been provided in the project in
case such assistance is requirea.   During negotiations it was agreed that
by December 31, 1963 BPC will turnish to, and exchange views with the Bank
onl the  recommendations  of  the  stuay  ana  take  all  such  actions  as are
appropriate taking into account any comments of the Bank.

4.14       In the financing plan it has been assumed that the Bank loan of
P 35.7 million (US$32.5 million) would be made available to BPC over 17
years, including a 4-year grace period, at: an 11.43% interest rate and a
frond end fee of 1.5%.  The conditions of other official project finance
(para. 3.18) available to BPC vary from 15 to 18 year terms, with interest
rates from 8% to 11.6% and grace periods frDm 3± to 4 years. A Government
loan of P 51.8 million (US$47.0 million) would be made to BPC over 25
years, including a grace period of 4 years at a 10% interest rate with
interest being added to the foregoing principal amount during the
construction  period.    Completion  of  a  s3atisfactory  lending  agreement
between Government and BPC would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
4.15       BPC's FY82-87 capital spending, apart from the project, will be
financed  from  loans,  capital  contributiDns  and  BPC's  internal  cash
generation. Transmission lines to the Orapa and Jwaneng diamond mines 1l/
(paragraph 3.04), which would complement the project will be substantially
financed by capital contributions from the mining companies.  Other loans
for capital spending will be provided by CDC, KfW, EIB and Government.
Unarranged loans for an assumed 75% of the cost of the fourth, fifth and
sixth generating units for which expenditures are tentatively scheduled to
commence in FY86 are estimated to total P 85.7 million in FY86 and FY87.
Revaluation of Assets
4.16        BPC, largely with the assistance of its consultants, Merz and
McLellan, revalued its fixed assets to ref:Lect current replacement costs.
On the basis of this revaluation it was agreed at negotiations that, for
the purpose of the rate of return covenant (paragraph 4.11) fixed assets
will be valued at a replacement cost of P 109.4 million less accumulated
depreciation of P 32 million at March 3i,  1981.   It was  also  agreed
that fixed assets would be revalued annually, using the Government's Urban
Cost of Living Index for "All Items" and "All Income Groups" issued by the
Central Statistics Office of the Ministry of Finance and Development
Planning. 12/
Future Operations and Financial Position
4.17        Projected income, balance sheet and cash flow statements for
FY82 to FY90, together with notes and assumptions, are shown in Annexes 11
to 14.  The statements indicate that BPC's financial performance and cash
position  would  be  satisfactory  throughout.    Between  FY982  and  FY90
electricity sales are forecast to increase by an average annual rate of
about 12% from 423 million kilowatt hours in FY82 to 1,064 million kilowatt
hours in FY90.   Revenues would increase  by about 7 times during  this
11/ An agreement was completed with the mining company under which it is
providing an 82% capital contribution toward the cost of the Jwaneng
line.  Bids have been received for the construction of the Orapa line
and an agreement providing for a 91% capital contribution by the mining
company is expected to be signed shortly.

period, while expenses (including depreciation) would increase by four
times. Without inflation allowances, expenses would about double.
4.18       Section 4.10 of Loan 776-BT includes a provision limiting lPC's
borrowings without the Bank's agreement in any fiscal year to an amount not
exceeding R25U0000.  BPC's future debt service coverage is expected to be
good ranging from 1.6 to 4.4 and such stringent requirements are no longer
required.  Therefore the covenant would be rescinded.  Insteaa, to protect
bPC's tinancial viability it was agreed at negotiations that BPC will not
incur Future Long term debt, without the Bank's consent, unless net income
before interest and depreciation is at least 1.4 times future debt service,
including proposed new borrowings.
V. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Need for the Project
5.01        In their report, BPC's consultants (Kennedy and Donkin, March
1981) have demonstrated that BPC needs 90 MW additional generation capacity
in order to meet Botswana's expected  load  growth  through  FY88.    The
inclusion of all three 30 MW units for completion by the end of FY86 is
justified by the immediate and firm load requirements of Orapa and Jwaneng
diamond mines, together with Morupule coal mine, which alone will add some
55 MW of demand onto BPC's existing system.
Least Cost Solution
5.02        In their report, BPC's consultants have examined a number of
alternatives including the size and timing of the units and the capacity
and technical requirement for the interconnection of the North and South
Divisions.   The proposed  construction  of  a three  30-Mw  firm  capacity
coal-fired generating station at Morupule with the 220-kV interconnection
between the presently installed Northern and Southern divisions is shown to
be the least cost solution.   The interconnection  of  the Northern and
Southern regions will be completed at the end of 19b4.
5.03         The Government's consultant, Charles T. Main, in an earlier
report (September 1978) examined a theoretical alternative to the proposed
Morupule generating station of constructing a 220 kV interconnection, also
of 90 MW capacity, between the RSA's ESCOM system and BPC's system,
assuming that the RSA could and would agree to such a major exclusive
connection.  Charles T. Main had concluded that the proposed project was
the least cost alternative and both K&D and the mission concurs with this
opinion.  Since the assumptions used in the K&D report, ESCOM's tariffs
have been increased by about 21% and the cost of the proposed Morupule
power station has been reduced by some 6%. These changes further reinforce
the choice of the project, which is now the least cost solution, as
compared with the (theoretically) available alternative of a new ESCOM
link, at all discount rates up to 15%, which is well above the opportunity
cost of capital in Botswana (Annex 15). The comparison is fairly sensitive
to  ESCOM  tariff  increases.    For  example,  small  increases  in  ESCOM



- 29 -
tariffs averaging 2% annually (in real tenrs) over the next 10 years 13/
would mean that the project would be preferable at all discount rates up to
18%.  An increase of 10% in the capital cos F of Morupule would, at current
ESCOM tariffs, still leave Morupule preferable at all discount rates up to
:L3%. The comparison is not sensitive to a 10% increase in the estimated
capital cost of the ESCOM line, nor to a 20% increase in the estimated
operating cost of Morupule generating stationl.
Economic Rate of Return
5.04       The economic rate of return has been calculated aver the useful
life of the project, i.e. 30 years plus 4 years construction time.   Since
BPC,   by  interconnecting  its  Northern  and  Southern  divisions,  will
effectively start operating a new interconnected system for the first time,
the  rate  of  return  has  been  calculated  Eor BPC's  system  as  a whole,
including the capital construction of phases one (units 1, 2 and 3) and two
(units 4, 5 and 6) of the proposed Morupule generating station, Unit No. 5
at Selebi-Phikwe, the proposed North-South interconnection, the SCADA
control   system  and   future   foreseen   transmission   and   distribution
extensions.   Only 56% of the cost of future lines to connect major new
consumers has been included because their construction will be sufficient
to carry loads through 1999/2000 without the need for significant
additional  construction.    By  1990,  200 MW  of  capacity  will  have  been
installed (i.e. 56%) of the MW 410 MW planned for 1999/2000.   Operating
costs include all generation, transmission anid distribution costs including
the purchase of power from ESCOM over the 31 MW interconnection. Annex 16
shows the present value calculations and fur:her details of the bases used.
5.05      The economic rate of return for the project, which is taken to be
the discount rate at which the shadow priced cost stream is equal to the
benefit stream comprising the revenues (Annexes 15 and 16), is calculated
to be about 18%.  However, this is a conservative estimate since it does
not take into account consumer surplus which is evidenced by the
willingness of the mining companies to pay for most of the capital costs of
new power transmission facilities to the mines.
Tariffs
5.06        The average tariff of 7.03 th/kWh is relatively high compared
with the 5.28 th/kWh long range marginal cost of production.  However, the
higher tariff is required for financial reasons.  BCL, which will continue
to be supplied in accordance with its present contract, will constitute an
ever decreasing percentage of BPC's total sales.   Seventy percent of the
expected new sales through FY90 will be to major heavy load consumers,
mainly mines, which will then constitute 47% of GWh sold (others being BCL
30%  and  township  23%).   The  three  new  BCL mining  customers  (Orapa,
13/ In October 1981 ESCOM announced a further increase of 13.2% for its
1982 tariff, which is about 2-3% higher than the average inflation
rate.



- 30 -
Letlekhane and Jwaneng diamond mines) are presently willing to pay BPC's
existing tariff rates because the alternative of generation by captive
oil-fired plant results, for them, not only in a far higher cost for power,
but also in a less reliable service due to the hazards of the long distance
transportation of the fuel and maintenance difficulties of the diesel
sets. Future mines should be willing to accept BPC's standard tariffs for
similar reasons, and electricity cost at this level should not inhibit
future investment. No energy intensive industries are currently envisaged
and the timing of future capital intensive mines is more likely to depend
on the market level of the product, rather than on the level of the
electricity  tariff.   The  project  includes  a tariff  study,  which will
evaluate the marginal cost of supply and make appropriate recommendations
covering the different types of consumers.
Risks
5.07       Significant assumptions in planning the project capacity and its
timing are that the existing power requirements of nickel, copper and
diamond mining (paras. 3.04, 3.05 and 4.05) will continue at about the same
level and that the power requirements of the increasing diamond production
will be according to current plans. The diamond mining companies have made
or committed themselves to make substantial capital contributions towards
the costs of transmission facilities (para. 3.06, and para. 4.15, footnote
11.) However, given the volatility of the world market for nickel, copper
and diamonds, there is the possibility that mining power requirements may
be less than anticipated.   The study's  conclusion, with which the Bank
agrees, is that the proposed project is not sensitive to sales losses
caused by reduction or even cessation of nickel/copper production, as the
consequent loss in waste heat steam supplied by BCL to BPC would cause a
reductionof 20 MW in BPC's generating capacity.  In that case the three 30
MW generating units at Morupule would still be needed as that would still
be only sufficient to cover three years load growth after project
completion (as compared to two years under the forecast load growth). The
production capacity of the units would be within the optimized system
design for the project. The effect of the postponed demand growth would be
to reduce the economic return (para. 5.05) from 18 percent to 15 percent.
Further analysis, as shown in the following table,has been made to
determine the sensitivity of the project rate of return to changes in the
power requirements of the diamond mines under different conditions.
Event                          Rate of Return
(percent)
(i)   Power requirements of diamond
mines cease                                        15
(ii)  Above plus decline in BCL requirements
to 83% of forecast                                 10
(iii) Power requirements of BCL cease and
diamond mining power requirements
drop to 58% of forecast                            10
From  the  above  analysis,  it  is  concluded  that  the  project  poses  no
unreasonable risks.

VI. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AfD RECOMMENDATION
6.01        During negotiations, agreement was reached that BPC and, where
applicable, Government:
(a) will by December 31, 1984 determine together with the Bank
whether the drilling program in Serowe establishes sufficient
coal resources to meet BPC's future requirements (para. 1.05);
(b) would consult with the Bank before making an appointment to the
position of Chief Executive Officer (para. 2.03);
(c) would by December 31, 1983 complete and exchange views with the
Bank on a reorganization study (plara. 2.04) and a tariff study
(para. 4.12), and would after such consultation, take all such
actions as shall be appropriate ;
(d)  would  have  its  financial  statenents  audited  by  independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank aind would submit such statements
to the Bank within five months after the close of its fiscal year
(para. 2.09).

approval a training program covering the operation, maintenance,
testing and also control center operations (para. 2.11);
(f) would continue to employ its engineering consultants to supervise
project construction (para. 3.19);
(g) would submit a report to the Bank on the project within six
months of project completion (para. 3.28);
(h) would contribute from net internal, cash generation not less than
20% of its total capital expenditures from FY82 to FY87 and would
annually review the adequacy of its tariffs for meeting this
objective (para. 4.09);
(i) would maintain its tariffs at a level sufficient to earn an
annual rate of return on average nat revalued fixed assets of not
less than 8% for FY84 and thereafter (para. 4.11);
(j) would revalue its fixed assets annually on the basis of an index
acceptable to the Bank and, for the purpose of the rate of return
covenant, the gross value of fixed assets at March 31, 1981 shall
be P 109.4 million less accumulated depreciation P 32 million
(para. 4.16); and
(k) would not incur long-term debt without the Bank's consent, unless
future debt service is covered at least 1.4 times by internal
cash generation (para. 4.18).



- 32 -
6.02         As conditions of effectiveness of the Bank loan, (a) a coal
supply agreement between BPC and the Colliery should be signed (para.
1.05); (b) all conditions of effectiveness of the AfDB, BADEA, CDC, EIB,
Kuwait Fund, Saudi Fund should be met as well as completion of export
credit financing arrangments (para. 3.16); and (c) the loan agreement

6.03       With the above agreements, the project would be suitable for a
Bank Loan of US$32.5 million equivalent, available to the Botswana Power
Corporation over 17 years, including a 4-year grace period.

BOTSWANA
Power Projeci:
Development of Coal Resources
1.            Botswana is a landlocked country with major coal resources.
Within its principal coal field at Morupule, there are four main seams
containing  some  6.5  billion  tonnes  of  coal.    Although  a considerable
portion of coal is located in areas affected by dolerite intrusions and
faulting, some 2.5 billion tonnes occu:r in areas that show little
structural disturbance with about 1.5 billion tonnes in situ contained
within the main seam with an average thickness of 7.4 m. The coal reserves
at Morupule within their leasehold and adjacent optional area are as
follows:
-  Million tonnes 
Leasehold       Optional Areas
Seam No. 1                     51.5                55.5
Seam No. 2                      6.8                33.5
Subtotal                    58.3               89.0
Total                                   147.3
The main No. 1 seam has an average thickness of 8.6 m and ranges in depth
from 40 to about 100 m.  Seam No. 2 averages 6.4 m in thickness and is
located about 7 m above the basal No. 1 seama. Seam No. 1 contains the best
coal.   It is classified as a high-ash, medium volatile, steam coal, with
the following characteristics: moisture 5%, ash 20%, volatiles 22%, fixed
carbon 53%, calorific value 5,570 kcal/kg, sulphur (total) 1.5%, hydrogen
3.2%, nitrogen 1.3%, oxygen 6.4%, sweLling index nil, ash fusion
temperature 1,3700C, hardground grindability index 69, abrasiveness index
148.
2.         Despite the problem of transport:ing its coal through neighboring
countries to the sea, the Government plans to export major quantities of
coal.  To this end, the Government has entered into discussions with Shell
International (Shell) and the Republic of 3outh Africa (RSA) authorities.
From these discussions, the Government exrpects Shell to export some 5
million tons of coal annually starting possibly as early as 1985/86 and
1986/87, if ongoing geological studies confirm that the proposed Mmamabula
mine  is  suitable  for  open-cast  mining.    Alternatively,  Shell  would
initially export from its proposed Serowe mine, which is near the existing
Morupule mine, is expected to be larger than Mmamabula, and would involve
underground  working  and  a  longer  construction  period.    If  Serowe  is
selected for initial development, washed coal may begin to be exported by



- 34 -
ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 2
FY88 in which case the resulting middlings 1/ would be used in the
proposed  power  station  for  power  generation,  which  is  designed  to
accommodate this.   However, the Government still expects construction to
start in about 1987 with active mining starting in about 1989, building up
to an estimated 10 million tons annual production in about 1994.
Discussions over the terms of both mining concessions are continuing with
Shell which, in either case, will be expected to finance substantially all
of the capital cost of the mines with, probably, the Government financing
the necessary infrastructure for exporting the coal.
3.          A further constraint on the export of coal is the transport to
the coast and the shipment facilities at the port.  From discussions with
the RSA, the Government expects that, initially at least, 5 million tons
could be shipped through already proposed enlarged facilities at Richards
Bay  in  RSA.    Rail  transportation  to  Richards  Bay  would  entail  the
construction of a relatively short rail link to the RSA existing rail
system at Ellisras (approximately 140 km) which, it is expected, could be
completed in about two years at a preliminary estimated cost of some P 55
million  (US$50 million)  in  1980  prices,  excluding  rolling  stock.    A
prefeasibility study is due to start shortly.
4.         A longer term objective of transporting coal for shipment from
Walvis Bay on the west coast of Namibia, over a projected trans Kagalagadi
railway is also contemplated. A preliminary study has suggested that such
a railway might cost in the range of P 1 billion (US$0.9 billion) in 1980
prices (including the construction of some 800 to 900 km of new track from
the Morupule area to Gobabis in Namibia, some 500 km upgrading of existing
track in Namibia from Gobabis to Walvis Bay, and the construction of a coal
terminal at Walvis Bay); it might take five or six years to complete; and
might be viable at an export level of 10 million tons of coal annually.
Although attractive from the overall politico-economic viewpoint of
assisting in the development of the presently underdeveloped and isolated
western areas of the country, the economic benefit of and financing
possibilities for such a high cost project clearly need to be investigated
in greater depth before any final opinion as to its viability or timing can
be reached.
1/  Middlings are the residual low quality coal, obtained when washing  the
coal for export. Only the washed coal is of export quality.

System Load Characteristics
BPC's Southern and Northern Divisions' load characteristics are
not  the  same.    The  Southern  Division's  daily  load  pattern  has  two
distinctive peaks due mainly to overlap of domestic and industrial loads at
certain times of the day.   There  is about 40% difference  between  the
maximum and minimum of daily loads.  There is also a seasonal variation of
the maximum loads, i.e. winter and summer peaks.  The winter peak is about
20% higher than the summer peak due to the heating load.   The Northern
Division's load pattern does not show distinctive peak variations but a
slight variation of about  5% between winter  and  summer  peaks.   It is
expected that the proposed interconnected system's winter and summer peak
load variation would be about 13%.   Analysis of the load curves of the
divisions by the consultants have shown that there would be very little
diversity between the peak demands.   Therefore,  in designing the system,
the consultants assumed only 5% diversity between the Southern and Northern
Divisions'  urban peak demands.   It seems that BPC has little chance of
shifting the daily peak to off peak hours in the Northern Division because
of the domination of BCL load.  BCL normally operates its smelter 24 hours
a day on a 3-shift basis.   However,  in the Southern Division there is a
possibility that a time-of-day tariff (para. 4.12) could reduce the peak
load and help BPC to reduce the future peak loads, though such a reduction
is expected to be little in the future due mainly to higher load factors of
mining loads.

POWER PROJECT
Project Description
Project Area
1.         The project area is shown on the map (IBRD 16099).  A summarized
project description is given in Chapter III. A fuller description of major
components is given below, with a summary of important features of site
selection, geology, topography, foundation investigations, meteorological
investigations, water and coal supplies.  Consultants to BPC have already
carried out comprehensive optimization studies to identify all the major
characteristics of all major components of the plant and powerlines, such
as capacity and numbers of boilers, turbines and generators, heater, cycle
cooling system, voltage levels, and powerline design.
Site Selection
2.         Comprehensive studies were carried out by the consultants to BPC
(Chas. T. Main of USA and Kennedy and Donkin of UK) for site selection by
taking into consideration coal transportation, transportation of equipment
and material for construction, water suFply and environmental aspects.
They concluded that the pithead power station shoula be constructed outside
the existing £4orupule Colliery concession Doundary; thereby preserving the
autonomy ot  both mine and power stations.   The power station would lie
approximately east-west, and allows possible future extension of the
existing turbine hall in an eastward direction. This alignment enables all
forestration to be on the south face, thereby aiding ventilation, and would
not adversely affect transmission line routes from the station.
Geology, Topography and Foundation
3.         The site is covered with superficial rock and soil deposits; no
outcrops of rock are present within the area designated for the power
station.   Some 20 vertical boreholes were drilled on a 300 m grid on the
site, the depth of the holes varying from 10 m to 25 m below ground
surface.    The  investigation  showed  that  the  upper 3 m was  a loosely
compacted sand, suitable for only lightly  loaded foundations.   Material
below these foundations would have to be removed to prepare for heavier
foundations. The turbo-generator blocks, which would be subject to dynamic
load, would be piled.
Meteorological Data
4.        The site and the Morupule mine lies on latitude 220 31' south and
longitude 260 53' east at an approximatE elevation of 950 m, and its

ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 5
climate is hot and dry as is usually associated with savanna grassland.
The main rainfall season is from November to March, with October and April
being considered as transitional months.  Nearly all the rainfall is from
thunderstorms with an average number of about 50 electric storms per
annum.    The mean  annual  rainfall at Palapye  is  about 420 mm  and at
Mahalapye 470 mm. Raintall greater than 80 mm over 24 hours is not unusual
with consequent flash floods damaging bridges, culverts, etc. The highest
temperatures occur in January, averaging 320C.  The coolest month is July
with an average minimum of 450c.   Accurate wind speeds  have not  been
recorded appropriately. Wind speeds in Zambia, however, are recorded up to
110 km/h with some instantaneous gust of up to about 153 km/h.
Transportation and Access to the Site
5.         The site lies some 10 km west of Palapye and approximately 1 km
north of the main Palapye-Serowe road (map IBRD 16099).  Consequently, it
is close to the main north-south  road artery of Botswana.   This is an
all-weather road from Gaborone to Serowe and Gaborone has good all-weather
roads connecting it through the RSA highways to the main harbors of RSA.
The main Zimbabwe-South Africa rail line follows the line of the road very
closely.  A branch line from this railroad passes directly to the Morupule
mine and a spur line to the powerhouse could easily be constructed.
Power Station
6.          The power station structure would be clad with plastic-coated
metal sheeting which would be fixed to the main concrete frame by steel
cladding. A flat concrete roof has been proposed for the turbine hall with
cooling condensers above the roof.  Ventilation will be effected by siting
air inlets in the form of iouvres at the lowest elevation on the south face
of the switchgear annexed to corresponding outlets at higher elevation on
the southern face of the bunker  bay.   Mechanical  ventilation would  be
provided for the room which is constantly occupied and/or contains
sensitive equipment.
Site Services
7.        Surface water run-off will be drained towards a central west-east
spine from which the main discharge will be to the south where the water
will be allowed to disperse over the ground surface. Possible pollution of
local groundwater (paras. 3.28-3.30) will be prevented by means of traps
leading to impervious evaporating pans to prevent noxious substance
contaminating  the  surface  run-off.   Foul  drainage  will be  taken to a

central treatment plant and the water recirculated for watering grass since
fresh water will be at a premium.  Suitable treated sewage effluents will
be used for sluicing purposes in the ash disposal plant.
Boilers, Turbines and Generators
8.          One standard 150 tonne per hour  pulverized coal-fired balanced
draft fan boiler will be provided for each turbine generator unit.   The
throttle steam conditions are 86 Bar (1,247 lb/in2, 9500F or 5100C and
optimum exhaust steam pressure will be 0.20 Bar (2.90 lb/in2 or 5.90 in.
Hg). Boilers will be connected on a range system.
9.         The turbine generator unit would be of a proven standard design
with a direct drive to the alternator. Each of the units would be equipped
with two high pressure stop values with one amergency guide closing type in
order to isolate the turbine from the flow of high pressure steam.   The
turbine would be nozzle controlled.  Each turbine would be fitted with an
automatic speed governor with a hydraulic system. In addition to the speed
governor, each unit will be titted with two emergency governors which will
cause steam to be shut-off to the unit at approximately 10% overspeed.
Each unit would be equipped with a complete oil system in order to provide
oil for both control and lubrication purposes.  The system would comprise
essentially an oil tank, a main oil pump, strainers and tnree motor-driven
standby oil pumps (one to be driven by a d.c. motor).
1O.        The generators' output voltage will be 11 kV and auxiliaries 6
kV.  Each generator will be equipped with a 40.4 kVA main transformer and
an 11 MVA auxiliary transformer.
Condensing, Feed Heating and Cooling System
11.        The air cooled steam condensers would be the draught type, each
capable of condensing the steam from one turbine generator, with all the
turbine valves open, and with throttle steam inlet condition (para. 10).
The air-cooled steam condensers would be designed with a performance
consistent with an optimized turbine/air cooLed condenser arrangement. The
condensers will also be able to maintain full load on the turbine under
extremes of ambient conditions. The Van Eck power plant (30 MW x 4) in RSA
has  provided  an  important  precedent  in  the  use  of  air-cooled  steam
condensers.   The very satisfactory results obtained from this plant have
led  SWA  (Namibia)  to  construct  a 3,600  MW  power  plant  based  on  an
air-cooled system.
12.        Miscellaneous plant and equipment such as emergency gas turbine
for black  start,  fire protection system,  compressed air equipment,  air
conditioning and ventilation system, maintenance workshop, cranes, lifts,
chemical laboratory, storage building will be constructed on the basis of
optimization studies and general engineering practices.

Water Supply and Treatment Plant
13.       The peak day water demand of the power plant would be about 2,500
m3/day, for 180 MW capacity including the second phase development.   The
capacity of the water system includes an allowance for the coal mine and
villages, 10% losses, 5/ spare capacity for the power station and 15% spare
capacity  for  the  mine  and  village.    Water  will  be  supplied  from  a
wellfield at the escarpment sandstones about 50 km in the north of the
plant site. A single asbestos-cement pipeline will be constructed between
the sandstones and the site. A raw water reservoir would be constructed at
the power station having a capacity of 18,000 m3.
14.       Two levels of treatment would be provided.  For domestic supplies
the water must be potable, but for boiler feed make-up the water must
be treated for boiler use by deionization after filtration.  The chemical
analysis of raw water has shown that its quality is reasonable for the
above purposes and that more sophisticated water treatment is not
necessary.
Coal Supplies and Handling
15.       Coal would be supplied directly from Morupule Colliery, loaded by
suitable means onto a long cross-country, troughed, belt conveyor running
between the colliery and the power station screening/crushing house.  The
rating of the conveyor will be 350 tons  per hour.   A weigher will be
installed at the receiving end of the belt. The belt will also be equipped
by a magnetic trash separator and screens to trap the ferrous metals in the
coal. Pulverized coal will be prepared in ball mills and will be stored in
the boiler house bunkers.  Pulverized coal will be fed into the boiler by
an automatic pneumatic system.
16.       Two distinct type of coal storage would be provided at the power
station, a long-term storage pile for a 4-month demand and a live storage
pile  in  the  outaoor  coal  park.    Live  storage  would  be  kept  moving
continuously and would never exceed two or three days' capacity before
being replaced to eliminate fire possibilities.
Ash and Dust Handling System
17.       Boilers will be equipped with high efficiency (98%) electrostatic
precipitators  for  the  fly  ash.    Fly  ash will  be  transported  to  and
discharged into bunkers by a pneumatic system, and to a sluice in the
boiler house.   Bottom ash would be discharged  into a sluiceway in the
boiler house basement from where it would be transported by a water jet
system to a suitably sized ash sump.   The ash and dust combined slurry
mixture would be removed by suction from the ash sump and pumped to the
disposal area to build ash dams to be designed to suit the material grading
and density of the ash.   The lagoons would need ash dams on all four
sites.   At the lagoons the overflow would be decanted and discharged to
evaporating pans.

Chimney
18.       The optimized solution is to build a single concrete chimney with
a height of about 100 m.   Final design will take into account the Bank
environmental guidelines for the first three 30 MW units.
Switchyard
19.         A 220-kV switchyard will be located adjacent to the powerhouse
with air blast circuit breakers.   Station generators will be connected to
the system through 14/220 kV transformers aiid 220 kV busbars.  Two 20 MVA
220/33 kV interbus transformer will be provicled to supply consumers located
at surrounding areas and also to supply power to the auxiliary system of
the plant in an emergency case and during startups. Coal handling and ash
disposal system will also be supplied from these transformers.  Two main
220-kV outgoing feeders, for Gaborone and Selebi-Phikwe, will be provided
to connect the power plant to the Northern and Southern Divisions.

FIRST POWER PRCJECT
Notes and Assumptions f or Financial Projections
1.         In preparing the financial projections BPC's FY82 budget has been
used as a base.
INCOME STATEMENTS
Revenues
2.            Forecast quantities  sold are detailed in Annex 4.  Forecast
revenues from BCL are based on the price agreement between BPC and BCL. To
achieve BPC's FY82-87 revenue objective, It has been assumed that tariff
increases for non BCL sales would be made at the commencement of each
fiscal year as follows:  1984 12%; 1985 12%; 1986 10%; 1987 10%.  In FY89
and 90 it is estimated that further increases of 4% and 7% respectively
would be needed to achieve an 8% rate of return on average revalued net
fixed assets.
Expenses
3.            Inflation  is assumed at 12% from FY82 through FY84 and 10%
thereafter.
Salaries and Wages
4.         Projected expenses take into account anticipated changes in staff
requirements during the period.
Fuel and Imported Energy
5.          Costs are based on engineering estimates of imports and plant
utilization to meet the projected demand.
Maintenance
6.         Based on engineering estimates taking into account change in type
of plant used.
Depreciation
7.        An average rate of 4% has been used.

BALANCE SHEETS AND CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS
Fixed Assets
8.          Fixed assets and related accumulated depreciation at March 31,
1981 are based on a revaluation by BPC's consultants, Merz and McLellan.
To maintain these assets at current values they have been revalued
annually, using estimated inflation rates of 12% for FY82 through FY84 and
10% thereafter.
Cash for Operating Requirements
9.        This is assumed at 52 days cash operating expenses.
Accounts Receivable
10.       Basea on BPC's experience, it has been assumed that about 42 days
sales would be outstanding.
Creditors
11.        These are estimated at 21.65% of cash operating expenses (about
79 days).
Project Finance
12.        IBRD, Government and co-lender finance will be or is expected to
be available to BPC on the following terms:

BOTSWANA
POWER PROJECT
Economic Analysis - Least Cost Solution
Comparison Morupule 90 MW Power Station vs.
ESCOM 90 MW 220-kV Interconnection
The bases of the comparison of page 3 of this annex are as follow:
1. Morupule 90 MW Power Station
(a) Capital Costs - Units Nos. 1, 2 and 3
Capital  cost  per  appraisal  estimate  at  shadow  price  excluding
taxes:
(i) Imported materials at estimate less 207% SACU rebate
(ii) Semi-skilled local labor at estimate
(iii)  Unskilled  local  labor  (50%  of  local  labor)  at  50%  of
estimate
(iv) Engineering at estimate
(b)  Morupule 90 MW Power Station - Units 4, 5 and 6
56% of cost of units Nos. 1, 2 and 3 because much of civil works,
etc. will have been constructed in Phase 1.
(c)  Operating Costs - averaging 0.376 th/kWh
K & D carried out extensive studies to determine the economic cost
of coal which is estimated at P 5.4/ton.
(i) Morupule Coal - Because the station will now be able to
burn coal of lower calorific value including middlings, a
factor of 80% has been utilized to reflect this and an
economic price of P 4.5/ton has been used.
(ii) Labor - skilled and semi-skilled at financial estimated
costs, unskilled at 50% of financial estimates.
(iii)  Miscellaneous other costs at 10% of Morupule coal costs.
(d) Savings on Selebi-Phikwe
Since the cost of Selebe generation would be less than the cost of
the ESCOM tariff, Morupule operating costs have been reduced



- 61 -
ANNEX 15
Page 2 of 3
by the coal savings on the additLonal Selebi-Phikwe output which
would be generated, if the ESCOM alternative were to be selected.
With the Morupule option, fuel savings would be achieved by
substituting some of the Selebi-Phikwe generation by Morupule
generation.    These  saved GWh hive been costed at 95% of the
difference between the P 4.5/ton economic cost at Morupule and the
P 8.5/ton economic cost delivered at Selebi-Phikwe as per K & D's
base case.
2. ESCOM 90 MW Interconnection
(a)  Capital cost of the interconnection was based on 130 km double
circuit 220 kV line within RSA,  L5 km double circuit 220 kV line
in Botswana, 2 terminals in RSA and 2 terminals in Botswana. The
transmission line was costed at P 150,000/km and the terminals at
P 2 million each. 20% SACU rebate was deducted from the Botswana
part of the estimate.
(b)  The cost of the second 90 MW was assumed to be single circuit,
since the first phase would already provide for the security of
transmission.
(c)  ESCOM Tariff Costs
These are calculated on the current ESCOM tariffs as of September
1981, converted to Pula at R 1 = P' 0.9565:
(i)  Maximum demand R 7.7/kW per month (P 7.37/kW) including 10%
surcharge.
(ii) Energy charge of 1.079 R cents/kWh (inclusive of fuel
surcharge) (1.135 th/kWh) Including 10% surcharge.
(iii)  A discount of 10% on (i) alid (ii) above.
(iv) A SACU rebate of 20% on discounted total of (i) and (ii).
The resulting net economic tariffs were about P 5.306/kW/month and
and 0.8175 th/kWh.

Basis for Calculation of Economic Rate of Return
The following methodology was used in calculating the Economic Rate of
Return:
(1) Shadow Prices
(a) Imported materials - ESCOM tariff 80% (less 20% SACU)
(b) Local labor - 50% unskilled at 50%
- 50% semi-skilled at 100%
(c)  Local costs - 35% fuel and material - 80% (less 20% of SACU)
(d)  Foreign engineering services (7.5% of total capital costs) - 100%
(e)  Coal - 80% border prices (less 20% SACU)
(f)  All other at 100% financial prices
(2)   Basis  for calculating  costs at shadow prices in 1981/82 constant
terms:
(a) Capital Costs
(i)    The Project - project cost estimates
(ii)   Units Nos. 4, 5 and 6 - 56% of generation project cost
since an estimated 44% will have been built with project
(iii)  Unit No. 5 Selebe-Phikwe - offers received by BPC
(iv)   Other transmission construction,  etc. - consultants  and
BPC estimate
(v)    Construction for major consuimers - 56% of estimated cost
since these lines will take 44% more load without
significant additions, i.e., through 1999/2000
(b) Operating Cost
Mi)    Generating  cost  Morupule  - project  estimates  based  on
local forecasts until 1989/90 when capacity fully loaded
(ii)   Generating cost other - financial estimates

Page 2 of 3
(iii) ESCOM tariff - loading forecast at 1981 tariff level
(iv)   Transmission and aistribution costs - financial estimates
(v)    SCADA - project estimates
(3) Benefits
(a) Benefits have been calculatd at existing tariff levels for
projected load forecasts through 1989/90 when capacity will be
fully utilized.
(b) No residual values have been included at the end of the 34 year
discount period, since this has been assumed to be the useful
life of the 30-MW units.
