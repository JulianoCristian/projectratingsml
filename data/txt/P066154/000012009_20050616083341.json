The\n            principal objective of the PSMAL was to improve public\n            sector management in order to provide the basis for\n            sustained economic growth, and improve the living conditions\n            for the country's poor. While addressing a broad range\n            of generic issues of public sector management, the PSMAL\n            focused specifically on the management of health care\n            expenditures, which are both a source of fiscal risk and a\n            key element of the Government's effort to reduce\n            poverty. In view of the overall performance and progress\n            with the implementation of the program supported by the\n            Loan, and in compliance with the specific conditions of\n            release referred to in Section 2.02 (d) of the Loan\n            Agreement, and described in the attached Tranche Release\n            Document, it is recommended that the Bank release the second\n            tranche of US$ 19.85 million to the Borrower."}, "docdt": "2005-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
