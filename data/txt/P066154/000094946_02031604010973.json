stability, and fiscal discipline.\n            The main objectives of the project are to: 1) strengthen\n            capacity at the center of Government, to implement reforms;\n            2) strengthen fiscal discipline within a strong\n            accountability, and transparency framework, 3) improve\n            strategic prioritization within a fiscal plan; 4) improve\n            the efficiency in program, and service delivery in the\n            medium-term; and, 5) seek a merit, and performance based\n            civil service, capable of supporting the reform strategy.\n            Sustainable fiscal budget commitments, and policy\n            implementation, will be accomplished through new legislation\n            governing the issuance of Government guarantees, and\n            accountable policy formulation. Nonetheless, the security\n            crisis risks an ensured macroeconomic, and fiscal stability,\n            though implementation of the Framework Agreement should test\n            the Government's capacity to implement the program.\n            Also, the risk of policy reversal, will be minimized by\n            ensuring that approval of lending operations only occurs\n            once substantial prior actions have been undertaken, and,\n            that substantial technical assistance supports reforms\n            comprised in the adjustment lending."}, "docdt": "2002-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
