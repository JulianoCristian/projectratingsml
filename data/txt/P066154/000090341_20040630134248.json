    was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory,. The lessons learned indicate that at first\n            glance, the Public Sector Management Adjustment Loan (PSMAC)\n            experience would appear to confirm the familiar adage that\n            Government commitment is essential to reform-and that\n            reforms should not be attempted where Government commitment\n            is lacking. If these lessons had been observed the PSMAC\n            would never have been attempted. No management reforms would\n            have been discussed until at least January 2003 and the most\n            politically controversial reforms--particularly in civil\n            service and health care--would still remain off the reform\n            agenda. In retrospect, the PSMAL experience suggests a more\n            nuanced set of lessons. It suggests that while unanimous\n            Government support for reform is desirable, Bank efforts\n            should not be delayed until it exists. The PSMAC also\n            supports the case for programmatic adjustment lending.\n            Although the follow-on operations (PSMAL, PSAL1 and PSAL2)\n            are structured as independent operations, they provide a\n            means to ensure that reforms introduced under the PSMAC are\n            sustained and extended."}, "docdt": "2004-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
