governance reform program. The\n            fiscal reform program aims for fiscal stabilization to\n            reduce the debt burden and restore sustainability to public\n            finances, improve public resource mobilization, and\n            restructure public spending toward priority development\n            areas. This is accompanied by public expenditure management\n            reform to strengthen financial management capacity and\n            institutions, improve the realism and credibility of the\n            budget, enhance fiscal transparency and accountability, and\n            introduce greater efficiency to operational management. The\n            program of governance reform includes strengthening\n            anti-corruption efforts, civil service reform, electronic\n            governance, public enterprise reform, and a program of\n            poverty monitoring and analysis. There are fourteen specific\n            triggers or prerequisite actions that had to be completed\n            for the APERL, which, as detailed in this report, have been\n            completed. The expected beenfits proceeding from this\n            project are: 1) strengthening the government's fiscal\n            and financial health; 2) a more conducive investment climate\n            for private sector growth; 30 more efficient and effective\n            public service delivery; and 4) improved social outcomes and\n            reduced poverty. The loan/credit will be disbursed in one tranche."}, "docdt": "2002-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
