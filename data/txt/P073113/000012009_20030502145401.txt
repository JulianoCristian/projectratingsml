3.  Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1
Original Objective:
a) State background: 
The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy in India—discussed by the Board in April 
2001—identifies focus states on the basis of demonstrated commitment to broad based reforms, particularly in the 
areas of fiscal management, power sector, and governance.  One of India’s leading reforming states, Andhra 
Pradesh (AP) is a focus state for the Bank.
AP is the first Indian state to articulate a far-reaching vision for its economic and social development
 
through the 
Vision 2020
 document in 1999. It is a statement of intent to pursue economic growth, develop human 
capital and reduce poverty. The process to attain this vision has been laid out in a series of strategy papers and
 
implementation of these strategies is ongoing. Moving forward on its development agenda, the Government of
 
Andhra Pradesh has made progress on a number of fronts.
AP is the fifth largest state in India with a population of 76 million. At US$390 in 1999, the per capita 
income of AP is 90 percent of the all-India average. During the 1990s the state economy grew at 5.3 percent per 
year, which was below the national average of 6.2. It is however expected that with reforms deepening, the growth 
rate will accelerate in the coming years.
While there has been a major debate on the absolute size of decline in poverty in the 1990s in India, the 
trend by all calculations has been downward and the overall achievement fairly good. In AP, according to one
 
study (Deaton and Dreze, 2002), the trend in the proportion of the population below the poverty line has moved as

b. Loan/Credit Objective: 
The main objective of the Andhra Pradesh Economic Reform Loan/Credit (APERL) is to 
support the fiscal and governance reform programs of the Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP). These
 
programs are part of GoAP’s strategy to achieve the economic and social development goals set out in its
 
Vision 
2020
.
The overarching objective of the fiscal reform program—laid out in GoAP’s Fiscal Reforms Strategy
 
Paper, January 2002
1
—is to improve public service delivery and expand development programs by increasing the 
efficiency and effectiveness of public resources. The program aims at fiscal stabilization by reducing the overall
 
debt burden, improving resource mobilization and restructuring public spending towards priority areas. Specific
 
fiscal targets are laid out in the State’s Medium Term Fiscal Framework, which is a five-year program to be
 
rolled-over annually. Also included in the fiscal reform program is a strategy to improve budgetary processes and 
strengthen financial management.
The program of governance reform includes strengthening anti-corruption efforts, improving civil service 
performance, expanding electronic governance, restructuring and/or privatizing public enterprises, and a program 
of poverty monitoring and analysis. 
The APERL program had fourteen specific upfront action “triggers” designed to strengthen the 
government’s reform program. All of these actions were completed prior to the loan approval. Information on 
- 2 -
Page  6
progress on these and related issues is provided in Section 4 below and indicators of performance are listed in 
Annex 1. The Bank program also lists several related follow-up actions as measures for 2002-03, which would 
form the basis for a subsequent adjustment operation. During 2002-03, GoAP has made progress on many of these 
fronts, which is also discussed in Section 4.

4.  Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1  
Outcome/achievement of objective:
This sub-section summarizes the achievements under APERL and lists the ongoing challenges that remain.
a.  Achievements
  
Andhra Pradesh has made steady progress on most fronts in its reform program under APERL. The State has 
been able to meet its key fiscal targets in 2001-02, as laid out in its Medium Term Fiscal Reform Program.
 
(Preliminary numbers for 2002-03, based on revised budgetary estimates, indicate that the overall fiscal
 
performance has been satisfactory.) Achievements in the area of public expenditure management and financial
 
accountability are impressive; there are many lessons to be learnt from this experience. Governance reforms
 
continue to move forward in the e-governance area. The GoAP’s agenda of public enterprise reform has made
 
steady progress and the program is now in its second phase. The work on institutionalizing the process of poverty 
monitoring has been initiated though its pace has been quite slow.
b. Ongoing and future challenges 
The economics of power sector continues to be a major development challenge for GoAP. Serious structural 
problems have affected power sector finances, which in turn, has had a significant impact on the overall fiscal
 
situation of the State. Fiscal gains achieved in the rest of the economy in 2001-02 were nullified by the increasing 
financial losses of the power sector. Based on preliminary numbers, a similar story emerges for 2002-03. GoAP
 
continues to struggle with the difficult issue of power subsidy to the farm community. The fact that 2002 has been a 
drought year has worsened the situation. Since power sector finances form such an important component of the
 
overall fiscal balance in the state, unless they improve in a meaningful way, the state’s fiscal situation would not 
stabilize. In turn, power sector finances are not likely to improve on a sustainable basis unless the government
 
adequately addresses the supply and pricing issues in the agriculture sector.
Other areas where there has been mixed progress are civil service reform, right to information and anticorruption. 
Since May 2002, relatively little progress has been made, for example, in implementing the GoAP’s strategy for 
- 3 -
Page  7
strengthening the capacity and independence of existing anticorruption institutions and streamlining disciplinary
 
procedures. The Revenue Reform Committee has been established by a Government Order, but it has not really
 
done any meaningful work to provide assistance in revenue reform.
2
4.2  
Outputs by components:
The following paragraphs provide details of each of the three main components along which APERL is
 
structured:
I.
Fiscal and Power Sector Issues
A key objective of the APERL has been to assist GoAP in reducing the fiscal deficit to a sustainable level, 
while restructuring expenditure allocation towards priority development outlays. The fiscal objectives of the
 
government are laid out in its Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) from 2001-02 through 2006-07. The
 
MTFF was published as part of the GoAP’s Fiscal Reforms Strategy paper in January 2002 and is in the process of 
being revised.
a.  Fiscal and power sector performance in 2001-02
The fiscal deficit target for 2001-02 in the MTFF was 5.0% of GSDP. GoAP achieved a stronger adjustment 
at 4.5% of GSDP. This cushion allowed GoAP to meet its “consolidated fiscal deficit” target of the year (5.6% of 
GSDP), despite higher losses in the power sector.
3
 
Both these fiscal targets were part of APERL milestones
In order to understand the nature of fiscal adjustment, a break-down of revenue and expenditure categories is 
provided below:
Revenue performance
While GoAP’s own revenue was on target, transfers from the Government of India (GoI) were lower by 0.05 
percent point of GSDP. This latter shortfall would have been higher (about 0.3 percent point of GSDP) if the
 
APERL assistance was not passed to the state in the standard 70 (loan)-30(grant) format that governs plan
 
transfers from the central to state governments. The MTFF had assumed that this assistance would come in the
 
form of a 100% loan. The 70-30 mix led to an increase in revenues (grants) by Rs. 396 crore.
Expenditure changes
The reduction in fiscal deficit of 0.5 percent of GSDP was mainly achieved by a net reduction in expenditure. 
An examination of revenue  expenditure (see Table 1) shows that GoAP marginally exceeded the MTFF target on 
non-wage O&M, while savings were realized in interest, salaries and pensions and other expenditure.
 
A few details 
on the composition are as follows:
Reduction in the interest expenditure from that estimated in the MTFF due to softer interest rate regime 
l
and less borrowing. This resulted in a saving of  0.2% of GSDP. 
The MTFF overestimated salary and pension expenditure by 0.2% of  GSDP. Savings in salaries were 
l
realized largely under the Grants-in-Aid to educational institutions and Dearness Allowance.
In the area of transfers and subsidies, GoAP’s spent 0.15% (of GSDP) less than the MTFF estimate. The 
l
reduction in rice subsidy, however, was somewhat undermined by higher power subsidy. The power 
subsidy in 2001-02 was 0.1 percent point higher than the MTFF estimate.
More resources were spent on non-wage O&M than budgeted in the MTFF.  This was mainly due to 
l
higher expenditure on maintenance of rural roads.

Table 1: Fiscal Performance in 2001-02 (in Rs. crore)
The power sector
While the budgetary performance in 2001-02 was better than targeted, financial performance of the power 
sector has been a matter of serious concern. Power sector losses for 2001-02 have been Rs 449 crore over and above 
the MTFF target of Rs 2437 crore.
4 
(See Table 2 below) The losses occurred mainly due to three reasons: (a) A
 
shortfall in revenue due to additional supply to agriculture consumers, especially in the last quarter of the financial 
year; and (b) adverse changes in sales mix; (c) higher T&D losses. Additional power was purchased during the
 
year which was 1400 million units over the budgeted amount, imposing an additional cost of Rs 316 crore. Of this 
1400 million units, 900 was supplied to agriculture, which was 9% more than what was budgeted.
5
 
To finance
 
these losses, the Power Finance Corporation (APPFC) has issued bonds worth Rs 350 crore and the remainder is
 
being carried as arrears on the books of APPFC.

(in Rs crore)
FY 2001-02
Variation
In APERL’s Letter of Development Policy, GoAP had committed to universal metering in accordance
 
with the directives of the AP Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC). Moreover, it had indicated that a
 
special task force has been set up “to design, implement and monitor pilot projects involving alternative subsidy
 
delivery mechanisms for the supply of electricity to farmers…” On agricultural metering, the progress has been 
quite slow. All new agriculture connections are now metered and in the current fiscal year about 30,000 agriculture 
commections have been metered. GoAP’s plan for metering existing agriculture connections is back-loaded and
 
spread over 2003-07. On the work of special task force, there is some recent progress after initial setbacks. Three 
pilot projects in four locations have been initiated by the Task Force. Baseline data collection and analysis is
 
underway. At present, the discussions on alternate subsidy delivery mechanisms are restricted to examination of
 
experiences in other countries and in other states to address the issue of subsidies and targeting. Based on its initial 
deliberations, the task force agrees that measurement of electricity consumption would be essential for the success 
and robustness of any mechanism designed.
The issue of agriculture metering and targeting subsidy is a structural one and in the absence of a
 
meaningful solution, power sector finances are unlikely to improve.
6
 Besides the increased subsidy to the
 
agriculture community, there are a few other factors that have contributed to the higher than estimated power
 
sector losses in 2001-02. These include, among others, non realization of efficiency improvements in lowering
 
T&D losses and inadequate tariff increases. In turn, this will continue to impinge on the state’s ability to improve 
its overall finances.
The good efforts of GoAP in improving billing and collections by vigorously implementing anti-theft
 
legislation, have been offset by the increasing cost of subsidized supply to agriculture. As a result, the financial
 
performance of the power sector has deteriorated.
 
b.  Fiscal and power sector performance  for 2002-03: Based on preliminary numbers 
The MTFF targets a reduction in the consolidated deficit in 2002-03 to 4.6% of GSDP (from 5.6%,
 
achieved in 2001-02). Preliminary fiscal information, as reflected in GoAP’s revised budgetary estimates, is
 
reported below in Table 3. The revised estimate for 2002-03 puts consolidated fiscal deficit at 5.1%. (All the deficit 
targets for 2002-03, including the consolidated deficit, were based on a SAL revenue grant of Rs. 630 crore, which 
did not materialize.  If the deficit targets are adjusted to reflect this fact, the fiscal performance in 2002-03 appears 
to be quite favorable. The consolidated deficit target becomes 5.1%.) Table 3 also indicates that in the face of a
 
revenue shortfall, GoAP adjusted its expenditures to meet its deficit targets.

(Revised Budgetary Estimates)
The power sector
The consolidated Profit and Loss statement of the power generation, transmission and distribution companies 
for 2002-03 (as filed to the regulator in December 2002) projects a net loss of about Rs 2329 crore, which is 537 
crore above the loss as estimated in the Business Plan. (Revised projections available from GoAP in February 2003 
puts this loss number as Rs. 1,954 crore.) Table 4 below shows a comparison of this projected performance against 
that of  Business Plan estimates (as well as those approved by the regulatory commission).
7
 
The data show that
 
revenues likely to materialize in the year are higher than ARR targets, but lower than the target projected in the
 
Business Plan. The change in revenue was due to higher share of power being sold to the subsidized tariff
 
categories though higher revenue was realized from higher than predicted HT-1 sales. On the expenditure side,
 
more thermal power has been purchased due to lower than planned availability of hydro-power for drought related 
reasons. According to GoAP’s calculations, the changed hydro-thermal mix increased the power purchase cost by
 
Rs. 464 crore. Besides reducing the availability of less expensive hydro-power, the drought has increased power 
demand for irrigation. Increased power supply to the agriculture sector is estimated to raise the power purchase
 
cost by Rs. 427 crore.

c.  Overall fiscal performance
Analyzing the fiscal numbers for 2001-02 (actual) and 2002-03 (preliminary), and reflecting on trends from 
earlier  years, a few broad conclusions can be drawn:
GoAP’s overall management of deficits in the past couple of years has been satisfactory (see Table 5
 
l
below). More specifically, in the last couple of years, the Department of Finance has been quite serious
 
about tailoring expenditures to incoming revenues—when revenues fell below estimates, expenditures
 
were adjusted to meet deficit targets.
Major financial losses in the power sector have nullified the fiscal performance and affected the
 
l
consolidated deficit targets. There is a decline in losses, but not at the projected level (Table 6).
In bringing the deficits down, total outlays on priority public spending like primary health and education, 
l
and capital outlays have been protected (see Table 7 below).

The Revenue Reforms Commission constituted by GoAP has not made much progress so far.
8
 
It was created 
in January 2002 by a Government Order and was required to submit a report within six months on a variety of state 
specific tax and non-tax issues including tax base expansion and revenue enhancement. In the light of the fact that 
inputs from the Commission’s report were expected to help the Annual Fiscal Framework (AFF) for 2003-04, this 
has been a disappointment.
9 
The Fiscal Reforms Implementation Committee, which was also set up recently, has undertaken three studies. 
These include a study on debt swapping to take advantage of lower interest rates, modifying the pattern of
 
grant-in-aid to colleges and commodity wise contribution to sales tax revenue. These reports are under
 
consideration. 
A
 
Medium Term Expenditure Framework
 
(MTEF) is under development in the primary health sub-sector, as 
a pilot for the introduction of medium term planning across all departments in future. The MTEFs would estimate 
the total resource envelope (off budget and on budget) available in these sectors and develop appropriate strategies 
to meet the Vision 2020 targets.
II.
Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability
GoAP’s reform program in budgetary and financial management area is laid out in its Fiscal Reforms
 
Strategy Paper published in January 2002. A number of the sub-components of this program are supported by
 
APERL. The following paragraphs provides a few details of achievements in the different components of their
 
reform program  
a.   Public Expenditure Management
As part of this program, significant progress was made during 2000-01 and 2001-02 in the establishment of a 
credible budget, in the orderly delivery of resources to line departments, and in starting to encourage greater
 
efficiency in resource use. The measures adopted have been further enhanced during 2002-03.  Some of these
 
achievements are:
Effective aggregate budget management
.
 The adoption of the Medium Term Fiscal Framework has
 
l
provided the tool for effective aggregate budget management. This guides the preparation of the Annual 
Fiscal Framework (AFF), within which the detailed annual budget is then developed. The idea is to widely 
disseminate (about a month  in advance) this blue print of the budget and invite comments from all
 
stakeholders. Appropriate adjustments are then made in light of the suggestions/comments received. The 
AFF for 2002-03 was posted on the GoAP’s Web site and comments were solicited from all stakeholders. 
The budget that was eventually passed by the legislature, reflected several of the suggestions that were
 
made. GoAP has once again put out its AFF for 2003-04 in preparation of its annual budget, in addition to 
revenue and expenditures by economic classification, provided indicative sector expenditure ceilings.
Hard budget ceilings, and greater flexibility to Line Departments
.
  The AFF has allowed hard budget 
l
ceilings to be set for the line departments at the beginning of the budget process. A key component of
 
GoAP’s reform program as well as an important milestone for APERL, this is one of the many successful 
features of AP’s improved public expenditure management. Within these ceilings the line departments
 
have been given greater responsibility and flexibility to prioritize their expenditures,
10 
and to
 
re-appropriate budgets within prescribed norms. This has been aided by aggregating budget sub-heads for 
smaller schemes,
11
 and by de-linking salary budgets from scheme budgets (this removes a major incentive 
to keep old/discontinued /completed schemes open). During a zero-based review of schemes during the
 
2001-02 budget process, 20,000 staff associated with non-performing schemes were identified for
 
redeployment; it is understood that these constitute the major part of approximately 17,000 that have since 
been redeployed to local governments. The process of rationalizing schemes is ongoing.  As a result, the 
Budget Book has been reduced from about 5200 pages in 2001-02 to about 4000 pages in 2002-03, and 
2700 in 2003-04.  
Improved budget release mechanisms
.
 The fiscal framework and the hard budget constraints have
 
l
- 10 -
Page  14
enabled the Finance Department to make 6-month budget releases at the beginning of the financial year, 
and to make credible commitment to quarterly releases in the second half of the year. The new budget
 
release system also provides for accommodating line departments’ seasonal variations in expenditure. The 
timing of budget releases is expected to become even more responsive to line departments’ requirements 
in 2003-04 when the latter begin providing information on their quarterly funds flow requirements to the 
Finance Department (as required by Government Order 506, May 2002).
12
 
The old system undermined
 
planning, reduced efficiency in the use of limited resources available, and prevented line departments
 
from being held accountable for performance. Discussions with line departments indicate that the system 
is viewed as highly beneficial in providing a predictable flow of funds which is largely consistent with the 
budget and with the progress in implementing schemes,
13 
and of the reduction in bureaucracy and
 
discretion over releases that had been exercised by the Finance Department. The system now provides the 
assurance to line departments that they will receive the funds budgeted, when they are required. The new 
structured monthly payment schedule system (within each month)
14
 
however has increased the need for 
line departments, particularly those with substantial works expenditure, to plan better and be prompt in 
preparation and submission of bills to the treasury.
Improved cash management.
 
The improved budget release system indicated above, combined with the
 
l
new structured payment schedule system (within each month) have facilitated better cash management by 
the Finance Department, including better matching of receipt and expenditure cash flows. In 2001-02,
 
GoAP had resorted to substantial use of overdrafts from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a cash
 
management tool, while fully conforming to the RBI’s overdraft norms.
15
 
This situation was in large part 
attributed to: (i) receipts from Government of India devolutions, and the Bank’s Adjustment Loan/Credit 
proceeds, being substantially delayed beyond the dates originally planned by GoAP; (ii) the Finance
 
Department’s strategy that establishing credibility of the new budget release system (which started in
 
2001-02) and securing the confidence of the line departments in this system was extremely crucial. The
 
Finance Department deliberately chose overdrafts as the preferred option (instead of restricting payments 
or holding back releases to line departments). The Finance Department indicated that stabilization and
 
initial success of the new system is demonstrated in: (i) a noticeable lack of the traditional ‘rush’ of
 
expenditures towards the end of the last fiscal year (2001-02); and (ii) during 2002/03, the reduction in 
the number of days in overdraft to only 17 days in the first nine months of the year. 
Incentives to provide better services and collect user charges: A new initiative
.
  The modified initiative
16
 
l
to provide incentives (in the form of supplementary budgets) to line departments for providing enhanced 
quality of services and collecting additional user charges is reported to be steadily taking-off, particularly 
in departments such as transport, police, education, health, stamps and registration, excise, commercial
 
taxes, horticulture and agriculture. For 2002-03 the amount collected is reported to have been Rs. 103
 
crore by January 2003.
None of these initiatives is fully complete, and work is ongoing to strengthen these institutions and
 
processes, and to iron out remaining bureaucratic delays in the cash management system. The system
 
continues to be refined as experience increases on what works and what does not. Nonetheless the
 
progress so far provides the central foundations for effective public expenditure management and makes it 
possible for the focus to increasingly shift to improving the use of resources within the line departments, 
and to hold them more accountable for performance. It is on this platform that new initiatives focusing on 
improving prioritization, effectiveness and efficiency of expenditures in line departments commenced in 
2002-03 as described below.
Two new initiatives introduced  in 2002-03.
 
First, the GoAP is seeking to better link the allocation of
 
public expenditure to outputs and outcomes. Performance indicators for the departments have been developed and 
are reviewed regularly (quarterly) by the Chief Minister, Ministers and senior officials. Inevitably this has
 
presented challenges: an attempt to link releases to achievement outputs was set aside during 2002/03, and instead 
the overall outcomes expected from programs and the expenditures on those programs are being identified.
 
- 11 -
Page  15
Building upon this the GoAP Performance Budget was introduced as part of the 2003-04 budget preparation
 
process. Each line department was required to prepared a performance budget that identifies departmental
 
objectives, the annual work plan and the performance indicators and targets (drawing on the performance
 
monitoring system that has been established), and broadly linking these to the funds requested. In addition, The
 
Cabinet Sub-Committee (CSC) played the central role in considering the competing demands of the different line 
departments; this replaces a system within which the negotiation of individual department estimates was
 
essentially the job of the Finance Department alone. In addition, workshops were held at state and district levels to 
discuss the performance budgets prepared by the line departments with officials and the public. These were
 
facilitated by the performance budget format which is easier for people to understand and to relate the budget to
 
what departments actually do, than the traditional budget estimates.
17
 
This first time round, it is unlikely that the 
performance budget process has significantly impacted the content or quality of the budget itself, in part because of 
the very condensed period in which the budget was prepared and debated (effectively limited to a period of only
 
one month). However, it did bring a performance orientation to the debate about resource allocation and supported 
increased political engagement in the budget process, and thereby provided the basis for improving the quality of 
budgets in future years.  Second, an initiative commenced involving the preparation of MTEFs in two pilot
 
sub-sectors, namely primary health and primary education. The aim was to introduce medium term expenditure
 
planning, within the indicative ceiling of funds available, and to encourage more efficient allocation and use of
 
resources. The Education Department stalled, because the GoAP has not been able to obtain approval for the
 
international consultants who were to assist the Department. The Health Department is due to present its draft
 
MTEF this month, though it is understood the process has been slowed by the need for further development of the 
Department’s strategy. The aim remains, however, for a medium term approach to be adopted in all departments. 
This medium term planning approach is likely to be fruitful if it is preceded by a clear sectoral strategy.   
 
b.   Financial Management/Accountability 
In the past year, GoAP has taken several initiatives to strengthen public financial accountability systems 
in the state. These include: 
Strengthening internal controls and follow-up/responses to audit reports.
 Enforcement of internal
 
l
controls has been strengthened by linking release of funds to adherence to public financial accountability
 
norms (See Government Order 507, May 2002). These cover: (i) responses to audit reports/paras (CAG’s 
Inspection Reports, and CAG’s Audit Report); (ii) responses to Public Accounts Committee (PAC)
 
Reports; (iii) clearances of advances drawn for expenditures (Abstract Contingent Bills); (iv)
 
reconciliation of amounts among DDOs’, Treasury’s and Accountant General’s books; (v) control over
 
Personal Deposit Accounts and Bank Accounts outside the Consolidated Fund; and (vi) prompt
 
completion of accounts and audits of local bodies, public sector enterprises, autonomous bodies and other 
Grant-in-Aid institutions. Instructions have also been issued to tighten recovery of loans, advances, taxes 
and other dues to Government. The Finance Department has started monitoring compliance (monthly),
 
and has linked funds releases to adherence to these controls. All this has sent a strong signal to line
 
departments about the importance of compliance. Data from progress reports indicates good progress on 
reconciliation, responses to audits and PAC reports, submission of bills/expenditure statements for
 
advances, and progressive closure and write-back of Deposit accounts maintained outside the
 
Consolidated Fund. The results of the above measures will be confirmed in the Audit Report for 2002-03. 
Information is awaited on the status of responses to the latest Audit Reports of the State Government, i.e., 
for the year ended March 31, 2001.
Computerization initiatives
.
  Several initiatives are underway:
l
·
Implementation of a new improved Treasury system (E-Khazana based on Oracle RBDMS) 
in 18 districts (District Treasuries and Sub-treasuries), and is expected to be implemented in 
the remaining 5 districts by end-March 2003. 
·
Development of middleware to link the various financial systems and to form an Integrated 
Financial Information System (IFIS). This would link the various offices – Treasuries,
 
Finance Department, AG’s Office, Reserve Bank, banks and departments, and is expected to 
- 12 -
Page  16
become operational in the next few months.  
·
Generation of individual employees’ account statements for employees Insurance and
 
Provident Funds have been computerized. 
·
A decentralized computerized system for salaries has been developed and is being operated 
in the Treasuries; this is based on monthly inputs from Drawing and Disbursing Offices
 
(DDOs) of the various Departments.  This also provides for direct payment of salaries into
 
their Bank accounts, at the option of employees; about 23% of all employees (55% of
 
employees in the ‘notified areas’) have opted for this method of payment. The payroll itself 
has not been entirely computerized yet. Potential plans in the future could include a Human 
Resource Management System (which is being finalized) that could include elements of the 
recently completed civil service census and other human resource details, and that is linked 
to Treasuries.
Accounts and audit backlog.
  The Status Report as on January 31, 2003 for Urban Local Bodies, Rural 
l
Local Bodies, and Boards and Authorities and other institutions audited by the State Audit Department, 
indicates that overall progress is good vis-à-vis the 2002-03 Action Plan, although there are slippages on 
the Municipal Corporations (attributed to old backlog and problems with opening balances), Gram
 
Panchayats, and Hindu Religious (HR) and Charitable Endowment (CE) Institutions. The Status Report
 
also indicates the targets for 2003-04, that includes completion in 2003-04 of all current audits (i.e., for 
2002-03) and clearing of all backlog. Information on the status of clearance of backlog of proforma
 
accounts and audit of proforma accounts of the AP Government Life Insurance Department (AP
 
Government Life Insurance Fund, and Group Insurance Scheme) has not yet been made available.
Updating and modernization of financial codes and rules
.
 Work on updating the Financial Manuals
 
l
(Financial Code, Treasury Code, Budget Manual and Accounts Code), being carried out by a Working
 
Group consisting of officials of GoAP, Office of the AG, consultants and members of the Institute of
 
Chartered Accountants of India, is nearly complete. This will be sent to the Accountant General for
 
concurrence shortly.
  
Internal audit strengthening
.
 Significant work has been carried out on initiating internal audit in the
 
l
State Government: (a) An Internal Audit Manual has been prepared by a Working Group that included
 
officials of GoAP and Office of the AG, members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, and 
consultants. A training program was also conducted. This Manual will be used, and will be periodically
 
updated based on implementation experience and feedback received during subsequent training sessions; 
(b) work on internal audit will commence shortly, including the establishment of an Internal Audit Cell of 
5-6 people in the Finance Department.
    
Improving transparency
.
 Measures to enhance transparency in government accounts and procedures
 
l
include the following initiatives:
·
Publishing/Disclosure of half-yearly accounts
: Receipts and expenditure for 9 months of
 
2002-03 (up to December 2002) were included in the draft Annual Fiscal Framework that
 
was published on the web on January 22, 2003.  This was based on Monthly Accounts
 
received from AG up to November 2002 and GoAP’s data for December 2002. GoAP expects 
to start publishing monthly accounts on its Web site using the Monthly Accounts provided by 
the AG from April 2003 and  proposes to tie-up with the CAG’s proposed corresponding
 
initiative.
·
Guarantees and off-budget borrowings
: GoAP is currently implementing the
 
recommendations of the Reserve Bank of India’s  report prepared by the Committee of
 
Finance Secretaries. Guarantees are divided into six groups and risk weights assigned. GoAP 
will provide for meeting these risk weighted contingent liabilities in its ‘Guarantee
 
Redemption Fund’.
18
 
Information on government guarantees provided and off-budget
 
borrowings (actuals) are provided as part of the annual budget documents, and aggregate
 
- 13 -
Page  17
figures were included in the summary budget document for 2003-04.  To further improve
 
transparency, Government could consider publishing details of major government guarantees 
and off-budget borrowings in summary form including explanation of the individual
 
guarantee risk ratings, as well as budgets for guarantees and off-budget borrowings, in the
 
summary budget document (AP Budget in Brief).
State Financial Accountability Assessment (SFAA)
: The SFAA, commissioned by the GoAP from the
 
l
Centre for Good Governance,  commenced  in November 2002. The Finance Department is considering 
the consultants’ draft report; and a final draft report is expected by end-March 2003. This will be provided 
to the Bank for comments; and a process of consultation within Government, and with other stakeholders, 
is also expected to take place to determine the way forward. The Department of Finance has stressed
 
improving financial accountability within line departments as being the critical focus of PEM/FM efforts 
in the coming year.
III.
Governance Reforms  
Governance and public management has traditionally been an area of strength for GoAP. Progress continues 
to be good in areas where GoAP has historically placed its greatest emphasis, such as e-governance and human 
resource development. Additional progress is also being made in areas such as administrative deregulation to
 
promote private sector growth, or the management of GoAP’s legal agenda. However, advances in other areas,
 
such as anticorruption or the reform of human resource management (HRM), have been mixed. There has been 
limited progress in tackling systemic machinery of governance and HRM problems since May 2002, although there 
are signs that this agenda has gained momentum over the last two months. The Centre for Good Governance
 
initially became overly engaged in in monitoring the performance of line departments—a role that was  not part of 
its original mandate—but it has recently reoriented itself and is focusing upon providing analytic support to
 
reforms and disseminating examples of best practice.  
The specifics of the reform program are discussed below.
Developing a strategy for reform. 
GoAP has produced a White Paper on Governance Reform and made it 
l
available on the Government website; it created an Administrative Reform unit within the General
 
Administration Department to take this agenda forward; and it created the Center of Good Governence
 
(CGG).  The CGG is developing projects along six work streams and is likely to produce some 16 outputs 
by the end of the fiscal year.  The quality of some of these outputs, such as an assessment of the
 
effectiveness of citizens charters or a breakdown of the cases coming before the Administrative Tribunal, 
is high. GoAP has also recently created an Advisory Commission on People’s Empowerment (COPE),
 
which has been charged with improving service delivery, combating corruption, increasing productivity
 
and reducing administrative costs.
The implementation of two of these initiatives has been disappointing. First, the office of Administrative 
Reforms functioned for only a few months with minimal staff and has few lasting accomplishments to its 
credit. The recent identification of a talented senior officer to head this office, however, is a promising
 
sign.  Second, there have been a series of on-going disputes surrounding the CGG that have significantly 
hampered its effectiveness, and the contract for the KPMG consultants recruited for this effort will be
 
terminated at their request in March 2003.  The CGG initially became too heavily involved in monitoring 
implementation, but it is now in the process of stepping back to its original role and serving more as a
 
think tank, a source of best practice, and playing a facilitator role. 
Civil service reform.
  
 This reform agenda is a broad one and is marked by areas where GoAP has made 
l
progress, areas where it has not, and areas where progress has been mixed.  Areas where it has made
 
progress include the conduct of a civil service census (although this effort has been repeatedly delayed and 
the Bank has still not received a copy of the final report).  It includes efforts to establish a computerized 
human resource database.
19 
 GoAP has also met the formal goals for developing and publicizing citizens
 
- 14 -
Page  18
charters in at least 25 departments. GoAP is making a good faith effort to analyze its legal caseload to
 
reduce the number of cases pending before the high courts, and the CGG has made impressive progress to 
date on this agenda.
20
 
Work on HRD issues, including establishing training centers in all 23 districts and 
the identification and training of 10,000 “change agents,” is also proceeding in a highly satisfactory
 
fashion.
There are three areas where GoAP has not made significant progress in implementing its civil service
 
reform agenda.  One involves basic machinery of governance issues and the rationalization of
 
organizational missions, structure and functions to eliminate overlap and redundancy. (As a precursor,
 
GoAP agreed to develop formal organizational charts for all major departments, clarify their reporting
 
relationships, and disseminate it on the Internet).
21
 
The second is the review and simplification of HR
 
procedures, which should be one of the functions performed by the new wing in the General
 
Administrative Department (GAD) with responsibility for Administrative Reforms. A number of measures 
could usefully be taken in this area, including: (1) the clear identification of GAD as the home for a
 
comprehensive HRM function; (2) initiating an inventory of cadre and service rules as a precursor to their 
rationalization; (3) rationalizing the classification of employees according to the nature of their duties and 
responsibilities; (4) reviewing department-specific staff norms, and updating those laid down by the
 
earlier Staff Review Committee; (5) initiating moves to restore credibility, transparency and objectivity to 
the annual confidential report (i.e. individual performance appraisal) process and to restore the ACR
 
process for non-gazetted staff, drawing upon initial steps towards performance monitoring by the CGG; 
(6) resume the practice of screening for compulsory retirement for selected employees at age 50 and 55; 
and (7) streamline disciplinary and vigilance procedures.  The third is the development of policy analysis 
capacity within the GoAP Secretariat, which is a long-term objective that can be addressed through a
 
combination of training and capacity building and lateral recruitment. 
Electronic governance.
 
 
Progress along this dimension continues to be impressive. A blueprint for
 
l
electronic governance has been drawn up for 35 major departments and its implementation is being
 
discussed at the highest levels.  Skims (renamed SmartGov) was launched in November with 483
 
modules. Twins/e-Seva has been expanded to involve 35 services in over 28 separate locations, and plans 
are underway to expand it to over 117 locations by June 2003. Over 5 million transactions have taken
 
place since the system was launched in August 2001, and the number of transactions has now crossed
 
50,000 per day.  Plans are also being developed for a pilot rural equivalent, the On Line Transaction
 
Processing  (OLTP) project, which will make over 65 services available to rural residents in a one stop
 
shop facility.
GoAP has recently approached the Bank for independent support for this effort through the reallocation of 
some funds from the AP Economic Restructuring Project.  
Deregulation.
 
Progress in implementing this agenda has been mixed but on balance positive. GoAP has
 
l
enacted Act. No. 17 of 2002 to facilitate the speedy processing of applications for various licenses,
 
clearances and certificates. Proposals for the simplification of procedures for inspection have been
 
prepared by Confederation of Indian Industry and Price Waterhouse Coopers, and enshrined in a
 
Government Order in August 2002. The AP Portal is also being designed with the goal of facilitating
 
small business registration. Some efforts are being developed to evolve a public relations/outreach strategy 
for the 29 departments involved in industrial and commercial clearances, as well as to improve procedures 
for grievance redressal. The ultimate effectiveness of these measures is unknown. 
Access to information
.  
GoAP has elected to implement the Government of India’s Freedom of
 
l
Information legislation, which was enacted in December 2002. The latter is binding over the state
 
government although the law in essence establishes a baseline, and Indian states are free to adopt more
 
far-ranging legislation. Significant progress remains in operationalizing this legislation in the state. 
Anticorruption
. During 2001 and early 2002, the GoAP took some promising steps in developing an
 
l
- 15 -
Page  19
innovative anticorruption strategy focusing on prevention, prosecution and public relations. It also
 
canvassed stakeholder views on critical anticorruption issues.  This strategy was placed before a Cabinet 
Committee, where little visible progress has been made for nearly a year. Recently, there have been some 
signs that the issue has been revived. The Committee has concluded its deliberations and a review meeting 
was held, in which it was decided that the former Commissioner of Hong Kong’s Independent
 
Commission Against Corruption, would be invited back to suggest measures to strengthen the GoAP’s
 
existing anticorruption organizations. However, he has yet to return for the next phase of this work.
GoAP has moved forward in the area of e-procurement. It initiated an e-procurement pilot project in four 
major departments in October 2002 (the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation, AP
 
Technology Services Ltd., AP Health, Medical Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation, and 
the Commission on Tenders), which account for Rs 2,000 crore annually in procurement transactions.  
Another 10 departments will be brought on board by March 2003, with the goal of capturing the major 
share of GoAP procurement (around Rs 10,000 crore annually) and implementing e-procurement in all
 
150 departments by the end of 2005.  With the support of DFID and in consultation with Bank staff,
 
GoAP initiated a multi-phased effort to reform its procurement policy and procedures.  Unfortunately, this 
effort has stalled and very little progress has been made over the last year.
Poverty and Social Analysis and Monitoring Unit.   
In February 2002 GoAP issued orders to set up the 
l
Poverty and Social Analysis Monitoring Unit (PSAMU). This unit will be housed within the Society for 
Elimination of Rural Poverty (SERP) that has been previously established. The objective of the Unit is to 
strengthen poverty analysis and monitoring capacity in the state, and to effectively feed such analysis into 
core government functions of policy-making, planning, budgeting, service delivery and monitoring. The
 
Unit is also expected to facilitate the preparation of an overarching policy framework for poverty reduction 
in AP. Since the Government Order was issued for the establishment of PSAMU, there has been an
 
external consultancy input to help GoAP articulate the institutional responsibilities and possible initial
 
work-plan of the Unit.
The World Bank has developed a Technical Assistance program to support GoAP in its poverty analysis, 
as part of its work to assist GoAP in operationalising the Vision 2020 program, and this work would be
 
carried forward in close alignment with the PSAMU. 
All in all, while the poverty monitoring unit has been established, the pace of the work program is slow. 
In view of this delay, the timetable of preparing an overarching policy framework for poverty reduction is 
likely to be pushed back.   
Public enterprise reform.
 The public enterprise reform program continues to make good progress. In
 
l
Phase I of the reform program, which started in 1999, 19 Units had been included though the target was 
only for 12 Units. Of these, 16 have  been privatized, closed or restructured. The program has raised about 
$38 million in gross proceeds, with about $26 million received so far. The bulk of the proceeds will be
 
used to settle the outstanding liabilities of the enterprises.  
Phase II of the reform program started in April 2002 and is to be implemented during 2002-06, covering a 
total of 68 enterprises. The target of 15 units for this year has been achieved. Ten units have been closed, 
two privatized, and three restructured. Another ten units are in the pipeline, including six sugar units
 
where a legal challenge to the privatization process has been recently upheld by the court. In addition, a 
number of option studies have been completed or are underway for Units that are slated for change in the 
coming years of the program.    
Implementation of the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) and the Social Safety Net Program (SSNP) 
continues.  During Phase 1, about 8,200 employees were given VRS; of whom about 5,000 were contacted 
under SSNP, counseling was provided to 4,336 and retraining assistance provided to 2,038 (1,749 trained 
and 334 under training). 
 
The SSNP unit estimates a redeployment rate of about 35%, but this will need to 
- 16 -
Page  20
be substantiated during a proposed review of the Phase 1 SSNP program. The proposed review of Phase I 
of the SSNP should highlight any lessons from Phase I which could be usefully fed into the Phase II
 
program. The SSNP program is expected to be scaled up to cover a larger proportion of workers taking 
VRS under Phase II. It would be important to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the retraining and 
redeployment efforts as the program is being scaled up. The IS has made progress in ensuring
 
transparency and standardization of the bid process, and information on this has been put on the internet. 
A more proactive communication strategy is  planned for Phase II. A manual has also been prepared on 
environmental auditing, and environmental audit is being carried out as part of the transaction process.
While good progress has been made under the program, the upcoming challenges will include continuing 
with the same momentum in the year ahead, and ensuring that lessons of SSNP from Phase I inform the 
Phase II program.
 
Other recent developments
.
  
In January 2003, the GoAP announced that it was going to enact a
 
l
Performance Accountability Act, which will seek to advance reforms along a number of dimensions.  In 
an effort to improve employee accountability, amendments to the AP Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1963 
and APCS (CCA) Rules, 1991 are expected to be tabled in the forthcoming session of the State Assembly.  
The GoAP has also announced its intention to move towards performance budgeting.  According to Chief 
Minister Naidu, this will entail the funding outcomes rather than inputs; the assessment of results by
 
available indicators; holding managers responsible for performance; providing flexibility to managers to
 
innovate and manage; and adopting medium and long term view of use of resources. The GoAP also
 
announced new initiatives to garner suggestions for productivity improvements from government
 
employees, and to establish a toll-free central call center to process citizen complaints.
ENDNOTES:
2
There is also an issue of expenditure composition. Among the southern Indian states Andhra has the lowest per capita
 
spending on education. In 2001-02, part of the expenditure reduction—to achieve the fiscal deficit target—was achieved by not 
spending the targeted amount (per MTFF targets) on social sectors including primary education and health. Responding to this 
issue of missed expenditure target, GoAP had indicated that no viable projects in these sub-sectors were denied funding. It has 
also been mentioned that savings were made by hiring non permanent teaching staff in schools without affecting the quality of 
education. More work is needed in this area to understand the resource constraints in social sector.
3
The consolidated deficit is defined as the sum of non-power fiscal deficit and the power sector financing requirement. For
 
more information, see Table 5 below.
4
The MTFF target mentioned here is the same as the target for GoAP’s Department of Energy presented in its February’02
 
Business Plan.
5
What has been surprising is that no such information was available when the official targets were communicated to the Bank. 
In fact, while GoAP was negotiating APERL with the Bank, it had asked the power utilities to increase the agriculture supply 
from 9 to 12 hours in February 2002.
6
Besides the increased subsidy to the agriculture community, there are a few other factors that have contributed to the higher 
than estimated power sector losses. These include, among others, non realization of efficiency improvements in lowering T&D 
losses and inadequate tariff increases.
   
7
The official financial numbers for the power sector, being tracked for 2002-03, are those that were approved by the AP
 
Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC). These numbers are slightly different from the numbers that appear in the
 
Business Plan which were communicated to the Bank during SAL negotiations.  According to APERC approved annual revenue 
requirement for the power sector, the net loss for 2002-03 is projected to be Rs 1,509 crore. This is predicated on the
 
assumption that the companies shall achieve efficiency gains of about Rs.300 crore, receive wheeling charges of Rs 135 crore 
and a favorable share of power from hydro generation. The net loss estimate in the Business Plan is Rs 1,792 crore. In order to 
be  consistent with the SAL document, this ICR  compares the actual performance with those numbers that are listed in the 
Business Plan.
8
Constitution of the Revenue Reforms Committee and issuance of terms of reference was a prior action requirement for
 
APERL. Setting up of the Fiscal reforms Implementation Committee was also a prior action requirement.
9
The Annual Fiscal Framework of GoAP is a new initiative in promoting transparency in the budget making exercise in Indian 
- 17 -
Page  21
states. See below.
10
It should be noted that currently there is limited room for prioritization and flexibility given the high proportion of
 
‘non-discretionary’ expenditure (e.g., salaries, regular operating costs, already committed expenditure). The ‘discretionary’
 
portion is estimated to be about 10-12% of the total budget.
11
In the 2003/04 budget the number of budget sub-heads was reduced to 2676 from 3221 in the previous year. The object heads 
were also reduced to 91, from 139.
12
Line Departments have not yet started providing this information to the Finance Department.
13
Revisions to estimates do, however, still take place during the year, as a result of shortfalls in revenue and the introduction of 
new schemes. As far as possible, the reductions are made in areas where expenditure has been slower. The allocation of cuts is 
approved by the Cabinet Sub-Committee, and generally is effected through the release in the 4th quarter. In 2002/03, the total 
non-plan revised estimates (RE) were slightly higher than budget estimates (BE) while the total plan RE were lower than BE: 
within these totals the estimates went up for some up for some departments and down for others.
14
Monthly payments are made on the followed schedule: salaries and staff costs: days 1-10;  non-salary operational expenditure: 
days 11-20; and works (contractors/suppliers) payments: days 21-30 of each month.  Small works bills (less than Rs. 200,000, 
or from self-help groups) are exempt from this system.
15
In 2001-02, GoAP was in overdraft on Ways and Means advances for 336 days.
16 
The earlier announced initiative of authorizing line departments to retain the amounts the incremental user charges collected 
in Deposit Accounts and to use these, was modified. Line departments are now required to deposit such amounts into the
 
State’s Consolidated Fund, and are then provided supplementary budgets to use these amounts for authorized purposes.
 
17 
The performance budget has not ,however, changed the format of the budget estimates that are submitted for approval to the 
assembly.
18
Making initial (aggregate) provision against government guarantees was a key prior action of APERL. The Guarantee
 
Redemption Fund was created  with an initial contribution from the state budget and fees for government guarantees issues 
since its commencement have been added.
19
While the initial target of June 2002 has proven overly optimistic, the SmartGov project has a major HRM component, and 
the system is now being developed on a pilot basis and will be ready for launch in four major departments totaling over 50% of 
the civil service by October 2003.  
20
This effort is proceeding along two dimensions.  The CGG has initiated a major study of 10,200 service related cases that 
went before the AP Administrative Tribunal between 1991 and 2002.  In addition, an analysis of GoAP’s cases before the High 
Courts has been supported by the Bank’s PRMPS Unit under the Dutch Trust Fund for Justice and Governance (TF024097) 
and should be completed by September 2003.
21
Various elements of AP’s reform effort to date have touched upon certain aspects of this work, ranging from expenditure
 
reviews of selected departments funded by DFID to a series of departmental reviews conducted by the GoAP in 2001 to work 
going forward under the SmartGov effort.  The CGG work program initially contained an assessment of the overall machinery 
of governance, as well as a more detailed functional review of the Department of Primary Education.  But a serious,
 
comprehensive effort to streamline administrative structures and address problems of functional overlap and duplication has yet 
to be made.

Institutional development impact:
GoAP’s institutional development measures, supported by this operation, has been quite good. In particular,
 
the process of budget formulation has improved a lot. As argued above, the links between the medium term fiscal 
framework, annual fiscal framework and the actual budget have been strengthened, and this allows the annual
 
budget to be developed from a medium term perspective. While it is a bit early to comment on its performance, the 
poverty and social monitoring unit is likely to provide valuable information on the goals of Andhra’s social
 
development. Finally, the e-governance initiative of GoAP has institutionalized transparency and improved

efficiency.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1
Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
A general country-wide economic growth slowdown and drought in the last couple of years have had a
 
negative impact on state’s finances. Drought continued in 2002 and it resulted in more subsidized power supply to 
the farm community. In view of the water shortage, the state had to rely more on thermal power, the more
 
expensive mode of power generation.        
5.2
Factors generally subject to government control:
The main factor that positively affected implementation and outcomes was that the program supported by 
the project was the client’s own program. The Government of Andhra Pradesh had put together its own strategy
 
papers and had designed it own action programs. In implementing its reform program, it found the Bank and
 
DFID as facilitating partners which were willing to provide technical and financial assistance.
A few factors, that were generally subject to government control, negatively affected the financial
 
performance of the power sector. These factors include supply regulation of subsidized consumer categories,
 
measurement and metering of agriculture supply, and inadequate cost recovery for certain categories (e.g., cost
 
recovery for the power supplied for irrigation is 10 percent and for residential consumers is 50 percent).
The government could have vigorusly pursued its anticorruption agenda that would have yielded better
 
results. Similarly, the work of the Revenue Reform Committee could have been done on a firm timetable, which 
would have yielded important insights in improving the process of resource mobilization. Finally, the work of
 
Poverty and Social Analysis and Monitoring Unit could have been facilitated by giving it more attention. 
 
5.3
Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Same as 5.2, as the government, represented by the Department of Finance, was the implementing agency.
5.4
Costs and financing:
The project money (along with DFID support), in the form of budgetary support, filled a big financing gap 
in the state’s 2001-02 budget. In the absence of APERL financing there would have been additional fiscal
 
compression and many of the priority spending at the margin would have been cut. If the government had to resort 
to market borrowing, it would have come at a much higher cost.   
6.  Sustainability
6.1
Rationale for sustainability rating:
One important reason why this project is likely to be sustainable is that it supports government’s own
 
reform program. The State has outlined its development vision; the process to attain this vision has been laid out in 
a series of strategy papers and implementation of these strategies is ongoing
.
The commitment to reform and succeed continues to come from the top. Many of the structural changes
 
introduced are difficult, if not impossible, to reverse.  Some examples of these changes are: the anti-theft
 
legislation and unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution in the power sector; programs to ensure
 
education for all particularly at the school level; transparency in the budget process through wide dissemination of 
the Annual Fiscal Framework; e-governance initiatives, particularly e-seva, to improve public service delivery.
There are a few problem areas, particularly the financial performance of the power sector, that remain as 
challenges. The sustainability of the overall fiscal reform program significantly depends on the actions taken in the 
power sector. If not addressed adequately, the financial burden of the power sector will inflict more damage to the 
state’s fiscal health. But if GoAP remains committed as it has been in the past, there is no reason to believe that 
- 19 -
Page  23
such challenges will not be successfully tackled. The important thing is that GoAP continues to move forward in 
pursuit of its development vision. It has requested the Bank to provide a follow-up adjustment loan in support of its 
reform program.
With state assembly elections due in 2004, there is likely to be a period of uncertainty. It is therefore likely 
that major reform actions could be postponed until the elections are over. 
6.2
Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Not Applicable.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1
Lending:
The Bank’s lending performance is rated 
satisfactory
. The project was consistent with the nature of India 
CAS which focuses on states that have demonstrated a commitment to broad-based reforms, particularly in the
 
areas of fiscal management, power sector reforms, and governance. A number of Bank reports (as well as those
 
done by other agencies) provided the necessary background information to help design the loan.
Looking back, one possible area where the Bank could have done better, was the monitoring of
 
developments in subsidized power supply to the agriculture sector. As discussed in Section 4.2 (under the
 
sub-heading of power sector), additional power was purchased during the first three months of 2002, the time when 
the loan was being negotiated, and over 60 percent of that was provided to the agriculture at the highly subsidized 
rates. This led to a 20 percent increase in the net loss of the power sector, over and above the amount budgeted in 
the Business Plan.
7.2
Supervision:
The Bank’s supervision of the project is rated
 
satisfactory
. The client and the Bank (along with the
 
co-financier, DFID) have been in regular touch on matters relating to the Government’s reform program supported 
by APERL. Besides one regular supervision mission there have been several other occasions (after the loan became 
effective) when the Bank team was able to visit Hyderabad and carry out dialog with GoAP regarding the progress 
made in its reform program. The supervision of another project, Andhra Pradesh Economic Restructuring Project, 
during May’02 provided one such opportunity. Finally, the supervision of a power project during the year also
 
provided relevant information related to the overall fiscal situation.
Through out this process the client has been very supportive in exchanging information. Details on the
 
financial performance of the power sector, along with other relevant information, have been regularly provided by 
the client.    
7.3
Overall Bank performance:
Based on the above ratings for lending and supervision, the Overall Bank Performance is rated 
satisfactory
.
Borrower
7.4
Preparation:
The Borrower’s performance was 
satisfactory
 in project identification and preparation.
The overarching development vision of the state was articulated in the 
Vision 2020
 document in 1999. It 
is a statement of intent to pursue economic growth, develop human capital and reduce poverty. The process to
 
attain this vision has been laid out in a series of strategy papers. All this work meant the state was in a very good 
position to identify and prepare for the project. Besides, a number of studies and other analytical work were done 
by several external agencies including the Bank. The Department of Finance, as the interlocutor, was fully
 
- 20 -
Page  24
prepared and was on top of all issues. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the strong support from the state
 
leadership meant that the reform process had a strong forward momentum.
One area where the government did not do due diligence preparatory work was in supplying accurate
 
information on the power sector. In February 2002, when the loan was being negotiated, there has been a
 
considerable increase in subsidized power supply to agriculture, but no information to this effect was supplied to
 
the Bank.
7.5
Government implementation performance:
The Government’s implementation performance is rated 
satisfactory
.
One main reason for satisfactory implementation is that the reform program, supported by the project, is 
that of the government. As noted in Section 4.2, the government has made a lot of progress in implementing a
 
variety of public expenditure management reforms, has improved the process of financial accountability, managed 
the public enterprise reform program well and has continued to reduce the fiscal burden of the Rice Subsidy
 
Scheme. Most important, despite the financial problems of the power sector (see below), it has managed to meet its 
fiscal target for 2001-02.
GoAP’s financial management in the power sector continues to be a source of concern. As detailed in
 
Section 4.2, if power sector finances are not managed properly, given the magnitude of the problem, the
 
government’s overall fiscal reform program could easily get derailed. Admittedly, the issue of power subsidies to
 
the agriculture sector is a difficult one, partly due to the associated political economy issues. Nonetheless, the issue 
has to be addressed to avoid major financial losses to the sector.
There are a few other areas where the government could have implemented the agreed action program. 
For example, while the Government had constituted the Revenue Reform Committee, the latter has not really done 
its job of preparing a strategy of reforming the structure and administration of the state’s tax and non-tax revenue 
sources. The Government’s anti-corruption agenda, after its initial momentum, has not moved since May’02. Also, 
the Right to Information Act is still to be implemented and the real work of the newly established Poverty and 
Social Monitoring Unit has not started.   
7.6
Implementing Agency:
Not Applicable (as the Government itself was the implementation agency). 
7.7
Overall Borrower performance:
Based on the above ratings for lending and supervision, the Overall Borrower Performance is rated 
satisfactory
.
8. 
Lessons Learned
The first policy based lending program in Andhra Pradesh provides several lessons. Some of them are
 
similar to what was learnt from the two previous adjustment programs in Indian states of Karnataka and Uttar
 
Pradesh; a couple of them are new lessons. These lessons, in turn, will be helpful in designing better adjustment 
lending operations in the Bank in general and in the South Asia Region in particular.
A few broad lessons learned in the context of APERL are listed below: 
·
Research and experience suggest that reform programs are much likely to succeed when owned and 
designed by countries. External agencies such as ours can help facilitate that process by providing 
technical and financial support. The Andhra Pradesh adjustment lending experience clearly confirms that 
hypothesis.
·
A series of single-tranche adjustment operations is better suited for supporting a multiple-year reform 
process. While this entails a higher administrative cost for the Bank, the process supports the required 
- 21 -
Page  25
incentive mechanism. It also helps in facilitating an exit strategy for the Bank if the reform program 
falters. In the case of Andhra, like other states in India, a follow-up adjustment operation is to be based on 
a continuation of the government’s reform program.
As is to be expected, the pace of progress of different components of a government owned reform program 
l
varies. However, it is important to determine what are the critical elements of the program, where 
progress has to be made and the pace has to be sustained for the credibility of the overall program. For 
example, it is clear in AP that unless the financial performance of the power sector is improved on a 
sustained basis, the overall fiscal reform will remain tentative. One possibility could have been to agree on 
specific actions that would have helped in improving the financial performance of the power sector.
 
Real meaningful institutional reforms always take more time than envisaged.  It is easy to set up a 
l
committee or two through a government order, but it is much more difficult and time consuming to ensure 
that these committee to the jobs that they are set up to do.  In AP, the experience of setting up of Poverty 
and Social Monitoring Unit and the Revenue Reforms Committee confirms this.
Working in partnership with other external agencies can bring useful technical and financial resources to 
l
the client. While with the involvement of several external agencies the transaction cost increases, the 
benefits to the client can be substantial.

A. Fiscal Outcomes 
The progress in achieving the core outcome objectives of  fiscal responsibility, have been satisfactory.
1.
The fiscal deficit in 2001-02 was 4.5% of GSDP as against the original target of 5% in 2001-02 and 
5.31% in 2000-01. This cushion allowed the achievement of the Consolidated Fiscal Deficit (CFD) target of 5.6% 
in 2001-02, despite  higher losses in power sector. The CFD in 2001-02  has also shown an improvement as 
compared to 2000-01 falling  to 5.6% from  6.02%. 
However, the fiscal deficit according to the Revised Estimate of  2002-03  is  marginally worse at  4.7% as 
against  4.5% in 2001-02.
2.
The Revenue Deficit has also gone down to 1.92% of GSDP in 2001-02 as against the original target 
outcome  2.3% in 2001-02 and 2.61% in 2000-01  (Actual). However, the revised estimate of 2002-03 is showing a 
higher figure of  2.02%. The Consolidated Revenue Deficit (CRD) (including power sector) has also improved 
from 2.98% in 2000-01 to 2.37% in 2001-02. It is further estimated to go down to the level of 1.64% in 2002-03 
(RE). This is a positive outcome.
3.
Under the States’ Fiscal Reforms Facility, apart from CFD, importance is given to CRD as a % of Total 
Revenue Receipts (TRR). GoAP has brought down the ratio of CRD to TRR from (-) 26.90% in 1999-00 to (-) 
16.30% in 2001-02 over the period of two years. On the whole, therefore, the State Government has managed to 
reduce CRD/TRR by about 10% age points, in line with the broad scheme of things.
4.
The Consolidated Debt Stock (including off budget borrowings & guarantees) has gone up to 39.76% of 
GSDP in 2001-02 from 36.37% in 2000-01 (Actual) and is further targeted to go up to 40.46% in 2002-03 (RE). 
The debt stock  may not be sustainable in the medium term as the ratio of interest payments to total revenue 
receipts for Andhra Pradesh is well above the thumb rule norm of 20%.The Consolidated Debt Stock (including off 
budget borrowings & guarantees) is more than two times of total revenue receipts as shown in the table given 
below; and calls for further corrective action in 2003-04 to 2005-06.

Outstanding guarantees have shown a declining path from the year 2001-02 from a level of 9.9% of GSDP 
in 2001-02, they are likely to decline to  8.73% in 2002-03 (RE) and further to 8.61% in 2003-04 as per budget 
estimates. This process, by incorporating  guarantees as off-budget borrowings is a welcome trend.
           
B. Process Milestones
The Andhra’s Economic Reform Programme include three components : (i) fiscal reforms programme
 
aims at fiscal stabilisation, (ii) public expenditure management reform to strengthen financial management and
 
(iii) governance reforms which includes a program of poverty monitoring, public enterprise reform, civil service
 
reform, etc. Government of Andhra Pradesh had committed to take action on the fourteen components under
 
- 24 -
Page  28
APERL.
    Government of Andhra Pradesh has made reasonable progress in fiscal, public expenditure management, and 
governance and public management reforms. The upfront action on all the fourteen triggers of the APERL have
 
been completed. These are summarised on the next page:
Key Triggers and progress of actions for APERL
Triggers and Actions
Progress
Fiscal Policy Reform
1.
Budget execution in 2001-02 consistent with the 
corrective measures needed to reach the MTFF 
targets (1.3% primary deficit, 5.0% fiscal deficit 
and less than 5.6% consolidated fiscal deficit) 
The FD fell in  2001-02 (PA) to 4.5% of GSDP. 
CFD remains almost at target of 5.6% of GSDP 
despite higher losses in the power sector. Primary 
deficit has also significantly reduced.
2.
Annual Fiscal Framework targets significant 
deficit reduction for 2002-03.
MTFF targets a reduction in the CFD in 2002-03 to 
4.7% of GSDP as against the 5.6%, achieved in 
2001-02, which is unlikely to be achieved due to 
deteriorating financial performance of power 
sector. 
3.
GoAP's Fiscal Reform Strategy Paper 
(including the MTFF) finalised and published .
Published and disseminated in January 2002 on the 
GoAP website. 
4.
Tax reforms and cost recovery : sales tax floor 
rates unified, major progress in preparation of 
VAT implementation.
GoAP is in full preparedness to mitigate it VAT 
regime from 1st April , 2003.
Public Expenditure Management Reform
5.
Set hard expenditure ceilings for each line 
department at the start of the budget preparation 
cycle, beginning in 2002-03
GoAP has begun the practice of setting hard 
expenditure ceilings for each Line Department 
(LD) at the start of the budget preparation cycle 
consistent with realistic resource estimate and it has 
also introduced a system of mid term review of 
budgetary performance of LDs in part to establish a 
board qualitative link to the next budget.  
6.
Make initial aggregating provision against 
government guarantees, including full 
provisioning for selected guarantees. 
GoAP has made a significant initial aggregate 
provision against potential government guarantee 
defaults, fully provisioned for selected guarantees, 
and intends to elaborate a comprehensive approach 
to the budgetary treatment of government 
guarantees. The State Government will also 
implement comprehensive policy on public 
guarantees next year.
7.
Initial rationalization of heads of account and 
periodic advance releases of spending authority 
to line departments.
GoAP has begun a rationalisation of heads of 
account and initiated the practice of quarterly or 
half yearly advance releases of spending authority 
to LDs.
8.
Computerize pension payments and initiate 
computerisation of salary payments.
GoAP has computerised pensions and is also 
proceeding to computerise payrolls along the same 
lines.
Governance and Public Management Reform
9.
Continue de facto civil service hiring freeze in 
place and conduct comprehensive civil service 
census.
In response to the growth in civil service numbers 
and upward pressure on wage bill,  the State 
Government has put in place a de facto ban on 
recruitment since 1993. Since 1997,  a target of net 
- 25 -
Page  29
annual reduction of 1.9% in the total number of 
civil servants is also met except in priority areas. 
Gap has also substantially completed a civil service 
census and is establishing a computerise database. 
10.
Implement anti-corruption drive in the power 
sector, including carry out regularization drive, 
strengthen   collection efficiency, enact power 
theft legislation, implement anti-theft legal 
sanctions through special courts. 
GoAP's initiatives includes include  a drive to clean 
up the power sector through regularising 2 million 
domestic consumers, improving collection 
efficiency to cover 98% and enacting a law to 
control theft and pilferage of electricity, along with 
special courts and police stations for dealing with 
power theft.
11.
Closure/privatize 11 public enterprises. Cabinet 
approval of phase II PE reform programme, 
with implementation sequencing and costing.
In phase - I , 11 units had either been privatized, 
closed or restructured and good progress has been 
made in the remaining 8 units. In phase - II, 68 
units are included under reform programme during 
2002 to 2006. Progress report of phase 2 of the 
programme will be prepared in each year.
12.
Submit Right to Information Bill to Cabinet.
Right of Information Act was submitted to Cabinet 
in January, 2002.
13.
E-Governance Implement public service access 
system (TWINs/eSEVA) in Hyderabad, 
streamline / computerise deed registration 
(CARD) to cut turn around time and public 
compliance burden.
GoAP will continue to roll out programs, such as 
Twin Cities Network Services which creates a 
"“one stop shop” for citizens to take care of 20 
different services, to cover 50 municipalities within 
the State. It will also give its highly successful 
Computer-aided Administration of Registration 
department program greater publicity to improve 
public knowledge and awareness regarding this 
facility. The State Government will also establish a 
blueprint for electronic governance.
Power Sector Reforms
             The most critical sector for the State Government is the power sector, where reforms need to be accelerated 
to improve the fiscal position of the State and to justify continuing bank support to the State. 
               
·
The State government’s  broad strategy in this area consists of measures to significantly improve the 
efficiency of power generation, invest in system up-gradation and crack down on theft of power to minimize T & D 
losses, strengthen the provision of quality power supply in order to retain high paying industrial consumers on the 
power grid, ensure nine hours of supply to agriculture, introduce energy audit and take all effective steps to ensure 
supply, quality service delivery and  payment compliance.
The GoAP also aims to privatize distribution in order to improve the management of the distribution 
l
companies and cut system losses.
·
The ultimate objective of the power sector reforms would be gradually to reduce the difference between the 
average cost of power (on the basis of current liabilities) per kwh and average revenue (on cash basis) per kwh.
·
GoAP has estimated that the net support to power sector will go down from the level of 2.5% of GSDP in 
2000-01 to 0.4% in 2004-05.
·
Universal metering of all electricity connections shall be completed within 2003-04.
- 26 -
Page  30
·
No new electricity connections shall be given without meters.
While the State appeared to roll back some of the process in Power Sector Reforms in the current year, 
there is some indication  that they intend to put in place correctives from 2003-04.  It is also unlikely that the State 
will meet its target outcome on loss reduction in the sector in the current fiscal. In part, the severe drought has 
worsened the Hydel/Thermal mix, leading to an unanticipated increase in the Average Cost of Power supplied. The 
inability to limit supplies to rural areas to contain cash losses at agreed levels, as well as their inability to increase 
tariffs in line with requirements would largely account for larger cash-losses of the sector
       
Fiscal and Governance reforms as well as power sector reforms are expected to continue in
 
remaining years of the reforms period in respect to the APERL. We expect the State to take corrective steps 
in the Power Sector, to bring the reform outcomes back on track. The future financial  support for the
 
program will be determined by the Government of India, GoAP , the World Bank and DFID on a year to
 
year  basis.

(b) Cofinanciers:
Comments from DFID:
DFID co-financed APERL with a £65 million financial assistance provided to GoAP on a grant basis.  
Complementing this financial assistance package are DFID-funded technical assistance programmes in the areas of 
governance reforms, power sector reforms, poverty reduction, and public enterprise reforms.
The APERL supports a strong reform agenda developed and driven by GoAP.  DFID’s rationale for supporting 
APERL is similar to that of the World Bank – assisting the government to achieve its goals, set out in Vision 2020, 
including the eradication of poverty.  This requires fiscal consolidation, reprioritisation of public expenditures to 
deliver on policy priorities, improved service delivery and modernisation of government (including greater 
accountability).  A key objective is to ensure that poverty reduction is central in the reform agenda.
The first tranche was based on a set of completed actions, and since then DFID and the World Bank have initiated 
discussions with GoAP on a possible second tranche of support.  The key challenges while designing the future 
support under APERL would include: reducing the power sector losses and so strengthening the prospects for fiscal 
stabilisation; re-prioritisation of expenditure in alignment with the key policy priorities of the government; 
ensuring that the governance reform agenda leads to effective improvements in service delivery; and 
mainstreaming poverty – ensuring that poverty reduction is central to the APERL.  All this would need to be done 
within a multi-year framework as required under the new GoI policy guidance on sub-national adjustment lending.  
DFID greatly values the partnership with GoAP, and the strong leadership and direction displayed by the 
government in taking its reform agenda forward.  A key challenge for the government in the days ahead would be 
to deepen and widen the base for reforms while ensuring that some of the more difficult reform tasks are being 
addressed.
DFID is very pleased with the close working relations developed with World Bank staff, and values the 
professional analysis and experience that Bank staff bring to bear on the discussions.  We look forward to 
deepening this relationship as APERL moves to future years of support.

Constitution of Revenue Reforms Committee 
(RRC) with an overall objective of providing 
guidance on revenue reforms in AP
Preparation for implementation of VAT
Achievements till Date (March 1, 2003)
Consolidated fiscal deficit below target in 
2001-02 (5.5% against a target of 5.6%), 
debt and liabilities within the MTFF ceiling, 
full support provided to the power sector, 
draft budget publized widely and mid-term 
report on budget execution placed on the 
GoAP's Web site.  
Spending on primary health and education 
was short of MTFF targets (1.9% against a 
target of 2.2%); expenditures on salaries and 
pensions were within targets and bogus rice 
cards have been eliminated from the system. 
A medium term expenditure framework is 
under development in the primary health 
sub-sector, as a pilot for the introduction of 
medium term planning across all 
departments in future.
The RRC has been quite ineffective and has 
not contributed to revenue reforms in the 
state; AP, however, is one of the most 
advanced states in India as far as preparation 
for VAT is concerned.

Budget allocations have been more or less in 
line with MTFF targets, the Fiscal Reforms 
Implementation Committee has undertaken 
three studies. These include a study on debt 
swapping to take advantage of lower interest 
rates, modifying the pattern of grant-in-aid to 
colleges and commodity wise contribution to 
sales tax revenue. The reports are presently 
under consideration. There is a mixed picture 
in terms of  hard budget ceilings imposed at 
the beginning of the year. For non-plan 
spending,  the revised estimates are higher 
for Agriculture, Rural and Urban 
Development, Energy than budgeted, and 
lower for some other departments. The 
reductions are understood to largely reflect 
the slower pace of expenditures in particular 
expenditure categories; increases generally 
reflect new schemes introduced during the 
year.  A guarantee redemption fund has been 
set up as a first step towards provisioning of 
guarantees. 
A zero-based review of schemes undertaken 
wherein approx. 20,000 staff associated with 
non-performing schemes were identified for 
redeployment; and about 17,000 have since

Timely follow-up and responses to audit 
observations
been redeployed to local governments. The 
process of rationalizing schemes is ongoing 
and it is understood that there is an 
increased focus on the poverty reduction 
programs for the discretionary part (about 
15%) of plan expenditures. A performance 
monitoring system was put in place 
throughout GoAP in 2002-03 and  
performance budgets were prepared by each 
line department as part of the 2003-04 
budget process with the aim of better linking 
funding to performance. Line departments 
have been given the incentive to collect 
innovative user charges and retain them for 
O&M expenditure.
A detailed exercise was carried out wherein a 
number of budget sub-heads for smaller 
schemes were aggregated.  Further, salary 
budgets were de-linked from scheme 
budgets removing a major incentive to keep 
old, uncompleted schemes open.  
Implementation of a new cash management 
led to more efficient use of resources as 
finances were available to line departments 
when required with greater predictability.  
This systems also helped better fine tune 
receipts and expenditure cash flows.  Also, 
during 2002-03 the GoAP had only been in 
overdraft 17 days in the 9 months to 
December 2002. Computerization of payroll 
has been incorporated into the larger 
integrated financial services system as a part 
of GoAP’s e-governance agenda. Review of 
financial regulations and record keeping 
procedures is nearing completion. 
Enforcement of internal controls and 
responses to audits have been strengthened 
by linking release of funds to adherence to 
public financial accountability norms (refer 
GO’s 506 and 507).  Action Plan for clearing 
backlog of accounts and audits of Urban 
Local Bodies, Rural Local Bodies, Boards 
and Authorities and other institutions 
prepared, and being implemented. The SFAA 
report should be finalized by end March 
2003.

CGG’s work stream.  Citizen’s charters 
prepared and disseminated for all major 
departments.  GoAP and CGG have drafted 
an excellent study of the implementation of 
citizens charters in AP.  GoAP has made 
progress in completing the initial analytic 
work in legal case load.  Training centers 
have been established in all 23 districts and 
10,000 change agents trained at the CGG.
A number of surplus staff redeployed as 
Panchayat secretaries to boost the overall 
decentralization agenda.  On-going dialogue 
on strengthening this area.
GoAP’s progress in the area of e-governance 
has been commendable. A blueprint for 
electronic governance has been drawn up for 
35 major departments.  E-Seva will be 
extended to all 117 municipalities in AP 
during 2003, and it will be complemented by 
the development of the On Line Transaction 
Processing (OLTP) system in rural areas in 
two target districts.  Much of this work is 
being implemented through a series of 
innovative public/private partnerships.
Single Window Clearance Act in place.  A 
number of GO’s issued to simplify labor laws 
and streamline inspections.  All the 
information placed on the GoAP's Web site.  
GoAP has elected to implement the 
Government of India’s Freedom of 
Information legislation, which was enacted in 
December 2002. The latter is binding over 
the state government although the law in 
essence establishes a baseline, and Indian 
states are free to adopt more far-ranging 
legislation. Significant progress remains in 
operationalizing this legislation.
Anticorruption strategy paper approved by the 
cabinet and a task force set up. 
E-procurement pilots have been initiated in 
four departments with 2000 crore in annual 
procurement. 
The Government Order to set up the Poverty 
and Social Analysis Monitoring Unit 
(PSAMU) was passed in February 2002. 
DFID, UK has agreed to support the Unit for 
the first year of its operations. As of 
February, 2003, it has not been staffed. 
Advertisements to fill the positions have been 
issued in the first week of March, and 
PSAMU is expected to be staffed by April, 
2003. Identification of indicators and setting 
up of monitoring mechanisms will follow once 
PSAMU is staffed.

Implementation of phase I and II program
Implementation of social safety net program
Implementation of communications program
Compliance programs for PEs with major 
environmental liabilities
Measures to improve transparency in 
tendering and bidding procedures
The public enterprise reform program has 
made good progress. Phase I, which started 
in 1999, included 19 enterprises. Of these, 
16 have  been privatized, closed or 
restructured, compared with the target of 12. 
Gross proceeds from the sale of assets 
amounted to about $38 million, with about 
$26 million received so far. The bulk if not all, 
of the proceeds will be used to settle the 
outstanding liabilities of the enterprises. 
Phase II covers 68 enterprises and is to be 
implemented during 2002-06. The target of 
15 units for 2002-03 has been achieved. Ten 
units have been closed, two privatized, and 
three restructured. Another 15 units are in 
the pipeline, including six sugar units where a 
legal challenge to the privatization process 
has been recently upheld by the court. In 
addition, option studies for most of the 
remaining Phase II enterprises have been 
completed or are underway.
