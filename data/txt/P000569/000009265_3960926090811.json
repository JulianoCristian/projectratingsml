In addition, the\n            project intends to provide (e) advisory and consultant\n            services to improve management and restructure several key\n            enterprises; and (f) consultant services for other critical\n            structural adjustment tasks. As a result of these actions,\n            the project will support a far reaching PE reform program as\n            a key element of the Congo's structural adjustment effort."}, "docdt": "1987-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
