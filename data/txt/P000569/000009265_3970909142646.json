outcomes were unsatisfactory, project\n            suitability was uncertain, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the transfer of\n            PE management responsibilities to interim administrators and\n            private liquidators was instrumental to improve these\n            enterprises' management and financial control and\n            reduce line ministries' interference into their\n            operations, prior to their privatization or liquidation. The\n            competitive selection of private liquidators also improved\n            the credibility and transparency of these operations. In\n            retrospect, the project was overly ambitious given\n            GOC's implementation and absorptive capacity. Extension\n            of its closing date proved to be effective for realization\n            of some of Project's objectives and at the same time\n            provided adequate support for the preparation of the\n            follow-up Privatization and Capacity Building Project.\n            Availability of resources to address the financial costs of\n            reforms is critical to the success of TA projects. The\n            Public Enterprise Institutional Development Project (PEIDP)\n            had little impact in key areas, including banking sector\n            reform, PE cross-debt settlement and staff reduction, mainly\n            because of Government's budgetary constraints. The\n            Project could have been more effective if a strategy to fund\n            the costs and obligations of these reforms had been\n            established at the beginning. These issues should have been\n            appraised during the Project design and preparation."}, "docdt": "1997-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
