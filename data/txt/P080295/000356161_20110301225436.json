The additional credit\n            will help finance the procurement of additional OPV in\n            support of Nigeria's final efforts to eradicate\n            poliomyelitis. While Nigeria has seen more than a 98 percent\n            in reduction of Polio cases and OPV coverage is more than 80\n            percent, the fact that new Polio cases have been detected\n            require that immunizations need to be carried out longer\n            than originally anticipated. The additional financing will\n            assist the Government of Nigeria in maintaining the\n            effective OPV coverage of the target population, of critical\n            importance for interrupting Polio transmission and finally\n            eradication. The additional credit will help finance the\n            procurement of additional OPV, and this scaling up and\n            intensification of activities will maximize the project\n            impact and development effectiveness. The additional\n            financing also supports activities that are central to\n            achieving the health related millennium development goals.\n            International Development Association's (IDA's)\n            support for the project is fully embedded in the national\n            program for polio eradication and contributes to the\n            national strategy for improving routine immunization."}, "docdt": "2011-02-18T00:00:00Z"}
