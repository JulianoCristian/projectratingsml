                         Implementation Status Overview
                         While overall performance of the program has been satisfactory and political commitment to polio eradication remains high - Nigeria saw an increase in the number of new cases. As
                         at July 15, 2011 Nigeria has 20 cases of wild polio virus this year in 6 States compared to 6 cases in 4 States for the same period in 2010. There were 376 WPV cases of polio for all
                         of 2009. The turbulent post election period and violence in the north undermined quality of the campaigns. Emergency Plans are now in place and escalated response measures
                         has been put in place.
