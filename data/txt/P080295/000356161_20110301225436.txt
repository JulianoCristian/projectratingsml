                                        I. INTRODUCTION


1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional
credit in an amount of SDR 39 Million equivalent to US$60 million to the Federal Republic of
Nigeria (GON) Partnership for Polio Eradication Project (P080295, Cr 37510; P090652,
Cr.37511; and P110696, Cr 45230). The proposed additional credit would be on standard IDA
terms with an additional "buy-down" provision by which third- party funded trust funds will
cover the service and commitment fees and purchase the credit at its net value if the project
meets the agreed trigger.

2.       The proposed additional credit would help finance the procurement of additional Oral
Polio Vaccine (OPV) in support of Nigeria's final efforts to eradicate poliomyelitis. While
Nigeria has seen more than a 98% in reduction of Polio cases and OPV coverage is more than
80%, the fact that new Polio cases have been detected require that immunizations need to be
carried out longer than originally anticipated. The proposed additional financing will assist the
Government of Nigeria in maintaining the effective OPV coverage of the target population, of
critical importance for interrupting Polio transmission and finally eradication. The additional
credit would help finance the procurement of additional Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), and this
scaling up and intensification of activities would maximize the project impact and development
effectiveness.

3.     In addition to the IDA credit to purchase OPV with the buy-down arrangement financed
by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Rotary International and the US Centers for Disease
Control (CDC), principal financiers of the two other project components (supplemental
operations (cold chain, social mobilization and training) and monitoring and evaluation) are the
European Union, KfW, UNICEF and WHO. The GON covers the operational costs of the nation-
wide immunization campaigns which is quite substantial, and is committed to continue providing
the necessary funding to achieve polio free status. Along with a small grant from the
Government of Japan for 2011, IDA, through this additional financing, is currently the only
financier of OPV.

 II. B ACKGROUND AND R ATIONALE FOR A DDITIONAL FINANCING IN THE AMOUNT OF US$ 60
                                             MILLION

4.     The proposed additional financing is consistent with the objectives and approach of the
current Country Partnership Strategy (2010 -14) that supports Nigeria's Seven Point Agenda
including the provision of health care and a focus on child immunization.

5.      The proposed additional financing also supports activities that are central to achieving the
health related Millennium Development Goals. IDA's support for the Project is fully embedded
in the national program for polio eradication and contributes to the N ational Strategy for
improving routine immunization.

6.     The original Credit agreement in the amount of SDR 20.9 million (US$28.70 million
equivalent) was approved on April 29, 2003 and became effective on August 6, 2003. The

                                                 1
Project was amended on May 10, 2005 to incorporate an additional financing assistance of SDR
33.4 million (US$51.7 million) and again on September 8, 2008 with a second additional credit
of SDR 31.8 million (US$50 million).
The original closing date of the project including the second additional financing was December
31, 2006; this was extended to April 30, 2012. This closing date remains valid. The amounts
from the original project, the first and second additional financing have already been disbursed in
entirety.

7.       The development objective of the Project is to assist, as part of a global polio eradication
 effort, the Government of Nigeria to achieve its goal of interrupting the transmission of wild
 polio virus, and to sustain these efforts throughout the implementation of the project, through
 effective OPV coverage of the target population1. While it is impossible to accurately predict
 how many years complete eradication of polio may take in any country, Nigeria was specifically
 troubled due to suspension of activities in late 2003 in the Northern part of the country caused
 by rumors that the vaccine contained anti-fertility agents. It took several years and intensive
 communication efforts for the program to recover its momentum and credibility and till date the
 Northern states are lagging behind the rest of the country with respect to vaccination coverage.
 During the past two years additional polio vaccination days were carried out, extensive mop-up
 operations undertaken and more children reached with polio vaccine. Besides, the GON has
 launched semi-annual, nationwide Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health (MNCH) weeks which
 include polio immunization in addition to other high impact services such as Vitamin A
 supplementation, routine immunization and malaria prevention for mothers and children. The
 program has used a mix of mono, bi and trivalent vaccines based on the epidemiological
 requirements.

8.     While the country had 4000 cases in 2003 and 612 in 2008, the very intensive effort
during the past two years has led to a 98% reduction of polio cases between September 2009 and
2010. Nigeria only had 21 cases in 2010. However effective OPV coverage of the target
population needs to be maintained till polio virus transmission has stopped and remains stopped
for an additional three years. The proposed additional financing will assist the Government of
Nigeria in maintaining the effective OPV coverage of the target population of critical import ance
for polio eradication. Through financing the additional requirement for Oral Polio Vaccine
(OPV), this scaling up of activities would maximize the project impact and ultimately the
development effectiveness.

9.      While the eradication efforts have taken longer and the costs of OPV as well as other
project components have been much higher than originally anticipated, the GON is determined to
continue this intense level of activity until the region is declared polio free. This necessitates un -
interrupted and secured financing for OPV.

  In line with previous additional financing for the project, the PDO statement for this 3 rd additional financing does
not include the dates which are included the PDO statement in the Project Appraisal Document of Original Project.
The PDO formulation in the original DCA and Financing Agreements in the previous additional financing carried
an abbreviated version of that in the PAD. To regularize this discrepancy the amended agreement will adopt the
PAD formulation and restate and supersede the past legal agreements for this project by encompassing all preceding
credits plus the new one in the new FA.


                                                           2
10.   The Project introduced an element of performance based financing with the donor buy-
down arrangement for the credit based on performance relating to the following triggers:

   -   Timely arrival of OPV at the national level procured through UNICEF. Target: vaccines
       arrive at least 3 weeks before the Supplemental Immunization Activities (SIA) in the
       national strategic store in Abuja. Tool: UNICEF/NPHCDA vaccine arrival report.

   -   Immunization coverage of SIA: Target: at the end of the credit, immunization coverage
       of OPV is at least 80 percent in each endemic state. Tool: cluster sample survey as per a
       WHO approved methodology.

11.     Performance on these triggers, and thereby eligibility for the buy-down, is currently being
assessed through an independent performance audit commissioned by IDA. The performance
audit covers both the point prevalence of polio immunization coverage and the vaccine arrival. It
has been carried out during the month of October 2010 and results should be available by the
early 2011. If targets are met the previous credits will be bought down leaving only this third
additional credit buy-down yet to be determined.

12.     While it is not possible to predict when Nigeria will see the last case of polio, there is
now ground for expecting that Nigeria will see the last case in 2011. During the last two years,
efforts were intensified in scaling up activities for polio eradication. Some of these included
extensive communication campaigns, a strengthened monitoring system including the use of Lot
Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS), and a surveillance system supported by a large number of
WHO field level officers and operations research to identify factors which hamper vaccination
coverage. During the past year, 8,000 stool samples have been collected from Acute Flac cid
Paralysis (AFP) cases ­ out of which 8 were found to be cases of polio. This is a good indication
of the high performance of the surveillance system. Stool samples are examined at 2 national
laboratories which can now, after intensive inputs from WHO, deliver reliable results in 21 days.

13.     Polio eradication has also helped strengthen other aspects of primary health care. Based
on lessons learned from the polio campaign, Nigeria has made progress in strengthening routine
immunization with the use of micro-planning, better use of data and increased engagement of
traditional and Government leaders. Current efforts to improve the cold chain and address
systemic gaps are also relevant for both polio and routine immunization.

14.    A large number of international and national immunization, communication and cold
storage specialists are placed in the country with a high concentration in the Northern states. The
program has carefully followed the semi-annual recommendations of the International Expert
Review Committee with regards to the type of vaccine to use, frequency of immunization
rounds, research to be conducted and strategies to be followed to achieve the program objectives.
For each case of polio the genetic train of transmission is used to determine the type of OPV to
be used as well as to predict the risk of further cases.

15.   The overall implementation progress of the Project is rated satisfactory and legal
covenants have been complied with. There are no outstanding financial management or



                                                3
procurement issues and the monitoring and evaluation arrangements for the program are
satisfactory. There are no unresolved fiduciary, environmental or social issues.


16.     Nigeria, India, Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only countries in the world wherein
polio is still endemic. According to WHO, no other country has ever experienced the rapid
decrease in polio cases that Nigeria has seen this year (see below). Although India has seen a
promising decrease this year, Afghanistan and Pakistan have not experienced any major
reduction in cases.

17.     Globally there are only a few producers of polio vaccine and as the epidemic is coming to
an end these producers are increasingly reluctant to continue their production. It is, therefore,
essential that Nigeria is able to transfer funds to UNICEF in time to secure the required OPV for
Nigeria. While UNICEF is the sole supplier of polio vaccine to the highly endemic countries,
they do have to prioritize limited supplies to the country which has funds.

18.     Alternatives to IDA additional financing were considered such as preparation of a new
IDA project, use of Government funds or funding from other donors. These options are not
viable due to the urgency of the request from the GON. While the GON and other donors are
providing substantial funds to cover the operational costs of the polio eradication efforts, there
are at present no other confirmed financiers of vaccines after the January 2011 round. Failure to
have adequate vaccines from February onwards would not only impede the polio eradication
efforts in Nigeria but would have adverse effects on the global eradication campaign. The IDA
role as a financier of last resort is, therefore, important.

                                    III. PROPOSED C HANGES

19.     The proposed additional financing of US$60 million would retain the objectives and
implementation procedures of the original project and would be allocated, as requested by the
recipient, as an additional credit to the GON. As such, there are no proposed changes to the
project's development objectives and design, and IDA funds will continue to be used to finance
the procurement of OPV through UNICEF.

20.    As described above, the GON has already introduced a number of new and improved
procedures to better achieve the objectives of the project and has recently demonstrated
remarkable success. While the implementing agency, the National Program of Immunization,
was originally under the Federal Ministry of Health, this office has now been subsumed under
the newly established National Primary Health Care Development Agency. The institutional
arrangements however remain the same.

21.   The proposed additional financing will continue to make use of the innovative IDA buy-
down mechanism. The donors for this trust fund have committed US$28 million for the buy-
down.

22.       Early experience from the performance audit review suggests that the indicator used for
previous buy downs: Vaccines arrive at least 3 weeks before the SIAs in the national strategic
store in Abuja is not specific and does not measure Government performance. Vaccine arrival is
dependent on a number of exogenous factors not always in the Government control. Further,
while the vaccine has not always arrived in the country three weeks prior to the planned polio
round, there has not been a single incident of vaccine stock-out recorded. Alternative indicators
were explored including those measuring performance of the cold chain, surveillance system and
allied interventions such as Vitamin A programs however they all had problems with specificity
and what the credit was meant to achieve.

23.     Hence while vaccine arrival will continue to be tracked as part of the results framework
as a process indicator of the quality of the polio eradication project, it will be dropped as a buy
down indicator. This third additional financing will therefore use only one buy down indicator
i.e. Immunization coverage of Supplemental Immunization Activities (SIAs); (Target: At the end
of the credit, immunization coverage of oral polio vaccine of at least 80 percent is reached in
each endemic state. (Tool: cluster sample survey according to WHO approved methodology).
Following the recommendations of the Independent Evaluation of Performance and Lessons
Learned in the IDA buy-downs for Polio Eradication Projects (World Bank, 2008), the
performance on this trigger will be measured through an independent performance audit
undertaken by IDA. The additional financing presents an opportunity to improve the quality of
the results framework. The revisions include the addition of two core indicators on children
immunized and the mandatory core indicator on direct project beneficiaries. This will ensure that
the project responds to the Bank's mandate to gather data on a uniform set of indicators at the
project level and will improve our ability to aggregate and report on results at the country,
sectoral and institutional level - across the results chain. Further enhancements to the results
framework include revisions to PDO level and intermediate results indicators which were refined
to reflect the actual results that the project is tracking.

24.     Project Costs and Financing: Total costs of this Additional Financing including taxes and
duties, are estimated at US$60 million. The breakdown of total estimated costs is in Annex 3.
Annex 4 lays out the disbursement schedule. A summary of the procurement arrangement is
given in Annex 5.

                                       IV. A PPRAISAL SUMMARY

25.     Justification for Government intervention: Vaccinations, including polio vaccination,
create positive externalities as an immunized child reduces the risk of spreading diseases to
others. However, since parents do not take into account these benefits when deciding whether to
vaccinate a child, the number of children immunized would be less than optimal without pro-
active Government intervention. Government intervention is also justified for equity concerns
as the poor and marginalized are the least likely to be immunized.

26.     Justification for World Bank's support: Polio eradication is a global public good, the cost
of which should be subsidized to individual governments. The resources needed in the short term
to eradicate poliomyelitis are substantial. Nigeria could not possibly finance the entire effort due
to insufficient resources and competing needs, as well as the relatively small share polio
represents in the country's burden of disease. However, the benefits to the country, to Africa and
to Global Health through the elimination of poliomyelitis in Nigeria are substantial as resources
currently used for polio immunization and care of the polio afflicted can be channeled towards
other health priorities. At the moment, the presence of the wild polio virus in Nigeria represents
a threat to the regional and global eradication efforts as the virus continues to spread to other
countries. Substantial progress has been achieved last year (with the 98% reduction in Polio
cases) due to the demonstrated commitment of the Government and the use of new and
innovative strategies. A final effort is now likely to eliminate the transmission of the wild polio
virus in Nigeria.

27.    Multilateral organizations, bilateral donors and foundations have been willing to
contribute to polio eradication as they recognize that IDA participation provides assurance that
the program is sound, monitoring is adequate and fiduciary controls are in place. In this way,
IDA financing has over the project life leveraged substantial additional resources for the
program.

28.     Cost-effectiveness of the eradication approach: As the eradication efforts approach their
goal, the marginal cost of finalizing the campaign increases significantly. This creates the
dilemma of whether it is more cost-effective to eliminate the transmission of the wild polio virus
or just control the spread of the remaining cases. Studies2 have, however, shown that the effort to
eradicate polio implies lower longer-term total costs than a control strategy. In addition,
eradication of polio will demonstrate that such efforts can yield results and thereby encourage the
country to engage in similar efforts towards other health problems.

29.    Financial Gap analysis: The Expert Review Committee (ERC) met on October 4 and 5,
2010 and recommended to schedule two full national immunization days, four sub-national
immunization days for about 20 high risk states in addition to the inclusion of polio
immunization as part of the semi-annual MNCH weeks for 2011. This will require approximately
400 million doses of OPV at the cost of around US$60 million for a year. The resources from
this project, with a closing date of April 30 th, 2012 will thereby finance the entire vaccine
requirement for one year. In 2012 it is expected that incidence will have come to zero and
Nigeria will enter a three year phase of maintaining their polio free status with a much lower
operational cost and vaccine requirement. These requirements will be met either through the
countries own sources or through other donors, with whom Nigeria is currently negotiatin g.

30.    The proposed additional financing does not require additional implementation capacity
beyond what is already in place for the existing Project, namely management by the National
Primary Health Care Development Agency, the use of existing public health structures at
Federal, State and Local Government levels with technical assistance from the Expert Review
Committee, WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and UNICEF. The additional financing will
be monitored through the existing monitoring mechanisms and already functional surveillance
system as well as through regular, joint donor supervision missions.

Fiduciary

Financial management: This is the 3rd additional financing for the project and the financial
management arrangements existing under the project have been assessed as satisfactory and
adequate. These arrangements under the project will not change and will be followed for this
additional financial. These procedures are consistent with the procedures agreed and documented
in the original PAD of the project and summarized below:

                                                       7
      i)      An agreement will be signed between the Nigeria government and UNICEF on a
              single source contract for the purchase of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV);
      ii)     The Agreement will be cleared with World Bank Procurement unit;
      iii)    The OPV will be procured in accordance with UNICEF's rules, regulations and
              procedures;
      iv)     The credit proceeds will be disbursed by the Bank directly to UNICEF for the
              purchase of the required OPV on the basis of instructions from the Government of
              Nigeria;
      v)      UNICEF will maintain a separate ledger accounts in its books through which all
              receipts and expenditures, for the purposes of providing these services contemplated
              by the Agreement, will be recorded;
      vi)     UNICEF will report quarterly/semester to the Nigeria Government (with copy to the
              Bank) on the use of funds received: (a) balance at the beginning and end of the
              reporting period; (b) the sales and purchase orders placed by UNICEF during the
              reporting period; (c) the actual quantities of OPV delivered during the reporting
              period; and (d) the expenditures from the OPV Procurement Account during the
              reporting period.

The Borrower will not be directly involved in the management of the funds relating to this IDA
credit. All financial management responsibilities are vested in UNICEF. The reports submitted
under vi) above will allow the project to meet the Bank's financial reporting requirements, given
that UNICEF financial regulations and procedures are accepted under the Bank-UN FMFA
which UNICEF has signed. This additional financing will also not request for project audit. The
team has secured audit exemption for this project from the FM Sector Board with the
understanding that the IDA reserves the right to request for such audit should any issue come to
our attention.

31.      Procurement and disbursement arrangements: The existing procurement and
disbursement procedures applied under the current project, which have been assessed to b e
satisfactory, will continue. UNICEF will undertake the procurement and supply of OPV through
its international procurement division, based in Copenhagen as agreed under the current Project.
IDA "No Objection" to the procurement agreement3 (MoU) between the GON and UNICEF for
the duration of the additional financing has been provided and will be signed by May 1, 2011.
Under the MoU, UNICEF will buy the vaccines from the most advantageous source, while
taking into account its other obligations to respond to the global needs for OPV and its own
institutional requirements. With respect to disbursement arrangements, no changes to the existing
disbursement arrangements are foreseen for this operation. The additional financing will include
provision for retroactive financing, as per conditions and criteria in the OP 6.00 of up to US$12
Million, with a cutoff date of December 15, 2010 for vaccine procurements using IDA approved
procedures.

32.     Environmental and Social Aspects: The Project is not envisaged to cause
environmental risks and the environmental category for the additional financing is C as for the
original Project. Since oral vaccine is used, only the vaccine vials present a potential

environmental risk. These are collected for vaccine monitoring purposes and brought to the state
level where they are buried according to WHO guidelines after having been counted. In terms of
social aspects, the Project has a strong poverty focus. Poor people living in unhygienic
conditions are at greatest risk of having polio. Besides, children in poor families tend to have the
lowest immunization coverage. The Project specifically aims to benefit vulnerable groups and
previously neglected groups by providing polio immunization. Poor families, particularly
children, are the primary beneficiaries of the Project.

     The development objective of the Project is to assist, as part of a global polio eradication effort, the Government of Nigeria to achieve its goal
     of interrupting the transmission of wild polio virus, and to sustain these efforts throughout the implementation of the project, through
     effective OPV coverage of the target population.
