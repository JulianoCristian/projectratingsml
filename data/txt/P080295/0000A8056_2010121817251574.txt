                         Assist GON in achieving its goal of interrupting transmission of wild polio virus by the end of 2003 and in sustaining these efforts throughout the period
                         2003-2005 through effective OPV coverage of the target population.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall performance of the program has been satisfactory. As of October 2010 a total of 8 polio cases with onset in 2010 have been reported compared to 376 WPV cases at the
                         same time in 2009. This constitutes one of the most dramatic reductions in polio virus circulation in any endemic country in the history of the polio program. The improved program
                         quality has been greatly facilitated by the engagement of political and traditional leaders.
