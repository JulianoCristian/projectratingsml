The project is designed as a sector\n            investment project, consisting of three complementary\n            components: 1) a sector planning and research component\n            facilitating long-term sector and project planning, namely,\n            for the National Surface Drainage System (NSDS) to carry\n            saline effluent from the drainage network to the sea, and\n            enhancing the technical foundations of drainage; 2) the\n            institutional reforms component, the most important\n            component, aimed at decentralizing provincial irrigation\n            departments, and streamlining and building the capacity of\n            water and power development authorities, provincial\n            irrigation and drainage authorities, area water boards,\n            on-farm water management directorates of provincial\n            agricultural departments, and farmers' organizations;\n            and 3) the investment component, designed to improve\n            drainage and water management infrastructure, and to protect\n            inland wetlands, which finances completion of ongoing\n            projects, rehabilitation and remodeling of completed\n            drainage projects, and new projects which conform to or\n            support the overall strategies of the project."}, "docdt": "1997-09-25T00:00:00Z"}
