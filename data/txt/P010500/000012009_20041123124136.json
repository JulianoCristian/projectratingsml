The section also contains a\n            description of project status and evolution. Section IV\n            discusses issues of particular relevance to the Request,\n            including the Left Bank Outfall Drain, the Tidal Link and\n            Cholri Weir, and NDP project issues. Section V recommends\n            actions, and Section VI concludes the main text. Annex 1\n            presents the Requestors' claims, together with\n            Management's detailed responses, in table format. Eight\n            other annexes provide background, and other pertinent\n            information. The Requestors allege that the project violates\n            Bank policies regarding adherence to Pakistan's\n            requirements under international environmental treaties and\n            agreements, as well as adversely affecting marginalized and\n            vulnerable indigenous peoples, and cultural and historical\n            sites, and so fails to adhere to Bank policies regarding\n            involuntary settlement, or to engage the local community in\n            meaningful participation. The Requestors ask for an\n            investigation and recommendations to correct the harm and\n            bring the project into compliance with Bank policy. The\n            report in response to the Inspection Panel Investigation\n            Report, states that Management believes the Bank has made\n            efforts to work with the Government of Pakistan, the Asian\n            Development Bank (ADB), and Japan Bank for International\n            Cooperation (JBIC) to realize the objectives of an extremely\n            large and complex Project. The Bank intends to pursue issues\n            raised in the Request concerning Sindh Province with the\n            Borrower, so that the Requesters' concerns are\n            addressed. Management believes that the Requesters'\n            rights and interests are not, nor will be, directly and\n            adversely affected by the manner in which the Bank has\n            implemented its policies, and procedures in the\n            implementation of the National Drainage Program Project. The\n            report includes a summary of issues and recommended actions,\n            and a technical note and recommendations, with specific\n            measures to protect the Dhands, and institutional arrangements."}, "docdt": "2004-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
