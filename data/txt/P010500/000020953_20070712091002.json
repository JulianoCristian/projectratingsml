It describes the activities\n            and projects initiated for the short term, as well as those\n            being developed for the medium and longer term. This report\n            highlights the major results of the first eight months of\n            the implementation of the Action Plan: 1) Significant\n            progress has been made to address the harsh conditions of\n            the population living in the area. Direct actions to\n            alleviate poverty are in place through an inclusive\n            consultation process with the communities; 2) A rapid\n            assessment of ecological and livelihood conditions of the\n            \"dhands\" in the vicinity of the outfall system has\n            progressed less than expected; 3) Progress has been made in\n            assessing and improving local government flood management\n            systems. The assessment was carried in April/May, 2007 and\n            discussed with the Government; 4) Progress has been made in\n            carrying out an assessment of the functionality of the\n            outfall system as well as in implementing the most urgent\n            repairs; and 5) Appraisal and negotiations of the Sindh\n            Water Sector Improvement Project (WSIP) have been completed\n            in March, 2007 and Board presentation is expected in\n            September, 2007. Management believes that while immediate\n            actions have been taken to address the main issues affecting\n            the area as a consequence of the floods of 2003 and 2006,\n            flood risks in the coastal zone of the Indus river system\n            will continue to be high."}, "docdt": "2007-07-05T00:00:00Z"}
