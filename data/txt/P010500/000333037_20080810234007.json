The overall outcome of the project was rated\n            unsatisfactory, and the performance of the Bank and the\n            borrower was also rated as unsatisfactory. The major factors\n            affecting the implementation and outcome of the project are\n            as follows: (i) the record storms of a cyclone in 1998 and\n            2002 resulted in extensive flooding in the lower parts of\n            the coastal areas; (ii) the persistent drought for over 4\n            years reduced the waterlogged area and emphasis shifted\n            towards increasing irrigation supplies instead of drainage;\n            (iii) there was reluctance in government circles to follow\n            the agreed Framework for Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n            (FLAR), which delayed the subprojects requiring land\n            acquisition, and in many cases precluded their\n            implementation; (iv) absence of a first year's program\n            in all provinces except Sindh as no projects, except the\n            remaining works of Nara canal in Sindh, were ready for\n            implementation in the initial stages of NDP, project\n            preparation activity started only in 1998 and initially only\n            the leftover works can be implemented and no new subprojects\n            can be implemented in the first year; and (v) changing\n            priorities and frequent additions and deletions of schemes\n            by the provinces resulted in too many revisions of rolling\n            plans, unproductive preparation of subprojects by\n            consultants and implementation delays. Lessons learned: (a)\n            good sector work prior to appraisal and coordination between\n            donors can be very valuable in assisting governments to\n            embark on correct, but politically difficult sector\n            policies, planning processes must utilize a more\n            consultative and participatory process in which all risks\n            and options as well as tradeoffs are made explicit and\n            considered by stakeholders and policy makers jointly; and\n            (b) strong environmental work is needed for implementing\n            complex projects. Environmental objectives and the intrinsic\n            and human environmental values that are important for the\n            livelihoods of direct and indirect beneficiaries need to be\n            an integral part of the framework for formulating plans,\n            designing projects, and evaluating tradeoffs and risks."}, "docdt": "2007-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
