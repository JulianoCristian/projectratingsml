The Requestors claim more than 50 villages will\n            suffer the permanent threat of flooding from the disposal of\n            upstream saline effluents if the existing Left Bank Outfall\n            Drain system  - which they allege is faulty - is further\n            expanded under the NDP. They also claim that the National\n            Surface Drainage System and the use of the disposal system\n            through the Tidal Link is not sustainable, because the Tidal\n            Link's failure has already caused the loss of thousands\n            of acres of land. The Requesters further state that the\n            super engineering ideas [that] have been used against the\n            natural flows are causing them harm, while the alternate\n            project options or disposal systems, which are historical\n            natural disposal systems, have been ignored. Further they\n            claim the proposed drainage network will badly affect the\n            already degraded environment of Indus Delta, by the absence\n            of fresh water, essential for coastal forests and marine\n            life; by the disposal of toxic drainage effluents that will\n            destroy the remaining resources of marine fisheries and\n            mangrove forests; and by the drainage effluent that contains\n            not only saline sub-soil water but also residual traces of\n            pesticides, fertilizer, and industrial waste accumulated\n            along the way. The Requestors also claim that blockage of\n            the flow of effluent causes the effluent to seep into both\n            sides of the Kadhan Pateji Outfall Drain, which negatively\n            affects groundwater quality, a single drinking source, thus\n            causing severe impact on human health. Also threatened are\n            two coastal wetlands, protected areas significant for\n            migratory birds and other significant biodiversity and\n            ecosystem values. The Requestors allege that the project\n            violates Bank policies regarding adherance to\n            Pakistan's requirements under international\n            environmental treaties and agreements, as well as adversely\n            affecting marginalized and vulnerable indigenous peoples,\n            and cultural and historical sites, and fails to adhere to\n            Bank policies regarding involuntary settlement or to engage\n            the local community in meaningful participation. The\n            Requestors ask for an investigation and recommendations to\n            correct the harm and bring the project into compliance with\n            Bank policy. This request for inspection is now registered."}, "docdt": "2004-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
