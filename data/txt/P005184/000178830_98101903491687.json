the\n            irrigation of about 34,000 hectares of newly developed land\n            by means of deep wells and small local stream diversions.\n            The project also includes the establishment of about 1,900\n            small sheep and poultry farms and the improvement of 5,500\n            hectares of range land for livestock production. Project\n            works are expected to be completed by March 21, 1972, which\n            is the end of Iranian calendar year 1350. Work on a limited\n            part of the project has been proceeding since 1964 but in\n            view of the complexity of the problems involved a detailed\n            program for the whole project was not completed until the\n            end of 1966. Full development of the newly irrigated land is\n            expected to be achieved within about ten years and to result\n            in an increase in net farm output of about $16 million a year."}, "docdt": "1967-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
