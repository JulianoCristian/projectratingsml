Following are several\n            lessons from the project experience. Enhancing institutional\n            capacity of the recipient agency in several competencies -\n            road maintenance, implementation of highway projects,\n            traffic management, and road transport sector training\n            systems - were project objectives, and an integral part of\n            the project and the Credit Agreement. However, the Ministry\n            of Transport (MOT) was reticent in approving technical\n            assistance, only few activities were approved and\n            implemented, and training only started at the later part of\n            the project, therefore not achieving the institutional\n            capacity building as planned. Rather, support to capacity\n            building should only take place after careful consideration,\n            and discussion with the agencies involved, its design should\n            be well advanced during project preparation, including\n            defined performance indicators, and intermediate results\n            linked to project outcomes, with emphasis on government\n            ownership. MOT needs to improve its ability to plan, budget\n            and monitor maintenance activities, to facilitate\n            preservation, and improve access for road users, taking into\n            account its Ten-year Strategic Maintenance Plan, when\n            preparing annual work programs. Other lessons address the\n            need to strengthen the role of the Supervision Engineer;\n            and, for design and construction standards consistent with\n            project objectives, through planning and programming\n            processes for road maintenance, further enhanced with\n            capacity building and standards for maintenance works,\n            adopted as a prerequisite for any future road maintenance\n            program. It is highlighted that environmental and\n            resettlement monitoring should be independent from the\n            project, with a framework consistent with internationally\n            recognized practices for design, implementation, and\n            operation of road projects. Finally, and although for nearly\n            a decade, restructuring and privatization of state-owned\n            enterprises (SOEs) has been occurring, there is however the\n            need for equity programs to improve the operational and\n            financial performance of SOEs."}, "docdt": "2004-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
