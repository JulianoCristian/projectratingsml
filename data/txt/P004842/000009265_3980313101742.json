All trees, saplings, and\n            shrubbery will be protected from unnecessary damage.\n            Thereafter, reseeding, replanting, or restoration will\n            prevent further damage (i.e. erosion) and restore\n            quasi-original conditions. After their use, borrow pits and\n            other material resource areas will be landscaped and planted\n            to provide substitute areas for displaced natural habitats\n            or other appropriate land use. Wastewater will be treated by\n            using settling ponds, gravel filters, or other processes so\n            as not to impair water quality or harm aquatic life. Dust\n            from vehicles or equipment will be minimized by regularly\n            sprinkling water or other acceptable methods. Waste\n            materials, brush, or trees will be burned only under\n            favorable weather conditions. To minimize traffic delays and\n            to protect pedestrians along work areas, temporary access\n            will be provided to residents.  Construction activities will\n            be limited to daytime hours.  Noise, from blasting, hauling,\n            and other such operations will be minimized by using\n            low-noise machines.
