     Improvement Project (IDSMIP) is to improve the effectiveness\n            and financial viability of irrigation water distribution and\n            management on 56,000 ha, through provision of support to\n            Water Users Associations (WUA) and the State Amelioration\n            and Irrigation Committee (SAIC). There are 3 components to\n            the project. 1) This component would include several\n            activities, designed to develop sustainable operating WUAs\n            in the country. It would finance technical assistance, goods\n            and training. 2) During project preparation diagnostic\n            surveys were carried out in nine project raions. The main\n            technical findings of the survey work were: (i) on-farm\n            systems are in poor condition with high water losses; (ii)\n            canals are seriously affected by the heavy silt load in\n            irrigation water due to non-functioning desilting at\n            headworks; (iii) there is lack of operational hydraulic\n            structures, and therefore no regulation or water\n            measurement, and thus no incentive for efficient use of\n            water; (iv) pump irrigation is seriously affected by poor\n            quality of pumps and unreliable electricity supply; and (v)\n            significant areas have been affected by salinity, and\n            reclamation would be needed. 3) With the similarities in\n            implementation requirements for the ongoing Rehabilitation\n            and Completion of Irrigation and Drainage Infrastructure\n            Project, the existing PKJ would also be responsible, on\n            behalf of SAIC, for the daily management, administration and\n            coordination of the IDSMIP."}, "docdt": "2003-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
