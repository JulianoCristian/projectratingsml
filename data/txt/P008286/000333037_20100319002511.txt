                                   Proposed Changes

a. What are the proposed changes, as applicable, in the project's development
   objectives, outcomes, design, and/or scope?

There are no changes in the project's development objective, outcomes, design, and/or
scope. The proposed changes are:
    1. An extension of the project closing date from March 31, 2010 to September 30,
       2010.
    2. Exclusion from the project of funding for heavy-duty maintenance equipment for
       Water Users Associations (WUA) that have benefitted from irrigation and
       drainage rehabilitation works.
    3. An adjustment of the credit categories in the order of US$2,583,593.25, from the
       categories of goods, training and operation costs to the categories of civil works
       and consultancy services.

b. What are the other complementary changes, as applicable:

Institutional arrangements                                  ___Yes    X No
If, yes, please explain:

Financing mechanism/Conduit                                 ___Yes    X No
If, yes, please explain:

Outputs                                                       X Yes    __No
If, yes, please explain:

Under the original project budget, the WUAs that benefit from rehabilitation were
eligible for operation and maintenance (O&M) equipment. A total of US$2.8 million
was allocated under the project, and numerous small items have already been purchased
and provided to the WUAs on grant basis. It was originally envisaged that about US$1.9
million would be used for the provision of heavy-duty maintenance equipment to assist
the WUAs with maintenance of their systems. However, in light of civil work contract
cost over runs, funds will not be available to purchase heavy-duty equipment. This does
not significantly impact the project outcome indicators, as in the years following
rehabilitation maintenance requirements are low. The provision of equipment should,
however, be considered for a future investment, as over time the capacity of WUAs to
conduct essential O&M of systems under their management has to increase.

Project Costs and financing plan (include summary tables) X Yes       __No
If, yes, please explain:

Corresponding changes in the project cost plan to reflect actual local and foreign
expenditures and estimates for the expenditure of the remaining funds will be made.
Financial management                                            ___Yes   X No

Disbursement arrangements                                       X Yes    __No

In order to complete the project activities, it is necessary to reallocate US$2,583,593.25
from the categories of goods, training and operation costs to the categories of civil works
and consultancy services. The costs of civil works in Azerbaijan have increased
compared to the estimates at the time of project appraisal. In addition, some of the costs
of the consultancy services for design and construction supervision were higher than
estimated at appraisal, due to civil works contract extensions. In view of the proposed
extension of the closing date, the total cost of maintaining the PIU will increase. In light
of cost overruns in these categories, there are not sufficient funds available to purchase
heavy-duty O&M equipment (goods category) for WUAs.

Closing date                                                    X Yes ___No

The Government of Azerbaijan requested to extend the credit closing date by six months,
from March 31, 2010 until September 30, 2010. This extension would allow the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) to adequately finalize and evaluate the project, properly
collect and articulate lessons learned, and thus incorporate these lessons in the planning
and implementation of future investments in the irrigation sector.

Implementation schedule                                         X Yes ___No

The implementation schedule is revised to reflect the extended project closing date to
September 30, 2010.
