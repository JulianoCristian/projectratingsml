for\n            Azerbaijan were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            project concepts and structure were simple but relevant. The\n            focus on institutional development and rehabilitation\n            appropriately concentrated on the essential core aspect of\n            irrigation that needed urgent development. Simplicity and\n            focus prevented risks of over-reach and distraction.\n            Objectives were straightforward and not too ambitious. This\n            was a pattern built in from the start of IDSMIP. This is a\n            lesson with relevance beyond IDSMIP and Azerbaijan. The\n            relationship between the Water User Association (WUA),\n            regional/local offices of the AIOJSC and RSU (Amelioration\n            and Irrigation Open Joint Stock Company and Raion Support\n            Unit) will be long term and should become a partnership of\n            support. Assistance should not create dependency but should\n            be designed to move WUAs toward greater self reliance.\n            Initial delays were caused in project implementation because\n            of lack of experience in preparing legal documents. More\n            training for RSUs and WUA officers in preparing documents\n            for WUA re-registration, water supply agreements, transfer\n            agreements, etc. at the beginning of the next project could\n            help avoid such delays. IDSMIP indicates that WUAs need\n            thorough training and management consultations to enable\n            them to have good irrigation service plans, which is also\n            relevant internationally. The main factor for WUAs achieving\n            sustainability lies in quality of management, operation,\n            repair and maintenance by the WUA. Investment in\n            rehabilitation and institutional development are mutually supportive."}, "docdt": "2011-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
