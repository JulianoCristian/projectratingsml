Several specific key lessons can be drawn from\n            this project: a) Bureaucratic procurement processes were a\n            leading cause of project implementation delays - Provincial\n            Electricity Authority's bureaucratic and politicized\n            procurement process resulted in a lengthy procurement cycle\n            adding delays and unnecessary costs to projects that it\n            undertakes. Speedier procurement processing and more\n            coordinated and efficient inventory management and materials\n            handling are key to increasing the efficiency of its\n            investment program. b) Fragmented project team and\n            coordination problems - A fully integrated project team\n            could have mitigated many of the delays caused by\n            insufficient coordination during implementation. c) Actions\n            on land acquisition should be taken early on during\n            preparation stage - To ensure smooth project implementation,\n            land acquisition should be completed before the start of\n            implementation, or a realistic and concrete time-bound\n            action plan should be developed and followed through with\n            close monitoring from both the Bank and the implementing agency."}, "docdt": "1998-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
