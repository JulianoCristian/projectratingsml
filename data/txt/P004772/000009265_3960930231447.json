The project\n            will also provide for the construction of transmission lines\n            and substations in a U-shaped geographical area surrounding\n            Bangkok. Specifically, the project will involve: (a)\n            construction of about 18, 115/22 kV substations and about\n            500 km of 115 kV transmission lines; and (b) consulting\n            services for: (i) system reliability improvement; (ii)\n            project engineering and design; (iii) training of PEA staff\n            in system planning, design, operation and maintenance; (iv)\n            improving PEA's capabilities in computerized\n            distribution planning and design; and (v) strengthening\n            PEA's organization structure."}, "docdt": "1991-08-16T00:00:00Z"}
