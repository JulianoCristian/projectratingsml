second\n            series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) program\n            is to support implementation of Mali's Growth and\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework (GPRSF) adopted in\n            2006. This program document proposes a fifth PRSC for the\n            Republic of Mali in the amount of SDR 44.5 million (US$70\n            million equivalent). This operation is the third in a\n            programmatic series of three PRSCs designed to support the\n            implementation of the Government's poverty reduction\n            strategy. Specifically, this second series aims to\n            strengthen public financial management and improve access to\n            basic social services, while enhancing the regulatory and\n            institutional framework for infrastructure and private\n            investment. The reform program supported by this operation\n            continues and deepens the agenda introduced by third PRSC\n            and fourth PRSC, with an increased focus on improving the\n            environment for private investment and infrastructure. The\n            design of the second PRSC series benefited from\n            consultations with various stakeholders. The lessons learned\n            from the implementation of the first four PRSCs were taken\n            into account in the design of this follow-up operation."}, "docdt": "2011-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
