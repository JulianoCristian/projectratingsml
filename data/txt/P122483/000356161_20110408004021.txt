CAS
                            with a particular emphasis on actions to ensure a well-managed transition
                            to private ownership in the cotton sector, enhance governance in the office
                            du Niger, improve the ease of doing business, enhance the financial
                            sustainability of the electricity utility, and to strengthen transparency and
                            accountability practices in the mining sector;
                    (2)     strengthen public financial management, through a strengthened legal
                            framework for procurement, increased transparency and strengthened
                            external oversight;
                    (3)     strengthen PFM in the sectors in charge of basic education and health in

Mitigation       security risks.

                 External risks. A slower than expected recovery from the global crisis, a reversal
                 of the terms of trade gains, a further drop in remittances and tourism revenues, and
                 a decline in external aid remain major risks for the country. The ongoing political
                 crisis in Côte d'Ivoire and the political turmoil in the Middle East and North
                 Africa add to the uncertainties emerging from global developments. Other
                 exogenous factors such as Mali's vulnerability to natural shocks (drought, locust
                 invasion) could compound the situation. Mitigating factors are Mali's strong track
                 record in macroeconomic management and the government's renewed focus on
                 growth-enhancing structural reforms while giving attention to key social
                 programs. The proposed operation would contribute to the mitigating measures by
                 supporting policy actions that contribute to economic growth and diversification,
                 and further strengthen public finance management including at decentralized level.
                 Implementation capacity risk. This risk stems from the very limited capacity in
                 the public sector at central, regional and local levels, that could slow down the
                 implementation of planned reforms. The proposed operation seeks to mitigate this
                 by accompanying key reforms with technical assistance provided through Bank
                 projects and by other donors.
                 Budget risks. Ongoing financial difficulties facing the cotton and electricity/water
                 parastatal companies (CMDT and EDM SA), the Malian Housing Bank (BHM)
                 and the social security fund CRM, could potentially require larger government
                 transfers than those included in the 2011 budget to cover larger financial shortfalls
                 in those sectors. These risks are mitigated by close monitoring of the financial
                 positions of BHM, CMDT, EDM SA and CRM, and ongoing restructuring efforts.
                 Continued high food prices and prolonged political instability in Cote d'Ivoire and
                 the Middle East and North Africa countries could also have significant budget
                 implications. Mitigation measures will be identified in the context of the
                 macroeconomic dialogue with the Government, including to allow for some
                 budget flexibility to address crisis-related expenses.
                 Political and security risks. Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for
                 2012 and could slow down the pace of reform. Insecurity concerns, linked with the
                 activities of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in the north of the country
                 remain and budgetary allocations could be higher-than-budgeted to accommodate
                 additional security spending. Insecurity could also reduce tourism revenues. These
                 risks are difficult to mitigate in the context of the operation.

                       FIFTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                                            1.     INTRODUCTION

1.1.    This program document proposes a Fifth Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSC-5) for the Republic of Mali in the amount of SDR 44.5 million (US$70 million
equivalent). This operation is the third in a programmatic series of three PRSCs (PRSC-5 of
PRSCs 3-5) designed to support the implementation of the Government's poverty reduction
strategy. Specifically, this second series aims to strengthen public financial management and
improve access to basic social services, while enhancing the regulatory and institutional
framework for infrastructure and private investment. The reform program supported by this
operation continues and deepens the agenda introduced by PRSC-3 and PRSC-4, with an
increased focus on improving the environment for private investment and infrastructure.

1.2.    The reforms supported by this operation are embedded in Mali's Growth and
Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework (GPRSF). The GPRSF covering the period 2007-
2011 and the accompanying Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) were considered by the Board of
Executive Directors on September 28, 2007. The GPRSF pursues strong broad-based growth and
improvement of public service delivery. The most recent (third) Annual Progress Report of the
GPRSF, approved by Mali's Cabinet on September 15, 2010, shows that progress has been made
in the implementation of the reform agenda but results have been mixed. Results were
encouraging regarding efforts to contain HIV/AIDS and to increase access to drinking water in
line with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), but child and maternal health indicators
remain a concern. 1

1.3.    The PRSC-5 is an integral part of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
for Mali discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on February 5, 2008. The PRSC-5
complements Bank operations that directly support Mali's growth agenda (notably on
agricultural productivity, energy, and business development) and education sector reform. The
CAS indicatively allocated US$50-60 million equivalent to PRSC-5. The amount of US$70.0
million equivalent allocated to the operation was determined by the confirmed IDA allocation for
Mali for FY11 and takes into consideration the country's financing requirements.

1.4.    The design of the second PRSC series benefited from consultations with various
stakeholders. The operation was prepared in coordination with other donors from the general
Budget Support Group. Consultations included representatives of National Assembly, the civil
society, notably business organizations, community level health associations, and women's
groups. These consultations ensure Government and country ownership of the supported policies
and harmonize donors around a common set of key reforms. The lessons learned from the
implementation of the first four PRSCs (PRSC-1 to PRSC-4) were taken into account in the
design of this follow-up operation.

A. P OLITICAL C ONTEXT

2.1.    Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for 2012. Commentators of
Mali's political situation anticipate very competitive elections, with the departure of the
charismatic incumbent Amadou Touré, and the expected return to the domestic political scene of
the widely respected Soumaïla Cissé, who has been heading the WAEMU Commission, and is
now expected to be the presidential candidate of the Union for the Republic and Democracy
(Union pour la République et la Démocratie, URD). Adema, the largest political party, will have
to face competition from a new party, the Party for Economic and Social Development (Parti
pour le Développement Economique et Social, PDES), which could have a particular appeal to
those voters looking for alternatives away from traditional parties. Adema announced its
intention to put forward its own candidate (not a coalition candidate this time), but has yet to
present a name. Elections will take place under a democratic system reinforced by the
constitutional reform package announced by the President that includes the creation of an upper
house of Parliament, independent media and election watchdogs, as well as a new code of
conduct for politicians. A referendum to endorse the proposed changes is scheduled for 2011.

2.2.    Insecurity concerns remain in the north of the country, linked with the activities of
al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Algeria, Mali, Mauritania and Niger seek to
coordinate intelligence and military activities more effectively, especially with the establishment
of the four-country joint command centre in Algeria in March, 2010. The military initiative will
be complemented by the strengthening of ongoing activities to improve living standards and
create jobs in Tuareg communities.

B. R ECENT E CONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

2.3.     Prudent macroeconomic policies led to broadly favorable outcomes in the period
2005-09 (Table 2.1 and Chart 2.1). Gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 3.9 percent
a year but varied between 1.1 percent and 5.3 percent, reflecting Mali's vulnerability to climatic
conditions and commodity price fluctuations (primarily of cotton, oil and gold). Average
consumer inflation was estimated at 4.6 percent in the period 2005-09, above the 3 percent
threshold under the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) convergence
criteria. This average is influenced by exceptional circumstances, notably the 2008 food and fuel
price crisis. The good harvest, the unwinding of the 2008 fuel and food shocks, and good
macroeconomic policies, contributed to the return of average inflation to 2.2 percent in 2009.
The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) worsened from 6.7 percent of
GDP in 2006, to 13.9 percent in 2008, when the import bill increased steeply as a result of the
food and fuel crisis. The external current account balance improved in 2009 as a result of
buoyant international gold prices (gold contributes about 75 percent of Mali's exports of goods)
and lower oil and food prices. The improvement of the overall balance of payments in 2009 was
also due to exceptional capital inflows, namely the revenues from the sale of 51 percent of state
telecom firm SOTELMA, completed in July and yielding US$0.4 billion (4 percent of GDP), and
the 74 million IMF SDR allocation. The basic fiscal balance, with a surplus of 0.3 percent of




                                                2
GDP in 2006, turned to a deficit of 1.4 percent of GDP in 2009, reflecting exceptional capital
expenditures financed by SOTELMA privatization receipts. 2

2.4.    Preliminary estimates suggest that economic growth during 2010 was 4.5 percent. A
16.5 percent decline in gold production reflecting the depletion of reserves in some existing
mines has been more than offset by strong growth in the agricultural sector (9.9 percent), which
has benefited from favorable rainfall and supportive policies, including input subsidies. 3
The good crop season held average inflation at 1.2 percent in the year. The external current
account deficit (excluding official transfers) is estimated at 8.6 percent of GDP, due mainly to a
worsening of the trade deficit reflecting a drop in gold exports. The external current account
deficit was financed by net capital inflows, particularly through external aid and foreign direct
investment. The overall balance-of-payments shows a deficit of about US$71 million, financed
by drawing on the foreign exchange reserves of the BCEAO.

2.5.    A moderate fiscal expansion took place in 2010 through the use of SOTELMA's
privatization revenues. 4 Preliminary estimates suggest that the basic deficit was maintained at
2.0 percent of GDP. 5 Tax revenues during 2010 corresponded to 14.8 percent of GDP. Plans to
adopt a broad tax reform, including align the tax framework with recent WAEMU directives,
were delayed and the reforms are now scheduled to be introduced in the context of the 2012
budget. 6 Expenditure and net lending were around 24.2 percent of GDP, in line with the
Government's program.




2
  The basic fiscal balance is given by the total revenue less current non-interest spending and net lending, excluding
grants, externally financed expenditures, and HIPC financed spending.
3
  Delays in the exploration of a new mine resulted in downward revisions in the projected gold production.
4
  The Government prepared a plan for the use SOTELMA resources covering the period-2009-12.
5
  A supplementary budget law for 2010 was submitted to the National Assembly in October incorporating, among
others, SOTELMA related expenses for which there was insufficient information at the time the budget law was
voted.
6
  WAEMU guidelines include a reduction in the profit tax from 35 percent to 30 percent.

C. M ACROECONOMIC O UTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

2.6.    Uncertainty on the speed and strength of the global recovery remains high. While
cautious optimism returned from the third quarter of 2009 with the resumption of growth
(notably in the US), recovery speeds vary, unemployment remains high and downside risks
stemming from fiscal fragilities have come to the fore. Weak labor markets, particularly in
Europe, could result in a further decrease in remittances. A key concern is that room for policy
maneuvers in many advanced economies has either been exhausted or become much more
limited given high debt levels and strained fiscal balance sheets. This could result in a reduction
of aid budgets in major developed economies, with a significant fiscal impact. Recent trends in
food and fuel prices in global markets are beginning to affect domestic inflation in Mali.
Analysis undertaken in the context of the 2008 food crisis shows that rising food prices could
lead to a substantial increase in poverty and the Government's response could have significant
fiscal impacts. The ongoing political crisis in Côte d'Ivoire adds to the uncertainties emerging
from global developments. Transport routes, trade and migrant labor flows could be severely
disrupted, even if at a lesser extent than in the early 2000s. The share of Mali's imports from
Côte d'Ivoire which varied between 13 and 16 percent from January to September 2010,
decreased steeply to 7.4 percent in December 2010. 7 The events of the last few weeks are a
defining moment for Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and other Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
countries, and could have significant macroeconomic impacts on Mali. Protracted unrest in Libya
in particular, could affect FDI, remittances and aid flows. 8 Given these uncertainties and Mali's
vulnerability to poor weather conditions and other natural disasters, projections for 2011 and the
medium term are conservative.

2.7.    Growth is projected to increase to 6.0 percent in 2011 and to average 5.0 percent per
year during 2012-14 (Table 2.1 and Chart 2.1). Growth is expected to be driven by the
agricultural and gold sectors. Gold output should increase by over 20 percent in 2011 owing to a
new mine expected to commence exploration, but decline moderately starting in 2013 with the
decline in reserves. Despite expected good weather conditions in 2011, inflation projections have
recently been revised upwards from 2 percent to 4.5 percent to reflect the expected trajectory of
food and fuel prices. Inflation is expected to return to 2.7 percent in 2012 and remain below 3
percent in the medium term. Buoyant gold and cotton prices are expected to more than offset
high oil and food prices thus helping strengthen the external current account balance in 2011.
However, this improvement may be reversed from 2012, as gold production declines.

2.8.   The 2011 budget law submitted to the National Assembly targets a basic deficit of 2
percent of GDP. However, the targeted deficit could be revised to 2.5 percent of GDP to
account for the impact of measures to mitigate the impact of the fuel and oil price increases on
poverty. Based on past experience, these could include exemptions to selected imports, and
subsidies. The authorities have not yet announced their response to the current crisis. The
response in the 2008 crisis included: (1) the elimination of the import tax on rice; (2) a temporary
ban of rice exports; and (3) measures to boost rice production. This package of measures led to
revenue shortfalls and a reduction and reallocation of expenditures. The 2011 budget law
7
  In the period prior to 2002 political crisis in Cote d'Ivoire, Mali's share of imports from Cote d'Ivoire hovered
around 30 percent.

  Libya is a major investor in agriculture (ON) and tourism, and is financing a number of public projects. While data
is scarce, anecdotal information suggests that a growing number of Malians work in Libya.

programs an increase in tax revenue by 0.1 percent of GDP compared to the projected 2010
outcome, to 14.9 percent of GDP. Latest projections see a decline in tax revenue to 13.9 percent
of GDP anticipating Government's steps to temporarily reduce import taxation on, for example,
imported food stuffs. The budget programs an increase in total expenditure to 25.4 percent of
GDP, reflecting higher capital expenditure financed with domestic resources (including
SOTELMA privatization revenue). While this target was not revised, re-allocations are likely to
be needed in response to the fuel and food price increases.

2.9.    With the SOTELMA financed fiscal stimulus, the trajectory of the basic deficit
diverges from its sustainable level of 1 percent of GDP from 2009 to 2012. The Government
is implementing revenue and expenditure measures to advance fiscal consolidation and return to
a sustainable basic fiscal deficit by 2013, in the context of the program supported under the IMF
ECF. The Government will propose, in the 2012 draft budget, an action plan for the next three
years aimed at modernizing and simplifying tax legislation and bringing it into line with regional
directives. By end February 2011, a study to inform the mechanism to index gasoline prices at
the pump to changes in supplier prices will be finalized. Also in 2011, priority will be given to
measures aimed at improving the mobilization of VAT, which accounts for about 40 percent of
tax revenues. 9 Actions will also be taken to follow up systematically on taxpayers who do not
abide by their filing obligations. A risk based approach to tax audits will be adopted and efforts
will be made to strengthen the capacity of the National Directorate of Property Titles and the
Land Registry. Measures to strengthen budget execution and oversight are also planned. These
include steps for the establishment of a single treasury account, upgrading the financial
management information system, and the adoption of a new procurement code in line with
regional guidelines.

2.10. There are fiscal risks but the Government is addressing them. The first risk is that
fiscal consolidation could slow down during the run-up to the 2012 presidential and
parliamentary elections. The second risk is that higher than budgeted spending could be directed
to security or to address financial difficulties facing the cotton ginneries (CMDT), the electricity
and water company (EDM SA), the Malian Housing Bank (BHM), or the social security
institution catering for public sector workers (Caisse de Retraites du Mali, CRM). The conflict in
Côte d'Ivoire could depress import taxes and put pressure on the provision of basic social
services through increased inflows of refugees and returnees. 10 Mali's strong track record of
fiscal discipline has served the country well, including in mobilizing budget support. Maintaining
these gains could provide strong encouragement to pursue fiscal consolidation even in the
incoming electoral period. The Government is coordinating efforts with other countries in the
region to address security related risks. The budgetary implications of the financial difficulties of
parastatals are being addressed through close monitoring of the financial positions of BHM,
CMDT, EDM SA and CRM, privatization (CMDT, BHM), and restructuring (EDM SA).

   The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) indicates that as of February, 7,
2011 the number of refugees had increased to over 36,000. UNHCR registered 35,790 refugees in Liberia, 670 in
Guinea, 221 in Togo, 135 in Mali, 84 in Ghana, 22 in Benin, 16 in Burkina Faso and 30 in Niger respectively.

Regarding CRM, steps to strengthen regulations to address the risks are being taken, but progress
has been slow. Slippages in the implementation of critical reform actions could increase the risks
above. For instance, delays in the adoption of a new tariff mechanism for electricity could
worsen the difficult financial situation of EDM S.A, more so with the recent increases in fuel
prices. Similarly, delays in the privatization of CMDT's subsidiaries could entail missed
opportunities to launch production in the sector while diverting scarce public resources from key
priorities such as education and health to address CMDT financial difficulties.

2.11. The 2010 Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) update indicates that the risk of debt
distress needs to be upgraded from low to moderate. Under baseline assumptions, all external
debt and debt-service ratios remain below the policy-dependent thresholds throughout the
projection period (Table 2.2). The present value (PV) of external debt is expected to increase
from 16 percent of GDP in 2010 to 19 percent in 2030. As production from existing gold mines
declines and other exports' growth only partly compensates that decline, the PV of the external
debt-to-exports ratio is projected to increase steeply from 62 percent in 2010 to 113 percent in
2030, but remain well below the threshold of 150 percent. With projected increase in tax revenue
collection by about 2.6 percent of GDP from 2010 to 2030, the PV of the external debt-to-
revenue ratio is projected to hover around 90 percent of GDP, which is significantly below the
threshold of 250 percent. However, Mali's external debt sustainability is highly sensitive to an
export shock or a hardening of financial terms. Under an alternative scenario that lowers the
exports to GDP ratio permanently by about 30 percent, the PV of the debt-to-exports ratio would
exceed the threshold in the year 2017 and remain above it until the end of the projection period.
Under a hardening of financial terms, the PV of debt-to-exports ratio would also breach the
threshold, but only by the end of the projection period. Mali's debt sustainability needs to remain
under close scrutiny and the Government needs to limit its recourse to external financing to
grants and concessional loans while strengthening debt management, or find ways to further
accelerate growth of GDP and diversify exports.

2.12. The IMF presented its ECF arrangement with Mali to its Board on May 28, 2008
and its fifth review was successfully completed on January 26, 2010. In the context of its
ECF-supported program, the Government is implementing measures to continue to maintain
prudent macroeconomic policies. In addition, the medium term reform program targets a number
of critical actions in banking, agriculture and public financial management that would reduce
fiscal risks and support accelerated growth. Bank and IMF staff will continue to coordinate the
content of the PRSC series and ECF to ensure that the instruments complement one another,
especially in the area of public financial management and structural reforms.

2.13. Overall, Mali's macroeconomic framework provides an adequate basis for the
proposed operation. The 2011 budget is aligned with the GPRSF priorities. The fiscal deficit is
temporarily unsustainable (2009-12) but this is related to exceptional investments financed by
exceptional resources from the privatization of SOTELMA. The authorities intend to use these
on non-recurrent spending aimed at raising economic growth. Funds are being allocated to the
eight priority areas of President Touré's 2007-12 Economic and Social Development Plan, which
is aligned with the GPRSF. About one-fourth of the money is destined for infrastructure,
agriculture, and the social sectors; one-fourth for counterpart funds to co-finance public
investment with donors; another one-fourth for paying down domestic debt; and the balance for
housing construction, decentralization, support to small enterprises, and other uses. Moreover,
the authorities have a credible fiscal consolidation plan, which is being implemented in a context
in which the overall public financial management framework is being strengthened, with donor
support. This plan emphasizes measures to increase domestic revenue mobilization, tighten
prioritization and controls in public spending, and minimize recourse to domestic financing.

                  3.   MALI'S GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION
                              STRATEGY FRAMEWORK

3.1.     The 2007 GPRSF embodies Mali's medium-term vision. The GPRSF lays out strategic
priorities for accelerating growth to and reducing poverty. The GPRSF is designed as the first
phase of the ten-year action plan to achieve the MDGs which targets a reduction of poverty
incidence to 34 percent of the population by 2015. To attain its twin objectives of rapid private
sector-led growth and stronger public sector performance, the GPRSF outlines three strategic
pillars: (1) development of infrastructure and economic sectors, to enhance productivity by
improving the business environment; (2) continuation and consolidation of public sector
structural reforms, to increase public sector efficiency, particularly through pursuing public
financial management reform, decentralization, strengthening the rule of law and fighting
corruption; and (3) strengthening the social sectors to improve the delivery of basic social
services, including improved access for the poor.

3.2.    Based on the household survey of 2006, the poverty rate was estimated at 47.4
percent (ELIM, 2006). Projections included in the 2009 GPRSF Progress Report estimate
poverty at 43.7 percent in 2009. Projections indicate that poverty rates remain higher in rural
areas, at 53.5 percent (from 57.6 percent in 2006), against 23.5 percent in urban areas (from
25.5 percent in 2006). Actual poverty rates are expected in the coming months, based on data
from the 2010 household survey.

3.3.     Despite progress in access to basic social services, Mali's prospects for achieving
several Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are low (table 3.1). The goals related to
combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases could be achieved. HIV/AIDS prevalence is
estimated at 1.3 percent in 2008 and is projected to decline further. Another goal that could be
achieved is universal primary education. Gross enrollment rates in 2009 reached 82 percent and
the girls/boys parity index improved to 80 percent. While progress was made towards many
health related targets set in the GPRSF for 2009, Mali is unlikely to achieve the 2015 goals on
reducing child mortality and improving maternal health. From 2007 to 2009, the rate of
deliveries assisted by qualified staff increased from 57 percent to 61 percent, but lags behind the
level it would need to have achieved to ensure meeting the MDGs. The maternal mortality rate
declined but it is very unlikely that the rate could be reduced by three quarters in 2015 compared
to 1990. Reaching universal access to reproductive health by 2015 is also highly unlikely. The
objective of cutting by half by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe
drinking water is likely to be reached. The ratio of the population with access to drinking water
increased from 70.1 percent in 2007 to 73.1 percent in 2009. The gap between coverage ratios in
urban and rural areas decreased in the same period. However, progress in the area of sanitation
has lagged behind. Progress was made in actions to eliminate gender disparities but results are
far from the MDGs. There are 15 women out of a total of 147 members of parliament, which is a
representation rate of 10.2 percent. Women are also less represented at the level of mayors where
they are only 7 out of 703 mayors, or a representation rate of 1 percent. Town councils have
6.7 percent women, in the Local Authorities High Council women hold 8 percent of the
positions.

3.4.    A number of public policies demonstrate the Government's willingness to assist the
poor and the vulnerable. However, the multiplicity of policies and action plans lacks cross
sectoral consistency and therefore fails to provide a comprehensive framework for social
protection. There is a consensus on the need to develop a cost-effective social protection system,
and introduce innovative social safety nets to mitigate the consequences shocks. The
Government is in the process of reviewing its social protection strategy, including the social
safety net system, and is looking for support to develop instruments to (1) better mitigate


                                                       12
economic risks in the face of price, exchange rate and climatic volatility, and (2) protect the
chronic poor and most vulnerable. In his context and to assist the Government the Bank has
prepared a review of social safety nets (Report No 53222-ML, December 2010). The findings of
the review show that: (1) the scope and coverage of the social safety net is very small (0.5
percent of GDP in 2009) compared to the most urgent needs (about 27 percent of population is
food insecure). The largest safety net programs (other than the general food subsidies of 2008)
are food rations (through food security stock) and nutrition transfer programs; (2) most of the
existing safety nets programs are heavily dependent on external financing, and due to inadequate
funding have limited impact; (3) existing policies fail to provide a comprehensive view of social
protection or ensures trans-sectoral consistency; and (4) weak institutional capacity and lack of
reliable information on beneficiaries and cost of the programs make it difficult to design a
comprehensive social protection strategy (including social safety net system) and to monitor the
results. To improve the efficiency and relevance of safety net programs Government needs to
play a more proactive role in terms of designing, coordinating, implementing, monitoring and
evaluating various safety nets programs. More specifically there is need to:

   ·   strengthen the institutional framework and capacity to design, coordinate, implement,
       monitor and evaluate the social protection strategy, including the social safety net
       systems, through reviewing the responsibilities of various institutions engaged in
       implementing the safety nets programs, as well as identifying the financing sources for
       safety nets programs (Budget, donors, NGOs);

   ·   improve cost-effectiveness of the safety net programs through improving the targeting of
       the programs and investing in monitoring and evaluation. Given the limited fiscal space
       available for safety net programs, the government must allocate its scarce resources to
       programs that are well targeted, cost-efficient and promote demand for health care and
       education, especially for young girls; and

   ·   expand safety nets instruments by introducing cash transfers and labor intensive public
       works as one of the main policy instrument to address the needs of chronic poor both
       during normal period as well as crises.

3.5.    Preliminary results of the 2009 population census highlight the urgency in tackling
demographic issues. The 2009 GPRSF report indicates that the population has increased from
3.5 million in 1960 to 14.5 million in 2009. The annual population growth rate is 3.6 percent
(compared with 2.5 percent, 3.7 percent, and 2.2 percent, in 1976, 1987, and 1998 respectively).
Determinants of the rapid population growth include the very high total fertility rate of 7
children, unmoved for the last two decades, and a mortality rate for children under five declining
steadily from 250/1000 in 1990 to 196/1000 in 2009. The increase in immigration due the
instability in some countries of the sub-region in recent years could have contributed to the
observed trend, particularly between 1998 and 2009. Population in Mali is bound to continue to
increase for a long time, given the age structure. Also, given the cultural background in Mali, the
size of the rural population and the fact that female education is among the lowest in SSA,
population policies will take a long time to have any effect. In addition, the 2006 Population and
Health Survey shows that about 30 percent of the demand for family planning is not met. The
Mali National Population Policy and its third implementation program for 2010-2014 advance



                                                13
reforms to tackle the problem. Demographic trends have also been highlighted as a critical issue
in the context of the preparation of the third PRSP.

3.6.    The Government of Mali launched the preparation of the third generation Poverty
Reduction Strategy, the GPRSF 2012-17, on December 6 and 7, 2010. The new strategy is
scheduled to be completed by June 2011, on time to inform the 2012 budget. The strategy will
cover the period 2012-17 to coincide with the electoral cycle. Thematic groups composed by
government officials at central and sub-national levels, and representatives of the civil society
and of the donor community were organized to prepare the draft strategy, which will be informed
by analytical work, including economic and sector work prepared by the Bank. 11

3.7.   The institutional framework for managing the overall implementation of the
GPRSF is well established. A technical unit within the Ministry of Economy and Finance is
responsible for the coordination of the GPRSF's implementation as well as for its monitoring and
evaluation. Four thematic groups (macroeconomic policies, basic infrastructure development and
productive sectors, institutional development and governance, sustainable human development)
made of representatives from the relevant line ministries as well as civil society meet on an ad
hoc basis to prepare the Progress Report. A Commission bringing together the Malian
Government and the donor community meets regularly to discuss progress made and next steps.
Work is underway to harmonize calendars to better incorporate the GPRSF's evaluation in the
budgetary process. The data collection phase of the new household survey was completed in
August 2010 and a population census was undertaken in April 2009. These two exercises will
provide updated information on various aspects of poverty in Mali.

3.8.     Annual progress reports of the GPRSF are prepared in a consultative process,
which includes government entities at national and sub-national level, NGOs and the donor
community. As with the previous ones, the preparation of the third report of the GPRSF had two
stages. In the first stage (the technical stage), three working groups were organized, focusing on
the following themes: (1) accelerated growth and the population issues; (2) poverty trends and
progress towards the MDGs; and (3) aid effectiveness and financing. Each of these three groups
prepared a report. Participation of the government officials and donor representatives at central
level was high. Civil society representatives were involved in the process, but more need to be
done to ensure a more effective participation in the future. The second stage (political stage)
consists of a review meeting, attended by representatives of the main stakeholders at high level
(ministers, presidents of regional assemblies, heads of donor agencies, etc.). This event validates
the consolidated GPRSF progress report. The report is widely disseminated across the country.
These dissemination efforts in 2011 will also be used to consult the Malian population on
priorities for the GPRSF 2012-17.

  Work has recently begun on Poverty and Gender Notes using a 2010 household survey. The notes will close
knowledge gaps and inform the preparation of the GPRSF (2012- 2017).

A. L INK TO THE C OUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

4.1.    The Bank's CAS discussed by the Board of Directors on February 5, 2008 was
designed to support the implementation of the GPRSF. The CAS covers the period FY08-11
and has two strategic objectives: (1) promote rapid and broad-based growth; and (2) strengthen
public sector performance for service delivery. Within the two CAS pillars, the Bank will focus
on: (a) private sector led growth by addressing key constraints such as productivity, energy,
transport, and finance and by linking the country to the rest of the world; (b) governance; and (c)
capacity development. It foresees the use of three types of instruments: development policy
operations (PRSCs), investment credits, and analytical and advisory activities. The proposed
PRSC-5 is an integral part of the CAS as it is designed to provide financing for the budget in
support of the implementation of policy reforms in key areas targeted by the CAS namely: (1)
enhancing the regulatory and institutional framework for infrastructure and private investment to
improve productivity; (2) strengthening public financial management for improved public sector
efficiency; and (3) improving service delivery to increase access to basic social services.

C. K EY L ESSONS L EARNED

4.3.   PRSCs are an effective instrument to support key GPRSF reforms and improve
policy dialogue in Mali. This said, the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICRR)
for the first PRSC series and experience from the implementation of PRSC-3 and PRSC-4
highlighted important lessons that were taken into account in the formulation of the agenda
supported by PRSC-5. In particular, greater realism and selectivity guided the design of policy
areas targeted for support, to better take into account what can be achieved in one tranche
support instrument in a context of limited capacity and a complex political economy.


                                                             17
4.4.     The PRSC-5 supports 11 policy actions, more than previous operations. While the
PRSC series had targeted an average of 9 prior actions per year, delays in the implementation of
reforms resulted in the increase in the number of policy measures in the last operation of the
series, reflecting an effort to catch up.

4.5.    Understanding the political economy of reforms is critical. Consensus is sought for
major policy decisions in Mali. The process can be lengthy, delaying implementation of critical
reforms. The PRSC series faced such delays regarding two measures, namely the adoption of a
new Investment Code and of a new tariff mechanism for electricity. These were PRSC-4 prior
actions that had to be postponed to PRSC-5. A draft investment code was prepared in the context
of PRSC-4 but more time was needed to build stakeholder consensus and improve the quality of
the code. The investment code submitted to the National Assembly in February 2011was
prepared in a participatory manner. Bank and IMF teams worked closely together to provide
inputs regarding the content of the code. This positive collaboration will continue to ensure
adequate implementation. The new tariff mechanism is politically sensitive and before adopting
it, the Government chose to conduct a number of studies and stakeholder consultations. While
this delayed the process, it could strengthen ownership of the mechanism and facilitate its
implementation.

4.6.    Close supervision and technical assistance are critical to address capacity
constraints and bottlenecks impeding or delaying the implementation of reforms.
Supervision has been intensified by complementing missions and regular meetings with written
quarterly status reports prepared by the authorities. Inadequate programming of technical
assistance by the authorities led to delays which ultimately resulted in the drop of the audit of
producer organizations debt as a prior action for the PRSC-5. This illustrates the criticality of
timely technical assistance for good progress in the implementation of reforms.
4.7.     Experience from the implementation of previous operations favors a streamlined
but strong monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework. Limitations in the availability and
reliability of data to measure outcome indicators are considerable in Mali. The PRSC-5 includes
a results matrix that is selective and contains indicators linked with the measures supported and
that are regularly monitored without imposing additional costs to the Government. Some targets
and indicators were adjusted to reflect revisions by the sectors, and difficulties in compiling
reliable information.

D. C OLLABORATION WITH THE I NTERNATIONAL M ONETARY F UND (IMF) AND O THER DONORS

4.8.     The Bank and IMF staffs coordinate activities closely. The two teams agree that
Mali's main macroeconomic challenges are to (1) create fiscal space to respond to the shocks to
which the country is vulnerable and (2) to raise the growth rate to reduce poverty more rapidly.
Over the medium term, meeting these challenges would require collaboration in a number of key
areas: (1) reform of the parastatal sector, notably in the cotton and banking sectors; (2)
strengthening public financial management (PFM) and well-executed decentralization; (3)
improving the business environment and international competitiveness; (4) orienting economic
management to strengthen the leading sources of economic growth; and (5) strengthening
statistical systems. In addition, it will be important to support development efforts and reforms at
the regional level, including through regional institutions (especially with regard to the financial


                                                18
sector) and infrastructure development (and its financing). The Fund will continue to support
Mali through the ECF, focusing on maintaining a macroeconomic environment favorable to
growth. Over the next year, program-related structural reforms will be focused on PFM issues,
and the housing bank. The Bank will support Mali through budget support operations,
investment operations and analytical and advisory work focusing on PFM, restructuring the
cotton sector, energy and energy pricing, agriculture productivity, private sector development,
and improved basic social service delivery. The teams prepared jointly a new DSA and
coordinated advice on the GPRSF Progress Report.

4.9.    In line with the Paris Declaration, development partners are supporting Mali in
implementing the GPRSF, by coordinating financial and technical support. A Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) was signed in March 2006 and renewed on July 1, 2010 by the
Government and a group of donors, including the Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB),
European Commission (EC), Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada to provide
a framework for a multi-donor approach to budget support. This Budget Support Group initiated
annual joint-donor missions in 2007. The last joint donor mission took place in October 2010 and
resulted in the preparation of a joint policy matrix, on which to base the programs supported by
the participating institutions. Under the Bank, EC and AfDB Tripartite Partnership, Mali is a
pilot for joint budget support. Budget support, including the PRSCs, is gradually helping reduce
Government's transaction costs. However, expected improvements in the predictability of aid
have yet to materialize, in part due to delays in the implementation of agreed reforms that
underpin disbursements. Development partners are organized in thematic groups, each of which
maintains close dialogue with the Government in specific areas. The support to the public
expenditure reform agenda is coordinated in line with the Government's PAGAM. The
Government has convened meetings periodically with the main donors to inform them of
progress on implementation. Key reforms in public financial management are being supported by
financing from IDA together with technical assistance from Canada, the EC and the French
Cooperation. Donor coordination around decentralization reforms has also improved with a
thematic group on decentralization chaired by the EC being in place. The working group focuses
on the institutional framework of the decentralization process in Mali.

4.10. The Ministry in charge of Basic Education has continued to lead the dialogue with
donors in the education sector. The Education For All (EFA)-Fast Track Initiative (FTI)
process has strengthened the Ministry further in this role and has given a focus to the Donor
Group, which includes 14 development partners. Regular donor meetings are organized and
through this, a deeper sharing of information on appraisal missions, technical assistance and
studies. The education sector benefits from sectoral budget support since 2006.

4.11. The health sector has adopted a sector wide approach. The sector development
strategy was the first building block of a Sector Wide Approach Project (SWAP) in the health
sector and has constituted the focus of donor coordination and harmonization. In addition,
support for HIV/AIDS is already structured around a sector wide approach with all donors'
programs aligned with the Government strategy. Steps are also ongoing to adopt a sector wide
approach in rural development.

4.12. Capacity constraints hamper Mali's ability to achieve its development objectives.
This justifies the emphasis given by the donor community to strengthening capacity through a


                                              19
range of technical assistance grants and training initiatives designed to enhance the
implementation of the GPRSF. The key donors involved include the Bank, IMF, EC, United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), the French Co-operation Agency (AFD), AfDB, the
Swedish Development Agency (ASDI) and the Unites States Agency for International
Development (USAID). Donor coordination to support capacity building efforts is also being
enhanced through the different thematic groups.

E. C OMPLEMENTARITY WITH O THER BANK ACTIVITIES

4.13. Bank support for the agricultural sector under the Agricultural Services and
Producer's Organizations Program (PASAOP), the Fostering Agriculture Productivity
Project (PAPAM) and the PRSC series are complementary. These projects focus on
increasing production and productivity of key selected production systems based on sustainable
land and water management practices in selected priority areas. The operation includes the
following axes: (1) investing in productive infrastructures and equipment; (2) enhancing service
provision to producers (research, training, advisory services, financing, input supply, etc.); and
(3) enabling the policy and institutional environment for productivity increase, while ensuring a
stronger sector monitoring for better policy decision making. Regarding cotton, these projects
include: (1) provision of technical assistance to the unit in charge of the restructuring program in
the cotton sector, the Mission de Restructuration du Secteur Coton (MRSC); (2) facilitation of
access by producer organizations to agricultural support services; (3) strengthening of capacity of
producer organizations and cotton related unions; and (4) supporting strategic and demand-
driven research and disseminate research results on new varieties, diversification, mechanization
or innovative practices, including environment-friendly agricultural practices.

4.14. Measures to stimulate private sector development supported by the Growth Support
Project and the PRSC agenda well aligned. The Growth Support Project, restructured in mid
2009, streamlined its mining component to focus on four key activities: (1) carrying out studies
on the diversification of non-gold mining; (2) provision of technical assistance in the area of
mining research; (3) developing small and medium-scale mining activities; and (4) supporting
the improvement in the transparency of financial flows in the sector, in line with EITI. The
PRSC-5 complements the Growth Support project by supporting the completion of all validation
steps and submission of the validation request to the EITI International Secretariat.

4.15. The Bank's Energy Support Project, approved by the Board in mid-2009, and the
PRSC series are mutually reinforcing. The Energy Support Project aims to help the
Government improve the availability, reliability, and efficiency of electricity services to support
shared-growth and competitiveness of the economy. The PRSC-5 reinforces these activities by
supporting the restructuring program of EDM SA, notably through the adoption of the new tariff
and subsidy policy for electricity.

4.16. A technical assistance (TA) project on Governance and Budget Decentralization,
planned for Board presentation in FY11 would accompany the PRSC series. The TA project
would enhance capacity and support the implementation of the reforms proposed by the PRSCs,
notably in the area of public financial management including at decentralized level. Technical
assistance is also being provided through trust funds focusing on strengthening poverty related
data collection and analysis as well as GPRSF participatory processes.

F. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

4.17. To inform policies aimed at accelerating growth, the proposed PRSC-5 draws from
Bank, Government and other partners' economic and sector work. The Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM) prepared by the Bank in 2007 (Report No. 36571-ML) highlighted the
critical importance of reforms in the agriculture sector, notably cotton and ON, in overcoming
vulnerability to climate shocks and enhancing food security and growth in Mali. The CEM also
highlighted the key role of measures to improve infrastructure and the business environment that
informed the choice of policy measures supported by the PRSC series. The CEM findings are
complemented by a number of reports, notably on cotton (Comparative Analysis of Organization
and Performance of African Cotton Sectors: Learning from Experience of Cotton Sector Reform
in Africa, draft, 2007, and Strategies for Cotton in West and Central Africa, 2007), and on
energy (Études Tarifaires des Services de l'Electricité et de l'Eau Potable, 2008). Studies by IMF
staff on cotton, mining and private sector development (IMF Country Report No. 08/286) also
provided relevant insights into the choice of policies supported by the PRSC series. Policy notes
focusing on growth will be completed during FY11 geared to enhance the understanding of
economic challenges and to strengthen evidence-based policy dialogue.

4.18. Government policy actions supported by the PRSC-5 are underpinned by
considerable analytical and fiduciary work undertaken by the Bank, the Government and
other partners. The Mali Country Systems Review for Project Financial Management, prepared
by the Bank in 2009 assesses PFM systems in Mali, with a view to improve their readiness for
the use of country systems by the Bank and other donors. Other recent Bank studies identifying
weaknesses and strengths of the PFM framework in Mali include the 2009 Public Expenditure
Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR), the 2004 CPAR update, and
various project specific assessments of FM and procurement. Government actions supported by
the PRSC-5 were also informed by the 2010 PAGAM II, which benefited from the Government
commissioned independent assessment of the PAGAM-GFP, and the EC 2009 Audit of Reform
Implementation to Improve Public Finance Management Procedures. Key issues regarding
transparent budgeting and public access to budget information highlighted by the International
Budget Partnership (IBP) 2010 Open Budget Survey (OBS), which in 2010 included Mali for
the first time, were also used in the preparation of the PRSC-5.

4.19. Finally, MDG reports and sector specific studies on education, health, social
development, and water supply underpin the reform agenda in those areas. MDG reports
have highlighted the challenges facing Mali in its efforts to move towards the targets defined for
2015. The Bank's 2006 Education Status Report and its update, the 2009 Action Plan to
Strengthen Capacity in the Education System in a Context of Decentralization and
Deconcentration, the 2009 Report on Basic Education Teachers in Mali: Training, Management,
Deployment, highlight key management issues in the sector, including inadequate recruitment,
deployment, training and remuneration of teachers. Insufficient definition of attributions at
different administrative levels and insufficient transfer of resources to decentralized entities are
also flagged as bottlenecks that need to be addressed. Government policies to advance PFM
reform for enhanced PFM at decentralized level supported by the PRSC-5 are drawn from the
Institutional Development Program, which targets measures to advance the decentralization
agenda as a means to strengthen delivery of basic social services.

                               5.    THE PROPOSED PRSC-5

A. O PERATION DESCRIPTION

5.1.   The proposed operation is the last of a programmatic series of three annual PRSCs
(PRSCs 3, 4 and 5). The overall objective of this second series of PRSCs is to support
implementation of Mali's GPRSF adopted in 2006. Specifically, the development objectives to
which the PRSC-5 contributes are to:
 (1)   improve the policy environment for infrastructure and private investment, with a
       particular emphasis on actions to ensure a well-managed transition to private ownership
       in the cotton sector, enhance governance in the office du Niger, improve the ease of
       doing business, enhance the financial sustainability of the electricity utility, and to
       strengthen transparency and accountability practices in the mining sector;
 (2)   strengthen public financial management, through a strengthened legal framework for
       procurement, increased transparency and strengthened external oversight;
 (3)   strengthen PFM in the sectors in charge of basic education and health in the Malian
       context of decentralization; and
 (4)   increase the utilization of health services by the poor.

B. R ESULTS F RAMEWORK

5.2.    The framework for monitoring and evaluation for the PRSC-5 is in line with the
institutionalized framework used for the monitoring and evaluation of the government's
program. Government development objectives to which this operation contributes specifically
and the associated outcome indicators that will be used to assess progress are summarized in
Annex 3. Alignment will be sought with monitoring and evaluation exercises for the GPRSF,
PAGAM II, and the preparation of the budget. The following changes were introduced to the
results framework: (1) cotton production forecasts were revised downwards, to reflect
adjustments made by the agriculture sector; (2) the indicator on cost of licenses to export was
dropped because of compilation difficulties; (3) the target on open competitive procedures was
revised downwards, reflecting updates made in the PAGAM II; (4) targets on budgetary
transfers for the co-participation in the pay of community teachers and for decentralized entities
in the health sector were revised downwards taking into account recent trends which result from
delays in reform implementation; (5) targets on midwives recruitments were introduced in the
matrix (this information was not previously available); and (6) the target for beneficiaries of
mutual health insurance schemes was revised downwards by the sector due to delays in the
adoption and implementation of the strategy to expand mutual health insurance schemes.

C. P OLICY AREAS

5.3.    Prior actions for PRSC-5 were selected from the Government planned reforms.
Basic criteria for the selection included: (1) criticality for the success of the Government's
reform program in the areas covered by the PRSC series; (2) expressed commitment; and (3)
feasibility.




                                                22
Improving the Policy Environment for Infrastructure and Private Investment

5.4.    Stimulating sustained agricultural productivity and diversification is critical for
growth and poverty reduction in Mali. Agriculture remains the mainstay of most Malians and
its performance determines output and inflation developments in the country. However,
productivity in the sector remains low, and with the exception of rice and some horticulture
crops, growth reflects mostly increased extensions of land used. In addition, agriculture is highly
vulnerable to recurrent droughts, floods, locust infestation, diseases and variations in world
prices notably for cotton.

5.5.    Years of subdued output prices and poor management have significantly affected
the profitability of CMDT and farmers' livelihoods, while putting pressure on government
finances. CMDT's financial situation led to the accumulation of debt to its suppliers, estimated
at CFAF 10 billion by end 2009. Farmers and producer organizations (OPs) are also burdened by
both internal (amongst their members) and external (to other parties) debt. The OPs' debt
accumulation results from a combination of factors, including poor performance of some
farmers, late payments and inadequate access to inputs due to CMDT management problems,
and shocks related to weather and prices. Mali cotton OPs take on input credit based on
solidarity principles. As a result, debt to banks and other suppliers is paid by surplus producers
who also bear the burden of deficit producers. This discourages the most efficient farmers from
remaining in the sector.

5.6.    The Government is implementing a transition plan and actions to re-launch cotton
production. The Government estimates cotton output in 2010/11 at around 260,000 tons, a
downward revision compared to previous projections that reflect the impact of excessive rains in
some areas. This is likely to be achieved due to a combination of factors: (1) timely payment of
producers; (2) increase in international cotton prices which will be reflected in domestic
producer prices through the application of the pricing mechanism; (3) provision of subsidies to
seeds and other inputs; (4) progress towards the adoption of a framework to resolve OPs debt
overhang; and (5) increased serenity and commitment from remaining staff of CMDT given that
uncertainties regarding privatization diminished. Steps are also being taken to render the Cotton
Inter-professional Association (IPC) and the Service Provider for Cotton Grading (OCC) fully
operational.

5.7.     The Government remains committed to privatize CMDT. Some, but not all of the
four lots to be privatized are now expected to be finalized by mid 2011. Seven (7) companies
manifested their interest in bidding for the 4 CMDT subsidiaries, of which 6 were shortlisted
using criteria specified in the bidding documents. Three short-listed companies did not submit
bids, apparently for a mix of both Mali-specific (perceived risks of the sector reform framework)
and non-Mali factors (internal company issues). The Malian authorities clarified that national
procurement regulations permit proceeding with evaluation of financial offers on the three lots
for which bids were submitted, and financial bids were opened on February 17 and evaluation of
the financial offers has been completed. In conformity with clearly specified bid documentation,
the evaluation committee was obliged to disqualify two of companies' financial bids for
submission of improper bank guarantees, which needed to provided by a Malian-domiciled bank
and be for a minimum 5 percent of the bid value. This leaves only one firm having submitted
offers that make it eligible for a maximum of two of the lots. Despite this setback that is beyond


                                                23
the control of Government, the internal government momentum to conclude this phase of the
process appears strong, and indications are that the authorities intend to move on to negotiating
concession details with the remaining company, so as to ensure that the 2011/12 cotton season
could be undertaken by this new operator in the ceded zones. Decisions will need to be taken
regarding the remaining lots for which concession agreements cannot be concluded as part of the
current phase, but indications from Government are that these lots may be resubmitted to a call
for bids once negotiations for the current phase are completed. When privatization is completed,
the market could have up to 3 companies with monopsony power in the regions in which they
intervene. The vertically integrated structure should result in cost efficiencies and economies of
scale, which would contribute to the sector's competitiveness and profitability. In practice
however, this structure may also function as an inefficient monopsony, with high overheads, a
lack of cost monitoring and control, misprocurement, and mismanaged investments, particularly
if the framework for cost repartition with producers is inadequate. Therefore, new regulatory
capacity is needed, in modalities comparable to a classic regulator of a public service
monopsony. 12

5.8.     In addition to privatization, the Government is working on other medium-term
measures to restore the cotton sector's viability and improve its overall competitiveness. To
increase the profitability of the cotton sector, the Government will continue the ongoing capacity
strengthening in biosafety regulation and various research to ensure the sustainable introduction
of GM cotton. Medium term plans of the Government include: (1) the creation of a cotton
observatory and a disaster fund; (2) the establishment of financing mechanisms for research
activities on cotton; and (3) adoption of measures to increase technology transfer and service
provision to cotton producers to increase yields. A study to inform the framework for future
subsidies in the agriculture sector is also being considered.

5.9.    Mali could increase agricultural productivity and reduce vulnerability to weather
related shocks by exploiting its irrigation potential. 13 Much progress has been achieved as a
result of the institutional reforms and investments made regarding the irrigable lands on the left
bank of the Niger River, notably the increase in rice production. Despite considerable delay, a
contract plan for the Niger River Irrigation Office (Office du Niger­ON) was adopted in early
2009. 14 This contract plan is a multi-year action plan which details the agreed activities to be
undertaken by ON, GoM and OPs to develop irrigation, maintain existing infrastructure, improve
land and water management, increase productivity and improve agricultural practices, while
ensuring a sustainable management of natural resources.

5.10. Private interest in investing in the ON area increased in recent years. Large
investors (also contributing for the development of irrigation infrastructure) have begun
operating, notably from Libya, China and South Africa. To enhance the profile of the ON, the
institution is now under the control of a State Secretariat and responds to the Prime Minister's
Office. Investments in the ON region cover agriculture, livestock and agro-industrial activities.
12
   The Government adopted in 2010 a draft policy paper on the role of the state in the cotton sector, after the
privatization of CMDT, with IMF support.
13
   Both the Niger and Senegal Rivers run through Mali. The Niger River runs through nine countries - Guinea, Cote
d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Benin, Cameroon, and Chad. Approximately 100 million people are
dependent in some way on the river for their livelihood.
14
   The Contract Plan is a performance contract between the state, producers and ON.


                                                       24
5.11. The Government plans to strengthen governance in the management of irrigation.
This will be achieved by developing a shared vision among key stakeholders (GoM, ON,
producers, private investors and donors) of irrigation development in the areas managed by the
ON. Irrigation expansion will no longer rely solely on public financing. It would tap not only
into private funding from domestic and foreign investors but also from OPs with access to
financing from micro-finance institutions or commercial banks. It is recognized that this new
investment model is required to accelerate infrastructure development and to modernize ON
management and governance. In 2009, indicative planning and mapping of potential public and
private investments has been published by ON to provide a more transparent vision of the on-
going irrigation expansion. The framework for participation would also need to be reinforced. To
take stock of the implementation of the Contract Plan and increase participation in the
management of ON activities, the Government planned a mid-term review for 2010, with the
contribution of key stakeholders, to review past and future ON activities and investments and to
propose adjustments to better align it with key objectives.

5.12. The competitiveness of Malian firms is constrained by poor quality and costly
infrastructure, notably transport. As a landlocked country, Mali's imports and exports are
heavily dependent upon neighboring countries' overland routes and seaports. Reducing
vulnerability and increasing the future competitiveness of Mali's economy will depend in large
part on improving the operational efficiency of its transport system. However, the sector faces
critical issues including: (1) insufficient resource allocation to road network maintenance; (2)
axle load control; (3) continued problems with transit facilitation; and (iv) the possibility that
Transrail may soon go to "Reglement preventif" (the equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy).
Bank's support is being channeled through regional projects and policy dialogue in collaboration
with other donors.

5.13. As the 2007 Mali Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) argues, competitiveness
of Malian firms is also hampered by high costs of, and weak access to electricity. Several
reform and investment programs have addressed the issues facing the energy sector in Mali but
implementation did not proceed smoothly. At the end of 2000, expectations were that quality and
reliability of water and electricity services would be improved with the concessioning of public
water and electricity to a private operator. These expectations were not met and the concession
contracts collapsed in October 2005. EDM SA emerged from this privatization experience with
an investment deficit, significant internal inefficiencies and inadequate tariff levels.

5.14. With the operationalization of Manantali in 2003, Mali has expanded electricity
supply rapidly. 15 However, since 2006, Mali has been using the integrality of its generation
quota from Manantali. In order to respond to the growing demand, EDM-SA has had to rely on
thermal generation. In the absence of tariff adjustments to reflect the shift in the generation mix
and higher oil prices EDM-SA has experienced financial losses year after year (Table 5.1).
EDM-SA financial performance improved in 2009 due to a combination of lower oil prices and
an average tariff increase of 4% - the only adjustment of recent years. EDM-SA losses are
expected to reach an unprecedented level in 2010. Prospects for 2011 are not much better given
recent trends in oil prices. The level of EDM-SA short term financial debt (mostly with local
banks) has also increased and the company has also accumulated arrears with suppliers.

15
     Manantali generates hydro-power.

5.15. The Government adopted an energy sector policy in 2009. The policy has four axes:
(1) a new institutional framework for the public provision of water and electricity services; (2) a
new tariff framework to ensure the economic and financial viability of the sector; (3) measures to
strengthen the production capacity and to reinforce transport and distribution networks; and (4)
measures to facilitate the participation of independent power producers. On July 16, 2009, the
Board of EDM SA approved a restructuring plan for the company, which has six main lines of
action: (1) reducing operational costs; (2) improving commercial performance; (3) adjusting
tariffs to reflect costs; (4) enhancing the company's cash flow position; (5) improving corporate
governance and strengthening EDM SA's technical and managerial capacity; and (6) financing
and implementing EDM SA's investment program.

5.16. Informed by the preliminary results of an institutional restructuring study, the
Government decided in September 2009 to formalize the separation of the water and
electricity operations. A decision was also taken to create an asset holding company and an
operating company in 2010, specifically for the management of water operations. Similar
companies (asset holding and operating companies) are planned to be created for electricity
operations from 2011. The Government has also decided to maintain a single commercialization
company for billing and client arrears recovery. Final results of the institutional restructuring
study will provide details on the linkages between the above mentioned companies.

5.17. The Government adopted in March 2009 a strategic vision on tariffs and subsidies.
The reform of the tariff and subsidy framework aims to align tariffs with production costs,
notably costs associated with oil imports, while protecting lower income consumers. To
operationalize the vision, work towards the preparation of a revised tariff mechanism began in
2010. This includes: (1) adoption, in consultation with key stakeholders, of an interim electricity
tariff mechanism which defines key principles and the methodology for tariff adjustments; (2)
simulations, using an economic and financial model, to calibrate the tariff formula; (3) adoption
and implementation of the new tariff mechanism. The adoption and implementation of the mew
tariff mechanism is scheduled for the second half of 2011.

5.18. There is a new mining law at an advanced stage of preparation that aims to address
several issues faced by the mining industry of Mali. The 1991 Mining Code successfully
contributed to attracting investment to the gold mining sector during the 1990s, while taxation
under the Mining Code of 1999, focused on profits, in line with common practice as evidenced
elsewhere in Africa (Ghana, Tanzania, etc.). However, as it was noted in the 2007 CEM, the
IMF Country Report 08/286, and more recently, in Bank's mission reports and activities, there is
scope for improvement, notably regarding: (1) local content; (2) the redistribution mechanism of
mining revenues between central and local governments; (3) revenue collection mechanism as
well as procedures for recording, reconciling, and disclosing revenue streams paid by companies
to the government; (4) local value added and creating incentives for nationals to be involved in


                                                26
jewelry making in collaboration with for small-scale miners; and (5) clarification of the
corporate role when dealing with the need to comply with international environmental and social
standards at all stages of a mining operation. The latter includes the assurance that sufficient
resources are kept aside throughout the life of the project to maintain infrastructure, for clean-up
operations and rehabilitation of closed mining sites for alternative uses.

5.19. The Government plans to boost actions aimed at improving governance in the
mining sector. Mali became a candidate country for Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI) in 2008 and was granted 2 years to implement the activities outlined in its Work
Plan. Mali's adherence to the EITI standards was expected to result in the country reaching
validation in the course of the year 2010. However, lack of timely donor's support delayed the
process. Taking this into account and in recognition of good progress made, the EITI
international secretariat extended the validation deadline. Several actions have been undertaken
to date that attest to the Government's desire to improve transparency and governance in the
mining sector including (1) completion and publication of the first EITI report covering revenues
generated from gold activities in 2006; (2) the dissemination of information on revenues
generated by the gold sector to civil society through the media, local newspapers, international
and national websites, organization of road shows and workshops; and (3) the promotion of
productive dialogue amongst multi-stakeholders (private sector, civil society and public sector)
on issues pertaining to sustainable mining development in the country, whether directly through
EITI meetings and/or national EI forum. To reach Compliance Status, the EITI Board has
requested that Mali prepares a second EITI report, covering the years 2007-08. Like many other
countries, the EITI Board is also expecting that Mali submits additional evidence on its public
accounting system in order to fulfill Indicator 13 (out of 20 validation indicators). Substantial
effort is being devoted by Mali in this direction and the country's candidacy for compliant status
should be cleared within the next six months. For the medium term, the Government plans to
continue implementing EITI post-validation status and is considering publishing audited reports
on mining taxation issues yearly as well as improving the institutional framework for recording
gold tax revenues, notably through a separate program that is also being financed by the Bank.

5.20. Notwithstanding progress made in recent years, private enterprises continue to face
severe constraints to open and expand. Research generally indicates that countries with
burdensome regulation have larger informal sectors, higher unemployment rates and slower
economic growth. Mali ranked 153 out of 183 countries in the 2011 Doing Business Report, an
improvement of two positions compared to the previous year. However, challenges remain,
notably regarding the regulatory and institutional framework which could be rendered more
attractive to private investors.

5.21. The 2005 Investment Code offered generous incentives to encourage non-gold
investment but it was in need of improvement. The selection of the projects which would
benefit from fiscal and custom incentives is based on complex economic criteria and is,
therefore, fraught with uncertainty and lack of transparency. The processing delays vary
considerably, creating a negative perception of the investment climate in Mali. These difficulties
are aggravated by the existence of special conventions granting particular fiscal and custom duty
concessions to individual enterprises. The five-year tax holiday provided under the Investment
Code also favors short-term over long-term investments.



                                                27
5.22. The Government adopted an action plan to improve the business environment
which includes the revision of the investment code. The investment code, prepared in
consultation with key stakeholders removes various problematic incentives and will be
accompanied by the publication of the incentives granted to investors. Moreover, the
Government intends to transfer all tax and customs incentives to the tax and customs codes
scheduled for adoption in the medium term. While introducing major improvements, the revised
code does not fully implement IMF TA guidance. 16 Bank and IMF teams will work together to
assist the authorities in the steps that will be needed to address this issue.

Public Financial Management (PFM) Reform

5.23. Preliminary results of the 2010 PEFA Update suggest that PFM systems in Mali
improved but challenges remain. The assessment indicates overall improvements compared to
the results of the 2006 PEFA in following critical dimensions of performance of the Malian PFM
system: (1) credibility of the budget; (2) comprehensiveness and transparency; (3) policy-based
budgeting; and (4) predictability and control in budget execution. 17 No change was noted
regarding accounting, recording and reporting. Indeed, the 2100 Open Budget Index (OBI) rated
Mali 61st out of 94 countries on public availability of budget information. Budget documents can
be consulted at no charge in the national public library. Access to copies is however constrained
by the cost of copying. 18With PRSC4 support, the Government commenced issuing quarterly
budget execution reports in 2010, published in the MEF website. Another critical dimension
which saw no progress is external scrutiny and audit. While the overall rating of the dimension
regarding predictability and control in budget execution improved, some key sub-dimensions
saw no progress at all, as is the case of competition, value for money and controls in
procurement.

5.24. Policy measures were taken to improve the procurement function in Mali but more
needs to be done. 19 The adoption in 2008 of new procurement codes improved the legal
framework for procurement. With PRSC-3 support, the Government established regional
procurement control directorates and the Procurement Regulatory Agency (ARMDS). A recent
review of procurement systems undertaken by Bank staff identified changes that need to be made
to the 2008 procurement codes to fully align them with WAEMU guidelines. In particular,
changes are needed to ensure an adequate assignment of attributions between the General
Directorate of Public Procurement (DGMP) and the ARMDS. The responsibility for the
definition of procurement policy, and training strategy and programs should be assigned to the
ARMDS. The review also noted that planning and programming of public procurement is mostly
limited to procurement related to externally-financed projects. In addition, enforcement of
procurement regulations is weak. For instance, these regulations are not fully applied by
statutory bodies. Other remaining issues include the absence of an official journal for public

16
   The new code includes a VAT exemption on domestically produced capital goods for a period of up to 5 years.
While this covers a limited number of goods, it is a change in the wrong direction. The authorities made this choice
to mobilize stakeholder consensus while minimizing the impact on the tax base and on tax administration.
17
   PRSC-3 supported the expansion of the number of ministries with MTEFs. The Bank also provided TA for the
harmonization of methodologies used by sector ministries in the compilation of MTEFs.
18
   The cost of photocopying the budget law is estimated at US$100 (over 8 percent of the 2010 GDP per capita).
19
   Other assessments consulted include the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) of 1998 and the 2004
update.


                                                         28
procurement, inadequate IT systems, weak control measures to ascertain the validity of bids and
conformity of the executed procurement, and lack of comprehensive benchmarks of the
country's public procurement system against international good practices.

5.25. External oversight remains weak. With PRSC-4 support, in 2010 the Government
submitted to the National Assembly of a draft law revising the Organic Law 96-071 to eliminate
limits to the number of judges in the Audit Section of the Supreme Court that can be recruited.
The timeliness of the submission to the National Assembly of the Budget Review Acts has
improved slightly, but opinions on them (Declaration Generale de Conformité) to be issued by
the Audit Section of the Supreme Court (SCCS) continue to be delayed. External audits are the
joint responsibility of the SCCS and the Auditor General Office (Bureau du Vérificateur Général,
BGV). The main state accounts have not been audited since 1960 and the SCCS covers a limited
number of audits each year. In 2009, the SCCS focused on audits requested by United Nations
agencies and political parties. Oversight activities of the BGV in 2009 included 19 financial
audits, 10 performance audits, and 10 missions to monitor the implementation of previous
recommendations. While limited in scope, audits have uncovered cases of fraud and corruption,
widely reported by the local media. 20 Follow up, however, is uneven. In addition, the National
Assembly's exercise of its prerogative to check on the executive is weak. Coordinated policy
dialogue between the Donor Budget Support Group has recently focused on anti-corruption and
governance issues.

5.26. The PAGAM II continues and deepens the PFM reform agenda introduced by
PAGAM-GFP. Priorities include: (1) finalize the computerized interconnections of all elements
of the chain of public expenditure, and implement the new expenditure management software
PRED5; (2) prepare and disseminate public buyer guidelines; (3) submit to the National
Assembly a draft law on PPPs procurement in line with WAEMU directives; (4) submit to the
National Assembly draft laws revising the laws that created DGMP-DSP and the ARMDS to
align them with the WAEMU Directive n°005/2005/CM/UEMOA; (5) strengthen capacity to
implement the new institutional and regulatory framework and the use of the new Procurement
Code by training staff from DGMP, ministries and the private sector, and installing a database
with integrated procurement management system in DGMP and in ministries; (6) submit to the
National Assembly the draft 2008 Budget Review Act (Loi de Règlement 2008), including the
opinion issued by the SCCS; (7) develop an action plan to clear the backlogs of the audit of the
Accounts; and (8) adopt a road map for the creation of an Autonomous Audit Court in line with
WAEMU guidelines. The PAGAM also targets capacity building notably in the areas of
procurement, and internal and external controls The Government mobilized support for these
efforts from a number of donors, including the Bank through the Mali Governance and Budget
Decentralization Technical Assistance Project, scheduled for Board consideration on April 28,
2011.

Improving Basic Social Service Delivery

5.27. Expanding access to and quality of basic education and health services are key
priorities of the government. Long term strategies for education and health were prepared in

20
 A serious fraud and corruption case is being investigated regarding a donor-financed project in the Ministry of
Health.


                                                        29
the late 1990s and early 2000s and were later integrated in the poverty reduction strategies of
2002 and 2006. Three investment programs were prepared for education, PISE I, PISE II and
PISE III. Similarly, medium term investment programs were formulated for health, called Social
Development Programs (PRODESS), the first for the period 1998-2002 and the second, initially
covering the five year period since 2003, was extended while the preparation of the third medium
term investment program takes place.

5.28. In the Malian context of decentralization, the implementation of education and
health programs is the responsibility of sub-national administrations. However, the transfer
of resources has lagged behind, in part due to capacity constraints. Political economy analysis
undertaken in the context of the preparation of the Mali Governance and Budget Decentralization
Technical Assistance Project identified considerable resistance to change from officials at central
and regional level who stand to lose power when the capacity of local authorities is increased.
Nevertheless, an instruction by the Prime Minister's Office indicates that from 2010, budget
lines in education and health should be gradually allocated to decentralized entities, for current
and investment expenditure. To strengthen coordination between the national and sub-national
administrations, a contractual framework has been adopted and is being piloted in the education
sector. Capacity building efforts are also being intensified. In the health sector, actions include
training elected officials for the correct implementation of the operational guidelines of Decree
02-314, on the transfer of financial resources to the municipalities (Collectivités Territoriales,
CT), and on monitoring and oversight mechanisms at regional level.

5.29. Utilization of public health care services is low and has not improved in the last
fifteen years. The number of new patients using health service units is small and hospital bed
occupancy is also low. The causes of this under-utilization of health services are related to the
perceived poor quality of services provided, the high cost of services and long distances.
Increased quality is a must for the situation to be overturned, which in turn could be helped by
the adoption of a contractual system through which providers meeting defined quality criteria are
certified. 21 The expansion of risk sharing schemes such as the mutuelles (community based
health insurance) would also help expand access, by reducing the out of pocket expenses.

5.30. The Government is committed to protecting access to quality social services,
including through increased involvement of local authorities. Actions planned by the
Government include: (1) promote Government-Local Authorities, Government-
NGO/Associations, and Government-Private Sector contracts for the implementation of health
sector policies, programs or strategies; (2) operationalize consultation organs in accordance with
the provisions of Decree No. 08-095/PRM of 21 February 2008 as regards education; (3) adopt a
framework for the preparation of regional and local education programs and definition and
implementation of contracts State-Municipalities in at least 230 school districts including on
teacher management; (4) build the institutional capacities of the Ministry of Health and all health
structures; (5) expand social security coverage and improvement of access by the most destitute
to basic social services and micro-finance; and (6) Ministry of Health trains local elected
officials and technical staff on the application of decree 02-314 in at least 3 health districts.



21
     Human resource management issues are critical and were addressed in the previous operations of the series.

D. P RIOR ACTIONS FOR THE P ROPOSED PRSC-5

5.31. The proposed PRSC-5 would support selected reform measures in the
Government's program described in section 5C that are deemed essential for its successful
implementation. The rationale for their selection has been discussed above, namely their
importance to the program and expressed government commitment and feasibility. Compliance
with these prior actions forms the basis for IDA to proceed with the proposed operation.

5.32. All prior actions for PRSC-5, formulated in collaboration with the Government,
have been met. As detailed in Table 5.2, the PRSC-4 PD outlined 10 triggers for PRSC-5. Out
of these, one was replaced due to delays in implementation (OP's debt), one (electricity tariffs)
was reformulated to reflect the actual progress achieved in the reform and to increase precision,
and another (the investment code) was reformulated to better reflect the content of the reform
undertaken. Reformulations were made to 6 measures to increase precision and/or scope. 22
Finally, a new measure was introduced (ON) given the criticality of the reform.

Improving the Policy Environment for Infrastructure and Private Investment

5.33. The PRSC-5 supports the following policy actions to improve the policy
environment for infrastructure and private investment: (1) Government satisfactorily
completes a report on the evaluation of the financial proposals for the purchase of shares of the
subsidiaries of the cotton ginnery CMDT; (2) submission to the National Assembly of the draft
law establishing the regulatory structure for the cotton sector; (3) strengthen the governance of
Office du Niger based on a shared vision of irrigation development at Office du Niger among
stakeholders (government, Office du Niger, producers, private investors and donors) and a
participatory management of the Office du Niger irrigation scheme; (4) Government adopts a
satisfactory interim electricity tariff mechanism; (5) complete all validation steps and submit
validation request to the EITI International Secretariat; (6) submit to the National Assembly an
Investment Code.

5.34. Privatization could help improve efficiency and put the cotton sector on a sound
financial footing. A strengthened, eventually privatized ginning sector should foster a
framework in which pricing signals help farmers make a rational choice between continued
cotton production and crop diversification. This will be critical to strengthen the performance of
Mali rain-fed agriculture and improve rural incomes. Experience elsewhere in the region has
been mixed, with some cases of success and some of failure. This mixed experience underlines
the importance of good design and execution in the privatization.

5.35. The establishment of a new regulatory structure, once the privatization process is
completed and results in the dissolution of the MRSC and CMDT regulatory roles, is
expected to foster efficiency in the operation of ginneries. The privatization of the four
CMDT subsidiaries ­ now likely to occur in two phases within the coming year - would change
significantly the structure of the sector, which requires other regulating tools than those currently
in place and exercised by MRSC and CMDT. Having up to four regional companies operating in
parallel will allow comparing the efficiency of ginnery operations, rendering it possible to
institute formal benchmarking for company performance. Until experience is accumulated, the
new regulatory entity could use information on the performance of other ginners in the region, to
establish the performance frontier. The regulatory entity would also introduce measures to
enhance governance (including through information sharing), solve any disputes or ambiguities
that may arise in, and protect producer and consumer interest. Results of the reform supported in
the cotton sector would be measured by seed cotton production.

5.36. The adoption of strengthened governance practices is critical to ensure a well
managed irrigation investment program. The participatory mid-term review undertaken in
2010 provided a forum for the GoM, private investors, OPs, and donors to build up a shared
vision of the development of Mali's irrigation resources. Moreover, the review assessed the
status of implementation of the Contract-Plan and made recommendations for improvements
going forward, thus enhancing the accountability framework. Results would be measured by the
number of meetings of the ON Surveillance Committee.

5.37. The granting to Mali of Compliance Status by the EITI International Board will be
a key step in the country's efforts to demonstrate its adherence to globally acceptable
standards in managing its mining resources. Validation serves two critical functions. First, it


                                                 34
promotes dialogue and learning at the country level. Second, it safeguards the EITI brand by
holding all EITI implementing countries to the same global standard. Validation is also the
mechanism that the EITI Board uses to determine a country's candidate or compliant status. Mali
could use this major milestone as an effective mechanism to signal a higher standard to attract
global resources into the mining sector. Companies are attracted by a level playing field and
increased transparency is associated with lower operational and country risk. Finally, complete
adherence to the EITI framework promotes both country and companies reputational risk by
making public the benefits to the public purse of their operations. Development outcomes will be
measured by the public availability of audit reports on tax revenues accrued from mining
activities.

5.38. Good progress in the implementation of a new electricity tariff mechanism is
essential for EDM SA's financial sustainability. The interim tariff mechanism defines key
principles and methodology for tariff adjustments, essential step in the process of formulation of
the electricity tariff mechanism. With the adoption of the tariff mechanism Mali will have a tool
to ensure the alignment of tariffs with costs, particularly of oil prices. A proper use of the tool
will contribute for the improvement of EDM SA's financial performance and at the same time,
increase the transparency of public transfers and contingent liabilities. Development outcomes
associated with the supported reforms in the electricity sector will be measured by the operating
margin, which would capture operating profitability (including tariff adequacy).

5.39. The adoption of the Investment Code provides a clearer framework for investors.
The Code could promote investment, both domestic and FDI by shifting to transparent non-
discretionary investment incentives and simplifying the application of regulations, thereby
fostering good governance and contributing to the reduction of (both public and private)
opportunities for corruption. Results will be measure by the number of days it takes to announce
a decision on incentives (towards granting "agreement").

Public Financial Management Reform

5.40. The PRSC-5 supports the following policy actions to strengthen PFM: (2) submit to
the National Assembly draft laws revising the laws that created DGMP-DS and the ARMDS to
align them with the WAEMU Directive n°005/2005/CM/UEMOA; and (2) submit to the
National Assembly the draft 2008 Budget Review Act (Loi de Règlement 2008), including the
opinion of the SCCS, and determine modalities for the audit of public accounts.

5.41. Strengthening procurement can potentially generate significant savings, thus freeing
resources that could increase poverty reducing spending. By supporting the revision of the
legal and regulatory framework, the PRSC-5 contributes to supporting Mali's adherence to good
practices of separation of functions of control and regulatory bodies. The clarification of
attributions regarding procurement policy for example, reduces conflict of interest and could, in
the medium term, increase the use of competitive bidding perceived as important to enhance
value for money. It could also reduce opportunities for corruption. Development outcomes will
be measured using PEFA indicators on competition, value for money and controls in
procurement.




                                                35
5.42. A high quality external audit is an essential requirement for creating transparency
in the use of public funds. The PRSC-5 contributes for the creation of a quality external audit
function in Mali by supporting the timely submission to National Assembly of the Budget
Review Act, accompanied by the opinion of the SCCS. Timely review of the Budget Review Act
by the SCCS provides much needed information to the legislature, highlighting weakness in the
management of resources contributing for the identification of corrective measures. The PRSC-5
also supports the definition of the modalities for the audit of public accounts. Decisions under
implementation in this context include: (1) the preparation and submission to the National
Assembly of a law that exceptionally approves audits from 1960 (independence of Mali) to 1991,
taking into account the lack of evidence for that period; (2) implementation of a program for the
accelerated audit of the accounts from 1992 to 2008. With these actions, the audit backlog could
be cleared by 2012. Audits for the accounts from 2009 will gradually be undertaken according to
the timeline established by law. The Cabinet also decided on steps needed for the creation of an
autonomous Audit Court, scheduled for 2012. Development outcomes will be measured using
PEFA indicators on timeliness of submission of audit reports to legislature and on scope of
audits.

Improving Basic Social Service Delivery

5.43. The PRSC-5 supports the following policy actions to improve basic social service
delivery: (1) sign at least 230 State-Municipalities contracts on regional and local education
programs, including on teacher management; (2) Ministry of Health trains local elected officials
and technical staff on the application of decree 02-314 in at least 3 health districts; and (3) create
from 2011 a budget line to track budget expenditures related to the five year program of
implementation of the strategy for the extension of the coverage of health insurance to the
agriculture and informal sectors through the expansion of health mutual insurance schemes
(mutuelles).

5.44. Contracts for the management of education programs are important for clearer
definition of responsibilities and improved coordination. The contracts specify the duties of
the various entity involved at different administrative levels and define in detail the functions and
responsibilities for the decentralized services. Responsibilities of decentralized entities will
include the development and implementation of education action plans, consistent with the
overall education strategy for the country. In particular, these plans will include local
interventions to increase access and retain girls in school, and to provide literacy programs
focusing on women involved in productive activities. The contracts establish that the
Government should channel resources in line with agreed targets, including trained teachers. The
contracts will therefore increase the predictability of budgetary resources at local level while
encouraging realism in the formulation of local budgets. Technical assistance and monitoring
and evaluation procedures are also spelled out in the contracts. Adequate implementation of the
contractual framework could gradually improved service delivery through an effective transfer of
competencies to decentralized levels and fostering community participation and scrutiny.
Development outcomes will be measured by the average pupil teacher ratio.

5.45. Training elected officials and technical staff on the implementation of the decree 02-
314 and its guidelines will help management at decentralized level and reinforce
accountability. With PRSC-5 support, a three year training program was adopted and

districts. Beneficiaries of the training were given instruments they needed for the management of
public monies at local level. By increasing capacity, fiduciary risks involved in the effective
transfer of resources to local municipalities could diminish. Development outcomes will be
measured by the health current spending budget transferred to decentralized entities because the
pace of transfers will be gradually increase with management capacity at sub-national level.

5.46. The creation of a budget line to track budget expenditures related with the strategy
for the extension of the coverage of health insurance to the agriculture and informal sectors
enhances the visibility of this reform. The measure consolidates a reform supported by PRSC-
4, which introduced Government's co-financing of contributions of the poor who adhere to
health mutual insurance schemes. The majority of the members of these schemes are rural
dwellers and people working in the informal sector, most of which are poor. Data from Mali also
shows that adherence is higher among women. Studies have shown that access to health
insurance expands the use of available health services since households that belong to health
insurance schemes do not have to pay out of the pocket for all their health service needs. The
increased visibility of budget allocations could enhance community oversight on their use.
Increased access to mutual insurance schemes could be particularly important to gradually
improve maternal and child health outcomes given the strong adherence of women. Development
outcomes will be measured by the number of beneficiaries of mutual insurance schemes.

E. F OLLOW UP OPERATIONS

5.47. The Bank's decision to proceed with a follow-on PRSC series will be informed by
the degree of progress towards in the implementation of the reform agenda supported by
the Bank. As per any development policy framework, an adequate macroeconomic framework
will have to be maintained during the program period. The choice of triggers for the third PRSC
series will be guided by the priorities that will be defined in the third PRSP, now under
preparation.

                          6.   OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A. C OUNTRY O WNERSHIP

6.1.    The proposed operation is supported and owned by the authorities. As indicated in
the Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1), the specific reforms it supports are critical elements
of the Government's strategy to continue the re-launch of the cotton and the energy sectors,
improve transparency in the mining sector, strengthen public financial management, and enhance
social service delivery. These reforms were designed with the wide involvement of the
Government's relevant ministries and agencies under the leadership of the Ministry of Economy
and Finance. The Third Progress Report of the GPRSF was prepared though a participatory
process, which culminated in a review meeting held in Bamako in July 2010. The review
meeting provided a key dialogue framework for a thorough and shared appraisal of the quality of
policy reforms and actions needed to improve the policy stance. Participants in the review
included representatives of the central and sub-national government, private sector, civil society
and the donor community. Recommendations of the review were taken into account in the
preparation of the budget.

6.2.    Specific consultations on the policy reforms supported by the PRSC series were
undertaken, including in coordination with other donors. In October 2010 consultations
between donors, government and civil society organizations were centered on the matrix of
policy actions jointly supported by the Donor Budget Support Group. In December 2010
consultations were undertaken with the Finance Commission of the National Assembly,
representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, women's groups, and health and mutual insurance
non-governmental organizations. These entities indicated their support to the agenda supported
by the PRSC series but emphasized the need to increase the focus on social development and
environment related issues.




                                               38
                            Box 6.1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
The operation supports implementation of Mali's Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework (GPRSF)
adopted by the Government in December 2006 and reviewed by National Assembly in the context of the 2007
budget discussions, following an extended consultation process. The GPRSF, which benefits from broad-based
consensus, is Mali's second poverty reduction strategy, the first dating to 2002. Mali has an established track record
of progressively strengthening implementation of its PRS. Extensive analytical work undertaken through Bank-
supported projects (notably on cotton, irrigation and banking) or Economic and Sector Work (such as the Country
Economic Memoranda on growth, transport sector studies, health and education studies) have suggested policy
options for the Government and have contributed to the country's strategic framework. The operation supports a
number of recommendations from the GPRSF three progress reports, including the increased focus on actions to
accelerate growth and make progress in the decentralization process.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
The Bank has been an active participant in the budget support donor group. The Bank and the six other budget
support donors signed a MoU with the Government in July, 2010. Joint reviews are undertaken every year. To
ensure that they are informed by the participatory evaluation of the GPRSF, these reviews are scheduled to take
place after the review of the GPRSF.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
The policy matrix is customized to the country circumstances. Elements of its reform program are drawn from
existing country analytical work, the GPRSF and the preparation of sectoral strategies (e.g., PAGAM II, agriculture,
education, health and social development). At the Government's request, the Bank's financial support through the
PRSC aims to be disbursed in the first half of Mali's fiscal year.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The policy matrix uses a selected set of eleven prior actions for Board presentation. The chosen policy measures
were identified jointly with the Government and in close consultation with other development partners (notably the
budget support donor group and the IMF). Conditionality is focused only on key actions which would help move the
Government's agenda forward.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support
As agreed with the Government, processing of the PRSC-5 is timed to the country's budget cycle, which coincides
with the calendar year. The PRSC amount is announced to the Government in the course of the preceding year to
enable its incorporation in planning the subsequent year budget. Regular performance reviews are undertaken and
are progressively being aligned with Mali's evaluation cycle in the context of the donor harmonization agenda.


B. P OVERTY AND SOCIAL I MPACTS

6.3.   The specific GPRSF policies supported by the proposed PRSC-5 are likely to have
positive impacts on poverty reduction. The PRSC-5 supports actions that contribute to private
investment and growth, including through improved conditions for cotton production, of doing
business, as well as enhanced performance and transparence of the energy and mining sectors.
Analysis of the recently conducted household survey will allow for a deeper understanding of the
impact of these actions on poverty.

6.4.   Strengthening the management of the cotton sector as intended by the current
reform process is likely to improve livelihoods of producers. Government reforms in the
cotton sectors supported by the PRSC-3 and the PRSC-4 were informed by results of the draft
2006 Cotton PSIA, which indicated that an improved pricing setting mechanism and stronger


                                                         39
producer organizations would yield positive effects on poverty in the cotton producing regions.
23
   PRSC-5 supports key actions of the privatization of CMDT and the establishment of the
regulatory body for the cotton sector after privatization. The new regulatory entity would help
efficiency gains by instituting formal benchmarking for company performance in the medium
term. In addition, it would enhance governance in the sector while protecting producer and
consumer interests. Other things remaining the same, the new entity would foster conditions for
increased output and profitability, which would benefit cotton households, in a setting of rising
cotton prices. Improved efficiency with the entry of private operators may encourage larger
cotton producers who had exited the market to return, and with them, opportunities for
employment for less competitive households. Other ongoing reforms including supported by
IDA (PAPAM), targeting increased agriculture productivity and diversification (e.g. to produce
grains), including by facilitating access to key inputs through sources that are not associated with
cotton production, would provide opportunities for the diversification of agricultural production
towards profitable crops such as rice. These positive effects could be reinforced by resolving the
internal debt overhang of OPs. Additional empirical work needs to be done to assess the impact
of reforms introduced in the cotton sector. A new household survey was completed in August
2010. Although the 2010 survey should update regional poverty figures, it is unfortunate that no
specific information has been collected on cotton. Therefore additional household survey
focusing on cotton-producing regions needs to be undertaken. Such survey ­ having cotton-
producing and non-producing households ­ would be crucial to assess the relative importance of
cotton in household income and hence evaluate the expected impact of reform or market price
variations in both output and input. This work, planned under the Mali Poverty and Gender
Notes, scheduled for FY12, should provide a good baseline to evaluate over time the actual
impact of reforms including privatization.

6.5.    Strengthening governance in the ON region could increase equity in access to
developed land and reduce uncertainties for business investing in the area. PRSC-5 supports
governance by fostering actions that build up a common vision of irrigation development in Mali
which strengthening the framework for participation and accountability. Enhanced governance
could help attract private investors and donor support while protecting the interests of
smallholders. Increased oversight of the implementation of the Contract Plan would increase the
likelihood that actions taken are in line with stated objectives, which target poverty reduction
though increased opportunities of employment and increased productivity including of
smallholder farms. Social impact assessment of the reforms in the ON region, undertaken in the
context of the PAPAM, concluded that by enhancing productivity, investments in the left bank of
the Niger River increased incomes and reduced poverty.


23
  Most of the Malian cotton is produced in the Sikasso region, a populous region in south-east Mali and bordering
another cotton-producing region in Burkina Faso. Although cotton has been a major export commodity in Mali, the
Sikasso region experiences the highest poverty headcount rates according to available household surveys of 2001
and 2006. Most recent figures based on ELIM 2010 survey are not available yet. PRSC-3 supported the re-
introduction of the cotton pricing mechanism, aligning Mali's prices to world prices and defining the repartition of
cotton revenues. This measure was informed by the 2006 PSIA, which indicates that a more equitable repartition of
cotton revenues between CMDT and producers as well as reduced uncertainties have positive effects on livelihoods
of cotton producers. PRSC-4 supported the creation of the inter-professional cotton organization key to give
producers a voice on key decisions such as the pricing mechanism. Again, the 2006 PSIA indicates that empowering
producers to influence decisions in the sector has positive effects on their livelihoods.


                                                        40
6.6.    Analysis of the poverty impact of changes in electricity tariffs was undertaken in
anticipation of the PRSC-5. The analysis assessed how different categories of households,
specifically the poor, are affected by changes in tariff level and structure. The tariff increase that
took place in July 2009 (4 percent) did not affect the tariff bands associated with consumers of
the poorest income levels. In addition, simulations of tariff increases of 8 and 11.9 percent
indicate that, given their very low electricity access rate, consumers in the poorest five income
deciles would not be significantly affected. Simulations were also based on a new structure and
bands recommended in a study commissioned to inform the change in tariff policy. Results show
that the proposed changes would be desirable, not only to enhance the viability of EDM SA, but
also to render the public provision of electricity more pro-poor. Results of the analysis were
shared with the authorities as inputs for the formulation of the tariff reform and contributed for
the decision to prepare and adopt new principles and methodology for tariff adjustments. Impact
analysis will be undertaken again to inform decisions on specific tariff adjustments.

6.7.    By supporting increased transparency in the mining sector through the EITI
validation process, the PRSC-5 would contribute to a better use of public revenues from
mining. The main macroeconomic impact of gold mining in Mali is through the fiscal channel.
Gold production contributes to government revenues in three main ways: (1) royalties; (2)
corporate income tax; and (3) dividends. Mineral resources can contribute to poverty reduction
and growth if exploited and managed adequately. Experience elsewhere shows that revenues
from mining companies can be an important engine for economic growth and social
development. Some countries achieved these results by channeling incomes from natural
resources to help finance social outlays, infrastructure, and productive capacity. Availability of
information on contributions to the public purse from mining activities could increase demand
for improved budget management thus gradually contributing for allocations conducive with
growth and poverty reduction. The implementation of the Investment Code would promote
private investment, enhance opportunities for employment and incomes, and poverty reduction.

6.8.    The strengthening of public financial management is expected to enhance the
efficiency and effectiveness of public resources in the delivery of development services. The
PRSC-5 supports a measure that would promote discrimination of attributions between control
and regulatory procurement agencies. In the medium term, this could help increase the efficiency
of procurement control and oversight functions, ultimately resulting in increased value for
money by emphasizing open and transparent bidding rather than opaque single source
contracting. The PRSC-5 also supports the timely submission to the National Assembly of the
2008 Budget Review Act, and the definition of the modalities for the audit of public accounts
including a framework to clear external audit backlogs. These actions, complemented by actions
to strengthen the capacity of the audit entity, supported by the IDA financed ML- Governance
and Budget Decentralization TA, would contribute to improved management of public funds, in
line with authorized expenditures and poverty reduction priorities, thus increasing the
effectiveness in public spending and benefitting the entire population.

6.9.   Strengthening PFM capacity for basic service delivery at decentralized level would
improve education and health outcomes. For education, PRSC-5 supports the signing of
contracts for the delivery of basic education services at decentralized level. These contracts
assign responsibilities at central and decentralized level to meet objectives in line with the
MDGs. Complemented by sector budget support and IDA provided technical assistance for


                                                 41
improved PFM management, this reform is expected gradually increase equity in the allocation
of budgetary resources, reduce the costs incurred by poor families who have access only to fee
based community schools. Moreover, an adequate implementation of the contracts, which target
primarily poor rural communities, would improve the availability of trained teachers and
textbooks at local level, hence increasing the changes for improved education quality. By
including local initiatives to encourage school enrollment and retention of girls, and offering
literacy programs targeting women working in agriculture and informal activities, the contractual
framework could also help address gender imbalances.

6.10. The PRSC-5 would also contribute to improved living standards of the poor by
supporting policies that improve the management of public resources at local level and
foster the use of health services. The operation supports actions to strengthen the capacities of
public employees and elected officials to generate and use information for improved budgetary
decision-making in the health sector. Together with sector budget support provided by many
other donors and IDA, this action would contribute to improved effectiveness in public spending,
hence benefitting the communities involved, in which poverty rates are above 50 percent. In
addition, by supporting the creation of a budget line for the allocations for the implementation of
the strategy to expand health insurance mutual schemes, the operation contributes for increased
membership of rural and informal sector households, particularly women. Removing the
constraint to the use of public services imposed by the need to pay out of the pocket would
complement ongoing efforts to expand the network of health centers, and to increase the
availability of skilled personnel thus contributing to improved health outcomes of the poor and
vulnerable.

C. E NVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

6.11. Mali has a relatively comprehensive environmental legislation. However, due to the
intense creation of new laws and decrees in recent years, coherence between legal texts on the
environment is lacking and application is not consistent. 24 In addition, limited capacity hinders
environmental management in Mali.

6.12. The specific reforms supported by the proposed development policy credit are not
likely to have significant negative effects on the country's environment, forests and other
natural resources. The reforms supported aim primarily to strengthen regulatory, institutional
and public finance management at the national, regional and local government level.
Nevertheless, the PRSC-5 covers certain aspects of improving the policy environment for
infrastructure and private investment, including in the agriculture (cotton, ON), and mining
sectors. The overall Government reform agenda in these sectors may have significant associated
environmental risks. Bank-supported investment projects in these areas are providing the
necessary support to enhance capacity to the address potential risks.



24
  The National Policy of Environmental Protection (NEPP), adopted in 1998 provides the policy framework in this
area. It concerns the fight against desertification, pollution prevention, promotion of food security and the fight
against poverty. Meanwhile, the Government of Mali has developed a National Plan of Environmental Action Plan
(NEAP), which takes into account all environmental problems. Regional and local action plans (RAP, PAL) were
also elaborated.


                                                        42
6.13. Land devoted to cotton production is anticipated to respond to net income prospects
for the crop associated with the reforms supported by the PRSC-5. Although cotton area
may expand beyond levels of the last two years, this will be on already cultivated arable land,
and it is unlikely that land used for cotton productions returns to the levels reached during the
peak years. Fertilizer use in aggregate and per hectare on cotton is not anticipated to increase as a
result of PRSC-5 supported actions. The fertilizer subsidy provided by the Government is
expected to be reduced in 2011, in line with declining fertilizer costs. Moreover, with adequate
intervention both from the new private operators and the Inter-Professional Cotton organization,
planning for input provision is expected to improve and actual fertilizer application made within
technical norms. The Government, with support from donors including IDA (PASAOP,
PAPAM) is aware of potential environmental risks associated with cotton reform and is
addressing them.

6.14. The adoption of the new investment code could encourage an increase in new
investments, which could have environmental effects. Risks identified by the environmental
assessments undertaken under the Growth Support project include diversion of water resources,
air and water pollution from agro-industrial activities, soil contamination, noise, tree destruction
and electromagnetic radiation. Mitigation measures were addressed in the design of the Growth
Support Project. Another issue of concern relates to legal provisions on infrastructure at mine
closure. This is being addressed in detail in the new Mining legislation under preparation.

6.15. The adoption of a new tariff framework is not expected to result in direct
environmental effects. Given that poor households have a very limited access to electricity and
the adjustment framework protects lower income users from tariff increases, it is not expected
that consumers will substitute electricity for more polluting sources of energy.

D. I MPLEMENTATION, M ONITORING AND E VALUATION

6.16. The Ministry of Economy and Finance will be responsible for overall coordination
of supervision and monitoring of the reform program supported by the proposed
operation. The MEF will liaise with focal points in the Ministries, departments and agencies
involved in the PRSC program. The participating ministries, departments and agencies will
furnish relevant information and documentation on implementation and monitoring of their
respective programs to MEF, which will oversee progress in achieving program objectives. The
main sources of data will be the 2010 household survey, the population census that took place in
April 2009, administrative statistics collected annually by the sectoral ministries' planning and
statistical units, economic statistics produced by the National Statistics Institute (INSTAT),
PAGAM II reports and budget data from the MEF.

6.17. The monitoring of the PRSC-5 outcomes will be conducted within the GPRSF M&E
framework, supervision missions, including jointly with other donors. The GPRSF includes
a results matrix, which informed the results expected for the PRSC series. The institutional
structure for managing the overall implementation of the GPRSF is well established. The
Government will provide quarterly reports to IDA on implementation progress measured against
the agreed performance indicators detailed in Annex 4. The overall reform effort will be
reviewed by the Government in close coordination with regular IDA missions to ensure
continued implementation of the program within an adequate macroeconomic policy framework.


                                                 43
E. F IDUCIARY ASPECTS

6.18. The Government has adopted a public finance management action plan (PAGAM)
based on the last CFAA (2002) and CPAR update (2004), and the plan addresses the main
risks highlighted in the assessments. The PRSC-5 supports the implementation of the PFM
action plan, building on achievements made under the PRSC-1 to 4 and Economic Policy and
Public Finance Management Credit (EPPFMC) operations. In addition, the Government
established baseline indicator values through the 2007 PEFA, to be able to monitor progress on
public finance management over time. Key findings of the recent Public Expenditure
Management and Financial Accountability Review were incorporated into the design of the
PRSC series. Preliminary results of the 2010 PEFA Update indicate that: (1) budget credibility is
satisfactory, except for arrears management; (2) budget comprehensiveness and transparency are
rated to be average, but budget information is weak; (3) budgeting is based on sectoral policies
and multi-year policies; (4) predictability and internal controls have some weaknesses, notably
on procurement and general internal control; and (5) accounting and reporting, as well as
external scrutiny and audits, are reported to be fairly weak. Overall, the Bank has judged
implementation performance of the public financial management reform program to date and
Government's commitment to its improvement as satisfactory. It further finds the fiduciary
environment to be adequate to proceed with the proposed operation.

6.19. The Central Bank of the West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank
of the West African countries, including Mali. In 2005, the IMF staff carried out an on-site
safeguards assessment of the Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO) and
found that progress had been made in strengthening the BCEAO's safeguards framework since
2002 when the last safeguard assessment was undertaken. The BCEAO now publishes a full set
of audited financial statements, and improvements have been made to move financial reporting
closer to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IMF staff noted that the BCEAO
has improved the explanatory notes to the financial statements and further changes are scheduled
for the next fiscal year, with a view toward a gradual alignment with IFRS, as adopted
internationally by other central banks. Furthermore, an international audit charter has been put in
place, mechanisms have been established to improve risk management and risk prevention, and
follow-up on internal and external audit recommendations has been undertaken. The assessment
identified a number of areas where further steps would help solidify the progress made in recent
years. The main recommendations relate to: (1) improving the external audit process by adopting
a formal rotation policy and further enhancing the transparency of the financial statements by
adopting IFRS in full; and (2) enhancing the effectiveness of the internal audit function by
further strengthening the reporting to management of the BCEAO. The status report of the
implementation of recommendations, received in March 2007, indicates that some progress was
achieved in corporate governance, and strength and transparency of internal financial reports.

F. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

6.20. Disbursement and accounting. The borrower is the Republic of Mali, represented by the
Ministry of Economy and Finance. The credit will be released in one tranche of SDR [...]
million (US$70 million equivalent) upon effectiveness. The closing date of the operation will be
December 31, 2011. The proposed operation will follow IDA's disbursement procedures for
development policy operations. Upon approval of the Credit and effectiveness of the Financing


                                                44
Agreement, the proceeds of the Credit will be disbursed by IDA into a dedicated account of the
Government for budget support. The proceeds of the Credit will not be used to finance
expenditures excluded under the Agreement. The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit of
the Credit into said account, an equivalent amount is credited in the Borrower's budget
management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. Based on previous experience, the
execution of such transaction from the Central Bank to the Treasury (Ministry of Economy and
Finance) does not require more than four days. The Borrower will report to the Bank on the
amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited in local currency to the budget
management system. Assuming that the withdrawal request is in Foreign Exchange, the
equivalent amount in CFAF reported in the budgetary system will be based on the market rate at
the date of the transfer. The Borrower will promptly notify the Bank by fax or email that such
transfer has taken place, and that proceeds have been credited in a manner satisfactory to the
Bank.

6.21. Auditing. Dedicated deposit accounts could be audited on terms of reference acceptable
to IDA. If, after being deposited in this account, the proceeds of the Credit are used for ineligible
purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will require the recipient to either: (a)
apply the corresponding amount to eligible purposes, or (b) refund the amount directly to IDA.

G. R ISKS AND R ISK M ITIGATION

6.22. The operation faces significant external risks. These risks stem from a slower than
expected recovery from the global crisis, a reversal of the terms of trade gains, a further drop in
remittances and tourism revenues, and a decline in external aid remain major risks for the
country. The ongoing political crisis in Côte d'Ivoire and the political turmoil in the MENA
countries add to the uncertainties emerging from global developments. Other exogenous factors
such as Mali's vulnerability to natural shocks (drought, locust invasion) could compound the
situation. Mitigating factors are Mali's strong track record in macroeconomic management and
the government's renewed focus on growth-enhancing structural reforms while giving attention
to key social programs. The proposed operation would contribute to the mitigating measures by
supporting policy actions that contribute to economic growth and diversification, and further
strengthen public finance management including at decentralized level. In addition, the Disaster
Risk Reduction and Climate Adaptation country programming and ongoing Disaster Risk
Reduction (DRR) projects in Mali could help reduce the chances of disasters and help
households cope in the event of disasters.

6.23. Implementation capacity risk is also significant. This risk stems from the very limited
capacity in the public sector at central, regional and local levels, which could slow down project
implementation. The proposed operation seeks to mitigate the risk by accompanying key reforms
with technical assistance provided through Bank projects and by other donors.

6.24. The operation faces moderate budget risks. Ongoing financial difficulties facing the
cotton and electricity/water parastatal companies (CMDT and EDM SA), the Malian Housing
Bank (BHM) and the social security fund CRM, could potentially require larger government
transfers than those included in the 2011 budget to cover larger financial shortfalls in those
sectors. These risks are mitigated by close monitoring of the financial positions of BHM, CMDT,
EDM SA and CRM, and ongoing restructuring efforts. Continued high food prices and


                                                 45
prolonged political instability in Cote d'Ivoire and the Middle East and North Africa countries
could also have significant budget implications. Specific mitigation actions will be identified in
the context of the policy dialogue with the Government and could include some budget
flexibility to address crisis-related expenses within the context of a prudently managed budget
that supports priority growth and poverty reduction programs. Reinforced overall donor
coordination will also be critical to ensure external financial and technical assistance to help
address the challenges these crisis may impose.

6.25. Political and security risks are low. Political risks are related with the run up to the
2012 presidential and legislative elections. The pace of reform, including for fiscal consolidation,
could slow down. In addition, continued security concerns linked with the activities of al-Qaida
in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in the north of the country could adversely affect tourism and
require higher budget allocations than anticipated in the 2011 budget law submitted to the
National Assembly. No mitigation measures are considered in the context of the operation, since
these issues are beyond its scope.

No. 00844/MEF-SG                        Mr Robert ZOELLICK
                                        President of the World Bank

Subject: Letter of Development Policy of the fifth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSP-5)
        Mr. President,
        I have the honor to submit to you the attached Letter of Development Policy which
supports the Government of Mali's request for assistance from your Institution pour the fifth
Poverty Reduction Support Credit of a sum of US$70 million.
        This support will allow the Government to pursue its program of economic, financial and
social reforms, particularly in the following areas: reinforcement of the agricultural sector
through a privatization in the cotton sector and the establishment of a regulatory authority in this
sector; the adoption of a provisional tariff mechanism in the electricity sector; transparence in
mining sector information and the adoption of a new Investment Code; improvement in the
public procurement system and external verification of financial information; reinforcement of
access to basic social services such as health, education and social development.
        This Credit allows, despite the negative effects on Mali of increases in food and petrol
prices, for the safeguard of the Government's efforts to maintain budgetary allocations targeted
towards the most vulnerable sections of the population.

Please accept, Mr. President, the assurance of my high consideration.


                                                                     Sanoussi TOURE

     REFORM PROGRAM SUPPORTED BY THE FIFTH POVERTY REDUCTION
                     SUPPORT CREDIT ­ PRSC-5


1. In 2010, implementation of the President of the Republic's Economic and Social
   Development Plan and the 2007-2011 Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
   (GPRSP) was continued and public finance reforms were strengthened. Since Mali also
   celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of its independence in 2010, assessments were done of the
   economic, social, and cultural sectors.
2. In the context of implementation of the reform program supported by the fourth Poverty
   Reduction Support Credit for Mali in 2010, the Government continued its efforts to safeguard
   macroeconomic stability and continue implementation of important structural reforms. This
   Letter of Development Policy describes the current socioeconomic situation in Mali as well
   as the outlook for the next few years. It highlights the strategic and policy objectives set by
   the authorities in the context of implementation of the 2007-2011 Growth and Poverty
   Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP). To facilitate financing and ensure the implementation of
   this strategy, the Government of the Republic of Mali is requesting the assistance of the
   development partners, in this case the World Bank, through the Fifth Poverty Reduction
   Support Credit (PRSC-5).

   A. Political, Social, and Economic Context

3. Since the introduction of multi-party democracy in the early 1990s, the sociopolitical
   situation in Mali has been relatively stable. Efforts to foster this stability and lay a solid
   economic foundation paved the way for the start of a political transition process in 1992.
   Since that time, Mali has had two democratically elected Presidents. Four presidential
   elections have been held, with the most recent taking place in April 2007, which resulted in
   the reelection of Mr. Amadou Toumani Touré, who received 72.2 percent of votes cast
   during the first round.
4. The ongoing revision of the 1992 Constitution ought to take into account Mali's international
   commitments, particularly with respect to the Supreme Audit Institution. A national
   commission has already produced a draft Constitution which is being reviewed by the
   various sociopolitical actors. Amendments to the draft Constitution include the establishment
   of a Senate to replace the High Council of Local Governments, the creation of an Audit
   Office with autonomy and independence vis-à-vis the Supreme Court, and the establishment
   of the agency responsible for managing elections to replace the National Independent
   Electoral Commission (CENI) and the General Delegation for Elections (DGE).

5. In recent years, sociopolitical and economic stability and the willingness of the most senior
   authorities to institute social dialogue as a mechanism for resolving disputes has bolstered the
   confidence of friendly countries and bilateral and multilateral partners in the Government.
   Consequently, the main problems, in particular the security situation in the north of the
   country, have eased as former combatants have laid down their weapons and major
   development programs have been implemented in the north, including the Ten-Year


                                                58
   Development Program for the Northern Regions of Mali, the Integrated Program for the
   Development of the Regions of Northern Mali (PIDRN), the Program for the Socioeconomic
   Reintegration of Former Combatants, and the Integrated Program for the Rural Development
   of the Kidal Region (PIDRK). Cognizant of the international dimension of the security
   situation in the northern part of the country, the Government of Mali is collaborating with the
   countries of the subregion to control the unrest caused by armed bands of traffickers and
   terrorists who are wreaking havoc in the Sahara.
6. The third review of the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP) took place
   on June 7, 2010. This third review was particularly important owing to the fact that it was a
   mid-term review of the five-year program. Moreover, the review facilitated launching of the
   preparatory work of the 2012-2016 PRSP. The review exercise was organized around three
   key thematic areas, namely (i) rapid growth and the issue of demographic growth; (ii)
   poverty trends and assessment of MDG achievement; and (iii) problems associated with aid
   financing and effectiveness.

7. The Accelerated Growth Strategy (AGS), which was drafted and adopted in 2008 by the
   Government, received broad endorsement from the technical and financial partners (TFPs) at
   the Donor Round Table held June 12-13, 2008. At this event, the technical and financial
   partners expressed their interest in and willingness to assist the Government with the
   implementation of this strategy through the activities set forth in the Action Plan for the
   Accelerated Growth Strategy (PASCA).

8. The Action Plan for the Accelerated Growth Strategy is supported by the following five main
   areas: (i) macroeconomic framework and fiscal policy; (ii) governance and combating
   corruption; (iii) structural reform; (iv) development of the productive sectors; and (v)
   development of the private sector. Close to half of the 93 Accelerated Growth Strategy
   (AGS) activities target infrastructure and productive sector development. Of the 93 activities
   described in the AGS, 14 were fully completed and 71 were under way in June 2010.

9. The 2010 joint budget review of overall budget support took place October 18-19, 2010. The
   review facilitated a joint assessment of the results of the budget support provided in order to
   implement the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP). It should be noted
   that a significant portion of the work focused on procedures for public finance management
   oversight, the action plan for combating corruption, and the problem of building the capacity
   of the Accounts Section of the Supreme Court and transforming it into an Audit Office.

10. Based on the provisional results of the 2009 General Population and Housing Survey, the
    annual demographic growth rate stands at 3.6 percent. The Malian population increased from
    3.5 million inhabitants in 1960 to 14.5 million in 2009. This rate could triple or quadruple by
    2050 to 45 million to 60 million inhabitants. This strong demographic growth may be
    attributable to lower rates of emigration and higher rates of immigration in recent years.
    Measures that can slow demographic growth such as ensuring the education and literacy of
    girls, distributing contraceptives at the community level, and building awareness of health-
    related issues are set forth in Mali's National Population Policy and its third implementation
    program for the 2010-2014 period.



                                                59
11. The outcomes achieved by the Government in the social sectors, in particular with respect to
    maternal and infant health, remain modest, thus raising concerns with respect to achievement
    of the MDGs in these areas. However, outcomes in the area of education, access to potable
    water, and HIV/AIDS are very encouraging. In fact, the gross school enrollment rate rose
    from 75 percent in 2006 to 82 percent in 2009. In addition, the percentage of the population
    with access to potable water climbed to 73.1 percent in 2009 compared to 70.1 percent in
    2007, with the MDG being 80.4 percent in 2015. Not only has the latter indicator improved
    at the national level, but the gap between urban and rural areas has been cut in half. The rate
    of prevalence of HIV/AIDS among pregnant women was estimated at 2.7 percent in 2008
    compared to 3.5 percent in 2006. For the population as a whole also, the prevalence rate
    seems to be trending downward.
12. In conjunction with technical and financial partners as a whole, the Government undertook
    very ambitious public finance reforms that led to the adoption, in April 2005, of the
    Government's first Action Plan to Improve and Modernize Public Finance Management
    (PAGAM/GFP). Implementation was considered broadly satisfactory following an external
    independent evaluation during the first half of 2009. With the aim of consolidating the gains
    of this first plan and deepening the public finance reform process as much as possible, a
    decision was made to formulate a second plan covering the 2011-2013 period. Consequently,
    the second phase of the PAFAM/GFP, built on a participatory approach and incorporating
    results-based management (RBM) principles was oriented toward (i) greater mobilization of
    public resources; (ii) improvement of the budget preparation and execution process; (iii) a
    strengthened public finance management governance system in Mali; and (iv) acceleration of
    the decentralization and deconcentration process already under way.

13. As early as May 25, 2005, when the first PAGAM/GFP Round Table was held, emphasis was
    placed on the need to establish a public finance management benchmark system in order to
    assess, in a timely manner, the impact of the implementation of this plan on the performance
    of the public finance management system. Mali's first Public Expenditure and Financial
    Accountability (PEFA) assessment was done in 2006. The 2010 PEFA sought mainly to
    assess progress made with improving public finance management relative to the benchmark
    established in 2006. In general terms, the provisional assessment report submitted to the
    Government in September 2010 noted significant progress in several public finance
    management areas. However, work remains to be done with respect to external supervision,
    in particular in the area of the certification and public account audits.


   B. Recent Macroeconomic Developments

14. The Government's reform program includes activities to boost the contribution of the
    agricultural sector to pro-poor growth. To this end, efforts will be aimed at achieving higher
    productivity and greater diversification. The Government plans to strengthen the already
    significant results obtained in the area of grain cultivation, in particular rice. Cotton
    production started to pick up since the 2008/2009 agricultural season. The Government's
    objective is to quicken the pace of this recovery during the 2009/2010 season. On February
    22, 2010, the Government launched a competitive bidding process to privatize the Malian




                                                60
   Textile Development Company (CMDT) and remains committed to restoring the viability of
   the cotton sub-sector by enhancing its global competitiveness.

15. The Government is cognizant of the fact that Mali can boost agricultural productivity by
    tapping into its irrigation potential. A great deal of progress was made following the
    institutional reforms and investments in the area of irrigation, in particular higher rice
    production. Taking into account the recent interest shown by the private sector in investing in
    the Office du Niger zone, the Government will continue to encourage private investment, in
    particular, foreign direct investment, while protecting the position of small producers,
    including the poor and other vulnerable groups, and paying special attention to
    environmental issues.

16. A project to promote agricultural productivity, namely the Program to Support Agricultural
    Productivity in Mali (PAPAM), the cost of which is CFAF 72 billion, has just been launched
    with World Bank assistance. The PAPAM seeks to contribute to achievement of the
    objectives set forth in the GPRSP, in particular those related to guaranteeing food security
    and increasing production and thus the income of rural producers.

17. While the marked and projected decline in gold production was not offset by the exploitation
    of a new mine (start-up activities have been postponed) in 2010, the robust growth of the
    agricultural sector should more than compensate for this, given the favorable rainfall and
    sound measures implemented to start the season, including the financial support of the State
    for farmers in the form of input subsidies. This favorable agricultural season should help
    keep inflation at 1.2 percent for the entire year. Real GDP growth for 2010 is estimated at 4.5
    percent.

18. Preliminary information indicates that the balance of payments current account deficit,
    including grants, is expected to reach a deficit of 8.5 percent of GDP. This deficit will be
    funded in large measure by net capital inflows, mainly in the form of foreign aid and foreign
    direct investment. Consequently, a deficit of the order of CFAF 35.4 billion (US$71.7
    million) is recorded in the overall balance of payments, to be funded by a withdrawal of
    foreign exchange reserves from the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO).

19. The money supply is estimated to have increased by 13.4 percent during 2010 driven by
    credit to the state. While private sector credit increased by a mere 1.5 percent during the
    same period. Most recent available data on the stability of the financial sector (end-December
    2009) indicate that the capitalization ratio of the banking sector remains above 8 percent.
    However, it should be noted that the capital of two banks still has not reached the legal
    minimum of CFAF 5 billion (US$ 10 million).

20. Provisionary data indicates that the basic fiscal balance posted a deficit of CFAF 92.8 billion
    (2.0 percent of GDP), while a deficit of CFAF 111.6 billion (2.4 percent of GDP) had been
    programmed. The underlying basic fiscal balance (basic fiscal balance excluding
    expenditures funded with revenue from the privatization of SOTELMA) was also markedly
    different (deficit of CFAF 38 billion or 0.8 percent of GDP) from the amount programmed



                                                61
   (CFAF 48.0 billion or 1.0 percent of GDP). All outstanding 2009 payments, amounting to
   CFAF 129 billion, were settled during the first eight months of 2010. Preliminary indications
   are that all performance criteria and quantitative indicators are broadly in line with the
   program supported by the International Monetary Fund's program.

21. Compared to 2009, the 2010 budget law reflected a 10.8 percent increase in recurrent costs
    on education and 12.9 percent on health, reflecting the Government's efforts to achieve the
    Millennium Development Goals. At the same time, an upturn is expected in investment
    expenditure with the creation, inter alia, of a National Fund to Support Development, funded
    with revenue derived from the privatization process and the increase in the construction of
    roads and bridges. The 2010 budget also provides for the granting of an advance to the
    CMDT to fund inputs and to the Banque de l'Habitat du Mali (BHM) for purposes of
    implementing the restructuring plan adopted December 30, 2009 targeting State divestiture
    from the Bank in 2012.
22. A growth rate of 6 percent is forecast for 2011 based largely on higher gold and agricultural
    production together with favorable conditions in international gold and cotton prices.
    Preliminary projections set inflation below the WAEMU convergence criteria threshold of 3
    percent, but this projection may have to be revised in light of recent food and fuel price
    trends. The Budget Law adopted by the National Assembly in December 2010 authorizes a
    basic underlying deficit balance of 1.3 percent of GDP or CFAF 64 billion. 2011 budgetary
    policy will be prudent but exceptional measures may need to be considered if food and oil
    prices continue to increase, to minimize the impact on vulnerable Malians. Fiscal and
    financial indicators may be revised in order to better reflect potential effects of fuel and food
    prices on the fiscal accounts. IDA resources will help the financing gap create fiscal space
    needed to moderate the effects of price increases on the populations whilst maintaining
    investment in domains such as infrastructure, education or health, which are important in
    order achieve higher growth, reduce poverty and continue progress towards achieving the
    MDG targets.

   C. 2011-2012 Reform Program

Improving the Political Environment for Infrastructure and Private Investment
23. There is little chance that poverty can be reduced in Mali without promoting sustained
    agricultural production and diversification. Agricultural performance drives production and
    inflation trends and agriculture is the main economic activity of the majority of Malians.
    However, the sector's productivity remains anemic and, with the exception of rice and a few
    horticultural crops, growth is essentially dependent on land areas sown. Moreover,
    agriculture is highly vulnerable to rainfall patterns, locust invasions, plant diseases, and price
    volatility on the global market, particularly in the case of cotton.

24. The Government is in the process of implementing the transition plan and other measures
    with the aim of stabilizing cotton production. Projected production for 2010-2011 stands at
    roughly
    260,000 metric tons, following the downward revision of previous projections in order to
    take into account the impact of excessive rainfall in certain areas.



                                                 62
25. The Government remains committed to privatizing the CMDT. The bidding process was
    launched in February 2010 and the offers were evaluated at the start of 2011. The
    privatization process should be completed by mid-2011. A new policy for the cotton sector
    was adopted in 2009 and we plan to approve a law that creates a new regulatory entity for the
    cotton sector.

26. Mali could increase agricultural productivity and reduce vulnerability to climate shocks by
    taking advantage of its irrigation potential. Progress has been noted in the aftermath of
    institutional reforms and investments made in irrigable land, aimed at boosting rice
    production in particular. Despite a long delay, a contract for the Office du Niger was
    concluded in early 2009. Actions are ongoing to strengthen further the governance of this
    critical sector. These include the creation of a framework for the development of a shared
    vision of irrigation development in Mali, as well as a mechanism for meaningful participation
    of key stakeholders in the planning and oversight of irrigation activities in the Office du
    Niger region.

27. Strengthening infrastructure and improving the business climate continue to be priority
    actions of the Government. The positive outcomes obtained in the area of construction and
    road maintenance will be continued and deepened. The Government continues its efforts to
    improve the Business Climate. Following a consultative process, a new Investment Code has
    been adopted by Cabinet and has been submitted to the National Assembly. The Government
    also aims to improve governance in the mining sector. Based on the preliminary results of a
    study on institutional restructuring, the Government decided, in September 2009, to
    formalize the separation of operations of the water and electricity companies. The
    Government has just adopted legislation establishing the asset ownership company and the
    service provision company of the water supply company. Plans are under way to establish
    similar companies (asset ownership and service provision), beginning in 2011, for the
    electricity company.

28. Reform of the tariff and subsidy mechanism is aimed at bringing tariffs in line with
    production costs, in particular oil importation costs, while protecting low-income consumers.

29. The Government plans to boost efforts to improve governance in the mining sector. Mali
    became a candidate country for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in
    2008 and was granted two years to implement the activities set forth in its work plan. Mali's
    adherence to EITI standards should be confirmed by the validation process in 2010. Several
    measures have been adopted thus far, including (i) completion of the first EITI report on the
    revenue derived from gold-related activities in 2006; and (ii) Organization of seminars and
    participation in international training programs attended by civil society representatives.
    According to the EITI Council, while significant progress has been made, Mali must step up
    its work if the country is to be declared in compliance with standards. Specifically, it must
    produce a second EITI report for the2007-2008 period. In the medium term, the Government
    plans to continue to publish verified annual reports on issues related to taxation in the mining
    sector and to improve the institutional framework for registering income for purposes of gold
    taxes, in particular through a program currently financed by the World Bank.




                                                63
Strengthening Public Finance Management

30. Progress has been made in the area of public finance management reform, as indicated in the
    independent evaluation report on the Government's First Action Plan to Improve and
    Modernize Public Finance Management (PAGAM/GFP I) and the preliminary findings of the
    2010 PEFA. However, challenges remain, particularly with respect to procurement
    optimization and oversight, the quality and timeliness of annual financial reports, and
    external supervision and auditing.

31. The PAGAM-GFP II continues and deepens the reforms of the Government's First Action
    Plan introduced by the PAGAM-GFP I. Priorities include (i) finalizing computerized
    connections of all items in the public expenditure chain and applying the new expenditure
    management software (PRED5); (ii) drafting and circulating guidelines related to public
    procurement agents; (iii) submitting to the National Assembly a draft law on public
    procurement for Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), in accordance with WAEMU directives;
    (iv) submitting to the National Assembly draft legislation amending the laws creating the
    General Directorate of Public Procurement-Delegation of Public Services (DGMP-DSP) and
    the Regulatory Procurement Public Service Delegation Authority (ARMDS) in order to bring
    them in line with Directive No. 005/2005/CM/UEMOA; (v) building capacity to implement
    the new institutional framework and using the new procurement code by ensuring the
    training of staff in the DGMP, ministries, and the private sector, and establishing a database
    equipped with an integrated procurement management system in the DGMP and ministries;
    (vi) submitting the 2008 budget review law to the National Assembly, in particular the
    opinion issued by the Accounts Section of the Supreme Court; and (vii) drafting an action
    plan with the aim of settling the arrears for auditing the books of public accountants. The
    main activities of the PAFAM-GFP II are in line with the Government's reform agenda set
    forth in the Economic and Social Development Plan and the Institutional Development
    Program.

Improving the Provision of Basic Social Services
32. In the context of decentralization in Mali, subnational governments are responsible for the
    implementation of education and health programs. Although responsibilities have been
    clearly defined, the transfer of resources is slow, owing in part to capacity constraints. A
    recent directive from the Office of the Prime Minister stipulates that, beginning in 2010,
    budgetary line items for education and health must gradually be allocated to the decentralized
    entities for purposes of current and investment spending. In order to improve coordination
    between national and subnational governments, a contractual framework was adopted and is
    being piloted in the education sector. Capacity building work is also being stepped up. In the
    health sector, measures include the training of government officials in the sound
    implementation of the operational guidelines of Decree No. 02-314 on the transfer of
    financial resources to subnational governments and on the regional monitoring and
    supervision mechanism.

33. The Government is committed to ensuring access to high-quality social services through,
    inter alia, greater participation by local governments. Measures envisioned by the
    Government include (i) promoting contracts between the Central Government and local
    governments, the State and NGOs/associations, and the State and private sector, with a view


                                               64
   to the implementation of health sector policies, programs, and strategies; (ii) establishing
   consultative entities, in accordance with education Decree No. 08-095/PRM of February 21,
   2008; (iii) adopting a framework for drafting regional and local education programs, as well
   as drafting and executing contracts between the State and local governments in at least 230
   district schools, including teacher management; (iv) building the institutional capacity of the
   Ministry of Health and all the health services; (v) expanding social security coverage and
   improving access to basic social services and microfinance for the majority of disadvantaged
   population groups; and (vi) adopting and starting implementation of a training program
   (health sector) for local government officials and technical staff related to the application of
   Decree No. 02-314 in at least four health districts.

34. With the aim of specifically improving social services delivery, special attention is being
    paid to a number of measures. They include (i) conclusion of at least 230 contracts between
    the State and local governments related to regional and local education programs, in
    particular for the management of teachers; (ii) adoption and implementation by the Ministry
    of Health of a training program for local government officials and technical staff related to
    the application of Decree No. 02-314 in at least three health districts; and (iii) adoption by
    the Government of a national strategy and program to expand health mutual insurance
    systems. Measures in the education and health/social development sectors are fully covered
    in the financial and technical support programs for these sectors, namely the Third Education
    Sector Investment Program (PISE III) signed in December 2010 and the Health and Social
    Development Program (PRODESS).

35. Contracts for the management of education programs are important in order to define
    responsibilities more clearly and improve coordination. Contracts stipulate the duties of the
    various actors and administrative levels involved, and spell out in detail the duties and
    responsibilities of decentralized services. Contracts also foster a realistic approach to local
    budget preparation, given that they include financing commitments on the basis of global
    budgetary benchmarks and expected results. Development outcomes will be measured by the
    average student-teacher ratio.

36. Training of government officials and technical staff related to application of Decree No. 02-
    314 and its guidelines will help improve management at the decentralized level and
    strengthen accountability. Trainees will receive the necessary tools to manage public funds at
    the local level. Capacity building could reduce the fiduciary risks associated with the actual
    transfer of resources to local governments. Development outcomes will be measured by the
    budget share of health-related current expenditure transferred to decentralized entities.

37. The expansion of health mutual insurance systems is key to a more rapid increase in the use
    of health services. Studies have shown that access to health mutual insurance encourages the
    use of available health services, given that the households belonging to the health mutual
    insurance systems do not have to pay out of pocket for all necessary health services. This
    measure strengthens a reform supported by the PRSC-4, which introduced State co-financing
    of contributions for the poor belonging to health mutual insurance systems. Development
    outcomes will be measured by the number of beneficiaries of health mutual insurance
    systems.

         D. Monitoring and Evaluation

38. The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) will be responsible for the overall
    coordination and the supervision and monitoring of the reform program to be conducted in
    the context of the GPRSP. To this end, it will liaise with the focal points in the ministries,
    directorates, and agencies involved in the program. These ministries, directorates and
    agencies will provide the Ministry of Economy and Finance with the relevant information
    and documentation on the implementation and monitoring of their respective programs. The
    MEF will oversee progress made with achievement of the objectives of the program. The
    main sources of data will be the household survey (Streamlined Household Survey (ELIM) ­
    a joint survey), the General Population and Housing Survey, government statistics compiled
    annually by the planning and statistics units of the sectoral ministries, the economic statistics
    produced by the National Statistics Institute, and the budget data obtained from the Ministry
    of Economy and Finance.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth Review Under ECF
Arrangement for Mali and Approves US$3.12 Million Disbursement
Press Release No. 11/20
January 26, 2011

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fifth
review of Mali's economic performance under a program supported by the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF). The Board's decision enables the immediate disbursement of an
amount equivalent to SDR 2 million (about US$3.12 million), bringing total
disbursements under the ECF for Mali to an amount equivalent to SDR 25.99 million
(about US$40.52 million). The Executive Board also approved an extension of the
arrangement from May 27, 2011 to December 31, 2011, and a rephasing of the last
disbursement into two equal tranches.
The arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) was approved on May 28,
2008, in the amount equivalent to SDR 27.99 million (See Press Release No. 08/126).
At the conclusion of the Executive Board's discussion on Mali, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
"Macroeconomic developments in Mali have been favorable, helped by the able fiscal
stewardship of the authorities. Growth is expected to remain at 4.5 percent in 2010 and
inflation is low. Performance under the ECF-supported program continues to be good,
reflecting the authorities' commitment to the program objectives. The 2011 economic
outlook is positive, with a projected strengthening of economic activity. Continued
prudent macroeconomic policies and a prompt implementation of structural reforms will
be necessary to reduce vulnerabilities, diversify the economy, further raise economic
growth, and reduce poverty.
"Fiscal policy continues to be cautious and more emphasis is given to directing adequate
resources to social spending. The 2011 budget is well aligned with the authorities'
growth and poverty reduction strategy and their program's macroeconomic objectives.
However, the need for VAT credit refunds has been underestimated. Additional resources
will be required to meet the deficit target and the authorities have committed to adopt a
supplementary budget with measures to increase revenue or cut expenditure.
"While public financial management has been strengthened, further progress is needed.
The authorities have committed to simplifying the tax code and modernizing tax and
customs administration in order to increase domestic revenue mobilization and improve
the business environment. The authorities also plan to reduce the excessive number of
accounts held by the government entities in commercial banks, implement the directives
of the West African Economic and Monetary Union to increase fiscal transparency, and
strengthen oversight in order to improve revenue collection and budget execution.
"To reduce external vulnerabilities stemming from the exports' concentration on gold,
the authorities need to continue implementing a prudent debt management and step up
efforts to diversify the economy. Ongoing efforts to privatize the cotton ginning company
and develop the financial sector development will be particularly useful," Mr. Shinohara
said.
