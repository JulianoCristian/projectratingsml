                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The key objective of the proposed PRSC-5 is to support government-owned reforms to improve the regulatory and institutional framework for infrastructure and
                         private investment, strengthen public financial management and improve basic service delivery. Specifically, the PRSC-5 focuses on supporting the
                         government#s efforts to (1) improve the business environment and enhance governance and efficiency in the agriculture, energy and mining sectors; (2)
                         strengthen and modernize the legal framework for procurement and improve the external audit function; (3) advance fiscal decentralization in the education and
                         health sectors; and (4) improve the framework for the participation of the poor in the mutual insurance schemes.
                          The operation is an integral part of the Bank#s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Mali discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on February 5, 2008,
                         and directly contributes to the CAS Strategic Objectives 1 and 2, complementing Specific Investment Lending (SIL) operations that directly support Mali#s
                         growth and education sector reforms.

                         Clear results registered towards achieving overall PDO as well as individual sub-PDOs, however slower than anticipated pace of reforms in some subsectors has led to mixed results
