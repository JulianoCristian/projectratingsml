                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The overarching objective of the proposed DPO is to strengthen state capacity and accountability, thereby addressing some of the key underlying causes of fragility in
                         Comoros. The DPO supports implementation of Government-owned reforms spelled out in four of the PRGSP’s six strategic axes, namely: (i) axis one, on economic
                         stabilization and equitable growth, emphasizing improvements in fiscal policy and public financial management; (ii) axis two, on strengthening key sectors by focusing
                         on institution-building and ensuring a broader role for the private sector, with this operation supporting reforms in the fisheries and energy sectors; (iii) axis three, on
                         strengthening governance and social cohesion, focusing on improvements in core government personnel management systems and stepping up the fight against
                         corruption; and (iv) axis six, on promoting environmental sustainability and civilian security, emphasizing improved disaster risk management.
                          The proposed DPO is a central element of the Bank’s ISN for FY10-12 and is fully aligned with its second objective to strengthen state capacity and accountability. The
                         proposed DPO is being prepared at a time when the country is aiming to meet the HIPC Completion Point and to benefit from significant HIPC and MDRI relief.
                         Implementation of the reform program is being supported through a Bank-financed Economic Governance Technical Assistance project that complements this
                         operation.

                         reforms in strengthening the state's accountability and responsibility in through Public Finance Management Reform, Treasury Reform, Transparency and accountability in the civil
                         service reform and strengthening the policy dialogue on governance and fight against corruption and strengthening economic governance in the fisheries and energy sector, and
                         finally, the program helped the government to address the country's vulnerability in Disaster Risk Management.
