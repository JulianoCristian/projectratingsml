the Economic Reform\n            Development Policy Grant Project for Comoros were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            timely capacity assistance through adequate coordination\n            with other sector operations and other donors is critical to\n            improve government\u0092s capacity to implement reforms. Although\n            technical assistance is critical to support the\n            implementation of reforms, it is not always sufficient for\n            entrenching change in national processes. The design of\n            reforms must also complement the existing capacities, be of\n            relevance from a political economy perspective, and be\n            tailored to the existing practicalities. Additional\n            consensus may be warranted when implementing reforms that\n            touch upon the power sharing between the Island governments\n            and the Union. Better understanding should foster trust\n            among the parties and help move the agenda forward. Bank\n            supervision needs to follow up with the government more\n            closely regarding the steps they need to take to achieve the\n            indicators supported by the operation."}, "docdt": "2014-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
