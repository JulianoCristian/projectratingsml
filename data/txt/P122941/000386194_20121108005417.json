the\n            Economic Reform Development Policy Grant Program is to\n            strengthen state transparency and accountability, thereby\n            addressing some of the underlying causes of fragility in\n            Comoros. This program document states an Economic Reform\n            Grant, a stand-alone development policy operation (DPO), to\n            the Union of the Comoros. The single tranche DPO, in the\n            amount of SDR 3.3 million (US$5 million equivalent),\n            supports the implementation of core reforms in\n            Comoros's Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy\n            (PRGSP), at a time when the country is aiming at reaching\n            the Completion Point under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted\n            Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC CP) by end 2012. A previous\n            DPO, the Economic Governance Reform Support Grant (EGRSG),\n            in an amount of US$3 million equivalent, was approved by the\n            Board on June 1, 2010 and disbursed in October 2010. In the\n            politically difficult context of the late 2010 elections,\n            slower than expected implementation of reforms and slippage\n            in macroeconomic performance resulted in delays in the\n            preparation of the planned second DPO. Since mid-2011, the\n            authorities have rekindled the reform process, taken steps\n            to bring the budget under control, and shown a renewed\n            commitment to advancing on structural and institutional\n            reforms. The main goal of the operation is to support\n            government-owned reforms in four out of the six axes spelled\n            out in the country's PRGSP, namely (i) axis one, on\n            economic stabilization and equitable growth, emphasizing\n            improvements in fiscal policy and public financial\n            management; (ii) axis two, on strengthening key sectors by\n            focusing on institution-building and ensuring a broader role\n            for the private sector, with this operation's focus on\n            the electricity sector; (iii) axis three, on strengthening\n            governance and social cohesion, focusing on improvements in\n            core government personnel management systems and stepping up\n            the fight against corruption and fostering transparency in\n            the issuance of fishing licenses and agreements; and (iv)\n            axis six, on promoting environmental sustainability and\n            civilian security, emphasizing disaster risk management."}, "docdt": "2012-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
