﻿UNION OF THE COMOROS
ECONOMIC REFORM DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT
GRANT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Recipient        Union of the Comoros
Implementing     Vice Presidency in charge of Finance
Agency
Financing Data   SDR 3.3 million (US$5 million equivalent)
Operation Type   Stand alone single tranche development policy operation
Main Policy      The proposed DPO    focuses on two broad policy pillars: (i) Fostering public
Areas            transparency and accountability, covering PFM, civil service management, anti-
corruption and fisheries; and (ii) Addressing economic and social vulnerability
emanating from weak performance in the energy sector and weak natural disaster risk
management.
Key Outcome      Improving public financial management
Indicators           *   Timely transmission of budget circular to sector Ministries, Departments, and
Agencies (MDAs) at least six weeks before the start of the budget conferences,
i.e. not later than July 31, 2013.
*   Availability of public information of budget execution through the regular
publication of quarterly budget monitoring reports, including data on social
sectors expenditures.
*   Improvement in cash management with at least three timely consolidated cash
balances of the Union government produced by the DGCPT.
Improving public sector efficiency and accountability
* Availability of public information on staffing and wages in the civil service
through the publication of six bi-monthly reports.
Strengthening governance and anti-corruption
* Availability of public information on the legal basis for limiting corruption by
high officials, with at least five articles in the media reporting on the existence
of this legal basis by September 2013.
Strengthening the economic governance of the fisheries sector
* Availability of public information on fishing licenses and agreements issued by
the government, with annual disclosure to the public.
Improving reliable availability of electricity

percent in the first semester of 2013.
Improving coordination of government bodies involved in natural disaster risk
prevention and management (DRM)
* Governmental DRM coordination mechanisms made formal and systematic,
with at least two meetings of the national DRM commission by end-September
2013.
Program          The overarching objective of the proposed DPO is to strengthen state transparency and
Development      accountability, thereby addressing some of the underlying causes of fragility in
Objective(s) and  Comoros. The Economic Reform      Grant (ERG) supports implementation    of
111


﻿relation          Government-owned reforms spelled out in four of the Poverty Reduction and Growth
to ISN            Strategy Paper (PRGSP)'s six strategic axes, namely: (i) axis one, on economic
stabilization and equitable growth, emphasizing improvements in fiscal policy and
public financial management; (ii) axis two, on strengthening key sectors by focusing on
institution-building and ensuring a broader role for the private sector, with this
operation's focus on the electricity sector; (iii) axis three, on strengthening governance
and social cohesion, focusing on improvements in core government personnel
management systems, stepping up the fight against corruption and fostering
transparency in the issuance of fishing licenses and agreements; and (iv) axis six, on
promoting environmental sustainability and civilian security, emphasizing improved
disaster risk management.
The proposed ERG is a central element of the Bank's ISN for FY1O-12 and is fully
aligned with its second objective to strengthen state capacity and accountability. The
proposed ERG is being prepared at a time when the country is aiming to reach the HIPC
Completion Point and to benefit from significant HIPC and MDRI relief.
Implementation of the reform program is being supported through a Bank-financed
Economic Governance Technical Assistance project that complements this operation.
Risks and Risk    This operation would face significant risks stemming from:
Mitigation
Political instability. Downside risks to the realization of the proposed ERG's
objectives remain primarily political. Continued progress toward political stability
remains the pre-eminent factor supporting positive medium-term growth prospects and
the needed acceleration of structural reforms. While the country will not have new
elections until 2016, fragility in the political environment remains a challenge.
Historically, difficult inter-islands relations over the use of public resources, against a
background of weak governance, structural weaknesses in PFM and high politicization
of civil service management, have been core contributors to the country's protracted
fragility. The Union government is well aware that careful attention to the political
economy of inter-government fiscal tensions, steps to foster trust among the parties, and
continued consensus building are required. Support by the international community for
a constructive dialogue between the Union and Island governments remains imperative,
as is delivering on the assistance that underpins reform implementation.
Weak capacity of implementing reforms. Weak capacity, eroded further by years of
fragility, is a major issue. The authorities and donors are tackling it by: (i) coordinating
and, when possible, consolidating their interventions; (ii) providing significant parallel
technical assistance and capacity-building interventions; and (iii) focusing the reform
agenda in a limited number of implementable measures. Close dialogue with Bank staff
also helps the authorities address implementation constraints.
Sustainability of reforms. The HIPC process has been a catalyst for reforms, and there
is a risk of a loss of momentum once the Completion Point is reached. The proposed
ERG pushes the agenda forward with a focus on initiation of specific implementation
steps going beyond HIPC triggers, but this being a stand-alone operation, some
operation-specific reforms could be reversed, including under an unexpected change in
the political situation. This said, early results on recent reforms, including on the fiscal
front and the normalization of wage payments, have lent public support to reforms.
Focusing on homegrown reforms and their consolidation mitigates this risk further,
given also that the next elections will take place in 2016. Going forward, sustained
engagement by the Bank, Fund and donors will remain critical in the post-HIPC period.
Challenging macroeconomic environment. Though domestic economic developments
hinge critically on continued political stability and improvements in economic
management, a weakening of global economic conditions, especially in the European
1v


﻿economies, would also undermine short- and medium-term prospects. With fiscal
stabilization at the center of the short-term policy agenda and no domestic fiscal space
to cushion shocks, the scope for macroeconomic policy responses would be limited to
the availability of adequate and timely financial support from the donor community.
Fiduciary risks. These risks are significant and directly mitigated by the focus of the
proposed grant on improvements in fiduciary standards and continued assistance in
public financial management and public administration reforms. An ongoing PEFA
assessment will provide benchmarks against which recent progress in strengthening
PFM performance can be measured, and facilitate the identification of areas in need of
additional remedial actions.
Opposition to reforms. Reforms, particularly in PFM, civil service management,
fisheries, SOEs and fighting corruption in weak governance environments such as
Comoros, come with non-negligible political-economic risks. Some localized resistance
to reform should be expected. However, this risk is mitigated in several ways. A focus
on transparency is central, especially to promote the perception of a fair distribution of
resources between the Union and the islands. Technical assistance and dialogue have
helped build consensus. Another mechanism is donor coordination and donors
collective focus on a few key reform areas.

﻿PROGRAM DOCUMENT
UNION OF THE COMOROS
ECONOMIC REFORM DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1   This program   document proposes an Economic Reform      Grant, a stand-alone
development policy operation (DPO), to the Union of the Comoros. The proposed single
tranche DPO, in the amount of SDR 3.3 million (US$5 million equivalent), supports the
implementation of core reforms in Comoros's Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (PRGSP),
at a time when the country is aiming at reaching the Completion Point under the Enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC CP) by end 2012. A previous DPO, the
Economic Governance Reform Support Grant (EGRSG), in an amount of US$3 million
equivalent, was approved by the Board on June 1, 2010 and disbursed in October 2010. In the
politically difficult context of the late 2010 elections, slower than expected implementation of
reforms and slippage in macroeconomic performance resulted in delays in the preparation of the
planned second DPO. Since mid-2011, the authorities have rekindled the reform process, taken
steps to bring the budget under control, and shown a renewed commitment to advancing on
structural and institutional reforms.
1.2   The main goal of the proposed operation is to support government-owned reforms
in four out of the six axes spelled out in the country's PRGSP, namely (i) axis one, on
economic stabilization and equitable growth, emphasizing improvements in fiscal policy and
public financial management; (ii) axis two, on strengthening key sectors by focusing on
institution-building and ensuring a broader role for the private sector, with this operation's focus
on the electricity sector; (iii) axis three, on strengthening governance and social cohesion,
focusing on improvements in core government personnel management systems and stepping up
the fight against corruption and fostering transparency in the issuance of fishing licenses and
agreements; and (iv) axis six, on promoting environmental sustainability and civilian security,
emphasizing disaster risk management.' Specifically, this DPO focuses on two broad policy
pillars: (i) fostering public transparency and accountability, covering PFM, civil service
management, anti-corruption and fisheries; and, (ii) addressing economic and social vulnerability
emanating from weak performance in the energy sector and weak natural disaster risk
management.
1.3   The proposed operation is an integral part of the International Development
Association (IDA) FY1O-12 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) to support the Union of the
Comoros. The Board discussed IDA's FY10-12 ISN on June 1, 2010 and the proposed operation
is consistent with the planned support aimed at tackling the underlying causes of fragility
(political, economic and environmental) by strengthening state capacity and accountability. The
Bank will soon launch the preparation of a Country Assistance Strategy for Comoros for possible
consideration by the Board in April 2013. Bilateral and multilateral partners have provided

July 2010. This was the country's first PRSP, which was adopted by the Government on September 29, 2010.

﻿substantial budget support in 2009 and 2010 and expressed willingness to continue to support the
country's reform efforts in subsequent years. The African Development Bank is preparing a
parallel budget support operation slated to be presented to its Board in November 2012. The
International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a Three-Year arrangement under the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF)2 on September 16, 2009 following satisfactory performance under the
Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance-supported program. After slippages in late 2010 and in the
first half of 2011, Government efforts resulted in a broadly satisfactory performance since then.
As a result, the third ECF review was completed in June 2012 and the completion of the fourth
review is slated for IMF Board consideration in December 2012.
1.4   Like its predecessor and as envisaged in the ISN, the proposed DPO supports
reforms that complement and strengthen the country's effort to meet the HIPC Completion
Point by December 2012. Comoros remains in debt distress, with a present value of external
debt exceeding 200 percent of exports and 190 percent of government revenues in 2011.
Comoros reached the HIPC Decision Point on June 29, 2010. Good progress has been made on a
range of triggers for reaching the Completion Point by December 2012 (see Table 2.3). The
proposed operation complements and strengthens the country's efforts as it aims to meet the
HIPC Completion Point requirements.
2. COUNTRY CONTEXT
A.    RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS
2.1   Comoros has been a relatively peaceful country despite the multiple coups in earlier
decades. There have been no ethnic or religious grievances and a near absence in recent years of
political violence. Political instability has mainly reflected the difficult search for an agreement
over the respective roles of national and island governments and sharing of public resources, and
its implementation into transparent and accountable institutional arrangements. In the three
decades since independence, Comoros has experienced several coups, demands for more
autonomy from the constituent islands (of Grande Comore, Anjouan and Moh6li), with a
separatist movement in Anjouan, and frequent changes in governments. Instability has in turn
contributed to a long-term declining trend in the economy and taken a severe toll on the public
sector's ability to deliver basic services, further fueling grievances and instability. In particular,
in an environment of weak governance, pressures for recruitment into the public sector remained
intense, undermining public sector performance.
2.2    Since taking office in May 2011, the new Cabinet has rekindled the reform process.
The five-month transition following the 2010 December elections was marked by slippages in
economic management, including pre-election promises to grant an unaffordable 30 percent
wage increase to civil servants. The Cabinet that took office in mid-2011, under President
Ikililou Dhoinine, has rekindled the reform process, rescinded the wage decisions, and, more
broadly, shown disposition for accelerated reforms. The IMF ECF-supported program has been
on track for more than a year, and the HIPC process has rapidly advanced. With no new major
elections expected for the next three years, political stability should support the reform
momentum.
2 The Extended Credit Facility has replaced the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).
2


﻿2.3    As political stability gains traction, transparency will retain a central role to foster
trust among the actors. The new Constitution in 2009, in particular, by clarifying the scope of
devolution and recentralizing some core functions, aims at achieving a workable compromise
between a functioning central government and some autonomy for the islands. Implementing this
compromise in a context of limited fiscal room, weak capacity, deficits in the provision of key
public services and a slow-growing economy remains a central challenge for the country. Trust
between the parties as they "build the ship at sea" is a core ingredient for success, and a central
rationale for the proposed operation's focus on public sector transparency.
2.4    Underpinning a focus on the supply-side of transparency, Comoros enjoys a vibrant
media that can mediate information when it is available. While the World Bank governance
indicator ranking on Government Effectiveness for Comoros is very low (at the 1 percentile), the
ranking for Voice and Accountability is in the 34.6 percentile (see table below). Key to this
ranking is, on the voice side, the presence of an active media. In this relatively small country,
there are three national daily newspapers, as well as TV stations and national and community
radio stations. Media coverage therefore represents a key mechanism that can be leveraged for
fostering better accountability.

B. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
2.5    Comoros' three islands form one of the smallest African countries. With an estimated
760,000 inhabitants, spread among three islands, the country remains mired in poverty. Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is estimated at US$785 and, based on 2004 estimates, about
45 percent of the population lived below the poverty line, an incidence that has probably
increased since then . Poverty incidence varies considerably across regions and is typically
higher in rural areas and on the island of Anjouan. The primary sector of the economy (mainly
subsistence agriculture, a few cash crops, and fisheries) and retail services dominate the
economy, representing about one-half and one-fifth of the country's GDP, respectively. Cash
crops comprise mainly three high-value export crops-vanilla, cloves and ylang-ylang4-and
constitute most of the export earnings in goods, equivalent to a mere 4 percent of GDP. The third
largest sector is government services, representing about 10 percent of GDP. Despite the
potential in tourism, the country has failed so far to tap into the growing role of this sector in the
region. With longstanding outmigration, the country benefits from large and growing
remittances-at close to 20 percent of GDP-from the Comorian diaspora, mainly in France.
The diaspora also represents the main source of visitors from abroad.
3   ongoing survey, expected to be completed in early 2013, should provide an update on poverty trends.
4Ylang-ylang (pronounced EE-Lang-EE-Lang) is a common name for the cananga tree. Its highly flagrant flowers, as the
essential oil derived from them, are used in perfume manufacture and for aromatherapy.
3


﻿2.6    Economic growth is edging up, albeit at still much too low a level for an impact on
poverty reduction (Table 2.1). Economic growth in 2012 should come out at 2.5 percent, from
2.2 percent the previous year, driven by a favorable performance of the agricultural sector, robust
remittances and associated housing construction, and a modest recovery in foreign direct
investment. While positive aggregate growth is a welcome break from the past, it is still too low:
with population growth estimated at 2.4 percent a year, much faster economic growth, sustained
over a long period, will be needed to affect poverty.
2.7   Fiscal performance continued to improve in 2012. (Table 2.2). With continued wage
bill restraint, stepped-up tax arrears recovery, and strong non-tax receipts5, the domestic primary
budget surplus widened in early 2012, and should come out at 2.2 percent of GDP for the year.
After clearing all wage arrears at end-20 11, the government has been current on civil service
salaries on a regular basis in 2012. In addition, the reform impetus on the fiscal structural reform
front has been sustained, and several Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms have
advanced, including the completion of the civil service census, implementation of the new
computerized wage management system, parliamentary approval of PFM reform enabling
legislation, and an improvement in budget reporting, with the production of quarterly budget
execution reports. Recent performance improvements allowed for the completion of the third
IMF ECF program review in June 2012; the completion of the fourth review is slated for IMF
Board consideration in December 2012.
Non-tax revenue (almost 4 percent of GDP in 2012) improved on account of the "Economic Citizenship" program whereby
Comoros has been selling passports to non-nationals abroad, a program that has been a subject of domestic debate on the possible
reputational risks for the country. To ensure better fiduciary oversight, revenues from these sales have been tracked and
channeled through the Central Bank of Comoros. The government is saving half of its 2012 revenues in BCC reserves, and
allocating the remainder to infrastructure rehabilitation and the WHO-managed malaria and HIV programs..

4/ Baseline scenarios
2.8     Monetary and price stability remains well anchored in the Comorian franc zone
monetary arrangement. The Comoros maintains a peg against the euro under the arrangement,
and has maintained broadly stable inflation over the decade, with temporary deviations from a
low trend reflecting mainly movements in world prices of food (especially rice) and fuel imports,
and domestic supply conditions in food crops. Against this background, inflation has subsided in
2012, and is projected at 6.0 percent in the current year.
2.9     Comoros' small banking system remains sound. There are three active banks in the
country, involved mainly in deposit taking, trade finance and foreign exchange transactions, as
well as several micro-finance networks. Credit to the private sector has grown in the last three
years, with a gradual restoration of political and economic confidence-it is projected to grow by
about 10 percent in 2012, slightly outpacing nominal GDP growth, to reach a still-low 1812
percent of GDP. With assistance from the IMF and the Banque de France, progress is being
made in banking supervision. The Central Bank aims at the establishment of a credit bureau, and
the government is in the process of selling its equity in a development bank that has been
restructured into a commercial bank.

remittances and aid. The external current account deficit is expected to narrow to 7 percent of
GDP, from 9.0 percent in the previous year, reflecting a pick-up donor's budgetary assistance
and continued solid growth in remittances. The export base remains small, but cloves export

﻿prices continued to be favorable in 2012; imports grew in line with the economy. Official
reserves are projected to exceed seven months of imports of goods and services.
2.11   The government is making headway in addressing structural problems that have
long constrained growth. Beyond decades of political and macro-policy instability, a range of
untreated structural ailments have affected the scope for rapid growth, ranging from a difficult
business environment of red tape to deficient infrastructure. In the Doing Business Report,
Comoros ranked 157 in the ranking of ease of doing business, but ranked particularly low on
entry and exit criteria (respectively 168 and 183 worldwide).6 To support its Investment Climate
reform program, the government has solicited support from the International Finance
Corporation (IFC), which provides assistance in areas such as business dispute resolution, small
business development and leasing. The power sector has been in a critical state for several years,
with low access, frequent blackouts and fiscal spillovers, and a persistent source of vulnerability
to economic growth. While generation capacity is not yet a major constraint to energy sector
performance, the Government is developing a power sector reform program focused on
improving the power company's management and operational performance, given the power
company's dismal billing and collection function (only 30 percent of electricity produced is paid
for), and its storage and distribution infrastructure. Progress on SOEs reform is now being made,
with the ongoing privatization process for Comoros Telecom with IFC support, and recent
decisions on MAMWE (see paras. 5-25 to 5-30).
2.12   Social indicators have shown improvement in recent years, benefitting from aid-
supported government programs. Under their recent PRGSP (see paragraph 3.1), the
authorities, with donor assistance, have managed to achieve progress on key indicators by
expanding access to primary health care and basic education, and deepening the fight against
malaria, measles and HIV. Child mortality at birth (49 per 1000) and maternal mortality (380 per
100,000 live births) have slowly declined over the decade, and there has been some progress on
the fight against AIDS, measles and malaria. Gross enrollment ratios have improved (net rates
remain below 80 percent), and gender parity at the primary school level is almost achieved.
Retention rates are low, however, and there are significant issues in education system quality and
learning outcomes, despite Comoros having a teacher/student ratio at 32. Access to safe water
remained stagnant at 11 percent, in recent years, and much remains to be done.
C. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
2.13   Comoros' medium-term     growth outlook is moderately favorable, assuming no
major political disturbances. Real GDP growth is projected to strengthen moderately from 2.5
percent in 2012 to the 3.5-4 percent range over 2013-14. With a population growth rate of 2.4
percent, such a growth trend remains modest but is achievable with a gradual entrenchment of
political stability and continued macroeconomic stability. In addition, private investment in
telecoms, a gradual improvement in MAMWE's operational performance, continued reforms of
the investment climate, and increasing donor support to public spending on infrastructure will
support growth and employment in the Comoros' small private sector. The trend of robust
6 It takes 11 different procedures and some 24 days to start a business, which is comparable to other SSA countries, but the cost
(176.5% of income per capita) is prohibitive even by regional standards. Termination costs are also a powerful deterrent due to
the risk of legal hurdles.

﻿remittances should also boost housing and trade, and a stronger performance in the agricultural
sector could be achieved with favorable international prices for the few commodities that are
exported and with additional investment. Inflation is projected to slow down owing to easing
pressures on import prices and remain on a stable path in the medium term. To close its financing
gap for 2013 and 2014, the Government expects to mobilize additional budget and project
support, on the basis of grants and concessional loans once the HIPC completion point is
achieved. Should the additional resources fall short of the financing needs, it is expected that the
Government would be willing to cut spending, while protecting pro-poor expenditures.
2.14  This said, Comoros remains vulnerable to a worsening of the global economic
context, especially in the Euro zone. Though Comoros has some trade-related exposure to
adverse developments in the European economy, the main channel of impact is that of
remittances (about 20 percent of GDP), with a large Comorian community living in France.
Remittances remained buoyant in recent years, however, despite the 2008 global crisis and
subsequent slowdown in European economies. Nonetheless, a deepening of the European crisis
could impact private transfers, recipient household livelihoods and activity in sectors highly
dependent on remittances, such as construction, trade and transport. Given Comoros' monetary
arrangement, the debt distress situation and lack of fiscal room, there is essentially no scope for a
domestic macroeconomic policy response in response to short-term shocks. For the medium
term, the onus remains on accelerating structural reforms, especially in growth-constraining
sectors such as energy, and on maintaining efforts to stay the course on fiscal consolidation.
2.15  The fiscal scenario in the medium    term  (Table 2.2) seeks continued fiscal
consolidation to achieve a sustainable fiscal position and stronger growth. The domestic
primary deficit, excluding revenues from the Economic Citizenship Program, is expected to
continue to narrow to 0.5 percent of GDP in 2014 reflecting ongoing efforts to extend the tax
base and strengthen the efficiency of tax and customs administration, including the establishment
of the new unified General Administration of Taxes, together with wage restraint and potential
savings from the civil service reform under implementation. Under this scenario, social
expenditures in education and health and investment are expected to increase as a percentage of
GDP in the medium term.
2.16  The latest joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis indicates that
Comoros remains in debt distress. At end-2012, the present value (PV) of the country's public
and publicly guaranteed external debt is projected at 31.8 percent of the GDP. Given the small
export base, the PV of debt exceeds 200 percent of exports, and would remain well above the
100 percent HIPC-threshold for most of the projection period. Comoros reached the decision
point under the HIPC Initiative in July 2010 and was granted debt relief by a number of
multilateral and bilateral donors. Delays in concluding the third IMF-supported ECF review
resulted in the suspension of the Paris Club agreements. However, the authorities have continued
in good faith discussions with bilateral and multilateral creditors on debt restructuring consistent
with the 2009 Paris Club agreement and the HIPC Initiative framework. Improving the external
debt outlook will depend on achieving the full delivery of HIPC assistance and expected support
under the Multilateral Debt Relieve Initiative (MDRI) and maintaining sound macroeconomic
policies in the long run.
2.17  Comoros' macroeconomic framework for the medium term provides an adequate
basis for the proposed operation. The authorities are fully aware of the need to remain cautious
8


﻿and closely monitor ongoing developments domestically and abroad. Recent developments,
namely the renewed commitment to fiscal consolidation, underscore the authorities' willingness
to take remedial actions to maintain macroeconomic stability and growth.
2.18   Significant progress has been achieved in the implementation of the HIPC
Completion Point (HIPC CP) triggers and Comoros is likely to reach the Completion Point
later in 2012 (Table 2.3). Substantial progress has been made on most triggers, and the HIPC
Completion Point is now slated for Board consideration in December 2012.

mandate and activities, consistent with the office's

3. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY
PROCESSES
3.1   On September 10, 2009, the Government of the Union of the Comoros officially
adopted the final version of the country's Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy Paper
(PRGSP) 2010-14. The PRGSP continues the efforts begun under the I-PRSP to stabilize the
economy promote private sector growth and improve delivery of social services. The General
Commissariat of Planning led the preparation of the document with a technical committee
formed by the PRGSP Unit and the statistics office. The strategy was prepared in a participatory
manner with extensive consultations both at the Union and Island levels through working groups
involving a broad range of stakeholders, including representatives from civil society, traditional
and religious leaders, non-government organizations (NGOs), and development partners. Its
vision is aligned with the objective of making progress towards the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). Technical working groups were constituted at the ministries and the islands level
to follow up on implementation of the PRGSP.
3.2   The objectives of the Government's Program for 2010-14 are in line with the
PRGSP 2010-14 which focuses on six key axes:
*  Core Strategy I: Stabilize the economy and lay the groundwork for strong equitable growth;
*  Core Strategy II: Strengthen key sectors by focusing on institution-building and ensuring a
broader role for the private sector;
*  Core Strategy III: Strengthen governance and social cohesion;
*  Core Strategy IV: Improve the health status of the general public;
*  Core Strategy V: Promote education and vocational training with the aim of developing
human capital;
*  Core Strategy VI: Promote environmental sustainability and civilian security.
3.3   Reaching the HIPC completion point is a major milestone for the current
government. The Comoros reached the HIPC Decision Point in June 2010 and is aiming at
reaching the HIPC Completion Point by end-December 2012. The government has renewed
efforts to mobilize line ministries for steady progress on implementing triggers for the HIPC
Completion Point, within the framework of their PRSP.
11


﻿3.4 The government's core macro-policy focus is on restoring macroeconomic and fiscal
stability by strengthening revenue mobilization and keeping the wage bill under control.
The government has made efforts to start addressing long-standing weakness in revenue
collection. With the support of the IMF, the African Development Bank, and the French
Cooperation, the government has initiated reforms of the tax administration, centered on
implementing a unified tax administration for the four constituent governments and reaping the
benefits of more inter-governmental cohesion in tax administration. The government has updated
the taxpayers' registry at its large taxpayer unit. Moreover, to strengthen tax and customs control
and reduce leakages and fraud, joint tax and customs investigation operations have been
increased. To keep spending under control, the government has updated the civil service payroll
drawing on the results of a civil service census, and gradually shifted to full reliance on the new
computerized payroll system. To help stabilize the wage bill over the medium term, the
Government has adopted new organic frameworks that define staffing requirements and is
moving toward their implementation. With better control on the wage bill, the authorities will
aim at improving the fiscal space for operations and investment expenditures in critical areas,
especially the social sectors and infrastructure.
3.5   In line with the PRGS, the Government has adopted a Public Financial
Management Strategy that covers the period of 2010-2019 and that is supported by an
action plan for 2010-2012. These efforts led to an improvement in the implementation of key
pillars of the reforms, including the legislative and institutional framework and budget execution
processes. These strategies are articulated around four pillars: (i) modernizing the legislative and
regulatory framework and strengthening institutional capacity; (ii) rationalizing budget
preparation; (iii) strengthening budget execution; and (iv) increasing transparency through
improved internal and external controls. The World Bank funded Economic Governance
Technical Assistance Grant supports the implementation of those reforms. As the ongoing PFM
Action Plan is coming to an end, the preparation of a new Action Plan for 2014-17 is planned to
be completed by June 2013. The latter will build on the findings of the ongoing 2012 PEFA
Assessment and serve as a platform for donors to harmonize and coordinate their interventions in
this area.
3.6   The government has adopted policies aiming at improving economic management
and creating a business climate that is supportive of private sector development. The
government has initiated a set of reforms on the doing business agenda to address critical binding
constraints to growth. This is done through the development of IFC's small business edge
initiative, development of leasing as a financing tool for SMEs, and support to alternative
business dispute resolution mechanisms. The government is aware of the central role of power
sector's poor performance (unreliability of supply and difficulty in obtaining connection) as a
key binding constraint to growth. As regards international and intra-island connectivity, it has
sought support for the development of a fiber optic program along with the launch of its
privatization program for Comoros Telecom.
3.7   The first annual progress report (APR) on the implementation of the PRGSP
candidly recognizes that advances were generally modest when compared with the
ambitious objectives set out in the strategy. This APR was completed in mid-2011. It reports
that results were broadly below the authorities' expectations, especially with respect to weak
recovery in economic growth, political governance, women's inclusion in the labor force, and
infant mortality rates. According to the APR, important constraints to the strategy's
12


﻿implementation were insufficient coordination among implementing government departments
and entities, insufficient monitoring and limited absorptive capacity.
3.8   The Government issued the second APR early in October 2012. The political
transition between the December 2010 elections and the appointment of the new cabinet in mid-
2011 both account in part for the weaker than expected outcomes presented in the first APR. In
this context, corrective actions are being taken by the authorities to address weaknesses during
the PRGSP implementation, including feedback received from development partners that
stressed the importance of (i) better alignment with agreed macroeconomic and structural reform
objectives, (ii) improving the quality, timeliness and coverage of socio-demographic and
macroeconomic data, (iii) stronger role of civil society in monitoring the strategy's
implementation, and (iv) strengthening of collaboration with donors. With a view to make the
strategy more operational, with AfDB support, the authorities have prepared a revised action
plan for the PRGSP the implementation of which began in the second half of 2011, with
technical and financial support from development partners.
4. SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM
A. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS
4.1   This operation was prepared in close collaboration and coordination with the IMF
and other donors providing budget support, notably the African Development Bank (AfDB),
the European Commission (EC), the Government of France and with the Arab Funds which
together account for the bulk of donor support to Comoros. Donors routinely exchange
information and coordinate missions to ensure congruency of policies and maximize aid
effectiveness. In June 2012, the IMF has completed the third review of the Three-Year
Arrangement under the ECF. The AfDB is providing support through a capacity building and
technical assistance project (for an estimated amount of US$8.5 million) and direct budget
support (for an amount of about US$1.5 million) is expected to be approved by November -2012.
Development partners are also coordinating the delivery of technical assistance.
B. RELATIONSHIP TO THE OTHER BANK'S OPERATIONS
4.2   This operation is an integral part of the ISN and is a key component of a broader
package of assistance." The proposed DPO is closely related to the IDA-supported Economic
Governance Technical Assistance (EGTA) operation that was designed in consultation with the
other donors active in Comoros to ensure complementarities, and reflects the Bank's
comparative advantage in areas of public financial management and civil service reform. The
EGTA project, approved in December 2010, is likely to be supplemented during FY13. In
addition, a planned energy project will also be assisting the authorities to tackle selected issues,
mostly related to the commercial performance of the state-owned public utility (MAMWE). The
governance reforms in the fisheries sector supported under this DPO will help leverage the
Indian Ocean regional fishery initiative to benefit the Comoros. Comoros has benefitted from the
regional Communications Infrastructure Program. The World Bank-financed Community
Development Support Project (CDSP) supports social protection initiatives mainly through cash-
for-work activities, and played an important role in the recovery and reconstruction process from
the recent floods, which affected the country in April 2012. A joint UNDP-World Bank project
13


﻿which is financed through a grant from The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery
(GFDRR) will support the institutional set-up and the mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction
into national sector specific policies through the implementation of the new Platform on Disaster
and Climate Change Adaptation. The Statistical Capacity Building Fund will support the
institutional set-up of the National Statistics Office and will help to support the implementation
of the national strategy of statistics.
C. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
4.3    The design of the proposed operation drew on a number of analytical pieces on
fragility and conflict. These include the Africa Region Research Paper on "Avoiding Fragility
Trap in Africa", a review of DPOs in fragile environments and the World Development Report
2011 on Conflict and Fragility. Three core findings from this body of analytical background
were of special relevance to the preparation of the proposed operation in the specific context of
the Comoros: (i) the importance of transparency in the use of public resources, among other
things to build trust among the actors, (ii) early wins on social and economic developments to
support the momentum of stability, and (iii) continuity in support to reforms, despite the risks
and possible temporary setbacks, with a focus on politically and capacity feasible but credible
actions that build on prior achievements.
4.4    Specific planks of the operation's design also drew on country-specific analytical
work and findings from ongoing technical assistance in the Comoros. These include, in the
PFM area, the 2007 Public Expenditure and Financial Assessment (PEFA); and a the Debt
Management Performance Assessment report completed and disclosed in June 2012, as well as
lessons from the diagnostic and dialogue supported by trust funded (LICUS and IDF) technical
assistance in 2006 and 2008, respectively. With regard to civil service reform, the policy
dialogue benefited from a 2005 diagnostic of the civil service wage bill and EGTA-funded recent
analytical support to the development of integrated civil service management software. A
Political Economy analysis on civil service recruitment was completed in August 2012,
highlighting the importance of transparency in recruitments and wages to underpin efforts to
improve HR and wage bill control against the background of inter-island conflicts over shared
public resources. This analysis also underscored the role of the media on the demand side of
transparency. In the Energy sector, a short and medium term Diagnostic and Sector Review of
the power and petroleum sectors was undertaken with Bank support and completed in August
2012, along with a political economy analysis of governance issues in the power sector. These
studies were coordinated with a long term Energy Sector Study funded by the EU, to be
completed by November 2012.
4.5    The Bank, in coordination with other development partners and the government,
has launched a program of economic and sector work to identify constraints to growth. A
long period of limited support to the country in its difficult political context had translated into
several knowledge gaps, and efforts have been launched to address these. These include (i) a
PER on Public Investment whose objective is to provide the government with core advice on
how to improve the transparency and integration of donor-financed projects and programs in the
country regular budget; (ii) a trust-funded analytical work program on the political economy of

﻿reforms in Comoros, focusing on civil service recruitment and energy issues, to enrich policy
dialogue and inform reform design in these areas; (iii) a broader program of analytical work on
growth, including a Growth Diagnostic on Comoros is being finalized, a policy note on energy is
at its final stage, and policy notes on fisheries, tourism, agriculture, transport and connectivity, as
well as a special focus on the role of remittances, are expected to be completed in FY13.
Building on the findings and recommendations generated by the policy notes, a policy note on
intermediate sources of growth will also be prepared to provide a road map of priority actions
aimed at stepping up growth, employment and poverty reduction. The sector piece on tourism is
complementary with a regional analytical work on tourism. Finally, a new PEFA will be
prepared in late 2012, with AfDB funding.
D. LESSONS LEARNED
4.6   Donor coordination is important in a politically-fragile environment. Like the
previous operation, this proposed DPO integrates some of the key insights and recommendations
of the Paris Declaration (2005) and Accra Agenda for Action (2008). Both echoed the calls of
client countries for aid vehicles in fragile states that would lower transaction costs on-and
increase ownership by-recipient governments. This mechanism of coordination is translated at
the sector level such as in the public financial management (involving the IMF, the World Bank,
the AfDB, the EU and the French) and energy sector (involving a joint policy dialogue with the
AfDB, the World Bank and the EU).
4.7   Ensuring successful implementation    of the reform    program   needs strong
Government leadership and communication. Critical reforms (energy, public sector
performance, SOE reforms) in Comoros are politically, economically and technically difficult. In
addition, the cost of reforms are significant and gains are slow to come or hard to see. The scale
of the task is huge, technical and managerial capacity is limited, and vested interests may oppose
reforms. The recent ICR on the June 2010 DPO shows that strong political leadership and
commitment is key to sustain the reform process and its ownership at the Union and Islands
level. It also emphasizes the critical importance of implementing an active communication
strategy to mobilize public support.
4.8   The previous DPO has demonstrated the importance of complementarities with
timely technical assistance. The Bank-financed Economic Governance Technical Assistance
project provided key support to the implementation of the reform agenda carried out under the
first DPO, especially in the areas of public financial management and civil service reforms
(LOFE, civil service census and others). The AfDB Institutional Development Project and other
donors' assistance that focuses on tax administration, public procurement, debt management and
other issues complemented the Bank's assistance.
4.9   Filling knowledge gaps through analytical work remains essential. The Bank study
on the political economy of civil service and energy reforms demonstrates the complexity and
challenges posed by important reforms that Comoros is determined to carry on and appropriately
informed the design of the DPO being proposed.
15


﻿5.    THE PROPOSED GRANT
A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION
5.1   The proposed stand-alone development operation, in the amount of US$5 million
equivalent, supports the government's reform program. The operation is designed to foster
public sector transparency and accountability, with a particular focus on the budget and the
management of the civil service. It will also help advance the government's anti-corruption
strategy and promote transparency in the government issuance of rights to exploit the country's
fisheries sector, one of its most important economic activities. It also aims to help alleviate
economic and social vulnerability by (i) taking steps to improve energy sector performance,
helping to mitigate one of the main sources of risks to the private sector, and, (ii), given
Comoros' exposure to natural disaster risks, support the shift from a response-oriented approach
to disaster risk management towards a preparedness-oriented approach by fostering
governmental cooperation at the national and regional (island) level. In several of these areas, the
operation builds on the momentum of the HIPC process and supports specific implementation
steps going beyond HIPC triggers. Financing under the operation will support continued efforts
toward fiscal stabilization and improved public service delivery, while facilitating progress on
implementing the new fiscal framework for the country.
5.2   The Development Objective of this DPO is to strengthen state transparency and
accountability. The reforms supported by this operation are structured around two broad policy
pillars: (i) Fostering public transparency and accountability, covering PFM, civil service
management, anti-corruption and fisheries; and (ii) Addressing economic and social vulnerability
emanating from weak performance in the energy sector and weak natural disaster risk
management. These policy clusters support the implementation of key reforms spelled out in four
of the six pillars of the country's PRGSP. This section describes the policies being supported by
the DPO, the associated challenges facing the government, and the actions already taken in each
area. This information is also provided in a policy matrix in Annex 1.
5.3   Prior actions. The World Bank, in coordination with other development partners, is
supporting the government's efforts to implement its economic governance reform program.
Table 5.1 provides a summary of the prior actions undertaken for this grant operation as well as
possible next steps in each policy area. The rationale for the proposed prior actions is that they
focus on key issues of the reform agenda covered by this DPO.

﻿Box 1: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
Principle 1 - Reinforce ownership. The reform agenda underpinning the proposed operation is
anchored on the country's PRGSP which was prepared through a broadly participatory and consultative
process and adopted in September 2009. The proposed operation supports a reform program, which was
designed jointly with the authorities, and reflects their needs and implementation capacity.
Moreover the proposed operation is fully consistent with the Government's PFM Strategy and
associated Action Plan for 2010-12. Bank-funded political economy analysis, which has informed
policy formulation, involved further consultation exercises.
Principle 2 - Agree in advance with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework. The accountability framework (i.e., policy matrix) for measuring progress
has been discussed with key government entities (Vice President responsible for Economy and Finance,
Vice President of Energy, Environment and Fisheries, CREF, HACS, DGFOP, CNLPC and DGPSC)
involved in the program at the Union level.
The operation has been prepared in coordination with other development partners providing budget
support and/or technical assistance, notably the IMF, the AfDB, the European Commission and France.
Principle 3 - Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances. The operation is consistent with findings of the Africa Region research on "Avoiding
Fragility Trap in Africa" and the Bank's principles for engagement in fragile states, notably by focusing
its support in tandem on state capacity and accountability building. The modality of the operation
(budget support) responds to the country's urgent financial needs.
Principle 4 - Choose only actions critical to achieve results as conditions for disbursement. Prior
actions and measures for additional budget support focus on key steps to strengthen core state functions
and accountability - notably public finance and personnel management systems, governance and anti-
corruption, economic governance of fisheries and energy sectors, and disaster risk management - and
will also contribute to strengthening Union-Island relations and diffusing political tensions.
Principle 5 - Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-
based financial support. As noted, the operation was prepared in coordination with other development
partners. Discussions have taken place to agree on sharing of information and coordination of missions
to ensure coherence of interventions and maximize aid effectiveness.
B. POLICY AREAS
Bi. PILLAR 1: FOSTERING PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY
Improving public financial management
5.4     In response to the weaknesses identified in various economic sector works, the
Government has adopted the 2010-12 Public Financial Management Strategy articulated
around four pillars: (i) modernizing the legislative and regulatory framework and strengthening
institutional capacity; (ii) rationalizing budget preparation; (iii) strengthening budget execution;
and (iv) increasing transparency through improved internal and external controls. In 2011/2012,
a significant effort was done by the authorities to implement the reforms with the support of the
Bank funded Economic Governance Technical Assistance Grant. These efforts led to an
improvement in the implementation of key pillars of the reforms, including the legislative and
19


﻿institutional framework and budget execution processes. Satisfactory progress was achieved in
the implementation of the 2010-12 PFM Action Plan (see Annex 2). The government is
preparing for a new PFM reform strategy for the period 2014-2017 that is aiming at
consolidating the gains made during the previous strategy.
5.5   Recent efforts have led to an improvement in the legislative and institutional
framework. In August 2012, the National Assembly has adopted the Public Financial
Management Bill (Loi des Op6rations Financieres de l'Etat). The Constitutional Amendment
approved by popular referendum on May 17, 2009 made it necessary to develop a broad
consensus on a revised and implementable legal and institutional framework of public finances,
because it reasserted some core federal prerogatives and restricted the extent of decentralized
competencies, without however calling the islands' autonomy into question. In view of the
country's history of political tensions related to the inter-governmental budget transfers, the Bill
was adopted after a broad consultative process involving the President of the Comoros,
representatives of autonomous islands, and key senior civil servants of the public administration.
It was imperative to define a clear and transparent fiscal relationship between the islands and the
federal state.
5.6   The new PFM Law represents a significant improvement as it provides more clarity
in the roles and responsibility of the federal government and autonomous islands in the
management and accountability of public finances. It aims at modernizing the management of
public finances, by defining basic rules, including (i) transparency rules applicable to the
presentation of budget documents and budget reports (budget preparation and execution,
timetables, budget classification, budget reporting formats and periodicity to Parliament, etc.);
(ii) the principle of sincerity; and (iii) employment ceilings by ministry with dispositions
according to which recruitments and promotions will have to respect both the employment
ceilings of ministries and the annual budgetary allocation for personnel expenditures in each
ministry. The Law also aims at introducing gradually the principles of performance and results-
based budgeting, and transition toward the adoption of program budgeting. Despite this
significant improvement in the legal and institutional framework for public financial
management, there remain significant challenges. The most important challenge is to ensure a
full implementation of the newly adopted law. The Government is taking steps in this direction,
including (i) creating a new directorate of public accounting and treasury, and (ii) producing and
publishing budget execution data.
5.7   The Government has created a new Directorate of Public Accounting and Treasury
and has appointed by decree the new General Director of Public Accounting and Treasury.
The Decree on the General Directorate of Public Accounting and Treasury (Direction G6n6rale
de la Comptabilit6 Publique et du Tr6sor - DGCPT) was adopted by the Government in February
2012. The creation of the DGCTP addresses issues such as the lack of centralization of public
accounts and the lack of clear distinction between the accounting functions of the Union and its
responsibility to oversee the country's accounting network. The new organization of the
Treasury is structured around a General Director of Public Accounting and Treasury who
exercises his authority over all personnel, including public accountants. The new organization
also gives the General Paymaster of the Union of Comoros responsibility for managing the single
treasury account at the Central Bank, centralizing all operations of senior accountants and
producing the General Accounts of the Financial Administration (Compte G6n6ral de
l'Administration et des Finances). All other accounts held by various departments and
20


﻿administrations will be managed under the sole responsibility of a public accountant who will
report to the Accountant General. Paymasters of the islands are now working as secondary
accountants and reporting to the General Paymaster. The effective implementation of this
Treasury reform is underway and the authorities of Comoros have appointed the Director
General and confirmed the General Paymaster of the Union in his position. The appointment of
the Treasurers of the Autonomous Islands is expected to be completed before end of 2012. As
the new DGCTP becomes operational and its capacity is increased, it will start preparing and
disclosing, on a quarterly basis, a consolidated TOFE (Tableaux des Operations Financires de
l'ttat) covering the Union and the islands operations.
5.8   The Government has improved transparency in the management of public finances
by producing and publishing quarterly budget execution reports. The Government of the
Comoros publishes the annual budget document in the Official Gazette.9 A budget committee
also meets every quarter to discuss and adopt cash flow plans and forecasts, and review and
approve budget execution reports. Quarterly budget execution reports of the last quarter of 2011,
the first quarter and the second quarter of 2012 were published in the website of the Policy
Coordination Unit (CREF) of the Ministry of Finance (www.cref-comores.org). Until recently,
the budget execution reports did not include data on public spending in social sectors and were
not made publicly available. The budget execution report for the second quarter now includes in
its annex detailed information of the social spending. Moreover, the Ministry of Finance will
issue a ministerial Circular that gives instructions for the regular quarterly publication of budget
execution reports. Similar efforts are being made to increase accountability in the management of
public finances. In line with the new PFM Law stipulations, the 2011 budget execution law
(Project de Loi de Reglement) is being finalized by the Government and is expected to be
transmitted, by end of June 2013, to the Chamber of Accounts for review and subsequent
approval by the Parliament.
5.9   Despite these improvements in the implementation of the PFM    Strategy, there
remain significant challenges. These include lack of integrated financial management
information system, weaknesses in the internal and external control systems, and lack of
legislative oversight.
*    Financial management information      system. Comoros' financial management
information systems are fragmented and outdated, except for the recently implemented
ASYCUDA++ for customs operations and the software applications for wage bill calculation and
external debt. The Bank, through the Economic Governance Technical Assistance project, is
supporting the enhancement of the public financial management information systems, including
(i) the development of a computerization master plan that will take stock of existing applications,
analyze linkages between the various components of the public financial architecture and
propose practical solutions adapted to the Comorian context; and (ii) the implementation of a
financial management information system for budget preparation, execution, accounting and
financial reporting. This ambitious program is expected to be implemented in a phased approach.
During the first phase, the Bank is funding the master plan that will include the technical and
functional specifications of the new system as well as the implementation plan. The second
phase will consist of the acquisition and roll out of the new system. This Integrated Financial

﻿Management Information System (IFMIS) will increase efficiency, internal controls, security of
data management, and comprehensive financial reporting.
*    Internal audits. The General Inspectorate of Finance (IGF) and the Accounts Verification
Committee (CVC) carry out internal audit functions in line ministries and other institutions,
including Tax and Customs. IGF has carried out controls in some ministries and government
agencies, including the Moroni Airport Authority. However, IGF has very limited resources to
fulfill its mandate. Besides, IGF and CVC are conducting their audits with no coordination. This
duplication of effort limits the effectiveness of internal audits, especially in a country with scarce
human, technical, and financial resources. The African Development Bank (AfDB) is supporting
the improvements of internal audit functions through the development of an audit strategy, a risk
based audit approach, and capacity strengthening of the auditors.
*    External audit and legislative oversight. The Audit Bench of the Supreme Court created
by organic Law No. 5-12/AU of 27 June 2005 has statutory jurisdiction on external control. This
Court comprises 3 divisions, including the Accounts Division. However, this external
verification institution is not yet operational. Thus, it is the Accounts Auditing Commission
(CVC), created by Order No. 7/CE of 5 April 2000 and placed under the direct authority of the
Head of State, which plays the role of Supreme Audit Institution. In that capacity, the CVC has
since 2005 verified the 2005, 2006, and 2007 Budget Laws and submitted the reports to
Parliament. While this submission addresses partially the issues of audit backlogs, it increases
the confusion on the roles and responsibilities of CVC and the Audit bench of the Supreme
Court. To address these challenges and establish an effective independent supreme audit
institution, the AfDB in coordination with the Government is conducting various studies,
including the review the current status and functions of the CVC with view of providing more
clarity in the external audit functions and increasing their capacity.

Improving public sector efficiency and accountability
5.10  Comoros' civil service wage bill still weighs on the Government's limited resources.
This largely reflects a disorderly process of decentralization agreed in 2001 to resolve tensions
between the Union and the islands. At the time, most central administrative entities were simply
duplicated in each autonomous island (with the Union and each island having a President,
Cabinet and National Assembly). The civil service roster doubled to about 12,000 in the period
1999 to 2008 and the wage bill increased from 6.2 percent to 9 percent of GDP. In 2009, civil
service wages and salary expenditures claimed about 65 percent of domestic revenues. Not
surprisingly, roles and responsibilities became blurred; wage arrears accumulated, staff morale
plummeted and poor quality services are being provided to the population.
5.11  The Government has taken steps towards a more structured and formal system to
regulate recruitment and payment processes in its civil service. The authorities conducted a
civil service census from June through October of 2011, and have made significant progress in
finalizing the data and making systematic use of it in the GISE, the government's computerized
wage payment system implemented in 2010. Since July 2011, most civil service wages are paid
through GISE. The census also provides the basis for an orderly implementation of the civil
service reform. This will inter alia entail implementation of the organic frameworks ("cadres
organiques"), including organigrams and staffing of all ministries, aimed at streamlining the civil
service and making the wage bill consistent with a sustainable medium term fiscal framework.
5.12  The authorities are now in a position to leverage the availability of GISE, to bring
greater transparency and accountability to recruitment and payroll. The first step towards
more transparency is the timely and frequent public dissemination of Government recruitment
and salaries' payments data at the Union and Island levels. In this regard, it has prepared and
disclosed in the government website www.cref-comores.org an exhaustive and detailed list of
civil servants per department at the union and at the islands level, on a monthly basis, covering
the period of July to August 2012. It also includes detailed wage bill data and information on
recruitment by gender. These GISE-generated reports provide updated information on the
situation on wage payments and arrears, with the same level of breakdown, and allow identifying
all changes in staffing due to factors such as recruitment, retirement, death, and transfers within
different entities. The goal is to provide all decision makers, and the general public, with access
to this information, thus promoting public information and debate surrounding these critical
issues. Moreover, open dissemination of the data will set the foundation for enhanced dialogue
and trust-building between the Island and Union governments, by allowing them to collectively
track each other's progress towards improved wage bill management and negotiate the necessary
steps forward.
5.13  The government is also determined to move forward with the civil service reform
agenda. In this regard, following the conclusion of the cleanup of the GISE data base, the
23


﻿authorities are determined to ensure the integrity of the payroll and personnel database systems
through sound data input controls and enforcement of the use of a unique employee reference
number (numero d'immatriculation). With a view to consolidate recent gains on establishing
GISE the authorities are committed to adopt the appropriate legal text to enforce GISE as the
sole system to pay salaries of civil servants and other public employees, and adopt a procedures
manual applicable to all levels of government to strengthen the regulation of human resource
management and rules of compensation.
5.14  These steps will need to be complemented with continued efforts at building internal
consensus and gaining trust among parties. Political economy analytical work suggests that, to
address the heretofore largely 'black box' of excess recruitment, greater public debate,
transparency and open negotiation between the Union and Islands governments is necessary. The
recent census of the civil service revealed that far more recruitment of civil servants had taken
place in recent years than previously estimated, especially within Island governments. Moreover,
the current fiscal framework, which allows each Island government to retain some control on
local recruitment under agreed budgetary ceilings, necessitates a close coordination and active
participation in decisions related to management of the wage bill by entities at the Union and
Island levels.
Proposed prior action:
*    The Recipient has prepared and disclosed on a public website or in a newspaper of
national coverage, at least one bi-monthly report covering the period from July to August 2012
on recruitments (each including an update on wage payments and arrears and otherwise in form
and substance satisfactory to the Association) in the central and Autonomous Islands'
governments, by ministry and commissariat and by gender.
Next step:
*    The government will adopt the appropriate legal text to enforce GISE as the sole system to
pay salaries of civil servants and other public employees, and adopt a procedures manual
applicable to all levels of government to strengthen the regulation of human resource
management and rules of compensation.
Strengthening governance and anti-corruption
5.15  The National Anticorruption Commission was established on August 25, 2011, and
its key members designated shortly thereafter. On July 25, 2008, Parliament adopted a law
establishing the Commission Nationale de Prevention et de Lutte contre la Corruption (CNLPC).
This law was promulgated by Presidential decree in June 2011. The promulgation of the law is a
step in the right direction, because Comoros continues to rank poorly (in the 26.3 percentile) in
the rating for Control of Corruption, part of the Worldwide Governance Indicators.10 The law
establishes the CNLPC and defines its mandate, composition and prerogatives. It also establishes
various forms of corruption offences to be incorporated into the Penal Code, and prescribes the
corresponding criminal sanctions. The CNLPC is responsible for implementation of the national
strategy to combat corruption. It conducts investigations, acts as an advisory body and makes
recommendations for reforms, wherever appropriate. It also sensitizes the public on the adverse
0nhttp://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi
24


﻿consequences of corruption and mobilizes support to combat it in all its forms. The CNLPC has
the authority to collect, file and analyze declarations of assets. The CNLPC is responsible for
submitting an annual report on its activities to the President and to the National Assembly.
5.16   The law establishes the obligation on the part of certain specified categories of
senior officials and heads of institutions to declare their assets on an annual basis. The law
makes it an offence on the part of any public or elected official or head of a public enterprise to
be in possession of assets that he/she cannot adequately account for. Under this provision, the
burden of proof shifts on to the interested party to demonstrate that the impugned assets were
legally acquired. Moreover, the law makes it an offence for any person who is required to submit
a declaration of assets and fails to do so, or submits a declaration that is incomplete, inaccurate
or false.
5.17   The President has signed the decree on declaration of assets in September 2012. The
list of officials targeted by the draft decree is quite exhaustive: it includes the President, elected
officials, judges and magistrates, as well as heads of institutions." It is anticipated that the
CNLPC code of ethics now under preparation will incorporate such a requirement on the part of
members to declare their assets. The declaration is in two parts. One part focuses on the assets of
the author of the declaration, as well as those of his/her spouse and dependent children. This part
of the declaration is subject to stringent confidentiality rules and does not open to disclosure
except at the request of the author or on the order of the competent judicial or parliamentary
authorities. The second part of the declaration focuses on financial interests and is solely
designed to prevent conflicts of interest. The declaration is required on an annual basis, and is
due within three months of appointment to a prescribed office. In the case of officials who are
already in office at the time of the entry into force of the decree, the declaration is due within
three months of the date of the decree. However, the effective implementation of the provision of
the decree will also require significant capacity building effort of the National Anti-Corruption
commission.
5.18   The government of Comoros has adopted the national strategy to combat
corruption in September 2012. The adoption of a national strategy to combat corruption along
with the internal rules of the CNLPC and the code of ethics is key to step up the fight against
corruption. To its credit, the CNLPC has already completed its investigation into five separate
complaints involving various enterprises and agencies, the results of which have been forwarded
to the judicial authorities for action. To date the judicial authorities have not acted on any of
those cases. The internal rules governing the procedures and practices of the CNLPC, as well as
the code of ethics are still work in progress. The CNLPC is counting on donors and other
external partners to assist it both in terms of training and equipment support in its new role.
Proposed prior action:
*    The recipient has adopted a decree requiring key officials to submit an annual asset
declaration under conditions which strike a balance between individual rights to privacy and the
overriding need to access information relevant to combating corruption and avoiding conflicts of
interest.
One notable omission from the list, which should be remedied, is the CNLPC itself and, more particularly, its members who
are not required to submit a declaration.
25


﻿Next step:
*     The adoption of a national strategy to combat corruption, along with the internal rules of
the CNLPC and the code of ethics.
Strengthening the economic governance of the fisheries sectors
5.19   The fisheries sector, fishing and value chains activities, is a major pillar of
Comoros's economy. Comoros enjoys an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of 70 times the size
of the country's land area and straddles the important tuna fishing grounds at the mouth of the
Mozambique Channel. All coastal countries of the South West Indian Ocean (SWIO) share the
tuna fisheries, and they are the region's most valuable fish resource. As the tuna is fished
predominantly by countries from outside the SWIO and no landing takes place in Comoros,
opportunities for economic growth, employment and value added, based on tuna, are currently
largely consisting in the payment made to the Government for access of foreign vessels to the
national waters and their resources.
5.20   Lack of transparency and monitoring of fishing agreements, licenses and related
revenues undermines the sector's governance.12 The tuna fisheries sector is an important
source of public revenues and financial transfers. Comoros has currently three fishing
agreements in force, but none of these agreements (with the exception of the European Union
one) or information about the related fishing licenses, or any other private fishing licenses, and
payments are made systematically available to the public.
5.21   Systematic disclosure of fishing agreements, licenses and related revenues would
contribute to a better monitoring by the public sector and stakeholders. Such disclosure may
have several benefits including (i) more transparency and accountability toward the owners of
the resources, i.e., the people of the Comoros, and as such avoid civil society's misconception or
suspicion about the content of the agreements, access granted and benefits extracted, (ii) support
for setting up civil society and stakeholders participation in the debate on efficient allocation of
access to fisheries, best use of Comoros's and regional fisheries resources and their sustainable
management, and sound policy design, and (iii) support a level playing field for the operators in
the sector, for the fishing agreements' signatories and the neighboring coastal States. Such
improvement could also secure public revenue collection, deter corruption perception, curb
illegal fishing and gradually optimize resource rents.
5.22   Some of the existing agreements may have confidentiality clauses and therefore
cannot be disclosed, prior to the consent of concerned parties. The authorities have
undertaken an inventory of the existing agreements and requested authorization from relevant
parties to disclose the agreements, subject to written consent of the parties. With a view to
improve transparency, the authorities have disclosed on the a Government website http://cref-
comores.org/pubs/Protocoles/ and soon in a national newspaper, the contents (including
12 The reforms supported by the proposed DPO in the area of fisheries follow the World Bank's experience in supporting the
disclosure of fishing licenses information in various African countries (e.g. Madagascar, Gabon, Liberia and Senegal). Disclosure
has had a transformational impact in Madagascar, turning fisheries in the main non-tax revenue for the Government and one of
the few sectors reporting non-tax revenue in the budget. In Gabon, the fisheries administration fully endorsed the disclosure
measure in order to fulfill accountability obligation and combat suspicion of corruption. The measure also indirectly supports
better regional collaboration and dialogue since neighboring countries can access the information and evaluate potential presence
of non-licensed vessels in their own waters.
26


﻿payments) of all existing fishing agreements and fishing licenses issued (foreign and nationals, in
the context of a fishing agreement or not) which were in force in the previous 12 months and
which have no confidentiality provisions, or which have confidentiality provisions but for which
written authorization to disclose by the necessary parties have been obtained. Agreements or
licenses with confidentiality provisions will be only listed.
5.23   Going forward, disclosure will continue every six months and, for all new fishing
agreements and fishing licenses issued, the authorities will systematically include in each
new agreement and licenses, a provision of mandatory disclosure of their contents on a
Government website and major national newspaper. For this purpose the Government will enact,
by June 2013, a legal text (arrte) that mandates a systematic public disclosure of new fishing
agreements or issuance of fishing licenses, no later than six months after signature of said
agreement or issuance of the license. This measure would pave the way for the implementation
of a resolution recently adopted by the members of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC),
the regional tuna fisheries management organization, of which Comoros is a full member. To be
compliant, the IOTC members will have to disclose, by July 2013 at the latest, the fishing
agreements in force in their countries.
5.24   Implementing these measures has already allowed better public knowledge of the
fishing access granted and revenues generated. The Government confirmed the nonexistence
of confidential fishing agreement and subsequently disclosed three agreements and license
details including catch fees13 paid under the European Union's agreement. Two agreements,
related license fees and catch fees received were previously unknown to the public. Such
disclosure will support discussion on access allocation and fee value, and participate to a
regional effort to promote transparency within the sector, since Seychelles and Mozambique
agreed to disclose similar information.
Proposed prior action:
*    Subject to the Recipient's pre-existing confidentiality obligations, the Recipient  has
disclosed the list of all fishing agreements and all fishing licenses in force during the previous
twelve months, including for each agreement and license, information in form and substance
satisfactory to the Association, on its cumulated duration and all related fees paid per category
and access regime. The public disclosure has taken place on a public website and in a
newspaper of national coverage.
Next step:
*     Legal text (i.e., arr6t6) is adopted by June 2013, at the latest, that mandates full systematic
disclosure of fishing agreement and license information.
13 In the frame of EU fishing agreement, catch fees are either paid by the European Commission and the ship-owners when
catches are above the reference tonnage set, respectively, in the Agreement or the license. Consequently payments take place
after the fishing season, unlike license fee payment.
27


﻿B2. PILLAR 2: ADDRESSING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL VULNERABILITY
Improving reliable availability of electricity
5.25 Unreliable electricity supply is a major source of vulnerability and a significant
constraint to Comoros' economic development. Provision of electricity services in Comoros
has deteriorated significantly over the last few years. The situation is especially challenging in
the Islands of Grand Comoros and Moheli that are supplied by the state-owned enterprise
MAMWE. Electricity generation and distribution in the Island of Anjouan is under the
responsibility of different company EDA, also an SOE, which has a better track record.
Electricity supply in the capital Moroni is very unreliable, with six hours of planned interruption
of service each day, and frequent unplanned load shedding. The situation is much worse in the
rest of the Island of Grand Comores: for the last couple of years, users there have only benefited
from five hours of supply once every three days. In Moheli, power availability is slightly better
with 12 to 18 hours per day, but available only to a very small number of clients.
5.26   The impact of the present situation with regard to socio-economic vulnerability is
three-fold: (i) small businesses who cannot afford very costly individual generators lose as much
as five hours of production daily due to idling of electricity powered equipment, but continue to
bear fixed production costs during power cuts. According to the local Chamber of Commerce,
seven businesses closed down last year because of unreliable power supply. Random power cuts
affecting refrigeration facilities make the fisheries sector highly vulnerable to power supply
unreliability; (ii) the quality of social services, particularly health services supplied by small
health facilities outside of Moroni which cannot afford individual generators, is highly
vulnerable to power supply interruptions which affect refrigeration, indeed, but also sterilization
of instruments and lighting during surgery and child delivery at night; and (iii) long load
shedding or discontinuation of power supply services affect disproportionately vulnerable social
groups in rural and semi-rural areas which are in the lower income brackets and receive
electricity only a few hours a week, if at all. The impact on these vulnerable groups not only in
terms of quality of life, but economic loss due to the impossibility to conserve food14. An indirect
source of vulnerability for Comoros is the increase in fiscal vulnerability originating in the power
sector. MAMWE needs considerable subsidies for 7 billion KMF ($18.7 million) through direct
funding and foregone fiscal revenues, diverting scarce budgetary resources from other priority
uses, including social services.
5.27 The unreliability of supply is mainly due to the inability of MAMWE to run its
generators under normal conditions. The power company has sufficient power generation
capacity (29 MW for a peak demand of less than 11 MW) but MAMWE is unable to run its
generators as needed for lack of fuel, as well as technical unavailability of many units due to lack
of maintenance and spare parts. In May 2012, for example, MAMWE had fuel for only 18 hours
per day for its available units. The population access rate to electricity is high compared to other
African countries, but still only 60 percent in Grande Comores and 20 percent in Moheli. Access
is limited to the higher income segments of the population and does not reach the poor,
particularly considering that the tariff is about $0.34 kWh, the highest in Africa. Overall, the
poor availability of electricity is mainly due to the inability of MAMWE to pay for the fuel and
maintenance of the largely sufficient equipment.
14 Direct interviews with households in rural areas suggest that the loss of food due to lack of power for refrigeration may be in
the range of 10%.
28


﻿5.28  Revenue collected by MAMWE is well below operating costs, and as a result the
utility is heavily dependent on government financial support to purchase fuel. The nominal
power tariff is theoretically sufficient to cover most of operating costs of power generators using
Diesel fuel. The key issue and cause of MAMWE's financial distress, and resulting vulnerability
of Comoros stemming from unreliable power supply, is that only a third of electricity produced
in 2011 was actually paid, not enough to cover even the fuel bill. From the 60 percent of
electricity produced which is billed to consumers, only 60 percent are collected, the remaining 40
percent corresponding to electricity billed, but un-paid. A precondition for putting the sector on a
path to sustainability is to establish payment discipline for electricity services. Such a poor
collection performance is not mainly a technical issue, but one that only significant progress in
management and company governance will help address.
5.29 A significant potential for improving MAMWE's commercial performance exists in
the short term. To this end, the Cabinet has adopted on August 15, 2012 a comprehensive
action plan for reorganization of MAMWE's commercial function. The action plan defines the
actions to be undertaken at operational level, the implementation schedule, the responsibilities
for implementation, as well as the cost of the equipments and services required for
implementation, so as to provide adequate technical documentation to start the process of
determined implementation. The Plan aims at reducing power thefts and non-payments by at
least 1/3 through: (i) the inspection of the distribution system and the disconnection of illegal
connections, with the support of police forces; (ii) the establishment of a commercial system
increasing the accountability of MAMWE staff for the billing and collection of bills in assigned
areas; (iii) the reinforcement of sanctions of delinquent staff; and (iv) the development of an
efficient client database to monitor individual consumption and ensure the integrity of the billing
cycle. The next step will be the timely implementation of the plan and the establishment of an
effective implementation monitoring mechanism.
5.30  A sustained restoration of energy sector performance will require a significant
effort over the long haul. Beyond a restoration of MAMWE's financial health, efforts will be
required on several fronts, including sector policy, such as a clearer redefinition of institutional
roles and functions for policy, planning and regulation, and enterprise governance. Options for
private participation in management and investment, and for shifting to economically feasible
alternative energy sources, such as hydro, thermal, wind and solar power, will need to be
examined but will first require the company to improve its operational and financial performance
from its current very low level.
Proposed prior action:
*      The Recipient (through its Minister responsible for energy) has approved a
comprehensive action plan, in form and substance satisfactory to the Association, for the
reorganization ofMAMWE's commercialfunction.
Next step:
*     Implementation of the plan for reorganization of commercial function of MAMWE and
establishment of progress monitoring mechanism.

﻿Improving coordination of government bodies involved in natural disaster risk prevention and
management
5.31   Being widely exposed to several known hazards and natural disasters makes the
Comoros one of the most vulnerable countries in Africa. At present, there is no formal
national policy on disaster risk reduction in the Comoros. Tropical cyclones, excessive rainfall
leading to major landslide events, and the presence of an active volcano, the Karthala, on the
main island of Grand Comoros pose a permanent risk to the country. Climate change will also
increase exposure to these risks, as probable rising sea levels will lead to coastal erosion and
potentially increase coastal flooding on all three islands. As a result, the country's development
and long-term socioeconomic growth expectations should deserve support according to the
World Bank Strategy and Global Strategy Guidance on Vulnerability and Resilience for the
Africa Region.
5.32 Vulnerability and resilience are already addressed in key policy instruments. The
government has recognized the importance of disaster risk reduction policies and programs to the
ongoing development of the country. Indeed, Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) has become a
major preoccupation for national authorities since the elaboration of the national multi-sector
plan for disaster preparedness and emergency response, first developed in 2004. It is now an
integral part of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy Paper (PRGSP) adopted in 2009.
Box 2: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
Floods, as in early in 2012, have been a frequent source of shocks on the economy and the poor, even if their
macroeconomic impacts have so far been limited. According to the Government and Sector Group estimates
(May 8, 2012) almost 65,000 people (8 percent of the total population) have been directly affected by recent
floods. An additional 80,000 people in Moroni and 3,900 in Mitsoudje were indirectly affected by the broken
water pumps that supply water to these communities. Food security remains a high priority to ensure that
affected farmers are supported in areas where up to 80 percent of crops have been lost due to the flooding.
The Karthala volcano has also intensified its level of activity in the past few years, registering four major
eruptions from 2005 to 2007, compared to an average of an eruption every eleven years recorded over the past
200 years. The one in 2005, affected more than 10,000 persons in the south of Grande Comores who had to be
displaced in various safe places.
The Natural Disaster Hotspot reports estimate that 39.6 percent of Comoros' land area is exposed to natural
disaster risk, and 32 percent of the population lives in these areas. In addition, recent national information
campaigns state that sea levels will rise at the rate of 4mm per year - totaling 20cm - over the next 50 years,
over twice the rate observed over the last 100 years. Annual average temperatures should reach 28.C by 2050.
The potential impact of these changes could have a major effect on livelihoods on the islands, as these are
largely based on agriculture and fisheries. Up to 10 percent of the coastal population could be displaced, due to
erosion and contamination of coastal water tables by sea water. Malaria rates may also rise. Coastal
infrastructure, including much of the road network, could be destroyed. The overall impact is estimated at 220
percent of GDP at 2001 levels.
5.33   The authorities are committed to adopting and implementing a comprehensive
DRM agenda. The Government intends to mainstream disaster risk management into national
policy, by consolidating and completing research into current and future hazard risk, developing
a national DRR policy and a strategy for its implementation and enhancing local capacity on
prevention and preparedness as well as coordination and information management. This strategy
may include legislation, institution building, training, the strengthening of early warning
systems, and other components. The planned activities have been designed on an inter-agency
30


﻿and multi-sector basis, in close collaboration with relevant national authorities and the active
involvement of various stakeholders in the three islands. A similar approach will be followed in
implementation, starting with the creation by ministerial decree (Arretd ministeriel) of a National
Platform for Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) which
takes into account Union and Islands government structures as well as the mandate of the
Direction Gndrale de la Protection et Scuriti Civile. The authorities are committed to further
strengthen the country's capacity in the DRM and CCA area, by preparing an integrated National
Strategy for Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change Adaptation that will include clear
short and medium term provisions to address the impact of disasters and climate change on
social outcomes.
Proposed prior action:
*     Adoption by a Ministerial decree (Arretd ministeriel) the creation of the National Platform
for Disaster Risk Management, inform and substance acceptable to the Association.
Next step:
*     By June 2013, the Government will adopt the National Strategy for Disaster Risk
Management which is proposed by the National Platform.
6. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
6.1   The policy reforms supported by this DPO are expected to have a positive poverty
and social impact. Improvement of public financial management, strengthening of public sector
efficiency and accountability, better governance and declining corruption, removing economic
governance constraints to fisheries and energy sector's development, and addressing disaster
management vulnerabilities have been identified as core objectives under the PRSP. Improved
budgetary and expenditure management will benefit the general public and particularly the poor
through (i) a reduction in leakages and (ii) a greater focus on poverty reducing expenditures.
Increased resources for poverty reduction are expected to be made available through tightened
controls over expenditures and stronger Treasury management, as well as through improved
management of the wage bill and by reducing the duplication of administrative structures and
programs across different levels of government. Moreover the efficiency with which these
resources are allocated toward priority expenditures will be improved through more efficient
tools to track such expenditures in the budget (both ex ante and ex post) and better economic
governance along with anti-corruption. Taken together, improvements in the reform areas
targeted by this DPO should enable the government move forward with implementation of its
PRGSP and focus scarce resources on priority social sector expenditures and disaster risk
management.
6.2   The social impact of MAMWE Commercial Action Plan will involve two main
aspects. The improvement in the collection performance of MAMWE will not affect compliant
consumers, and will reduce subsidies from the Government, allowing public resources to be
better allocated toward developmental spending. Moreover, the improvement in the quality of
power supply resulting from the increased financial capacity of MAMWE will favorably impact
31


﻿individual electricity consumers, foster job creation (as unreliability of power is quoted by
business associations as the main deterrent to business development in Comoros) and improve
the provision of health and education services.
B.    ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
6.3   The proposed operation focuses on institutional reforms with no direct impact on
the environment. The short-term environmental direct or indirect impacts of the proposed
operation are nearly inexistent, as the operation entails no measures that would affect short-term
environmental indicators. Long-term impacts may be more significant and positive, but they will
be contingent on many factors, including capacity and future policy developments. Through
stronger economic governance, especially in the fisheries and energy sectors, the Union and
Island Governments will be able, down the road, to address environmental issues related to risks
of over-fishing or to opportunities for alternative energy sources, a process that has proved
difficult before now. The proposed operation is helping put in place the institutional
fundamentals for disaster risk management that ultimately should yield positive environmental
outcomes.
C.    IMPLEMENTATION MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.4   The Economic and Financial Reforms Unit (CREF) will be responsible for
monitoring reforms, reporting progress and coordinating actions with all ministries and
entities, including at the Island level. The Government will provide quarterly reports to IDA on
implementation progress measured against the agreed reform program, especially the measures
identified as next steps, and achievement of the HIPC Completion Point triggers. Routine
periodic Government reports to track progress in the implementation of the PFM Action Plan for
2010-12 will be shared with the Bank. The overall reform effort will be reviewed by the
Government in close coordination with regular Bank supervision to ensure continued
implementation of the program within an adequate macroeconomic policy framework.
6.5   The Government's Annual Progress Reports on the PRGSP will also be timely
prepared, under the leadership of the Directorate of Planning (Commissariat du Plan), and will
be shared with the Bank. Comoros continues to have a weak national monitoring system. With
the support of its development partners, notably AfDB and the European Commission, the
authorities are strengthening and developing their capacities to design, implement, monitor, and
evaluate their development and poverty reduction strategies.
D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
6.6   The Government has been pursuing a program of public financial management
(PFM) reforms since 2010. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) has demonstrated a strong
commitment to modernize the PFM system and has adopted a PFM Action Plan for 2010-12 to
support the implementation of the PFM Strategy for 2010-19. The PFM action plan is a
comprehensive response by the authorities to address the weaknesses of their PFM system, as
identified by the 2007 PEFA assessment and assessments and recommendations from
development partners, including France, the European Union, the IMF and the World Bank. Key
reforms supported by this DPO draw on this PFM action plan 2010-12. The Government is
committed to carrying out the PFM reform agenda, and has established an Economic and
32


﻿Financial Reforms Unit (CREF) whose role is to (i) oversee and coordinate the PFM reform
action plan; (ii) harmonize and coordinate government actions; (iii) provide guidance and
address policy-related issues; and (iv) hold different actors accountable for progress. The PFM
reform action plan is supported by the Donors' community, including the World Bank and the
African Development Bank, through technical assistance operations addressing the challenges
described in section 5.B.
6.7    Finally, as regards the Central Bank of the Comoros (BCC), satisfactory progress is
being made in implementing recommendations of an IMF Safeguard Assessment (SA)
completed in April 2010. The safeguards assessment found that despite capacity constraints the
Central Bank has taken steps to strengthen its safeguards framework and made additional
recommendations. In this context, the BCC is intensifying efforts to implement International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); its audit charter has been revised to better define the audit
committee's mandate; and a summary report of the central bank's annual financial statements is
regularly posted on its website (http://www.banque-comores.km/), the last one being the Annual
Report for the year 2010, which also includes its auditors' statement. The 2011 Annual Report is
under preparation, with financial statements and audits for 2011 already completed at end-
August 2012.
6.8   Overall, the fiduciary framework is deemed adequate to receive the proceeds of the
grant.
E. DISBURSEMENTS AND AUDITING
6.9   The proposed grant will follow     the Bank's disbursement procedures for
development policy operations. The untied balance of payments/budget support will be
disbursed against satisfactory implementation of the development policy program and will not be
tied to any specific purchases. No procurement requirements are needed. Once the grant is
approved by the Board and becomes effective, and following the Recipient's request for
withdrawal of proceeds of the grant, IDA will disburse the single tranche of SDR 3.3 million
(US$5 million equivalent) into a dedicated account that forms part of the part of the country's
official foreign exchange reserves (held by the Central Bank of the Comoros). This dedicated
account will be established for the purpose of this operation.
6.10  The financial support provided under this operation is not intended to finance goods
or services in the standard negative list. The Recipient shall ensure that upon the deposit of the
grant into said account, an equivalent amount is credited in the Recipient's budget management
system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. The Recipient will report to IDA, by fax or email
within 10 days of the transfer, on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and
credited in local currency to the budget management system. If the proceeds of the grant are used
for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will require the Recipient,
promptly upon notice from IDA, to refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to
IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA upon such request shall be cancelled. Although an audit of the
deposit will not be required, the Bank reserves the right to require audits at any time. The
administration of this grant will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance of the Union.
33


﻿F. RISKS AND MITIGATION
6.11   Political instability. Downside risks to the realization of the proposed ERG's objectives
remain primarily political. Continued progress toward political stability remains the pre-eminent
factor supporting positive medium-term growth prospects and the needed acceleration of
structural reforms. While the country will not have new elections until 2016, fragility in the
political environment remains a challenge. Historically, difficult inter-islands relations over the
use of public resources, against a background of weak governance, structural weaknesses in PFM
and high politicization of civil service management, have been core contributors to the country's
protracted fragility. The Union government is well aware that careful attention to the political
economy of inter-government fiscal tensions, steps to foster trust among the parties, and
continued consensus building are required. Support by the international community for a
constructive dialogue between the Union and Island governments remains imperative, as is
delivering on the assistance that underpins reform implementation.
6.12   Weak capacity of implementing reforms. Weak capacity, eroded further by years of
fragility, is a major issue. The authorities and donors are tackling it by: (i) coordinating and,
when possible, consolidating their interventions; (ii) providing significant parallel technical
assistance and capacity-building interventions; and (iii) focusing the reform agenda in a limited
number of implementable measures. Close dialogue with Bank staff also helps the authorities
address implementation constraints.
6.13   Sustainability of reforms. The HIPC process has been a catalyst for reforms, and there
is a risk of a loss of momentum once the Completion Point is reached. The proposed ERG pushes
the agenda forward with a focus on initiation of specific implementation steps going beyond
HIPC triggers, but this being a stand-alone operation, some operation-specific reforms could be
reversed, including under an unexpected change in the political situation. This said, early results
on recent reforms, including on the fiscal front and the normalization of wage payments, have
lent public support to reforms. Focusing on homegrown reforms and their consolidation
mitigates this risk further, given also that the next elections will take place in 2016. Going
forward, sustained engagement by the Bank, Fund and donors will remain critical in the post-
HIPC period.
6.14   Challenging macroeconomic environment. Though domestic economic developments
hinge critically on continued political stability and improvements in economic management, a
weakening of global economic conditions, especially in the European economies, would also
undermine short- and medium-term prospects. With fiscal stabilization at the center of the short-
term policy agenda and no domestic fiscal space to cushion shocks, the scope for
macroeconomic policy responses would be limited to the availability of adequate and timely
financial support from the donor community.
6.15   Fiduciary risks. These risks are significant and directly mitigated by the focus of the
proposed grant on improvements in fiduciary standards and continued assistance in public
financial management and public administration reforms. An ongoing PEFA assessment will
provide benchmarks against which recent progress in strengthening PFM performance can be
measured, and facilitate the identification of areas in need of additional remedial actions.
34


﻿6.16   Opposition to reforms. Reforms, particularly in PFM, civil service management,
fisheries, SOEs and fighting corruption in weak governance environments such as Comoros,
come with non-negligible political-economic risks. Some localized resistance to reform should
be expected. However, this risk is mitigated in several ways. A focus on transparency is central,
especially to promote the perception of a fair distribution of resources between the Union and the
islands. Technical assistance and dialogue have helped build consensus. Another mechanism is
donor coordination and donors' collective focus on a few key reform areas.

﻿Annex 2- Economic Governance Reform Support Grant
Assessment of Possible Triggers for a Follow on Operation5
A Strengthening public financial management
Trigger 1: A draft organic law on the budget framework is prepared and discussed in a
national workshop prior to submission for approval.
Status: Met. The draft Bill was discussed and validated during a workshop in October 1,
2011. The Bill was adopted after a broad consultative process involving the President of the
Comoros, representatives of autonomous islands, and key senior civil servants of the public
administration. The Bill was adopted by the Council of Ministers on February 2012.
Trigger 2: Quarterly reports are published on public website or newspaper with national
coverage and include basic information on spending in social sectors.
Status: Substantially met. Quarterly budget execution reports issued for the last quarter of
2011 and the first quarter of 2012. However, data on social sectors spending has yet to be
reported and the reports have not been disclosed to the public.
Trigger 3: The government implements the first tri-annual PFM action plan 2010-12
demonstrating improved capacity for budget organization and strengthened internal and
external controls.
Status: Met. Satisfactory progress was achieved in the implementation of the 2010-12 PFM
Action Plan, in particular in the following areas: (i) approval, with the 2012 Budget, of
legislation on ministry personnel frameworks (organigram and staffing); (ii) approval, in
February 2012, of decree to reform of the Treasury and Public Accounting area (iii)
promulgation, in February 2012, of new Public Procurement Code consistent with COMESA
(Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa); (iv) approval, in April 2012, of decree to
establish the General Directorate of Financial Control (Direction Gndrale du Contr6le
Financier); (v) approval, in May 2012, of decree creating the Autorit de Rfgulation des
Marchis Publics and defining other important public procurement implementation issues;
and (i) approval of the Public Financial Management Law in June 2012. Also, the Budget
Laws for 2011 and 2012 were approved before the beginning of the respective fiscal year.
B Strengthening public sector efficiency and accountability
Trigger 4: The automated payroll system (GISE) is operationalized to manage civil service
human resources and payroll.
Status: Substantially met. GISE has been operationalized. From July 2011 to March 2012,
most civil service salaries were processed by the newly installed GISE. The field work of a
civil service census was completed in October 2011. Cleaning up of the GISE personnel data

﻿base is taking longer than expected. Currently, the plan is to complete the final list of civil
servants by end-June 2012.
Trigger 5: The lists of admitted candidates (ranked by order of merit) to competitive
examinations for entry into the civil service for category A are systematically published in a
newspaper with national coverage.
Status: Not met. At the Union level, the procedure was occasionally followed, but at the island
level it was not. It is thus unlikely that the 90 percent target spelled out in the Program Document
has been met, even though recruitment levels at category A have been generally constrained
since 2011. Additional institutional reforms related to the organic frameworks and related
implementation capacity constraints will also need to be addressed to move on the objective
supported by this trigger.

﻿Annex 3- Letter of Development Policy
UNION DES COMORES
VICE PRESIDENCE DES FINANCES
DON POUR LA REFORME ECONOMIQUE
Moroni, le 6 October, 2012
Mr. Jim Young Kim
Presidênt de la Banque Mondiale
The World Bank
Cher Mr. Kim,
LETTRE DE POLITIQUE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
Au nom du gouvemement des Comores, j'ai l'honneur de vous écrire pour la demande du Don pour la
reforme économique (Econonic Reform Grant) de l'Association Internationale pour le Développement
(lIAD) pour supporter les programmes de mise en Suvre contenues dans notre Document de Stratégie
pour la Croissance et la Réduction de la Pauvreté (DSRCP). Cette Lettre de Développement (LDP)
énumère et décrit les actions que le gouvernement a déjà prises et s'engage à prendre dans un proche
avenir pour menre en Suvre son agenda de développement. Je joins en attachement la matrice de mesures
préparée en collaboration avec l'équipe de la Banque Mondiale dont le contenu est résumé dans cette
lettre.
1. Contexte
Depuis lindépendance de 1975. l'instabilité politique récurrente a aflucté négativement le
dé,cloppcment économique et socia) des Comores. Cependant. depuis ces derniéres années. ces tensions
politiques se sont apaisées et suite aux élections de 2010. considérées comme justes et transparentes par
les obserateurs iternationaux. Nous sommes engagés pour concentrer nos efforts pour consolider
davantage Funité nationale, améliorer le niveau de vie de la population, réduire la pauvreté et nous
acheminer vers les progrès pour atteindre les objectifs du millénaire.
Depuis la prise de fonction du nouveau gouvernement au milieu de l'année 2011. le gouvernement a
affirmé son engagement pour poursuivre les objectifs du DSCRP 2010-2014. Des progrès satisiaisants
ont eu lieu dans le renforcement de la gestion macroéconomique et la mise en place des reformes
structurelles. Je suis ravi d'annoncer que nos efforts ont contribué à la mise en place satisfaisante, en Juin
2012. de la troisime revue de 'accord FEC du FMI. Je suis également ravi de vous annoncer que la
plupart des déclencheurs pour le point d'achèvement sont remplis, afin que les Comores soient éligibles à
l'iniiat.ive de réduction de la dette multilatérale (MDRI).
Il. Contexte Macroéconomique
Malgré les cinq mois de transition et la crise politique à laquelle que notre pays a lait face après la fin des
élections de 2010 et l'environnement international dilficile, la croissance réelle du PIR a atteint 2.2
pourcent en 2011 après une moyenne d'environ 1.6 pourcent sous la période 2008-2010. En 2012, la
43


﻿croissance économique est estimée pour atteindre 2.5 pourcent. L'accélération graduelle au ni.eau des
aci'.ités economiques retlèe l'amélioration de la performance au niveau de l'agriculture de subsistance,
ainsi qu'une envolée des prix internationaux du girofle. une hausse de la construction immobilière
largement linancée par les transferts de la diaspora, et une reprise au niveau des investissements directs
étrangers (IDE). L'inflation. bien que toujours à un chiffre, a connu une hausse annuelle de 6.8 pour cent
en 2011 suite a la hausse des prix des denrées alimentaires sur le marché international, notamment le
pétrole et les produits alimentaires mais elle devrait décélérer à 6.0 pourcent en 2012. Un environnement
international moins fivorable particulièrement par une hausse des importations reliées au pétrole et les
produits alimentaires, combiné à une remontée des transferts courants publics et privés - ont conduit à
l'affaiblissement du délicit du compte courant allant de 9.0 à 6.9 pourcent du PIB en 2011 et 2012
respectivement. Au niveau des finances publiques, après les dérapages a fin Décembre 2010 et a fin Juin
2l 1. les performances se sont améliores considérablement à la fin de J'année 2011. compte tenu des
recettes fortes au niveau du rev enue et des dépenses mis en place par la nouvelle administration qui a pris
fonction en mi-201 1.Ces mesures correctives ont eu pour objectif de recouvrer de, arriérés fiscales et un
renversement considérable des salaires dans le secteur public octroyé en 2010, En 2011. le solde
budgétaire primaire a été porté à 1.6 pour cent du PIB (hors recettes non fiscales équi.valent a Presque
pourcent du PIB). ioutes les accumulations des arriérés de salaires au début de l'année 201I ont été
apurées à la fin de I'année 2011. Ces développements ont renforcé la conclusion de la troisième revue du
programme FEC du FMI. La quatrième revue a eu lieu en Septembre - Octobre 2012.
Bien que la reprise de la croissance économique lors des années soit encourageante, le gouvernement est
conscient du besoin de continuer de formuler et mettre en place les politiques qui contribueront à
renforcer la croissance économique et réduire la pauvreté. Notre objectif est de mobiliser les ressources
potentielles de manière plus active afin d'accélérer nos efforts de développement afin d'achever les
objectil's suivants en 2014. (i) accélérer la croissance réelle du Pl B à 4.0 pourcent. (ii) ramener l'inflation
à près de 3.2 pourcent sur une base annuelle: (iii) rétrécir le déficit du compte courant d'environ 8.6
pourcent du PlB due à l'amélioration des exportations et un ralentissement de la demande d'importations.
Bien que comportant beaucoup de défis. ces objectifs sont acher ables sous l'hypothèse d'absence de choc
internes el un environnement économique international favorable que l'Europe a Cu à faire face
recemment
Au niveau des finances publiques, nos efforts de consolidations fiscales sont rcnl'mrcés et le déficit
budgctaire primaire est prévu pour diminuer de 1,6 pourcent du PIB (hors les recettes exceptionnelles
mentionnées ci-dessus) en 2011 à 2.2 poureent du PIB en 2012 et diminuera davantage à 0.5 pourcent du
PIB en 2014. Pour atteindre les objectifs en 2012, notre intention est de (i) intensifier les eForts de
nobilizetion au niveau de nos adrninistrations fiscales et douanières pour atteindre les objectifs de
recettes equix alents à 11.8 pourcent du PIB: et (ii) assurer une gestion rigoureuse des dépenses publiques,
afin de réduire la masse salariale à 8 pourcent du PIB. contenir les autres dépenses courantes à 5.8
loureent du PIB et augmenter les dépenses d' investissements financées sur ressources intérieures de à
peu près un point de pourcentage du PIB 2.2 pourcent. Il est à noter que l'achèvement des objecti's sur la
masse salariale se :er dans un contexte de la mise en place rigoureuse du logiciel (iIE (cairm niégré
Sac luires er E., eui/) au niveau national Par ailleurs, les depenses d'investissement financées sur
ressources propres au niveau des secteurs de l'éducation, la santé augmenteront à 13 milliard de FKM,
soit pres de 5.7 pourcent du PIB. Dans le cas ou l évolution interne international induiront une baisse au
niveau des recettes et des dons, le gouvernement est déterminé à prendre des mesures correctrices,
notamment pour réduire les augmentations des dépenses prévues au niveau des biens et services et les
dépenses d'investissement financées sur ressources internes. ou poursuivre un effort vigoureux de
recouvrement fiscal.

﻿UNION OF THE COMOROS
VICE PRESIDENCY OF FINANCE
ECONOMIC REFORM GRANT (ERG)
Translation of the French version dated October 6, 2012
Moroni, October 6, 2012
Mr. Jim Yong Kim
President
The World Bank
Dear Mr. Kim,
LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
On behalf of the Government of the Union of the Comoros, I am writing to request an Economic
Reform Grant (ERG) from the International Development Association (IDA) to support
implementation of programs and policy measures outlined in our Poverty Reduction and Growth
Strategy Paper (PRGSP). This Letter of Development Policy (LDP) sets out the actions that the
Government has already undertaken and is committed to undertake in the near future to
implement its development agenda. I am attaching a policy matrix prepared in collaboration with
the World Bank team that sets out the contents of this letter in a summary form.
I- Background
Since independence in mid-1975, Comoros economic and social development has been adversely
affected by recurring political instability. However, in recent years, tensions have eased and
following the end-2010 elections, considered fair and transparent by international observers, we
are committed to focus our efforts on further consolidating national unity, improving the
population's standard of living, reducing widespread poverty and making progress towards the
Millennium Development Goals.
After coming into office in mid-2011, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to pursue the
objectives spelled out in the Comoros 2010-14 Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy Paper.
Broadly satisfactory progress has been made in strengthening macroeconomic management and
implementing structural reforms. I am pleased to report that our efforts contributed to the
successful completion, in June 2012, of the third review of the Three Year arrangement with the
International Monetary Fund under the Extended Credit Facility. I am also pleased to report that
most of the triggers for the HIPC Completion Point have been met. Consequently, and to address
47


﻿the country's unsustainable external debt burden, Comoros expects to reach, in December 2012,
the HIPC Completion Point and to become eligible to support under the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative.
II-Macroeconomic Context
Despite the political crisis faced by our country in mid-2010, the five months transition to a new
administration after the end-2010 elections and the adverse global economic environment, real
GDP growth reached 2.2percent in 2011 after averaging about 1.6 percent in the period 2008-
2010. In 2012, economic growth is estimated to reach 2.5 percent. The gradual acceleration in
economic activity reflects improved performance in subsistence agriculture, including a boost
from high cloves export prices, increased housing construction largely financed by strong
remittances from our Diaspora, and some pick-up in foreign direct investment (FDI). While still
in the single digits, annual average inflation rose to 6.8 percent in 2011 on account of higher
international commodity prices-particularly of imported oil and foodstuffs-but is expected to
slow down to 5.6 percent in 2012. A less favorable global environment, higher FDI-related
imports and declining donor's assistance led to a weakening of the external current account
deficit to 9.5 percent and 10.4 percent of GDP in 2011 and 2012, respectively.
On the fiscal front, following slippages at end-December 2010 and end-June 2011, performance
improved considerably in late 2011 on account of strong revenue and spending measures
implemented by the new administration that took office in mid-2011. These corrective measures
targeted recovery of tax arrears and reversed a considerable public sector wage increase granted
in late 2010. In 2011, the domestic primary budget deficit was limited at 1.4 percent of GDP
(excluding one-off nontax receipts equivalent to almost 3 percent of GDP); and all wage arrears
accumulated in the earlier months of 2011 were cleared by end-year. These developments paved
the way for the completion of the third review of the ECF program with the IMF, in June 2012.
The fourth review of the ECF program will take place later in 2012.
While the pick-up in economic growth in recent years is encouraging, the Government is aware
of the need to continue formulating and implementing policies that will help to bring about faster
growth and poverty reduction. Our goal is to mobilize potential resources more actively to
deepen our development efforts with a view to achieving the following objectives by 2014. (i)
Accelerate real GDP growth to 4.0 percent; (ii) bring inflation down to about 3.2 percent on a
year-on-year basis; (iii) narrow the external current account deficit to about 8.6 percent of GDP
due to improved exports and restraint in the demand for imports. While challenging, these
objectives are achievable assuming absence of domestic shocks and more favorable global
economic environment than that faced recently, in particular in Europe.
With regard to public finances, our fiscal consolidation efforts are being strengthened and the
domestic primary budget deficit is expected to fall from 1. 6 percent of GDP (excluding
exceptional revenues mentioned above) in 2011 to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2012 and further
contract to 0.5 percent of GDP in 2014. To achieve the 2012 goal, we intend (i) to intensify our
tax and customs administration revenue mobilization efforts to achieve domestic revenue target
equivalent to 11.8 percent of GDP; and (ii) to ensure a rigorous management of public
expenditures, with a view to reduce the wage bill to 8 percent of GDP, contain other primary
current expenditures at 5.8 percent of GDP and increase domestically-financed investment by
48


﻿about one percentage point of GDP to 2.2percent. It must be noted that achievement of the wage
bill target will take place in the context of a rigorous countrywide implementation of the
integrated computerized wage payment system (Gestion Integre des Salaires et Effectifs -GISE).
Moreover, domestically-financed education and health primary expenditures, current and
investment, will increase to 13 billion KMF, representing about 5.7 percent of GDP. In case
domestic or international developments lead to shortfalls in revenue or grants, the government is
determined to implement corrective measures, namely to reduce planned increases in goods and
services and domestically-financed investment expenditures or to pursue a vigorous collection of
tax arrears.
III- Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy Paper
Comoros' Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy Paper (PRGSP) covers the period 2010-14
and resulted from a thorough and inclusive participatory process, at the Union and Island levels.
It was officially adopted in September 2009 and identifies the following six priority axes: (i)
stabilizing the economy and laying the groundwork for strong and equitable growth; (ii)
strengthening key sectors by focusing on institution-building and ensuring a broader role for the
private sector; (iii) strengthening governance and social cohesion; (iv) improving the health
status of the general public; (v) promoting education and vocational training; and (vi) promoting
environmental sustainability and civilian security. Late in September 2012, the Government
issued the second annual PRGSP progress report that covers developments during 2011.
The PRGSP forms the basis of the reform program to be supported by the ERG, which I present
in this letter. In developing the ERG-supported reform program, Government is aware that to be
successful, the agenda must be comprehensive and focus on selected major macroeconomic and
structural measures necessary to accelerate growth and poverty reduction, especially in the
delivery of public services to those most in need. To this end, the ERG reform program rests on
two broad policy clusters:
a. Fostering public transparency and accountability; and
b. Addressing economic and social vulnerabilities.
The ERG two broad policy clusters are adequately aligned with reforms identified in four of the
six PRGSP priority axes. The first pillar, fostering public transparency and accountability,
focuses on improving public financial management, improving public sector efficiency and
accountability, strengthening governance and anti-corruption and strengthening the economic
governance of the fisheries sector. The second pillar, addressing economic and social
vulnerabilities tackles weaknesses in the energy sector and critical vulnerabilities to natural
disaster. Government believes that the two policy clusters supported by the ERG reinforce
existing programs and projects, and also complement and expand reforms implemented to meet
the HIPC Completion Point (CP) triggers, and help build up the elements of opportunity and
empowerment needed to reach our development goals. This is particularly the case of HIPC CP
triggers focused on public financial management and governance and state-owned enterprises
reforms.
49


﻿IV- Prior Actions and Next Steps supported by the ERG
In order to address key development constraints identified in each of the policy clusters
supported by the ERG, the Government has already taken the following actions:
Fostering public transparency and accountability
*  To improve public financial management, the Public Financial Management Law
(Loi des Operations Financieres de b'Etat) has been voted and promulgated by the
National Assembly in August 2012. Moreover, the quarterly budget execution
reports for the first quarter and the second quarter of 2012, which include
information on spending on social sectors, have been posted on the Policy
Coordination Unit of the Ministry of Finance's website. Finally, the decree to
reform the Treasury administration was signed by the President in February 2012,
and implementation of the General Directorate of Public Accounting and Treasury
has started with the recent appointment of the (i) Director General of Public
Accounting and Treasury, and (ii) the Paymaster General of the Union.
*  The next step, for 2013, will be for the government ensure that the 2013 Annual
Budget Law (Loi de Finances) is in conformity with applicable provisions of the
PFM Law including fiscal balance, budget unity, and the establishment of the
single treasury account. The 2011 draft budget execution law (Project de Loi de
R6glement) will be submitted to the Chamber of Accounts and The Government
will finalize the recruitment of key senior staffs of the General Directorate of
Public Accounting and Treasury by appointing the Paymasters of the Islands and
will appoint of the Paymasters of the Islands. And finally, the government will
prepare and disclose, on a quarterly basis, a consolidated TOFE (Tableaux des
Op6rations Financi&res de l'Etat) covering the Union and Islands operations.
*  To improve public sector efficiency and accountability, the GISE-based report
covering recruitments (each including an update on wage payments and arrears and
otherwise in form and substance satisfactory to the Association) in the central and
Autonomous Islands' governments, by ministry and commissariat and by gender
has been prepared for the period July to August 2012 and has been disclosed on the
CREF's website.
*  The government will adopt the appropriate legal text to enforce GISE as the sole
system to pay salaries of civil servants and other public employees, and adopt a
procedures manual applicable to all levels of government to strengthen the
regulation of human resource management and rules of compensation.
*  To strengthen governance and anti-corruption, the President recently signed the
decree requiring key officials to submit an annual asset declaration under
conditions that strike a balance between individual rights to privacy and the
50


﻿overriding need to access information relevant to combating corruption and
avoiding conflicts of interest. The government has also adopted in September 2012
the national Strategy to combat corruption, and is committed to implement it in the
short run.
To strengthen the economic governance of the fisheries sector, the government has
disclosed the list of all fishing agreements and all fishing licenses in force during the
previous twelve months, including for each agreement and license, on its cumulated
duration and all related fees paid per category and access regime. The public
disclosure has taken place on CREF's website in the local newspapers "La Gazette"
and "Albalad "on October 10, 2012 and will continue every year. The next step is that
the government is committed to adopt the legal text (i.e., arr6t6) that mandates full
systematic disclosure of fishing agreement and license information by June 2013.
Addressing economic and social vulnerabilities
*  To address weaknesses in the energy sector, on August 15, 2012, the Cabinet
approved a comprehensive action plan for reorganization of MAMWE's, our state-
owned electricity company commercial function. The next step will be for the
government to effectively implement the plan for reorganization of commercial
function of MAMWE.
*  To deal with critical vulnerabilities to natural disaster, the President recently signed
the decree to establish the National Platform for Disaster Risk Management. This
platform will formalize and strengthen the coordination mechanism between national
and regional services, and will allow an orientation of the mechanism for the
prevention and preparedness for natural disasters.
V- Conclusion
On behalf of the Government of the Union of the Comoros, I wish to thank IDA for the support it
has been providing to our country. This support has been and continues to be critical in laying
the foundation for and expanding the scope of our development initiatives.
The Government is committed to implement the policy measures described in this letter, and
summarized in the attached policy matrix. They are fully consistent with the Government's
determination to spearhead the drive towards growth, the diversification and deepening of the
economy, poverty alleviation, and prudent economic management. I trust that this request to
support our reform program through the Economic Reform Grant will receive your favorable
consideration.
Yours Sincerely,

﻿Annex 5- IMF Relations Note
Press Release No. 12/230                             International Monetary Fund
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                Washington, D.C. 20431 USA
June 15, 2012
IMF Executive Board Concludes Third Review Under the Extended Credit Facility
Arrangement for the Union of the Comoros; Approves Extension of the Arrangement and
US$2.37 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the third
review of the Union of the Comoros' economic performance under the program supported by the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF). In completing the review, the Board approved a waiver for the
nonobservance of a performance criterion on reduction of domestic arrears and the modification
of this performance criterion. The Executive Board also approved an extension of the
arrangement through December 31, 2013, and a rephasing of the remaining disbursements.
The completion of the review will enable an immediate disbursement of SDR 1.56 million
(equivalent to US$2.37 million). The Union of the Comoros' ECF arrangement was approved in
September 2009 in an amount equivalent to SDR 13.57 million (about US$20.63 million; see
Press Release No. 09/3 15).
Following the Executive Board discussion on the Union of the Comoros, Mr. Naoyuki
Shinohara, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
"Comoros' overall performance under the ECF-supported program has significantly improved
since late 2011. Against the backdrop of a favorable political environment, and enhanced donor
support, the authorities have initiated corrective measures to put their ECF-supported program
back on track and are committed to prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. All
these efforts are necessary to promote sustained strong growth, facilitate progress towards long-
term debt sustainability, and reduce poverty.
"Achievement of the government's fiscal objectives, including creating the space needed for pro-
poor and pro-growth spending, will require strengthening domestic revenue collection and
observing expenditure restraint. In this context, it will be important to enhance the efficiency of
tax and customs administration, and expand the tax base. Efforts should also continue towards
avoiding accumulation of new payments arrears.
"Prudent debt management policies remain essential to address Comoros' unsustainable debt
situation. Further progress towards reaching understandings on debt restructuring with all
53


﻿external creditors and implementing the HIPC Initiative Completion Point triggers will therefore
be important.
"On the structural front, the authorities have stepped up technical consultations with
development partners on the reform of public financial management and the restructuring of
public utilities. In the financial sector, the authorities are reinforcing banking oversight and
strengthening the central bank's internal control mechanisms, all of which are essential to ensure
continued sound expansion of financial intermediation.
"In light of the more supportive policy environment, an extension of the ECF arrangement to
end-2013 would provide the needed additional time for addressing delays in the implementation
of reforms, so as to strengthen economic competitiveness and enhance the effectiveness of the
authorities' poverty reduction strategy," Mr. Shinohara added.
