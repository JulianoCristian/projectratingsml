The aim is to\n            improve the income of the private farming community and\n            increase its productivity and hence the competitiveness of\n            the sector. The project will address the need: 1) to change\n            delivery mechanisms for the provision of technical services\n            to the private farming community; and 2) for institutional\n            restructuring to meet the needs of a market economy.\n            Increased farmer ownership and accountability of the\n            agricultural knowledge system are also essential elements of\n            project design. The provision of relevant and efficient\n            veterinary services and support for the shift from a\n            grain-based animal production system to a lower cost\n            pasture-based livestock industry are other central\n            objectives. In addition, rationalizing the regulatory\n            framework for the seed industry will be supported. The\n            project will furthermore seek to strengthen the Ministry of\n            Agriculture and Forestry's policy formulation\n            capabilities and the agriculture data base in order to\n            ensure more rational policy decisions in the future.\n            Finally, the project consists of the six following\n            components: 1) extension; 2) research; 3) animal health; 4)\n            pasture and fodder development; 5) seed industry\n            development; and 6) policy analysis support."}, "docdt": "1996-02-23T00:00:00Z"}
