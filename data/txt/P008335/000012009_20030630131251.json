is\n            satisfactory, sustainability likely, with substantial\n            institutional development impacts, and satisfactory\n            performances by both the Bank, and Borrower. Lessons\n            reinforce that institutional reform projects such as this\n            one, can be successful in building capacities to support the\n            private agricultural sector, even when government has lagged\n            in reforming trade, and price policies, privatization of\n            agro-kombinats, and state-owned land, as well as for other\n            policies, fundamental to long-run market-oriented\n            agriculture sector development. Basically, projects designed\n            to improve institutional performance, can be implemented\n            before economic reforms are completed. Another lesson\n            conveys that if an agricultural institutional development\n            project is to be evaluated in terms of quantified impacts on\n            farmer incomes, (1) the difficulty of this must be\n            recognized, (2) the logic of the quantification must\n            therefore be specified in detail early on, (3) the project\n            must not become effective until precise, defined baseline\n            data to support the evaluation are available, (4) data\n            collection, and monitoring must be rigorously implemented\n            during the project, and, (5) all these expensive monitoring\n            and evaluation activities, must be adequately financed as\n            part of the project. Competitive grant schemes financed by\n            the project, show that useful research can be developed, and\n            transferred to farmers. However, experience also suggests\n            that effective competitive grant management requires strong,\n            independent supervision, and regular financial, and\n            scientific auditing. In this context, farmer representation\n            on advisory boards is often notional, and rarely democratic,\n            while research, and program supervision is often under\n            funded, and insufficiently independent. To be effective in\n            satisfying the research needs of small private farmers in\n            the long run, the government should therefore, start an\n            ongoing process of reform."}, "docdt": "2003-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
