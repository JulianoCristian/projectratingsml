MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Uganda - Second
Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1434-UCG)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Uganda - Second Technical Assistance
Project (Credit 1434-UG) prepared by the Africa Regional Office, with Part II contributed by the
Borrower. rTe PCR is comprehensive, informative and insightful.
The PCR tells the story of a project that was on the whole successful in achieving ambitious
objectives under tlie difficult conditions of Uganda during the mid- and late-1980s. The project
aimed at producing not only an array of project and policy studies but also at providing policy advice
and at strengthening several core ministries and agencies the staff of which had been decimated by
earlier political disruptions.
The project design allowed project/task managers to exercise considerable flexibiity in
adapting modalities and modus operandi to changing opportunities and constraints. The project got
off to a slow start because it became effective at a time (April 1984) of unrest and strife.
Fortunately, the government that came to power in 1986 was committed to making good use of
project resources and subsequent implementation proceeded well on all fronts. The project is rated
satisfactory overall, and the institutional developmental impact appears to have been substantiaL
The benefits should be sustainable provided that civil service and related reforms permit the
payment of salaries sufficient to retain a critical mass of qualified public servants.
An important Bank contnbution was in the form of intensive supervision; the PCR argues
persuasively that this was a necessary condition for making this kind of project (i.e. one with its
built-in design flexibility) work well. The Borrower's comments state that 'the amount and type of
supervision received [under this project]...will certainly be needed for the next few years if
Government is to continue its strong dialogue with IDA and maintain the progress currently being
made."
The project may be audited because of the need to disseminate lessons of experience from
successful TA projects in countries where absorptive capacity is very limited.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

SECOND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
CREDIT 1434-UG
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Technical Assistance Project
(TAII), for which Credit 1434-UG in the amount of SDR 14.2 nillion was approved on April 28,
1984. The loan was closed on June 30, 1992, with complete disbursement. During the effectiveness
period of the IDA credit a total of approxinately US$ 10 million was also made available through a
UNDP project to provide assistance to the Mbinistry of Planning and Economic Developmew This
UNDP project was executed by IDA under the same management as the IDA Credit.
The PCR (Parts I and l) was prepared by the task manager, Mr.I. Knapp, of the Public and
Private Enterprise Division; reviewed with the tbh,n Country Officer for Uganda, Ms.A Vaughn, and
then commented upon by the Borrower, (Part II).
Preparation of the PCR was started duiing the final supervision mission to close off all
administrative matters for the Credit, in October 1992, and is based, inter alia, on the President's
Report, the Credit Agreement, supervision reports, and sub project files.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
UGANDA
SECOND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
CREDIT 1434- UG
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.    The Second Technical Assistance project became effective (April 1984) at a time of renewed
unrest and strife in Uganda and, as such, much of its momentun and usefulness as an immediate
follow on to the First Technical Assistance Project was lost. However, the new Government that
came to power in 1986 adopted the flexible design of the project and, within the same broad
framework of objectives, set up a directed set of sub projects that were for the most part instrumental
in establishing the lending and policy framework within which Government and IDA have inacted
over the last six years.
2.    The project relied extensively upon foreign expatriate assistance, and, for the most part, the
quality and style of the recruited consultants was good, with very few problems being encountered.
Many of the same consultants have moved on within the expanded lending program to take further
assignments, thus maintaining an unusual amount of continuity and local expertise in the use and
management of technical assistance fuids. This approach, while obviously open to criticism on the
grounds of "perpetuating external dependency", has been very necessary as a result of the enormous
loss of skilled Ugandan technicians and managers. Nevertheless, the use of long term resident experts
has facilitated significant amounts of in-country and on-the-job training, at very economical costs and
the benefits of this past training can now be seen in the emergence of many younrer Ugandan civil
servants at the mid management levels in those institutions that received assistance.
3.    The project also started the process of joint efforts of IDA and donors in focusing technical
assistance within a common framework. With a strong and informed central Government ministry, the
Ministry of Planning and Econonic Development (MPED), technical assistance was utilized
efficiently in addressing many issues of economic policy, and in breaking through specific bottlenecks
that confronted Government. Of particular importance in this joint effort at practical partnerships with
the donors was the complementary UNDP project at the MPED. The integration of the UNDP funded
experts within the friamework of IDA funded sub projects was of great assistance to Govermuent in
ensuring maximum benefits, while also providing Government with independent analysis and support
for their discussions with IDA.



(iii)
4.    Many of the lessons learned from this project have already been incorporated into two major
follow-on technical assistance projects. The modality of expatriate long term assistance to run major
projects with senior counterparts has been widely extended and was used as a model for designing the
management of a major piece of technica assistance now being undertaken by Government at the core
Ministries. Also, the success of technical assistance in transferring skills, and building enduring
capacities has been recognized as all too fragile, unless Government is willing to pay proper attention
to the issues of wages/benefits, and basic equipment. In the case of the Ugandan Governent, this
understanding is evident, and serious steps at Civil Service Reform with appropriate attention to
wages/benefits are now beginning to emerge, supported by fuither IDA lending.
5.    Perhaps the most .nportant lesson that has been drawn is that project design can never be a
substitute for good leadership and conmnitment within Government, and that a commonly shared view
of what needs to happen requires a considerable amount of face to face contact. In this sense, while
the Second Technical Assistance Credit helped to start Government along a particular path and
process, the methods employed placed an extremely heavy load upon supervision and required inputs
that are not normally availble. ( While the fonnal tables show the recorded supervision, actual in-
country supervision, in conjunction with TAM and the UNDP project, between 1988-1991 averaged
six missions and approximately 20 weeks per year). As such, projects of this type should only be used
in very particular circumstances, and should lead quickly, if at all possible, to a more normal
operating approach for the design and delivery of technical assistance.

Country             : Uganda
Sector              : Public Sector
B.    Introduction and Background
1.           At the time of project preparation, Governmenit's primary goal was to restore law and
order as a basic prerequisite for futture economic progress. Second to this was a desire to provide a
broad framework for the development of the economy during 1982/83 and 1983/84, as contained in
the Recovery PtnrTam document released in April 1982. A basic req iement for implemenation of
the Recovery Program was action to strengthen the administratve framework for implementing
programs, for carrying them forward and malkng them more effective. The contemplated actions
required that technical assistance be provided to Government in order to make up for the enormous
loss of technical and managerial skills resulting from the exodus and loss of life during the conflicts
of the 1970's. The Second Technical Assistance Credit was thus prepared and agreed as an immediate
follow on to the First Technical Assistance Credit. The two Credits shared similar broad objectives in
the areas of capacity building/substitute TA and preparatory studies for future policy and investment
operations. Additionally, TAIR was designed to fund studies already identified under TAI and agreed
with the (then) Government.
2.           Government efforts to achieve recovery were being significantly frustrated by an
administrative machinery that had been seriously affected by abuse and neglect between 1970- 1980.
The civil service's internal situation was characterized by serious manpower constraints at the higher
levels and expansion of staff numbers at lower ievels; financial constraints; low pay and morale; weak
management and organizational problem; poor records and record keeping practices; and inadequate
and dilapidated equipment. By any normal measures of efficiency and effectiveness one might have
concluded that the Service did not function at all. All reports by IDA staff and other concerned
donors deplored the situation and the use of technical assistance to alleviate the situation was a
common reconunendation.



2
3.           The Credit was presented to the Board in late 1983, and became effective in April
1984. Subsequent unrest in 1985 greatly affected the allocation and use of funds and it was not until
the Government of President Museveni came to power in early 1986, and by 1987 established some
levels of security, that the project was able to begin proper and full implementation. [For the
historical background covering the major years of project implementation see OED Report # 8751,
Program Performance Audit Report, First Technical Assistance Project (pages 39 -40)].
C.    Pro3ect Objectives and Description
4.           The stated objectives of the project were to:
(a) strengthen the Government's economic decision making, planning,
project preparation and impiementation capabilities through external
assistance, and
(b) transfer skills to Ugandans through training
5.           To achieve these objectives the credit of 14.2 million SDR's (equivalent to US$15
million) was to finance high priority activities (ie "sub projects"), selected in agreement between
Govemment and IDA. Project design was flexible to allow for identification and agreement of specific
sub projects throughout the first two years of the credit life. The sub projects would have to be
consistent with the Revised Recovery Program for 1983-1985, and as a matter of priority were to be
concenated on:
(i)   the Ministries of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, and
Public Service and Cabinet Affairs, to improve their capacities to
manage the economy;
(ii)   sector ministries to strengthen their planning and project capabilities,
and
(iii) the Institute of Public Administration to enhance its ability to provide
training in Uganda.
6.           At the time of presentation to the Board a number of sub projects had been fully
agreed between Government and IDA, costed at approximately US$4 million, and other projects
costed at approximately US$6 million were in advanced stages of preparation. The credit also
contained a feature that required all commitments to be made within two years,( by December 31
1985), with all expenditures to be completed within a further two and a half years. (This requirement
was later removed).
7.           As in the case of the First Technical Assistance Credit the project was administered
by the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development (MPED), utilizing the services of a senior
economist as the project administrator, who was to be assisted by an expatriate advisor. Sub project
proposals were to be prepared by Government Ministries, parastatals or other agencies, with the



3
assistance of consultants if necessary, and presented to a Review Committee, comprisLng the
Pennanent Secretary of MPED, Secretary to the Treasury and other officials of MPED, MOF and
line ministries. All agreed sub projects were then to be submitted to IDA for approval and allocation
of funds. Approved sub projects were to be implemented by the proposing agency, with MPED
providing IDA with progress reports.
D.    Project Desian and Organization
8.           The project brief was distributed on February 24, 1983, and the project was appraised
in April 1983. As this was a technical assistance project, no Staff Appraisal was issued, and the
project went to the Board as a President's Report, on December 22 1983, with effectiveness being
declared on April 28 1984. The project followed on immediately from the first technical assistance
project (evaluated by OED in Report #8751, referenced above), with the broad objectives of
providing further funding for needed studies and preparation work already identified, and further
assisting Govermnent in strengthening core agencies associated with the development and
implementation of economic policy, through the conduct of studies and training of Ugandans.
9.           The design of the project also foresaw and thus included arrangements for the receipt
of various study and sub project preparation proposals by the planning ministry frnm across a wide
range of organizations and sectors. (In terms of actual implementation the range of organizations
involved became more focused under a new Government, from 1986 onward). The design also
recognized the assistance provided from UNDP (which was extended on three occasions during the
credit disbusement period), to the implementing agency, and intended that improvements being made
in parallel through this assistance should have an interactive effect on the selection of sub projects and
the Tnanagement of their implementation.
E.    Project Implementation
10.          With the internal difficulties experienced during late 1984 and 1985, new sub project
preparation was reduced to almost nil, and by late 1985 there were still uncompleted sub projects
under Technical Assistance I, and only US$ 2 million (cumulatively) had been disbursed under
Technical Assistance IH. (See Table 3, Part III). During 1986, the pace of imnplementation began to
pick up, particularly in the area of sub project preparation, and with the resumption of supervision
missions for the credit in early 1987, tied with the beginning of a policy dialogue with the new
Government, implementation then began in a more serious and integrated manner.
11.          Under the new Govermment and the direct leadership of a new Permanent Secretary in
the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development, the overall objectives for the Credit were
retained, but a large part of the Credit proceeds became more narrowly focused than had been
envisaged at the time of Credit design. In the area of project preparation, the six ongoing contracts
were concluded by 1988, but no new ones were initiated and the value of these studies to later policy
considerations and/ or lending is questionable; under studies. ten were completed, of which three
were of sufficient importance and impact - the household budget survey, the agricultural task forces
and the information systems study - that they received significant follow up (under the Third
Technical Assistance Project, and the Economic and Financial Management Project, which came into
operation in mid 1988 and mid 1992 respectively). Trining, which received less attention in total



4
than had been originally planned, alto received significantly less funding for individuals, with more
attention being applied to groups of people in specialist areas, eg accounting, organizational
specialists. Training also became more important within the sub project structures set up to implement
improvements and changes within the administrative structures at the center of Government,
e.g.within the Ministry of Civil Service and Cabinet Affairs. In total, credit administration and
management became more concerned with technical assistance implementation and addressing more
directly the immediate concerns and bottlenecks within the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of
Planning and Economic Development, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Public Service and
Cabinet Affairs, and the Agricultural Sector. (Table 4 in Part III provides a complete listing of all
such projects, numbering 30 in total). The major technical assistance sub projects under each of these
ministries and sector(s) are briefly described below.
Minisby of Finance
12.          The ministry received assistance valued at approximately US$ 2.7 million, covering 9
sub projects. The most important of these were TA-7 and 24; TA-17; and 3-TA-7. TA7 and 24
provided Government with the services of a qualified accountant, who during the time in country,
(almost 6 years), was called upon to act as the Commissioner for Treasury some five times, upon the
dismissal/removal of the incumbent nationals. Though the original objective for this assistance,
(improvements in accounting practices and standards), remained largely unmet under TAI, there is
little doubt that the presence of an independent expatriate advisor capable of immediately stepping into
the line management role provided significant assistance to Government in its attempts to curb various
excesses within budgetary expenditures. The advisor also played a major role in the organization and
implementation of the accountancy training, funded under 3-TA-7; (results of this training are shown
in Table 6, Part m). The other major initiative funded for the ministry was TA-17 which involved a
complete assessment of Govermment systems concerned with the tracking of financial transactions.
This assemet became the basis of the design now being implemented under the Economic and
Financial Maagement Project (EFMP).
Ministry of Planmin= and Economic Develorment
13.          The ministry received assistance of approximately US$2.4 million for some 7 sub
projects, the most important of which concerned the Statisdts Department, (1-ST-2 and 6; and 1-TA-
12 and 23). [IDA assistnce to the central departments of thb ministry was unnecessary as UNDP
assistance was provided, which was executed by the Bank, and managed by the IDA TAII task
managerl. The two major areas of work - rehabilitation of the statistics department and the conduct of
the household budget study - were further supported under TAIl and the EFMP, (Statistics only).
The results of the household udget survey, (which was completed under further assistance from
TAI), have been widely accepted by Bank staff working on Uganda, and Ugandan planners as a
very competent and professional product, while the Statistics Department itself is now thought to be
one of the better departments of its kind in Africa, (according to consultants from donor agencies),
that is capable of a wide range of data collection and analysis as an underpinning for economic
Plnig.



5
Minstr of Indust
14.          The minitry received approximately US$ 2.0 million in assistance. from 5 sub
projects. TA-8 and TA-14 dealt with strengthening the various functions of the riinistry and assisting
with the preparation of sub sector reports and policy options. This work was of significant input
towards tue design of a new IDA credit - the Public Enterprise Project (PEP), which went to the
Board in November 1988 (Credit 1962-UG). Funding also facilitated later studies on the role and
structure of the Ministry (in 1989), that were instrumental in designing the merger of Industry and
Commerce (1991). Other assistance was also utilized to start up the PEP, by funding key exptriate
assistance, without the need for a project preparation facility. [ The PEP in turn prepared the way for
a detailed divestiture plan, and the beginning of the privatization processes across all sectors, which is
now supported by the Enterprise Development Project, (Credit 2315-UG)J.
Ministry of Public Service and Cabinet Affairs.
15.          The ministry received approximately US$6.9 million for four major sub projects, all
directly concerned with strengthening internal capabilities and preparing/implementing various initial
steps towards a more comprehensive program of civil service reform. The largest sub project - 1-TA-
6 achieved a number of improvements within the ministry, particularly through the training program
organized with assistance from RIPA (UK), and carried out at the Institute of Public Administration in
Kampala. Also, a series of courses were held that began the process of sensitizing Pennanent
Secretaries from aU sectors across Government to the need for improvements from their staffs.
However, on balance this assistance was not considered to be as successful as it might have been,
given the level of expenditures and in 1989 Government decided to close out the existing
implemening arrangement, change the Chief Technical Advisor, and redirect its efforts towards more
general aspects of civil service reform, including studies of the structure and roles of ministries;
operation and efficiency of the payroll system and its links to appointments/promotions; and a census
of civil servants, part time workers and teachers. These activities continued to receive funding under
the follow on credit, TAll, that resulted in a mnmber of documented changes, including (V) the
removal of some 20,000 ghosts from the payroll;(ii) a more than fifty percent reduction in part dme
employees; (iii) a reduction in Ministries from forty four to the current number of nineteen, and (iv)
the completion of the most accurate census to date on Government employees.
Agricultural Sector
16.          A number of different organizations within the sector received assistance of
approximately US$ 1.4 million for 7 sub projects. Major emphasis was placed in two areas: (i) a sub
project implemented by the International Service for National Agricultural Research (ISNAR),
oriented to studying and improving agricultural research, and (ii) assistance to the Agricultural Task
Forces who considered a wide range of agricultural rolicy issues. The latter area was further financed
under TAIII. (OED Report #8751 identified the performance of the Agricultural Task Forces as one
of the major achievements under TAI ). The outputs of the various task forces have been utilized by
Government and IDA to reformulate policy in the Agricultural sector, which was then supported by a



6
major IDA policy based operation in 1990 - the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (Credit 2190-
UG, presented to the Board on December 13, 1990).
F. Overall Performance and Institutional Development
17.   The performance under the Second Technical Assistance Credit has been, in the main,
satisfactory. The Credit was successful in assisting Government to lay the ground for a wide range of
IDA (and donor) funded investment and policy based operations. It also started a trend, continued
under TAIII (since 1988), of utilizing technical assistance in a flexible manner, whereby an expatriate
advisor was directly teamed with a civil service counterpart in a senior management position eg.
commissioner; deputy permanent secretary, and together the details of a sub project were worked out,
within the general framework and overall budget previously agreed between IDA and Government.
These sub projects were then heavily monitored and supervised by IDA, with assistance from the
central ministry responsible for the credit, and inputs of IDA sector specialists to the credit task
manager.
18.          The results achieved clearly demonstrate the benefits that can accrue through technical
assistance if there is a strong focal point within Government, (in this case the Ministry of Planning
and Economic Development) that is also closely tied to. and has a major input into the major
initiatives within the macro-economic Rolicy area. However, it should also be noted that given the
need for speed in tackling the many institutional and policy problems that beset the Government
between 1986-1991, the proper and fully required administrative procedures within Govermnent were
not strictly followed. While all sub- projects submitted by Government came from the Permanent
Secretary, MPED, in writing, and if appropriate were accepted in writing by the IDA task manager,
many were not formally discussed by the required project sub committee, and the updating of
interested goverment officials owed more to the missions and aide memoires than to outward
communication from the ministry. The lessons of more recent experience with technical assistance
and its relationship to internal differences within Government suggest that an added degree of caution
and review needs to be exercised in the administration of technical assistance, to ensure complete
transparency and consensus among all agencies, on whose collaboration the long term success of TA
depends.
19.         In terms of building institutional capacities, many of the sub projects achieved
significant improvements in the skill levels, procedural approaches, and general operating efficiencies
of respective organizations and units. However, it also became clear during the implementaion that
such improvements would not be sustained once the sub projects ceased and needed financing for
"salary top ups", equipment and training were no longer available.l/
1/ In Uganda there is now a Government/Donor overall agreement on the level and manner in
which "top-ups" are paid to Government staff. This level is also monitored within the efforts
of Government to reform its pay and benefits approach, as part of the agreed Civil Service
Reform Program.

G. MA Performance
20.          This Credit continued the practice developed under the First Technical Assistance
Credit of utilizing a flexible administrative machinery for the allocation of funds, as opposed to
allocating all the credit proceeds to sub projects at the time of design. This approach was entirely
appropriate, given the internal difficulties of the times, and avoided the possible requirement for a
formal redesign of the project. However, the built in design flexibility, while extremely benefit  to
Govermnent, necessitated significant supervision effort on the part of IDA staff, and would not ikave
worked successfully without resources provided from other sources, e.g. UNDP, that allowed "extra"
and more frequent supervision missions. The results also benefitted from the very close integration of
the country team around an evolving policy dialogue that was for the most part conducted with the
Permanent Secretary of MPED, as the focal point.
21.          Also, and importantly, the results eventually achieved were greatly reinforced by a
strong continuity of personnel, and interlocking structures that greatly facilitated policy and
implementation aspects. On Government's side, the same team of Pennanent Secretaries involved in
the use of proceeds from this Credit were also involved in the design and implementation of the two
follow on Credits, which utilized many of the outputs and experiences from TAII. On IDA's side,
management of this Credit was passed from the Country Officer to a Public Sector Management
Specialist, who in 1989 was transferred to the controlling Country Operations Division, and was then
involved in supervision of TAIL and design of the EFMP. This continuity allowed for significantly
enhanced comnon understandings of practical difficulties in implementing technical assistance, and
very open and straightforward communication between Government and IDA staffs. In turn, this
resulted in the ability to utilize assistance very rapidly, without long delays and difficulties that can be
associated with such issues as procurement, contract awards, terms of reference, access to appropriate
conuting expertise, etc. The third aspect involving continuity and evolving expertise in the use of
technical assistance concerns a core group of expatriate advisors, recruited under this project, and
retained under the follow on TAHI Credit. While there were obvious risks of perpetuating "external
expertise dependency", the lack of in country expertise mandated that outside experts be used. A
deliberate decision was taken by Government and IDA staffs that long term resident experts, teamed
with appropriately selected senior staff, and supported by contracted local staff was the most efficient
way to ensure that problems were tackled quickly and effectively. This approach was also felt to
provide the best environment for providing training, as opposed to merely putting people through
classroom courses. The success of this approach is evident when looking at any number of
departments within the core organizations, where many civil servants first recruited to work on TAII
sub projects now hold significant positions.
22.          A further and extremely important element in IDA's performance involves key
donors, in particular UNDP, ODA and USAID. It is estimated that between 1986 and 1992 the
Government of Uganda received approximately US$50 million from these donors and ID.A for
technical assistance. While such assistance has covered every sector, by far the most funding has been
expended around "core" Government ministries and associated economic policy and implementation.
The IDA Credit was the initial vehicle for providing a focal point, (MPED) and a general framework
for much of this expenditure. The relationship started between all parties during the major years of
IDA's funds commitment and implementation (1987-1990), was extended under TAM and resulted in



8
very significant parallel financing for activities within the EFMP framework. Without the very close
cooperation that has evolved the impact of technical assistance would have been greatly impaired, as
would IDA's performance.
H. Sunmarv and Conclusions
23.          The Second Technical Assistance Credit met the stated general objectives of
strengthening the capacities of core agencies and of transferring skills through training. However, in
retrospect, and based on the need for and results from further technical assistance projects, the
expectations for strengthening of capacities were probably too optimistic, and failed to take account or
tackle all the dimensions involved in capacity building. Of particular difficulty to Government was the
issue of sustainability and most importantly the payment of appropriate salaries that helped ensure
continued attendance of better skilled staff in the work areas where they had been trained. The
outcomes were also reduced by the continued internal unrest over the first three years of the credit
effectiveness, and by the difficult economic perod that Uganda then entered.
24.          On the positive side, this Credit spearheaded a new start of assisting and developing a
policy dialogue, and taclding major areas of economic difficulty, that was then further extended under
Technical Assistance m. A review of the lending program for Uganda over the last four years (1988-
1992), shows that both for institutional actions and project preparation in the industrial sector, the
agricultural sector, the bankdng sector, within the area of civil service reform, and across a broad
range of policy areas, eg debt reduction; trade and tariff regimes; exchange rate etc all owe something
to work initiated under this Credit. While the Credit was not specifically designed with this objective,
and could not in any event have foreseen the difficulties the country had to face due to internal
conflict, the flexibility in design, allied to the development of close relationships between operational
saff and key Government officials provided the opportunity for the use of such an approach.
25.          In conclusion, the Credit was instrumental in laying a strong foundation for the
development of sound policy options and their implementation, while at the same time helping to
increase the needed relationships and understandings between a new Government and IIDA.

PART II PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A.    Background
1.           The need for technical assistance cannot be over-emphasized in Uganda, particularly
in the early 1980's, after the loss of much of Uganda's skilled and trained manpower in the 1970's.
This was an agreed fact both when IDA extended the first technical assistance credit in 1980 and the
second technical assistance credit in 1984.
2.           The situation in the administrative machinery/Civil Service until 1984 was still
characterized by manpower constraints in the higher levels and an expansion in the lower levels,
financial constraints, low pay and low staff morale, weak management and organizational problems,
poor records and data systems, inadequate training and broken down equipment etc. All evidence
deplored the effects of the above outlined situation and reiterated the critical shortage of trained and
competent manpower. The conmmon theme was the recommendation to alleviate the difficulties which
faced Uganda's economy by providing technical assistance and training.
3.    Following discussions between IDA missions and Government, IDA agreed to extend a
second TA of SDR 14.2 million, in March 1984, for a project whose objectives were to:-
(a)   strengthen the Governments decision making, planning, project
preparation and implementation capabilities through external assistance
and
(b)   transfer skills to Ugandans through training.
To achieve these objectives, the project would finance expertise provided by expatriate advisers or
consulting firms, training and equipment.
B.    Imglementation of the Proiect
4.    This second IDA TA project was appraised by IDA in April 1983 and negotiations were held
in November 1983 in Washington D.C. A Development Credit Agreement was signed on March 8,
1984. After a slow start due to the political events which characterized much of 1984 and 1985 in
Uganda, the project implementation was accelerated during 1986, 1987 and 1988. Towards the end
of 1988, IDA did in fact extend a third TA Credit to Government, as almost all of the Second IDA
TA had been committed on various sub-projects of high priority, selected by agreement between IDA
and Government and consistent with the Government's revised Recovery Program.
C.    Evaluation of the 2nd IDA Technical Assistance Proiect
5.    The then MPED was responsible for the implementation of TA 11. This was agreed based on
the fact that the Ministry's weaknesses had been addressed under the second Restructuring Program
and with renewed efforts to implement the UNDP-flnanced Planning Assistance Project, its capacity



10
to administer the second project would be greatly enhanced. This prediction, in the Government's
view , proved correct.
6.    As of November 3, 1987, about US$13.0 million had been formally committed on thirty-one
(31) sub-projects and only about US$ 2.0 million remained uncommitted. However, it had already
been proposed by Government at this particular date that US$ 635,000 would be used for the Public
industrial Enterprises Secretariat, US$ 200,000 for the rehabilitation and implementation of a
computerized Financial System in the Treasury and US$55,000 for the Directorate of Supplies and the
Central Tender Board. Therefore, only about US$1,000,000 remained uncommitted. This is not to
say, however, that the project was not implemented without frequent problems/difficulties. A
frequent difficulty was that after a long processing period, sub-projects were delayed in their
implementation or were withdrawn altogether, (e.g. because candidates for technical assistance
positions declined at the last minute, or could not be found in the first place). This was mainly due to
the security situation existing in the country. Examples of such sub-projects were:-
(a)    The Household Budget Survey, - (first phase)
(b)   The Small Scale Industry Advisor in UCB and
(c)    The Rural Credit Scheme in the BOU
These problems gave rise to the disbursement lags that occurred during the implementation of the
project.
7.    Another difficulty related to the maintenance of a consolidated project account of all
expenditures financed out of the proceeds of the TA II credit. The Treasury (then under MOP)
continued to effect payments without the knowledge of the then MPED. Although such payments
were always duly in order, the MPED still found it could not adequately monitor and record
expenditures in a timely fashion resulting, in the lack of expenditure records and therefore lack of
accounting records and lack of the anmnal audits, which was a mandatory requirement of the DCA.
D.    General Conclusion
8.    From the borrower's perspective TAII was a very useful vehicle that enabled specific actions
to be undertaken that laid the basis for a strengthened dialogue with IDA, particularly concerning
macroeconomic issues. While it is true that this credit received significant in-country supervision,
that was facilitated by IDA's need to supervise UNDP projects in the same central ministry, it should
be noted by IDA management that this level of supervision and the particular type of interactive and
close supervision was extremely beneficial to Government's efforts to move the macroeconomic
reform program along a new path. The amount and type of supervision received, which was then
continued under the following credit TA III, will certainly be needed for the next few years if
Government is to continue its strong dialogue with IDA and maintain the progress currently being
made.

D.Maior T.A.Contracts : General Performance
1 .Price Waterhouse: ($534,000) Price Waterhouse won an internationally competitive bid to assess
the computer and information needs for the Ministry of Finance, in relation to Government's financial
transactions. The contract suffered from a number of difficulties during its execution; (i) in
retrospect, the original TOR was not well defined, and while the overall objectives were well
understood, the level of detail required in order for the study work to be "projectised" at a later date
were vastly underestimated; (ii) Govermnent did not have a strong cadre of senior managers
sufficiently knowledgeable in computers and the management of fiancial information to be able to
give indepth direction to the consultants as the study progressed, and uncovered the possible need for
further work, and extensions; (iii) IDA's supervision of the contract,( which in light of (ii) above
should have been very strong) was constrained by a lack of appropriate resources with technical
knowledge in the subject area. The result of these difficulties was that the initial draft report could
not be accepted by Government and IDA, as it failed to take account of many important factors that
would affect implementation of new systems. However, the redrafted report, which involved
significant additional effort by the consultants, and strong liaison with IDA, was accepted by
Government and became the underpinning for the computer information and strengthening component
within the Economic and Financial Management Project.
2.UNDP Office of Project Services (OPS): ($ approx. 4.6 million) UNDP OPS took over the
contract for assistance to the Ministry of Public Service and Cabinet Affairs from another UN agency,
who Government felt were unresponsive to the need for speed, particularly in regard to procurement
matters. They also managed the contract for assistance to the Statistics Department, the Household
Budget Survey and the Treasury. The relationship that was developed between Government, OPS and
IDA has been extremely satisfactory. The flexibility of the modalities offered by OPS was utilized on
a case by case basis to meet different needs at different stages of sub project design. Moreover, the
quickness of response, the ease of organizing joint missions, and the cost elements of their work all
assisted in the achievement of results. Under the follow on Credits, TA 111, and EFMP, Government
has extended furither contracts in recognition of their performance.
3. Royal Institute of Public Administration (RIPA): ($ approx. 1.2 million) The RIPA contract was
executed in parallel to the assistance being provided to the Ministry of Public Service and Cabinet
Affairs, in that the contract was to strengthen the Institute of Public Administration in Kampala,
which is the main training organization for civil servants. The initial design for the contract was
flawed in one major respect- it failed to recognize the financial state of the local institute, and the
extremely low levels of equipment, pay and general working conditions. While RIPA fielded
personnel as requested, and followed up closely on their performance, the project setting made it
almost impossible for their efforts to meet with the desired success, and today little of their efforts is
visible.



21
4.United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO): ($ 625,000) UNIDO was awarded
a contract to strengthen the Ministry of Industry, with particular attention to both internal
organizational requirements and the need for sub sector studies. The contract was performed
satisfactorily, in that the stated o'itputs were completed, and at a later stage work undertaken was used
in the eventual design of the reorganization of the Ministry, in its merger with Commerce, and sub
sector studies assisted in preparing the way for the design of the IDA Public Enterprise Project.
Difficulties did arise between Government, UNIDO and IDA in the preparation of this latter project,
due to the different understandings over the modalities and for contracting with UNIDO under the
provisions applying to execution of Bank-funded projects. (These difficulties have since been
resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned).
5. Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accounting (CIPFA) Training Center. ($1,275,000)
CIPFA was awarded a contract to provide training to local accounts personnel. Again, the original
contract did not recognize the difficulties of the local environment, and particularly Government's
difficulties in meeting agreed local cost contributions. The program took much longer to run than was
originally foreseen, and suffered from a lack of study continuity. However, positive results were
achieved, with 137 people obtaining diplomas and certifications, albeit at a rather high cost per
completion of around US$1000 per individual. Despite the difficulties the contractor lived up to its
contract and mainained close relationships with IDA and Government in an attempt to complete all
the needed training for -students".
Key Lessons:
Discussions at the time of supervision with all the above groups on the performance under their
various contracts showed one marked similarity - no one was really prepared for the environment in
which the contract was to be executed and original TOR's failed to take this into account when
costing the need for "support" to the contracts awarded eg. equipment, salary supplements for local
staff whose input was vital in achieving results, and the lack of depth of Government to discuss and
find ways out of difficulties. Resolution of these problems was facilitated by frequent supervision
missions and follow up, and from approximately 1988 onward appropriate steps were taken with the
design and costing of sub projects to ensure that these difficulties would be minimized.

through lack of audits. A summary report of
the auditors for the period 6/28/1984 to
6/30/1992 was furnished on 9/1992.
