the\n            economy. The dual project objectives aim at: (a)\n            strengthening the Government's decision making,\n            planning, project preparation and implementation\n            capabilities through external assistance; and (b)\n            transferring skills to Ugandans through training. To achieve\n            these objectives, the credit will finance high priority\n            sub-projects. These sub-projects will concentrate on\n            improving the capacity of certain government ministries to\n            manage the Ugandan economy; strengthening the planning and\n            project preparation capacities of sector ministries; and\n            enhancing the Institute of Public Administration's\n            ability to provide training in Uganda. The project will\n            finance technical expertise provided by expatriate advisors\n            or consulting firms, training and equipment."}, "docdt": "1983-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
