improve sanitary\n            conditions in Cali by moving the discharge of raw sewage\n            downstream from the city's main intake of water, and by\n            separating domestic sewage from stormwater run-off; it would\n            increase utilization of the installed water production\n            capacity by supplying water to the adjacent Municipality of\n            Yumbo; it would extend the water supply and sewerage\n            networks to, and reduce flooding in, certain low-income\n            areas; and it would increase the area available for orderly\n            urban growth. All of Cali's and Yumbo's population\n            would benefit from the reduction of the very hazardous level\n            of pollution at the point of water intake from the Cauca\n            River, and about 250,000 people, 70% of which are among\n            Colombia's poorest 40%, would benefit directly from the\n            other components."}, "docdt": "1978-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
