The lessons learned indicate\n            that the coordination by Ministry of Planning and\n            International Cooperation (MOPIC) of a multi-donor project\n            was crucial to the success of the Community Infrastructure\n            Project (CIP). The transparent procurement process and the\n            timely payments to contractors led to substantial savings.\n            Selecting clear performance indicators for both outputs and\n            outcomes from the onset of the project would have helped to\n            monitor the targeting of activities and re-focus them when\n            circumstances required. Under Part B, sub-projects were\n            implemented throughout the life of the project based on the\n            initial needs assessment. This, together with the limited\n            menu of infrastructure improvements financed under the\n            project (mostly roads), created some rigidity during the\n            final stages of implementation, somehow reducing the ability\n            of the project to target the poorest communities. CIP\n            provided models of two types of Bank project assistance: the\n            clearly defined, pre-set menu of infrastructure investments\n            for the upgrading squatter settlements and refugee camps,\n            and the demand-driven approach under component B. The\n            Bank-wide implementation profile for similar infrastructure\n            projects is substantially in excess of the project period of\n            three and a half years. It is important to make realistic on\n            the experience of comparable projects and the country situation."}, "docdt": "2004-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
