infrastructure\n            services. A secondary objective is to improve the capacity\n            of selected institutions to deliver infrastructure services\n            to the poor in an effective, efficient, and targeted way.\n            The five components comprising the project are: 1) upgrading\n            on-site water supply and drainage, school, community, and\n            health center infrastructure in squatter settlements; 2)\n            upgrading on-site water supply and sewage treatment, and\n            transport infrastructure in refugee camps; 3) upgrading\n            off-site sewage treatment and disposal infrastructure in\n            refugee camps and adjacent areas -all in the Central Region;\n            4) upgrading low-income municipal and village physical and\n            social infrastructure, including drainage and access roads,\n            solid waste equipment, primary health centers, and community\n            and youth centers; and 5) project management, consultancy\n            services, training, and pilot programs; and funding poverty\n            and unemployment surveys and public awareness programs."}, "docdt": "1997-07-24T00:00:00Z"}
