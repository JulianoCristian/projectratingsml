INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND REC(fMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE
KINGDOM OF NEPAL FOR A HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$2.5 million to
the Kingdom of Nepal for a highway project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.       The project was appraised in November/December 1969. Credit
negotiations were completed on October 1, 1970. The Borrower was repre-
sented by Mr. B.B. Pradhan, Secretary, Ministry of Works, Transport and
Communications; and Mr. B. Pradhan, First Secretary of the Embassy of
Nepal in Washington.
3.       In November 1969, IDA made a credit of $1.7 million equivalent
for a telecommunications project. If approved, this credit would be the
second project in Nepal financed by the Bank Group and the first lending
operation for the country's transportation sector.  In 1964 the Bank made
a grant of $100,000 equivalent to the Government of Nepal for a transpor-
tation survey which was completed in 1965. Some of the recommendations
have been implemnented with assistance from bilateral and multilateral aid
agencies.
4.       The following is a summary statement of the first IDA credit to
VPepal as of September 30, 1970:
Amount US$ Million
Credit No.  Year  Borrower                 Purpose         IDA    Undisbursed
1 6~6-N!P   1969  Govt. of Nepal   Telecommunications      1.7        1.6
5.       The telecommunications project is progressing satisfactorily,
although some delays have resulted from the death of the Chief Executive
of the Telecommunications Board at the end of last year. A successor has
been selected.
6.       A project is presently under preparation for irrigation and the
possibilities of assisting tourism are under consideration. In addition,
highway and water supply feasibility studies, currently underway with finan-
cial assistance from the UNDP, are expected to lead to projects which may be
cuitable for IDA financing.

7.              PART II - DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED CREDIT
Borrower:                Kingdom of Nepal
Amount:                  Various currencies equivalent to US$2.5
million
Purpose:                 To assist in financing the replacement of
highway bridges, the supply and erection
of suspension bridges, and the improvement
of road maintenance as part of the Borrower's
highway improvement program.
Amortization:            In 50 years including a 10-year period of
grace, through semi-annual installments of
of 1% from March 15, 1981 through September
15, 1990 and of 1lit from March 15, 1991
through September 15, 2020.
Service Charges:         3/4 of 1% per annum
Estimated Economic Return on the Project: 20%
PART III - THE PROJECT
8.       An appraisal report entitled "A Highway Project - Nepal" (PTR-54a) on the
proposed project is attached.
9.       Nepal has within its boundaries some of the highest mountains in
the world, making penetration into the hill areas from the Terai Plain as
well as lateral communication extremely difficult. Up to 1953, there were
no motorable roads outside the Kathmandu Valley. Although considerable foreign
assistance has been provided in recent years for highways, the network of roads,
now totalling about 1,300 Km., is still among the smallest in the world, whether
in relation to area or to population. Recognizing the limitations imposed by
the inadequacy of transportation, the Government has accorded high priority to
highway development in its five-year plan, which includes, among other things,
the completion of the eastern section and commencing work on the western sec-
ticn of the East-West Highway running the entire length of the southern part
of the country, and north-south feeder roads. The proposed project is part of
this plan.
10.      One of the main objectives of the proposed credit would be to
improve highway maintenance. This is important in reducing transport costs
on existing roads and maintaining standards of roads to be taken over from
bilateral aid agencies which are financing and constructing major portions of
the highway network. A substantially increased allocation of funds by the
Government will be required. The project also provides for the replacement
of five narrow 'and unsafe road bridges on existing roads and the supply and
erection of five suspension bridges for porter traffic in the hills, to
facilitate communications in remote parts of the country.

11.       Another important objective of the project would be to strengthen
and improve the organization of the Roads Department, which would be respon-
sible for the execution of the project. For this purpose, a team of technical
experts would be provided by the UNDP. Of the six experts to be retained,
two, including the Project Manager, are already in Nepal.  The remaining
four are expected to be recruited shortly.
12.       The estimated total cost of the project is US.$3.4 million
equivalent, of which US$2.7 million represents the foreign exchange compo-
nent. The proposed credit would cover US$2.5 million of the foreign exchange
costs. The remaining foreign exchange costs would be financed by the UNDP.
Expenditures incurred since April 1, 1970 on consulting services to complete
detailed engineering and prepare bidding documents, amounting to US$30,000,
would be eligible for reimbursement under the proposed credit. The local
costs, US$0.7 million equivalent, would be met by the Government. Contracts
would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding, except
for items such as the erection of suspension bridges and workshop construc-
tion which would be carried out by the Roads Department or by local contrac-
tors after competitive bidding.
13.       The project is expected to reduce transportation costs substantially.
The rate of economic return on its different elements is estimated to range
from 14% to over 30%, with an average of about 20%.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
14.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association
and the Kingdom of Nepal, the Recommendation of the Committee provided under
Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of
Resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed 'to the
Executive Directors separately. The draft Development Credit Agreement
conforms generally to the pattern of Agreements for other highway projects.
PART V - THE ECONaIY
15.       An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Pros-
pects Cf Nepal" (SA-7a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June
26, 1969. A basic data sheet is attached.
16.       The economic report describes the difficulties facing the economy.
Three-quarters of the land is hilly and mountainous, and most of the people
live there, largely in isolated communities. As a result, economic growth
has been highly localized, mainly in the Kathmandu Valley and parts of the
lowlying Terai Plain (adjacent to India). This geographical factor, combined
with the country's late start in development from an isolated feudal kingdom
less than twenty years ago, has caused Nepal to remain one of the least de-
veloped countries in the world, with one of the lowest per capita incomes



($45_- j65). The population of about 11 million is growing at about 2
percent per year, and gross national product is probably not increasing
any faster.
17.       Nepal has few natural resources, and those which exist (water
power, forestry) will take a long time to develop. Agriculture, including
forestry, is the largest sector in the economy, accounting for about 75
percent of the gross domestic product, and provides employment for over 90
percent of the total labor force. Rice, hardwood and jute from the Terai, ghee
and potatoes from the hills are the most important export items. An adequate
road system is needed to lower the cost of bringing agricultural and forestry
products to market centers, and of distributing inputs such as fertilizer.
Creation of infrastructure, in roads, telecommunications, aviation, water
supply and sewerage, is also necessary for the rapidly growing tourist indus-
try, which is Nepal's principal source of convertible foreign exchange, apart
from jute exports and Gurkha remittances.
18.       The Government has recently brought out its Fourth Five-Year Plan.
At the request of the Government, a draft of this Plan was reviewed by a
Bank mission which visited Nepal in May.  Main emphasis in the Plan is given
to the improvement of agriculture and transportation.
19.       Nepal's very low per capita income severely limits the government's
ability to raise revenue, which for most of the past years has covered only
50 to 60 percent of total government expenditure. Most of the deficit, which
has in the past been about equal to development expenditure, is covered oy
foreign aid. Nepal has been quite successful in obtaining aid, and most of it
has been in the form of grants. Since the devaluation of the Nepalese rupee in
December 1967, the balance of payments position has continued to improve; gold
and convertible currency reserves increased by 60 percent to about $68 million
(as of mid-April 1970) mainly due to rising jute exports. Holdings of Indian
currency have doubled to about $21 million equivalent. However, the longer-
term prospects for the leading export, rice to India, are not promising.   Nepal
is poor, has very limited natural resources and is almost completely dependent
on outside aid for its development capital needs. In these circumstances, the
provision of aid on concessional terms is fully justified.
PART VI - CCMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
20.       T am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECCMENDATION
21.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development Credit.
