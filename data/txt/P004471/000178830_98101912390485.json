present. It is estimated that, by\n            1987, some 3.3 million of the 4.6 million urban poor would\n            have reasonable access to safe water as a result of the\n            project. An additional 10,000 jobs for 30 months would be\n            provided during project construction. The major risk\n            associated with this project relates to the ability of MWSS\n            to improve its capacity to construct and operate a much\n            larger water supply system. This risk would be minimized by\n            the substantial provision in the project for technical\n            assistance and training and by the proposed reorganization\n            of MWSS with branch offices for operation and maintenance.\n            Close supervision ofthe project will be required."}, "docdt": "1978-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
