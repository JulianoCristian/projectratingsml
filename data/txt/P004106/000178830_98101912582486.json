provides a basis\n            for improving the sectoral policies affecting the machinery\n            industry sector, supports upgrading their technological\n            capabilities, and provides credit for financing productive\n            investments in the sector. It would consist of: (a)\n            Technical Assistance: Institutional development for SMIPC to\n            assist it in providing technical assistance to small and\n            medium machinery producers to upgrade their skills and to\n            improve their productivity in using existing technology at\n            the plant level; (b) Training: On-the-job training for top\n            managers and foremen in small and medium machinery\n            enterprises to be provided by SMIPC and by other\n            institutions through arrangements made by SMIPC; and (c)\n            Credit: Lines of credit to SMIB, KLB and CNB, respectively,\n            to finance the investment requirements of the small and\n            medium machinery industry. About 660 individual enterprises\n            would receive technical assistance under the project and\n            about 3,300 managers, engineers and supervisors would be\n            trained in manufacturing processes."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
