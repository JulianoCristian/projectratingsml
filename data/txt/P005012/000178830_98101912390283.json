objective of the project is to\n            provide shelter, employment and urban services for the\n            lowest income groups at costs they can afford, thus\n            eliminating the need for direct public subsidies and\n            permitting the project to be replicated on a larger scale.\n            The project is expected to improve living conditions and\n            increase employment opportunities for an immediate design\n            population of about 120,000 low income persons in Cairo,\n            Alexandria, and Assiut and will be primarily executed by\n            these three Governorates assisted by a central government\n            unit. The project would include six closely related\n            components: (i) comprehensive upgrading of four settlements;\n            (ii) sites and services on two sites; (iii) a small business\n            assistance and manpower training program; (iv) improvement\n            in solid waste collection and disposal; (v) urgent repairs\n            to water supply and sewerage systems; and (vi) technical\n            assistance in project implementation and institution building."}, "docdt": "1978-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
