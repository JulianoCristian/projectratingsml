better quality upon graduation. This\n            will be pursued by: 1) expanding access to junior secondary\n            education in a cost-effective and equitable way; 2)\n            improving the quality of junior secondary education; and 3)\n            strengthening the education management capacity at all\n            levels. To meet these objectives, the following components\n            and subcomponents will be implemented selectively and in\n            varying degrees in the public and private systems of the\n            five project provinces: DI Aceh, West Sumatra, Jambi, South\n            Sumatra, and Lampung. The first objective will involve: 1)\n            creation of a total of 53,520 student school places; 2)\n            gradual expansion of alternative equivalency programs; 3)\n            student and teacher accommodations for public schools in\n            rural and remote areas; and 4) financing of scholarships for\n            32,600 talented poor students with priority given to girls.\n            The second objective will require: 1) strengthening of\n            teachers' subject-matter knowledge and pedagogical\n            skills; 2) enhancement of learning environment; and 3)\n            provision of contract teachers for rural areas. The third\n            objective will be achieved by: 1) training school principals\n            and other administrators in managing schools and providing\n            pedagogical support to teachers; and 2) developing\n            managerial and data analysis capacity."}, "docdt": "1996-08-16T00:00:00Z"}
