sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is modest; Bank performance\n            is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is satisfactory.\n            Some of the key lessons cited were the following: 1) When\n            school communities manage resources they are likely to be\n            used more efficiently and lead to greater long term\n            participation in school development. 2) Improving learning\n            outcomes is complex and teacher training on its own will not\n            bring it about. 3) Within the framework of decentralization,\n            the Central Government must have a role in targeting\n            strategies to address education needs if national goals for\n            basic education are to be achieved. 4) During times of\n            financial crisis, or political change, projects should be\n            designed with a view toward maximum flexibility, and the\n            potential for rapid restructuring as the need arises. 5)\n            There are advantages in cost effectiveness and efficiency\n            when several similar projects are funded concurrently and\n            managed as a single program rather than as separate\n            Projects. 6) Baseline data should always be collected,\n            documented in the Project Appraisal Document, and agreed\n            upon during project preparation. 7) Using contract teachers\n            addresses temporary teacher shortages and introduces\n            increased flexibility into the civil service. 8)\n            Establishing a strongly staffed and well managed project\n            implementation unit is a key factor to successful project\n            implementation. 9) It took time for schools to learn how to\n            match the books and equipment they ordered with actual\n            student needs and the teachers' ability to make\n            effective use of them. 10) Systematic monitoring and\n            evaluation (M&E) is critical to the success of a project\n            with widely dispersed project activities and sites. 11)\n            Geographical targeting of services should be done on the\n            basis of poverty. Estimates should be made down to the\n            village level. Also there should be a pre-commitment to\n            update the \"map\" each year - thereby overcoming\n            the static nature of most poverty map schemes."}, "docdt": "2005-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
