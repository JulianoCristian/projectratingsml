Some lessons learned include:\n            capacity building for results: the lack of capacity in\n            Angola during the period of project implementation needs to\n            be recognized and a review of performance and results\n            achieved needs to take this firmly into account.\n            Implementation arrangements: the establishment of a PCU in\n            the Ministry of Health (MoH), and not the National AIDS\n            Council Multi - Sectoral AIDS project (as with other MAP\n            projects) was positive and relevant at the time. It allowed\n            the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) to develop strong links\n            with each of the three disease programs. Integration and\n            efficiency: looking ahead Angola should focus more on\n            integration of disease specific programs and do more to\n            address system wide constraints. Also further attention\n            should be given to the efficiency and cost effectiveness of\n            services delivered, to maximize value for money.\n            Geographical targeting: any geographical targeting of most\n            in need populations by the project should be documented and\n            accompanied by a clear rationale. Flexibility but with a\n            focus on desired results: the project provided a good degree\n            of flexibility to respond to the rapidly evolving needs and\n            also provided support to fill critical gaps in the national\n            plans. However in supporting new activities the project gave\n            up and missed opportunities to fund some critical\n            interventions (in the original plans) which would have\n            provided a more direct contribution to the projects desired\n            results. (M and E) Monitoring and Evaluation. The Angolan\n            context requires that special attention and support be given\n            in all projects to M and E, especially to establish the\n            baseline and end line data for the project."}, "docdt": "2011-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
