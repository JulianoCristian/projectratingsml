                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project#s development objectives are to: (i) reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS in the Angolan population through a multi-sector approach that strengthens
                         institutional capacity and increases access and utilization of health services for prevention, diagnosis, care, and support; (ii) strengthen the capacity of the
                         health sector to detect new cases of TB, improve treatment compliance, and increase the completion rate; and (iii) strengthen the capacity of the MOH for
                         effective case management of malaria.

                         The average HIV prevalence in Angola at 2%-3.5% during the last 3-5 years is relatively low compared to other countries in the Southern Africa sub region. No major changes of HIV

                         prevalence were observed in the last three surveillance rounds done by the Ministry of Health (MOH) with support from CDC. However in some provinces in the south, the prevalence
                         of HIV is higher (6-9%). Malaria is a major public health problem in Angola. However, according to the 2008 Multi Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), the use of insecticide treated nets

                         to prevent malaria among vulnerable groups is relatively low (16.4% for children under five, and 18.2% for pregnant women). The country made good progress in reducing case-
                         fatality rate due to malaria in public health facilities from an estimated 57% to 3.2 % among mothers and from 45% to 9.9% among children under five. This reduction may reflect
                         improved malaria case management as a partial result of successful roll out of Artemisinin-based Combined Therapy and Rapid Diagnostic Tests. Tuberculosis is also a major public
                         health problem exacerbated by co-infection with HIV. The government remains strongly committed to control HIV/AIDS. The roll out of HIV Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT)
                         services, and of the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT) Program has been successful and surpassed the project targets.
