To this effect, this Environmental Assessment (EA)\n            will help identify, assess, and mitigate potential\n            environmental and social impacts of project activities,\n            including medical wastes. Impacts and control measures for\n            health care centers include: Provision of containers, and\n            protective equipment, and, training for workers to minimize\n            exposure to hazardous waste. A wide awareness program shall\n            be conducted on risks and impacts of hazardous health care\n            waste, to include storage of wastes in containers, and its\n            transportation to municipal disposal sites, following a\n            careful site selection. This should reduce infection\n            spreading, odors, smoke and air pollutants from open\n            burning, and visual impacts. Adequate covering, drainage\n            control, and run-off management should be ensured at storage\n            areas so as to reduce surface, and ground water\n            contamination. An ecological assessment of disease carriers\n            should be conducted at areas planned for facility\n            construction or rehabilitation, followed by identified\n            mitigation measures. Such mitigation for rural water supply\n            and sanitation include water conservation, appropriate sites\n            location to avoid land use conflicts, and ensuring as well\n            sufficient community participation. To minimize\n            contamination and disease, planning of, and training in\n            drainage monitoring, shall be established, as will adequate\n            installation of latrines, and septic systems. Erosion\n            control should be practiced to avoid damage to fragile\n            ecosystems, natural sites and wilderness areas, as well as\n            areas with significant biodiversity."}, "docdt": "2004-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
