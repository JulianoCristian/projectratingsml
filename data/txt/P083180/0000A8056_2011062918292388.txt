                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project#s development objectives are to: (i) reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS in the Angolan population through a multi-sector approach that strengthens
                         institutional capacity and increases access and utilization of health services for prevention, diagnosis, care, and support; (ii) strengthen the capacity of the
                         health sector to detect new cases of TB, improve treatment compliance, and increase the completion rate; and (iii) strengthen the capacity of the MOH for
                         effective case management of malaria.

                         Compared to other Southern African countries, the HIV prevalence in Angola has been maintained at less than 2-3.5% for the last 3-5 years. The country's HIV prevalence varies

                         endemic with transmission occurring throughout the year. The Government's malaria control strategy is based on vector control interventions (use of insecticide treated bed nets,

                         indoor spraying, and larvicide substances), improved diagnosis and enforcement of the use of standard malaria treatment protocols that use Arthemisinin-based Combined Therapy
                         (ACT) as first line. During the last 5 years, case-fatality rate due to malaria among pregnant women and children under the age of five years in public health facilities declined. This
                         reduction has been associated with the roll out of ACT throughout the whole country, and the introduction of Rapid Diagnostic Tests to improve diagnosis of malaria. Tuberculosis
                         (TB) is also a major public health problem exacerbated by co-infection with HIV. The Government remains strongly committed to control HIV/AIDS through the successful roll out of
