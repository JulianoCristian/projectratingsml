It is the\n            Government's first effort to control waterlogging and\n            salinity through improved water management.  Besides\n            removing severe water supply constraints by increasing\n            delivery efficiency of canals and watercourses, it will\n            control excessive seepage and provide surface drainage. The\n            main objectives are to: a) increase agricultural\n            productivity and income; b) reduce the need for expensive\n            subsurface drainage and avert related environmentally\n            harmful effects; and c) improve the equity of water\n            distribution.  To achieve these objectives the project will:\n            1) conserve water by: i) recovering a significant amount of\n            seepage from the larger channels by installing interceptor\n            drains; and ii) preventing seepage from distributaries and\n            minors by providing impervious lining and improving\n            watercourses; 2) provide a network of surface drains in the\n            area to evacuate storm water run off; 3) carry out research\n            on technical and management issues crucial for irrigation\n            and drainage subsectors; 4) provide technical assistance to\n            ensure adequate back-up for implementing agencies and train\n            project staff; and 5) monitor and evaluate the\n            project's impact on groundwater tables and agricultural production."}, "docdt": "1992-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
