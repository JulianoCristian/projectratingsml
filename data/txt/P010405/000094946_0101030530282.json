Lessons learned from this project include: a)\n            Farmers willingly contribute to capital and operation and\n            maintenance (O&M) costs when they are involved in all\n            phases of project cycle. b) Turnover of management of\n            irrigation systems to formal farmer organizations lead to\n            improved equity of water distribution, cost-effective\n            O&M, and improved O&M cost recovery. c) Project\n            interventions that require up-front capital cost\n            contributions by farmers should have effective linkages with\n            micro-credit facilities. d) Capital cost sharing should take\n            into account the social and other disparities between\n            different farm sizes and income groups. e) Effective\n            monitoring arrangements should be in place within\n            implementing agencies to ensure that procurement processes\n            are completed within a reasonable time frame. f) Investments\n            in high-cost sub-surface drainage interventions should be\n            preceded by interventions in water conservation, surface\n            drainage, and improved water management, accompanied by a\n            monitoring program to identify the residual subsurface\n            drainage requirements. g) Investments in canal lining should\n            be preceded by field investigations. h) For waterlogged\n            saline groundwater areas along canals, a system of\n            inter-connected subsurface interceptor and tile drains\n            should be considered. i) Resettlement action plans should be\n            developed through a consultative planning process."}, "docdt": "2000-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
