education, health, road\n            maintenance, and rural development, which will benefit the\n            country's poor in the context of a medium-term\n            expenditure framework (MTEF);  ii) ensure the quality and\n            volume of basic social services while maintaining conditions\n            amenable to a stable macroeconomic situation; and iii)\n            strengthen budget implementation, monitoring, and control.\n            The project has two components.  The first will restructure\n            public expenditures by giving more emphasis to the four\n            sectors identified by the Government as priority areas\n            (education, health, rural development, and road\n            maintenance).  The second will strengthen budgetary\n            implementation and control through the adoption of a\n            computer-based public sector financial system, more rigorous\n            implementation of the regulatory framework, especially those\n            related to financial control and procurement, and the\n            simplification of budgetary processes."}, "docdt": "1997-11-18T00:00:00Z"}
