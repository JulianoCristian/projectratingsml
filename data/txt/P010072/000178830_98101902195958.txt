INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOnIENDATION OF TIE PRESIDENT
TO TIIE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR AN IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for the equivalent of US$6.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for irrigation
development in the Narayani Zone of the Terai near Birganj.
PART I - TH.1E ECONO0Y
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Current Economic Position
and Prospects of Nepal" (SA-7a) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on June 26, 1969. An economic mission visited Nepal last year. The mission's
report will be circulated soon and its findings are summarized below.
3.        Lack of dependable statistical data makes difficult a precise
assessment of the recent economic performance of the Kingdom of Nepal.
Available statistics should therefore be considered as indicating no more
than orders of magnitude and trends. There is, however, evidence that
since 1965 Nepal's real growth has been almost entirely neutralized by
population growth, estimated at 2 percent a year. Nepal is one of least
developed countries in the world with a per capita income of 870-80 per year
and an estimated literacy rate of only 10 percent. Agriculture accounts
for about 70 percent of GDP and provides employment for about 90 percent
of the labor force of which the great majority are subsistence farmers. The
industrial sector is very small and its contribution to GDP has been marginal.
4.        Serious efforts toward development have been underway only since
the late 1950's. Development expenditures have increased rapidly - expanding
from NRs 232 million in 1964/65 to NRs 570 million in 1971/72.    Public invest-
ment has been largely concentrated on infrastructure particularly roads,
power and irrigation facilities.   On average, about half of expenditures for
development during this period have been financed with external assistance,
notably from India, the United States and China. About 80 percent has
been in the form of grants. Nepal's external debt service has thus remained
very low. External reserves have been increasing and as of mid-1972 stood
at $112 million of which about $95 million were in convertible currencies.
5.        In its efforts to formulate and implement development programs
and projects, the Government is faced with unusually severe constraints.
The country is landlocked and the physical resource base is very narrow
consisting mainly of agricultural land, hardwood forests and abundant water
resources available for both power generation and irrigation. No minerals
in commercial quantities have been discovered. Nepal's internal market is



- 2 -
small and production costs tend to be high. About 60 percent of the
population live in the central Hills at or near subsistence levels.     For
lack of transportation facilities, large numbers of communities are virtually
isolated from each other.
6.        Preliminarv analysis of Nepal's future food grain position indicates
that unless timely and effective measures are taken, the current export
surplus (about 300,000 tons of rice per year to India) is likely to turn
into a deficit around the end of this decade. In the Hills, where no addi-
tional land is available and yields are low, the principal requirement is
to increase productivity by means of improved technology and to restructure
agriculture away from food grains towqard more suitable horticulture and
livestock production. In the rolling Terai to the south, food grain production
can be substantially increased not only with improved technology but also
by expanding the area under cultivation and making use of the potential for
extending irrigation and for controlled resettlement in cleared forest areas
and waste land. Cultivated land in Nepal amounts to about 1.8 million ha or
about 13 percent of the total area of the country.    However, only about
120,000 ha are irrigated and all of the systems in operation are designed
primarily to provide supplemental water to the wet season rice crop. Few
of them have significant supplies of water during the dry season and double
cropping is therefore very limited.   Expansion of irrigated agriculture in
areas where double cropping can be practised offers the best Dossibility of
expanding food grain production over the medium term. During the current
five-year plan period (1970-75), the Government's original target was to
bring about 180,000 ha of additional land under irrigation.    This has now
been recognized as far too ambitious in terms of financing,, planning and
management and the target has, therefore, been reduced to roughly 56,000 ha.
7.        Over-population, in the Hills and uncontrolled migration to the
Terai poses a serious threat to future develonment. A greatly expanded land
clearance and resettlement program in the Terai would help to absorb part of
the eYxcess population and, if carefully planned and controlled, could
substantially reduce wasteful destruction of forests and severe erosion of
arable land. Intensive farmiing of new7 irrigated land would also provide a
17velihood for migrant farmers as would a program for systematic and efficient
util:i.zation of Nepal's forest resources.
8.        The bulk of Nepal's rmerchandise trade is with India and, because
of the relatively open border, much of this is unrecorded. Total recorded
merchandise exports to all countries have averaged about $40 million over
t;ie past several years.  Of exports to India, about 50 percent has been rice.
J.ute and jute products account for about 70 percent of exports to third
countries.  Th'e possibilities for export diversification are limited.    The
most prorisiAn; opportunities appear to be in the exploitation of 'Nepal's
forest andi water resources with a view toward developing exports of timber
and energv to India. The principal constraint is inadequiate capacity to plan
ai%m nmanage. Tourism has expanded very rapidly in recent years and continued
h is quite possible provided a program for increasing hotel accommodations
arm otner facilities is implemented.



- 3 -
°.        Over the past seven years (1964/65-1971/72), public revenue and
total public expenditures increased by about 15 percent per year - substan-
tially faster than the growth of GDP - and the ratio of total public revenue
to GD? rose from 3.2 percent to over 5.2 percent, while the ratio of total
expenditures to GDr went up from 5.9 to 9.3 percent. Since 1964/65 develop-
ment expenditures have more than doubled and increased their share of GDP
from 3.9 to 5.7 percent. Foreign grants, which on the average amounted to
about one-half of development expenditures, grew by over 9 percent per annum.
Current savings which represent about a third of current revenues now finance
only about 30 percent of development expenditures. Despite a significant
rise in the ratio of public revenue to GDP over the past decade and the fact
that much of the economy is non-monetized, Nepal's tax effort remains low.
Substantial and prompt improvement will be necessary if development expendi-
tures are to continue growing at a satisfactory rate.
10.       Another important constraint on Nepal's economic development,
however, has been the Government's capacity to plan, appraise and implement
development programs and projects. The problem is apparent in all sectors
and its principal elements include poor coordination of closely related
programs; lack of progress reporting and evaluation; defective project
formulation and implementation; and general difficulty in taking decisions
within the Government. Given Nepal's late awakening to the process of
economic development, these problems are not unexpected. W4hile noteworthy
attempts at improvements have been undertaken in the last .few years, much
remains to be done, and substantial technical assistance will be required
to supplement the limited Nepalese staff that possesses requisite skills.
11.       As Nepal's absorptive capacity rises, the country should be able
to handle larger volumes of new investment. The outlook for a continued
flow of bilateral grant aid on the scale of the past is uncertain. In view
of the continuing rapid increase in planned public capital expenditures,
Nepal's currently comfortable foreign exchange position is unlikely to be
a permanent feature. Moreover, the country's prospects for earning convertible
currencies are limited and, in view of its extreme poverty, Nepal's require-
ments for foreign assistance from new sources on soft terms could rise rapidly
in the future.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NEPAL
12.       The first IDA credit to Nepal in the amount of $1.7 million equiv-
alent was made in FY 1970 for a telecommunications project. This was fol-
lowed by development credits for a highway ($2.5 million) and a tourism
projects ($4.2 million). The proposed credit would bring the total amount
of IDA assistance to Nepal to $14.4 million equivalent. There have been no
Bank loans to Nepal and there are no IFC operations in the country.
13.       Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of
January 31, 1973, and notes on the execution of on-going projects.



- 4 -
14.       Bank Group lending to N4epal has so far been at a modest level
compared to the country's needs for, and total receipts of, external assis-
tance. This is due to the relatively large amounts of assistance given Nepal
by other donors , and the country's limited absorptive capacity, affecting
the pace of project identification, preparation and implementation. The
past and prospective development of Bank Group operations in Nepal reflect
the country's needs (a) to place major emphasis upon agriculture, forestry
and small-scale industry; (b) to give special attention to integrated schemes
within the agricultural sector upon which economic development in Nepal
basically depends; and (c) to continue assistance for the development of
infrastructure, including water supply, feeder roads and other forms of
communications, particularly betwEen the Hills and the Terai.   Projects in
these sectors will help to raise income and living standards and promote the
economic integration of the country.
15.       A second telecommunications project has been appraised and is
scheduled for your consideration before the end of the fiscal year, while
a mission to appraise a water supply and sewerage project is scheduled for
next month. Further along a forestry/settlement project will be appraised
and a second highway project identified. Missions are also scheduled
during the next year for the identification of further irrigation, rural
development and livestock projects. In view of the institutional constraints
and shortage of trained personnel in Nepal, the identification, preparation
and implementation of these projects is likely to require more time and
effort on the part of the Bank:, as well as greater inputs of technical
assistance, than is common in other countries. For this reason, training
assistance will be an important: element in many future projects, as it is
in the proposed credit. In view of Nepal's extreme poverty and low savings
capacity, some local currency f-inancing of projects - as in the proposed
project - will be recommended i'n appropriate cases, especially where the
foreign exclhange component of the investment is relatively small.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN NEPAL
16.       Nepal's agricultural resources are determined to a large extent
by topographic conditions. Paddy is the main crop covering 54% of the
cultivated land. The Terai, containing hardwood forests and about 70
;ercent of the cultivated land, produces about two-thirds of total agricultural
outp'It. Besides foodgrains, it also produces oil seeds, jute, sugarcane
and hardwoods. In the Hills, maize is the main crop: wheat, barley, paddy
and millet are also grown here, largely on a subsistence basis. Family
hioldings in tne hills are estimated as being between 0.2 to 0.6 ha. The
corresponding figure ranges from 0.9 to 6.8 ha in the Terai.   During
1965-1970, the sectoral growth rate was estimated at only 1.8 percent per
annu-m as compared to 3.8 percent in the non-agricultural sector (both in
real terms). Food grain output has probably grown at less than 1% a year
and tile c2-real surplus available for export has declined from 500,000 tons
to an estimated 300,000 tons a year over the past decade. The performance



- 5 -
of other cash crops has varied. Jute production, which provides 70 percent
of the country's earnings of convertible currencies, has increased by
about 5 percent per annum. However, yields are low and the quality poor.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is financing a rehabilitation program in
this sector which would improve the competitive position of jute. Oilseed
production is increasing and mustard seeds are an important export to India.
Sugarcane production is also increasing although yields are still low.
Production of tobacco and spices has been stagnating.
17.       The major development constraints include inadequate irrigation
and drainage facilities, the low level of modern agricultural inputs and
the shortage of trained manpower. Although rainfall in Nepal is substan-
tial, it is heavily concentrated during the monsoon season. Irrigation
and drainage works are thus essential for reliable crop production,
but the total irrigated area is at present only about 7% of the cultivated
land. This represents, however, a notable improvement over the position
only ten years ago when public irrigation works covered only about 2% of
the cultivated area. Existing irrigation systems are mainly semi-perennial
for wet season irrigation and drainage is inadequate. Approximately 20-30%
of the irrigated areas produce a second crop. More sophisticated
irrigation works designed for double cropping need to be instituted where
water can be supplied from the few major rivers that have a dry weather
flow in order to realize significant improvements in agricultural production.
Longer term needs include storage reservoirs on the main rivers and
research to identify crops and varieties which will give maximum returns
under irrigation.
18.       In its Fourth Five-Year Plan (1970-1975), the Government has
placed emphasis on the completion of on-going irrigation works, including
the proposed project and two similar projects being financed by the ADB.
A number of other programs have also been undertaken to develop the
agricultural sector. An Intensive Agricultural Development Program,
providing mainly extension services, has been established in 28 districts
(out of 75) where land and other necessary resources are considered suitable.
Efforts have been made to introduce better crop varieties and to encourage
a more intensive use of fertilizers and crop protection techniques. The
Agricultural Marketing Corporation (AMC) supplies inputs to farmers and
regulates the marketing of farm produce. The Agricultural Development
Bank of Nepal (ADBN) provides agricultural credit to farmers. Besides
teclnical assistance, ADBN has received a loan of $2.4 million from the
ADB for the supply of tractors and pumpsets to farmers on credit.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
19.       The proposed project would permit year-round irrigation in the
project area which represents approximately 25% of the total irrigated land
in Nepal. Besides the construction of irrigation and drainage facilities,
the project would introduce improved irrigation practices, improved operation
and maintenance, agricultural extension and other elements of successful



-6-
irrigated agriculture. The feasibility study for this project was conducted
by consulting engineers, Nippon Koei of Japan, financed by the UNDP and
with assisEance from the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program. Appraisal of the
project is based on this study and on the findings of an appraisal mission
which visited Nepal during November/December 1971. The report of the appraisal
mission entitled "Appraisal of Birganj Irrigation Project (Narayani Zone)"
(No. PA-146a) dated March 1, 1973 is being circulated separately. A credit
and project sulmmary is attached as Annex III.
20.       At the negotiations held in Washington in January 1973, the
Kingdom of Nepal (HMGN) was represented by His Excellency K. S. Sharma,
Ambassador of Nepal in Washington, Mr. B. P. Rinal, First Secretary at the
Embassy, Mr. L. B. Shrestha, Under-Secretary for Finance, and Mr. B. K.
Pradhan, Deputy Director General for Irrigation.
21.       The proposed project illustrates the importance to land-locked
Nepal of close economic cooperation with India.   The 1959 Gandak Irrigation
and Power Project Agreement (the Ganddak Agreement) between HMGN and the
Government of India (GOI) and subsequent exchanges between the two countries
regulate the international aspects of the Gandak River waters. Under this
agreement India constructed a barrage on the Gandak River on the India--Nepal
border, a small hydroelectric station, and various major irrigatiorn works
commanding an area of 1.2 million ha in India and 60,000 ha in Nepal, includ-
ing the project area. India agreed to construct the Nepal Eastern Canal
which extends from the Don Branch Canal at the Indian border to the Bagmati
River in Nepal, and a distributary system down to canals of 0.57 m3/sec capa-
city (IBRD Maps Nos. 3895 and 3896 attached). Construction of the remainder
of the distributary system below 0.57 m3/sec is the responsibility of HMGN
with India contributing 1.5 million Indian Rupees ($200,000) towards the
cost of this construction, Works constructed under the Gandak Agreement are
scheduled for completion this month. India has undertaken to deliver 24.1
m3/sec of water into the Nepal Eastern Canal at all times, except during
annual maintenance of the Don Branch Canal. Sat:isfactory arrangemrents have
also been agreed between GOI and HMGN for the operation, maintenance and
repair of the Don Branch Canal.
22.       The project would complete the const.ruction of the canal distributary
system to irrigate 28,700 ha near Birganj, and provide tubewell irrigation
Lo 2,700 ha in an adjoining area. It includes drainage, on-farm development,
ofice buillings, project staff quarters, cooperative stores, procurement
of vehicles arid equipment, agricultural extension, and cooperative services
Lo pro'ride inputs and credit to farmers, providing an integrated approach
to the agricultural development of the project area.   In addition it would
i;iclude the preparation of feasibility studies for a small pumping scheme and
a future irrigation project.
23.       The project would be executed by the Narayani Zone Irrigation
Development Board (NZIDB), recently established as an autonomous government
agency, having jurisdiction over an area encompassing five administrative
districts, in two of which lies the project area. The appointment of NZIDB's
2-eral Manager, with qualifications and experience acceptable to the
---&ociatica. would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.



-7-
The staff of NZIDB would be trained by a consultant team in the planning,
design, construction, operation, maintenance and management of both the
surface and groundwater irrigation systems as well as in agricultural develop-
ment. Since NZIDB would be a new agency, drawing its key staff from several
ministries, its success in implementing and managing the project would depend
on strong support from HMGN as well as on the assistance and training of NZIDB
staff by the consultants. Because of the heavy monsoon rains the construction
season is limited to November to June. The proposed project is expected to
be completed by June 1978. Improvement of the existing 14 tubewells and the
construction of the 14 new tubewells and their canal distributary systems
would be performed in the dry season of 1974/75. On-farm development would
be carried out by farmers' own labor. Should a farmer fail to carry out
on-farm development works within one year after the completion of the
tertiary canals and drains in the project serving his farm, NZIDB would
carry out these works and recover the cost from him. Irrigation water
would be released to farms only after on-farm development works have been
completed.
24.       The total project cost is estimated at US$10.1 million equivalent,
including price contingency allowance of 7% per annum for local costs and
of 5 percent per annum for foreign costs on the unexpended balance. 1/ The
foreign exchange component is estimated at US$4.0 million, or 39% of the total
cost. Under the proposed credit, IDA would finance the entire foreign ex-
change cost of civil works, equipment and spares and consultants - plus 33%
of the local costs, i.e. about 59% of the project cost. HMGN would finance
31% of the project cost; included in HMGN's share would be the $200,000 from
India. The remaining 10% of the project cost would be met by farmers'
contributions in the form of labor for on-farm development work. Equipment
and vehicles would be procured and civil works contracts awarded after
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Association's
Guidelines. Civil works contractors would be prequalified. Disbursements
from the credit account would be made on the basis of 100% of foreign ex-
penditures for equipment, spare parts and consultants and 85% of total
expenditures for civil works contracts. Water charges would be collected
from beneficiary farmers to cover operation and maintenance costs starting
one year after completion of on-farm works and release of water. Charges
would be raised gradually over a reasonable period of time to cover as much
of the investment cost of the project as practicable, having due regard to
farmers' incentives to produce and capacity to pay.
25.       The major benefit from the project would be the substantial
increase in foodgrain production in the project area, mainly rice and wheat,
1/   Cost estimate calculations in this Report and in the Appraisal Report
are based on the rates of exchange in force prior to February 13, 1973.
As a result of the devaluation of the U.S. dollar, foreign costs ex-
pressed in U.S. dollars are likely to increase by $200,000 - $300,000.
However, the Nepalese Rupee, which initially followed the U.S. dollar,
was further devalued    on February 20, by 4.12% vis-a-vis the dollar,
which has the effect of reducing the dollar equivalent of the local
currency component of the project by about $200,000. On balance, there-
fore, the direct effect of the currency changes is to leave project costs
expressed in U.S. dollars and hence the proportion to be financed by the
proposed credit, virtually unchanged.



!.'C1i \woluld lead to an increased agricultural income and employment opportuni-
ties for some 20,000 farm families. The primary beneficiaries would include
the majority of the project area population who are subsistence smallholders
wtnf current incomes below the national average farm income.    At full
developmiient of the project, the annual gross value of project agricultural
output is expected to increase from the current MRs 47 million to NRs 122
million, more than doubling thie projected output without the project (.\Rs 51
million). The economic rate of return would be about 21% if GOI expenditures
in constructing the barrage, main canals, surface and tubewell irrigation
facilities attributable to ciie project and estimated at $5. lnillion are
treated as suTik costs; or 14%, if they are included in tihe first year without
interest. The economic rate of return for the tubewell scheme alone, wzhich
has been included in order to expand an existing pilot tubewell project and
to develop institutional capacity for construction and management of future
tub)ewell irrigation projects, would be about 14%.  Other intangible but
im-portant benefits include tihe demonstration effects of the project,
institution-building and training which would set an example for, and contribute
to, agricultural development in Neepal.
26.       The project would neitlher require resettlement of farmers nor
constructioni of new villages. It would provide drainage which would help
reduce floods and soil erosion and minimize water-logging. In addition,
increased production, particularly of pulses and vegetables, would improve
thie quality of human nutriticn.  NIZIDB, through its Extension Services Section,
would train farmers in the proper use of cihemicals to control pests and rodents.

(i) Credit No. 166 Telecommunications Project; US$1.7 million Credit
of November 10, 1969; Closing Date: July 1, 1974
After initial delays in making the credit effective, delay in
signing an agreement with India for construction of the Biratnagar exchange
which is an essential part of the project and delays in taking procurement
action, this project is now proceeding satisfactorily and completion is
expected by December 1974, some 18 months behind schedule. The total cost
of the project has increased from US$4.15 million to US$5.27 million, partly
due to a decision of the Government that customs duties must be paid on all
imported items. As of January 31, 1973, all but US$252,000 of this credit
was committed.
(ii) Credit No. 223 Highway Project; US$2.5 million Credit of
December 21, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
Difficulties in acquiring land and procuring certain bridge materials
have delayed construction of the five project bridges by up to nine months.
Contractors are now expected to complete construction of all bridges by about
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weakness in project execution.

the middle of 1974. Procedures involved in opening letters of credit with
some suppliers and procurement problems witr a foreign contractor delayed
the delivery of certain work-shop and highway equipment by about eight months.
The bid price for road bridges is about 10 percent above the cost estimate;
however, it is still within the contingency allowed. The estimated cost of
other project elements is thes same as appraised.
(iii) Credit No. 291 Tourism Project; US$4.2 million Credit of
March 22, 1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1975
The Credit was decLared effective on November 9, 1972. Due to
delav in meeting the conditions of effectiveness and delays in appointing
qualified architectural, engineering and project management consultants,
the project is almost one year behind schedule. A project management
contract will soon be signed for the Hotel de L'Annapurna expansion and
construction is expected to start later this vear.
