       presents the PDOs as follows: The project's development objective is to limit and reverse the trend of the epidemic by
       preventing new infections. The Umbrella restructuring presents the original PD~ by combining the wording in the
       DGA and the PAD; see. Par. 47.

1.   Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Country context. For most of the decade prior to project appraisal, Guinea suffered from a variety
of problems contributing to a deteriorating mv/AIDS situation, including:
         •      dramatic poverty with UNDP's Human Development Index ranking Guinea as the poorest
                country in the world between 1992 and 1994 and 16200 of 174 in 2000;
         •      regional strife in Liberia and Sierra Leone resulting in an influx of nearly half a million refugees
                as well as the internal displacement of a similar number of Guineans;
         •      domestic political instability with frequent charges of electoral irregularities and a rapid turnover
                among the political leadership; and
         •      poor. performance on key social indicators (health, education, water, etc.) even in comparison
                with other Sub Saharan Africa countries.
2.      HlV/AIDS ~ituation. Guinea anticipated the seriousness of mv/AIDS by creating the National
AIDS Commission in January 1986, more than a year before the official notification of the first cases.2 But
its overall response was somewhat slow and uncoordinated; three short-term plans to combat the epidemic
were subsequentlyimpleniented (with donor assistance) emphasizing the following interventions:
     •       1987-90: (i) raising awareness and training to improve hospital capabilities in Conakry (at the two
             university teaching hospitals) and in the mining areas (Fria .and Kamsar); (ii) strengthening
             prevention (via blood transfusion and mother-to-child transmission); and (iii) improving diagnosis
             and biological surveillance of AIDS cases3 • Epidemiological surveys of mvIAIDS in 1989 and
             1990 estimated prevalence in Conakry and in rural towns at 0.96% and 1.78% respectively.
     •       1990-95: (i) the syndromic care in basic health facilities for patients with sexually-transmitted
             diseases; and (ii) the· mobilization of social groups, especially young people at school and sex
             workers.
     •       1995-99: (i) recognizing the long-term nature of the epidemic and the need to establish an
             organizational framework; (ii) adopting a national strategy to include a political dimension to the
             technical approach used previously; and (iii) envisioning future possibilities for the treatment of
             persons infected by the disease.
3.      Although these plans addressed a number of the future Multi-Sectoral mvIAIDS Program (MAP)
elements, they did not succeed in reducing prevalence; the frrst national survey undertaken in J~ly 2001
showed that the mv prevalence rate was much higher than previously estimated. The prevalence rate among
pregnant women had reached 4.4% in the urban areas throughout the country, with even higher rates in
Conakry (5%) and in the forested region of Eastern Guinea (7%). In addition to the increasing extent of the
epidemic, the survey showed two other alarming trends: (i) a change in the gender ratio of mv-infected
paqents from 8 men to 1 woman (in the late 80's) to 2 women for 1 man (in 2000); and (ii) a decrease in the
average age of AIDS cases from 39 years old (in 1989) to 26 years old (in 1999). Finally, the survey found
mv to be particularly prevalent within specific groups, including: sex workers, people suffering from a
sexually transmitted infection or tuberculosis, truck drivers, the military, and mine-workers.
4.      The publication of the results of the 2001 survey had a profound effect on policy makers, key social
players and development partners, and the population as a whole. Discussion of the epidemic focused on: (i)
the factors contributing to the spread of the disease (inadequate knowledge and inappropriate attitudes,
sexuality at an early age, high prevalence of risky behavior, subOrdinate status and lack of empowerment



2 Concurrently, beginning in the l~ 1980's, Guinea initiated several important reforms in the delivery of primary health
care, including decentralization, cost recovery, and essential drugs.
3 Considered a proxy for the population as a whole, given the absence of national population data.



                                                                                                                      1
among women, importance of mining and trucking activities, and large numbers of refugees and displaced
people); and (ii) the weaknesses of the health service delivery system.      .
5.      Beginning in 2002, the country critically analyzed the Government's response to the AIDS epidemic
and initiated several important measures to strengthen the response and qualify for MAP n financing.
Specifically the country:
    •    formu~ated  a multi-sectoral strategy in the fight against AIDS over the period 2002-2006, which: (i)
         emphasized seven priority areas; and (ii) highlighted the specific needs of the most wlnerable
         groups such as the young, the military, inhabitants of zones with a high concentration of refugees·
         and prostitutes, and mobile populations; and
    •    strengthened the structures to coordinate the fight against IllY/AIDS by: (i) replacing the National
         Commission to Fight AIDS (chaired by the Minister of Health) with a multi-sectoral National AIDS
         Commission (CNLS) l,lDder the leadership of the Prime Minister; and (ii) establishing focal points
         for AIDS activities in most central ministries as well as at regional, prefectoral, and district levels.
6.       Further, by recruiting an Executive Secretary for the CNLS, deciding to select an independent
agency to oversee financial management, and agreeing to fund activities undertaken by the private sector,
civil society organizations, including religious groups, local associations, and communities, Guinea met the
eligibility conditions for MAP.
7.       Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement. Among Bank strategy
documents, the 1997 CAS noted the country's significant efforts to decentralize health services, provide
essential drugs, and involve local communities in financing and managing health services, but IllV/AIDS
was not mentioned until 2000, initially. in the interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP) and
subsequently in the CAS Progress Report (July 2001)4. The IPRSP emphasized the need to address the
''urgent emerging" AIDS threat through medical and non-medical means by: (i) stabilizing or reducing the
incidence ofIllV/AIDS; and (ii) controlling its socioeconomic impact.
8.      The Multi-Country IllY/AIDS Program for the Africa Region established the epidemic at the center
of the development agenda and argued that curtailing the spread of IllY was pivotal for the achievement of
human and overall development goals in the region and· in countries such as Guinea. According to Bank
analysis,Guinea's progress in moving from a state-controlled to a market-based economy, in focusing on
poverty issues and strategies, and in improving the delivery of basic services to the population would not be
sustainable if strong efforts, backed by the international community, were not made to help Guinea
implement its IllV/AIDS program. The Bank further noted that donors had expressed interest in supporting
the program and indicated that Bank involvement was essential for its success.
9.       The CAS Progress Report recommended the preparation of an IllY/AIDS project under the MAP
operation, suggesting that: (i) the Bank retrofit its ongoing operations to include and/or strengthen IllV/AIDS
components; and (ii) the Government use the decentralized structures and systems being strengthen~ in
other programs as an innovative approach for the proposed project to tackle IllV/AIDS. The PAD itself did
not list any alternatives considered, though the project concept document review notes three which might
have been considered: a ministry of health-based project, an IllV component in a Health SWAP, or a part of
a broader communicable disease control project.
10.     Bank support for Guinea's efforts to fight IllV/AIDS· was justified by insufficient donor funding' for
the response and inadequate resources to scale up existing and proposed interventions. Overall, the Project

S In addition to the traditional UN agency support, bilateral support included USAID and KfW (social marketing of
condoms) and GTZ and Canada (treatment of STI). A number of national and international NGOs were also providing
services.

                                                                                                               2
Appraisal Document (PAD) estimated that Bank funding would essentially double the financial resources
available to fund the country's response. Further, it was expected that Bank support to the Strategic Plan,
together with its ability to ensure an appropriate fiduciary architecture and to attract donor interest would
catalyze a coherent, multi-sectoral, and well-funded response to HIV/AIDS in Guinea.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
11.     As presented in the PAD, the overall objective of the project is to limit and reverse the trend of the
epidemic by preventing new infections. In addition, the project was expected to contribute to building
capacity for HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment, and mitigation activities6•            .

12.      More specifically, the PAD stated that the project would: (i) assist the Borrower in implementing the
National Plan against HIV/AIDS (PNLS) for the period 2003-06 and promoting civil society and community
initiatives for prevention and care put forward by beneficiary groups so as to prevent the spread of
HN/AIDS; (ii) expand People Living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA)'s access to treatment, care and
support; and (iii) support civil society and community initiatives for HIV/AIDS prevention and care.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
13.     The original PDOs were formally revised in May 2007 as part of an umbrella restructuring of eight
MAP projects which, among other things, eliminated HN prevalence as a PD~, proposed a more strategic
management of the epidemic, and recommended modifications in institutional arrangements. As restructured,
the overall development objectives of the Project were to: (i) increase HIV/ AIDS knowledge and promote
low risk behaviors; and (ii) improve the coverage and use of HIV/AIDS prevention, care, treatment, and
support services.
14.     Data on the original and revised key outcome and intermediate outcome indicators are presented in
Section F of the Data Sheet and discussed in more detail in Section 3.2 and Annex 2.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries and Benefits
15.      Though national in scope, the project was expected to reach about 50% of the country's population
through one or several of the proposed interventions (e.g. information and awareness, condom distribution,
voluntary testing and counseling, STI diagnosis, blood safety, etc.). Coverage of targeted groups was
expected to be higher, specifically for: (i) youths, women, and high-risk populations (sex workers, truck
drivers, military, and miners) meriting prevention programs7; (ii) people currently infected by HIV and their
immediate families benefiting from improved care and support; and (iii) orphans and families headed by
children targeted for educational and other types of assistance. The PAD also indicated that project
implementation would monitor benefits to ensure that communities were not left behind and that high-
powered groups do not get disproportionate support from the project.
16.     The project was expected to have a number of positive benefits, including: (i) reducing the costs
associated with Guinea's current burden of disease (STIs, tuberculosis, and other opportunistic infections)
and future expenditures for treatment and care; (ii) lowering child mortality related to the number of HIV-
infected newborns; and (iii) extending the productive lives of people infected with HIV/AIDS and mitigating
the economic and social impact of AIDS particularly for vulnerable populations affected by HIV/AIDS. In
addition, public, private, and community institutions were expected to benefit from the project's contribution




6 The PD~ are phrased as follows in the Development Grant Agreement (DGA): The objective of the Project is to
support the Recipient's multi-sectoral efforts to limit and contain the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic through: (1)
implementation of the Recipient's HIV/AIDS National Plan to increase access to prevention services as well as care and
support for those infected and affected by mvI AIDS; and (2) promotion of civil society and community initiatives for
mvIAIDS prevention.
7 The project made a conscious decision not to address refugees as they were targeted by several NGOs.



                                                                                                                    3
to strengthening the technical, financial, and managerial capabilities of the various implementing agencies
involved.
1 ..5 Original Components
17.      Component 1: Support to community-based initiatives (USS 10.00 miUion). By providing grant
resources to support a broad range of community, civil society and private sector initiatives, the component
intended to empower communities to address lllVIAIDS prevention, care, mitigation, and support. Building
on existing IDA-fmanced initiatives in health and social development and especially on the participatory
approach used by the Projet d'Appui aux Communautes Villageoises (PACV) project, the project intended to
rely on two main typesofNGOs: (i) those that help local communities cany out their participatory diagnosis;
and (ti) those that are specialized in and provide certain services to the communities. The project supported:
(i) the assessment and registration ofNGOs based on their experience. and capabilities; (ii) the participatory
diagnoses by NGOs to raise community awareness and stimulate demand for information and services, (iii)
the preparation of community action plans for approval and financing by the governing rural development
committee (CRD) or urban commune (CU); and (iv) the implementation and supervision of a small grants
program administered by the CRD/CU for the benefit of the successful communities.
18.     Component 2: Support to the public sector (USS 5.94 miDion). This Component was intended to:
(i) improve the capacity of all line ministries (both central and regional) to respond to the lllV/AIDS
epidemic by integrating lllVIAIDS activities into ongoing operations and activities; (ii) provide ministerial
staff and their dependents with lllV/AIDS and STI education, training, and care-related support; and (iii)
develop AIDS-related activities emphasizing prevention and care for those constituencies falling within their
mandate. Though all ministries were eligible to receive support for their annual action plan, ten ministries
and their constituencies were considered priority: Health; Education (in-school youths); Youth, Sports and
Culture (out-of-school youths); Social Affairs (persons living with lllVI AIDS and orphans); Interior
(uniformed services); Transport and Public Works (truckers and transporters); Tourism (sex workers); and
Mines, Geology and the Environment (miners). The Ministry of Communication was also included for its
contribution to advocacy, information, and marketing.
19.      Among the priority ministries, the Ministry of Health was designated to receive the largest share of
fmancing for core activities related to: (i) prevention (condom distribution, blood screening and transfusion,
management of sexually transmitted infections, voluntary counseling and testing, mother-to-child-
transmission); (ii) care and treatment (at both primary and referral levels); and (iii) national sentinel
surveillance. Antiretroviral therapy (ARn was only to be established on a pilot basis for 150 patients after
the conditions ~or buying ARV drugs were in place.
20.     In addition, the project supported efforts to manage hazardous waste including: (i) the development
of disposal methods (acquisition of incinerators, burial, etc.); and (ii) the training of health workers in
handling lllVIAIDS hazardous materials.
21.      Component 3: Capacity buUding (USS 1.66 mllUon). This component was intendedto.fmance: (i)
updating of the national lllV/AIDS Strategy and Action Plan; (ii) strengthening of public and private
institutions in lllV/AIDS prevention and care through technical assistance; (iii) cross-cutting support
(training, communication, procurement, etc.) for Components 1 and 2; and (iv) studies and surveys for
monitoring and evaluation purposes. In particular, the component envisaged contracts to private entities with
the demonstrated capabilities: (i) to expand lllVIAIDS services more quickly and to regions not yet covered;
and (ii) to contribute to the professionalization and sustainability of the fight against lllV/AIDS.
22.       Component 4:. Project Coordination and Facllitation (USS 2.70 miUion). This component was
intended to support the operations of: (i) the National Commission against lllVIAIDS (CNLS) located in the
Prime Minister's Office; (ii) the Executive Secretariat responsible for adminiStrating, coordinating, and
facilitating project implementation; and (iii) the regional, prefectoral, and sub-prefectoral committees
responsible for supervising the implementation of action plans and proposals at local levels. This component
also financed the recruitment of an independent financial management agency.


                                                                                                            4
 1.6 Revised Components
 23.     The restructuring of the project did not alter the original four project components.
 1.7· Other significant changes
 24.     During implementation, the original Development Grant Agreement (DGA) was amended to: (i)
 modify implementation procedures;· (ii) revise project outcomes; (iii) reallocate the proceeds of the project;
 and (iv) extend the closing date.
 25.      Revisions ofproject implementation procedures were approved: (i) in August 2003 to correct the
 procurement threshold for small works to reduce the proportion of subproject co-financing by the beneficiary
 from 20% to 10%; (ii) in October 2005 8 to permit project fmancing of the previously omitted regional AIDS
 committees (CRLS),to assign the CRLS the responsibility of approving the CRD/CU action plans, and to
 further reduce the beneficiary co-fmancing requirement from 10% to 5% either in cash or in kind9; and (iii)
 in August 2007 to incorporate revised thresholds for procurement.
 26.   Revisions of project outcomes were approved in July 2007 as part of the umbrella restructuring of
 theMAPsIO.
 27.      Reallocations of project proceeds were approved: (i) in October 2005 to replace counterpart funding
 requirements for categories 3 (20%) and 7 (10010) with the Government's proposal to waive duties and taxes
 on all items used for the fight against lllV/AIDSl1; (ii) in March 2006 to increase the amounts for goods and
 training and decrease the amount for sub grants; and (iii) in March 2007 to further increase the amounts for
 goods, consultants, and training and further decrease the amount for sub grants.
  28.     Revision of the initial project closing w~ approved in February 2008 to extend the closing date from
  July 31,2008 to December 11; 2008 (to take into account the length of the Bank's suspension of operations
. during the months of civil strife).
 29.       The delay in producing the ICR, originally scheduled for June 2009 and subsequently extended
 several times (ultimately to June 2011) was the result of the coup d'etat and the subsequent application of the
 OPIBP 7.30, suspending Bank missions to Guinea until December 2010 when they resumed.
 2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outeomes
 2.1 Project Preparation, Design and .Quality at Entry
 30.      Project preparation. An initial "pre-identification" mission was conducted in May 2001 to discuss
 an lllVIAIDS project, but concerted project preparation began in January 2002. Bank preparation of the
 project emphasized: (i) the eligibility conditions for the MAP and the broader lessons learned from earlier
 projects; (ii) an appreciation of the specificities of the Guinean situation (and the previous national program)
 and the experiences of on-going IDA funding for the health project, including: the Projet Population Sante
 Genesique (pPSG), the Projet d'Appui aux Communautes Villageoises (pAcV), and the Programme de
 Renforcement des Capacites Institutionnelles (pRCI); and (iii) a participatory approach involving the full
 range of potential actors able to contribute to a multi-sectoral approach. Like many of the MAP project
 preparations, this one was marked by periods of intense activity (to agree on technical components, identify
 activities, etc.) and lengthy delays (to sort out implementation arrangements).




 8 The Government actually requested this amendment in June 2004, but it was not approved by LEGAF until September
 2005.
 9 The intention was to harmonize and align MAP and Global Fund procedures.            .
 10 In August 2006, following the mid-term review, the project requested changes in the PD~; this request was never
 formally acted upon, but it was referred to by the Bank when it formally communicated (in September 2008) its
 approval of the restructured project indicators approved in May 2007.
 I Counterpart financing for Category 7 had previously been reduced from 20% to 10% during negotiations.



                                                                                                                 5
31.     Project preparation was supported by a Japanese Trust Fundl2 to contract consulting services to: (i)
carry out assessments (of NGOs, Traditional Healers); (ii) formulate strategies (Mother-to-Child
transmission, a 100% condom strategy for target groups, an orphans strategy, a private sector strategy); (iii)
develop plans (communications, waste management Plan; and (iv) prepare for project implementation
(Manuals of Operation, design ofa management training program). The work fmanced under the trust fund
in 2001 was used to finalize the National Strategy for 2003-07, which had previously been prepared with
UNAIDS assistance l3 .
32.      The Project Concept Document (PCD) was reviewed in March 2002 and addressed three key issues:
(i) the Government's reluctance to contract out the fmancial management of project funds to the non-state
sector; (ii) the implementation arrangements and incentives for a minimum number of core implementing
staff; and (iii) the need to focus the project more on prevention than on care and more on target groups
(specifically, commercial sex workers, men-having-sex-with-men, truckers, miners, and the military) rather
than on the general population, except in those parts of the country where the epidemic had started to spread.
33.      Based on the experience with other MAPs, the PCD review was also concerned about the sequence
and timing of project appraisal to ensure that the Bank approval process (with a tentative Board date prior to
June 30, 2002) did not get ahead of the requirements to adopt regulations, appoint necessary staff, agree on
acceptable fmancial management arrangements, conduct specifi,c studies (including the waste management
plan), etc.
34.      A Project Preparation Facilityl4 in the amount of $700,000 was approved on April 12, 2002 and was
expected to fmance: (i) the capacity strengthening and logistics needs of the CNLS, as well as essential
consultancies during the remaining phase of project preparation; and (ii) the launching of pilot and other
activities both under the public sector and local response components. Disbursement from the Project
Preparation Facility (PPF) wasvery slow, utilizing just $70,000 of the total advance as of the original closing
date. IS                          '

35.     An initial pre-appraisal mission was conducted in March-April 2002, and a subsequent pre-appraisal
mission was conducted in May 2002. The Decision Meetings of June 3 and June 20, 2002 retroactively
considered the second pre-appraisal mission ,as the appraisal mission. While a number of agreements were in
place as of May 2002 (establishment of the national committee, technical agreements with existing projects
to supervise key activitie&, etc.), several important actions were identified, including fmalizing: (i) project
operations and fmancial management manuals; (ii) monitoring and evaluation arrangements; and (iii)
baseline data surveys. In addition, the mission emphasized the need for the Government to contribute to
counterpart fmancing as a condition of negotiationsl .
36.      Several modifications were incorporated into the project design to keep the project on what the
decision meeting called a ''fast track". These included: (i) reducing the number of effectiveness conditions;
(ii) agreeing on grant initial procedures for funding the community projects}'; and (iii) modifying first year
plans and'expected expenditures. Delays in meeting the required conditions (especially fiduciary) postponed



12 Signed in April 2001 with an original closing date of October 30, 2002, the Japanese PHRD grant (TF026713) was
subsequently extended to December 3, 2002 and then to March 28, 2003 when the project became effective. Of the
total amount ofUS$383,900, US$254,294 (66%) was disbursed.                                           .
13 The January-February 2002 aide memoire lists 6-7 studieslconsultancies to be financed by the PHRD, but the results
for only half of these are listed in the document file and/or were available in the field.
14 Signed on April 29, 2002, the PPF (p073378) was closed on March 28, 2003 when the project became effective. Of
the total amount ofUS$700,000, US$511,306 (73%) was disbursed.                                      ,
IS The' original closing date of September 25, 2002 for the PPF was subsequently extended to March 31, 2003 to
coincide with expected effectiveness date of the project.
16 The original amount of the counterpart contribution of 800 million GNF was reduced at negotiations to 300 million
GNF with an additional 375 million GNF to be deposited six months after effectiveness.
17 It was always intended to modify these arrangements based on the experience gained during implementation.



                                                                                                                   6
negotiations until October 2002, ~d the Board approved the project on December 13, 2002. While there
were subsequent Government delays in ratifying the DGA and approving the project operations manual, the
project became effective March 28,2003, slightly less than three months after the signing of the development
grant agreement.
37.      Project design. The PAD presents a standard MAP design based on considerations of the Bank's
experience with MAP 1 and broad participation in planning Guinea's proposed response. It builds on
Guinea's'strengths, described in the National Strategy 2003-07, in responding to·the lllV/AIDS epidemic: (i)
reasonable data on the evolution of the epidemic by region and by population group; (ii) successful
interventions in several key areas, including social marketing of condoms, treatment of STDs, and
tuberculosis; and (iii) the mapping of existing partner agencies within an organizational framework for
coordinating the technical and fmancial response.
38.      While the PAD offers a detailed description of activities to be fmanced, it does not provide much
technical justification for the selection of the activities and virtually no data on the numbers of or approaches
for reaching the target populations. In addition, the design somewhat arbitrarily established limits for the
project by arguing that the project would: (i) not support policy reform in any sector (though the multi-
sectoral approach, the reliance on decentralization, and the use of public-private partnerships each seem to
require some support); and (ii) only allow for the treatment of an initial 150 PLWHA. 18 Finally, very limited
attention is paid to voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) and prevention of mother to child transmission
(PMTCT).
39. .   The design did take advantage of the Government's increased acceptance ofNGOs (and the growth
of associations of PLWHA) and the NGOs' improved capabilities to implement activities addressing
lllV/AIDS. The design also benefited from Government's concern about the fiduciary performance of the
country portfolio in general and the ongoing health project in particular. As a result financial management
was contracted out, a financial operations manual prepared, and fmancial management software installed.
40.      The PAD could have benefited from: (i) more detailed analysis in several sections (including health
sector issues, the economic and social analyses, and the environmental analysis; (ii) more emphasis on the
importance of existing Bank-financed projects (PPSG, PACV and PRCI) as well as other projects for the
success of the MAP; and (iii) better discussion of the Bank's added value. The risk. assessment and
mitigation measures were generic and perfunctory.
41.       Project design emphasized a number of lessons learned from the MAP 1 projects. Many were well
known, includirig the need for political leadership and commitment, a multi-sectoral approach, community
participation, and effective monitoring and evaluation. The Guinea design sought to counter the tendency for
MAP projects to lose momentum after Board approval by using: (i) the Policy and Human Resources
Development Fund (PHRD) grant to sensitize representatives of public sector and civil society organizations,
establish program coordination and implementation mechanisms, and train community development agents;
and (ii) the PPF to start pilot operations prior to effectiveness.
42.     In July 2007, Guinea was among the countries which agreed to amend their Development Grant
Agreements by modifying the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and extending the closing from July 31,
2008 to December 31, 2008.
43.      Quality at Entry. No Quality Enhancement Review (QER) was conducted, but comments on the
PAD summarized problems related to the monitoring and evaluation framework (and particularly the lack of
baselines and targets), the weaknesses of the procurement and disbursement sections, and the lack of an
environmental action plan. A Quality Supervision Assessment (QA7) (September 2006) summarized several
conclusions on quality at entry, noting: (i) the Government's lack of capacity and uneven commitment; and


18 Both the PCD and the PAD reviews also noted that the project did not address refugees llIld internally displaced
persons,.but the preparation team argued that other, more appropriate organizations (e.g. UNHCR and Medecins Sans
Frontieres) were working with these groups and that the number of refugees in Guinea was decreasing.

                                                                                                                 7
(ii) the PAD's weak ·presentation of the results framework. The assessment concluded, however, that "in
retrospect, it seems unlikely that the remaining steps for readiness could have been achieved in time for a
prompt project start, and that moving to implementation (with the enhanced resources and expectations of
delivery entailed) most probably accelerated completion of key steps."
2.2 Implementation
44.    Disbursement overview. The original Development Grant Agreement (H014 GUI) in the amount
of SDR 15.4 million (US$20.3 million equivalent) was signed on December 30,2002, became effective on
March 28, 2003,19 and was expected to close on July 31, 2008. The borrower was expected to finance
US$2.0 million equivalent bringing the total project cost to US$22.3 million equivalent.
45.      As the following table shows (see the disbursement profile as well in Section I of the Data Sheet),
actual disbursements tracked the PAD's planned disbursements to a remarkable extent:
                     Table 1: Comparison of planned and actual disbursements (cumulative)

                   Disbursements           2003       2004       2005       2006     2007     2008

                 Source: AGF (KPMG), Analyse de la perfonnance (Janvier 2009).


46.     Given the important additional resources which became available after project effectiveness (from
mPC, the Global Fund and bilateral projects including among others Kreditanstalt fUr Wiederatifbau,
Reconstruction Credit Institute· (KFW), Gesellschaft fUr Technische Zusammenarbeit (German Agency for
Technical Cooperatioil-GTZ), and United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the
disbursement would seem to be even more remarkable.
47.       Implementation overview. Despite the measures initiated under the PPF, the project began slowly
as noted by the initial supervision missions. The implementation of the capacity-building component was a
particular concern since the preparation of materials and the organization of training were late. By November
2003, the Implementation Status Report (lSR) indicated that significant activity was underway in all of the
components. A year later the ISR (November 2004) described more mixed results (particularly with respect
to the community-based initiatives), but rated both implementation progress and achievement of the PDOs as
satisfactory. With minor changes in the ratings, this pattern of satisfactory (or intermittently moderately
satisfactory)performance on both the PDO and the IP continued throughout the duration of the project.
48.       Somewhat obscured by the smooth disbursements and consistent ratings are: (i) the country's
continuing political instability particularly during the period 2005-07; and (ii) the modest nature of the
project's ambitions and fmancing. On the one hand, though political instability resulted in reduced
government commitment and fmancing as well as physical destruction of project assets (for instance,
computers and other equipment to monitor the project were looted or destroyed in 5 of 8 regions during the
events of January and February 2007), project commitments for the local and sectoral initiatives proceeded
rapidly, reaching 75% by early 2005 and more than 90% by early 2006.
49.      On the other hand, the project's ambitions were perhaps overly modest as shown, for example, by
the project's: (i) insufficient staffmg for project implementation at national and especially at regional levels,



19 Despite the delays noted previously, the Guinea MAP was the first MAP to become effective within 90 days of the
signature of the grant agreement. .
 where the lack of staff handicapped project implementation; (ii) inability to respond to demands for
 additional subproject funding more than two years before the project's original closing; (iii) limitations on
 the number of patients eligible to receive ARVs (150 PLWHA); and (iv) the small project contribution to the
 expansion of VCTIPMTCT sites (5 completed at the beginning of a period from 2006-2009 which saw the
 number of sites increase from 4 to 74). Three potential reasons for this timidity can be advanced: (i) fear of
 overpromising and under-producing which characterized a number of the previous MAPs; (ii) the recognition
 of the large role that the Global Fund would play; and (iii) the Bank's desire to move to a health sector
 funding approach, for which preparation began during the period of the MAP.
 2.3 Monitoring aod Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
 50.      M&E design. Neither the National Strategic Framework (NSF) 2003-07 nor the PAD provide much
 guidance for the design of monitoring and evaluation.2o The NSF proposes a number of broadly defmed
 indicators to be collected at different intervals depending on the administrative level. The PAD identifies
 three mechanisms: supervision, surveillance (epidemiological and behavioral), and surveys, with all three
 essentially under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health assisted by external technical assistance (TA),
 and especially GTZ and the University of Montreal for the project zones, for surveillance and surveys. The
 PAD also, of course, identifies outcome and intermediate outcome indicators which are only generally
 related to those in the NSF.
  51.     Between project appraisal and effectiveness in March 2003,·the Trust Fund fmanced three technical
  assistance missions. The first two were intended to: (i) better define the project·indicators and the methods
  for calculating them; (ii) describe the activities, roles, and responsibilities of M&E personnel; and (iii) draft
  an M&E manual. The third mission was expected to: (i) collect baseline information for the project
  indicators; and (ii) train relevant personnel on the use of the M&E manual. In addition to these technical
  issues mentioned above,·pre-effectiveness reviews of the M&E system expressed concerns about the issue of
. ownership and the need to establish an effective process for training and involving contributors/recipients of
  project data at all levels. It is not clear from the documentary record whether. any of these efforts were
  fmalized.
 52.      At the outset, there were some small discrepancies: (i) between the PAD's discussion of the PD~ and
 the KPI and the proje~t design summary (Annex 1); and (ii) between the KPI in the PAD and those in the
 Development Grant Agreement. In addition, there were problems with a number of the proposed project
 indicators: (i) several were poorly formulated and difficult to' measure; (ii) baseline data were not available
 for all of the indicators; and (iii) some targets could not be disaggregated to show the project's contribution.
 53.       The indicators were reviewed and clarified in 2006 after the mid-term review by: (i) eliminating
 prevalence and five other indicators for various reasons (e.g. achieved, unmeasured or un-measurable); and
 (ii) reformulating three other indicators (due to the lack of clarity or data). These revisions were
 incorporated into a restructured project in 2007 as part of the umbrella MAP restructuring.21
 54.       Implementation. Progress in implementing monitoring and evaluation was limited in the year
 following effectiveness, but accelerated in 2004: (i) in March, the Bank fmanced technical support to fmalize
 the M&E manual and propose tools for routine field data collection; (ii) by September, an operational plan
 for monitoring and evaluation had been validated by a UNAIDS technical working group and adopted; and
 (iii) by December, the Monitoring, Research and Evaluation Unit had been established within the SElCNLS,
 an M&E specialist recruited, c.omputers procured for focal points required to submit reports,· management




 20 In comparison, the M&E framework, formally adopted in October 2008 as part of the revised National HIVIAIDS
 Strategy, was a very complete presentation.        .
 21 The umbrella restructuring revised indicators to eliminate HIV prevalence and to focus on vulnerable groups. The
 restructured project also incorporated the revised Bank procurement guidelines (of October 2006) and altered
 procurement thresholds of the aggregate amount for some procurement methods.

                                                                                                                  9
 information software adapted for the project (using GTZ's SIDAPES), and quarterly reporting underway
.with guidelines and forma~2.
55. . Specific progress had been achieved on: (i) physical and financial monitoring, with the Financial
Management Agency (FMA) monitoring all contractual arrangements between the project and the
beneficiaries of project funding; (ii) project monitoring, with the SElCNLS following the principal project
indicators; and (iii) surveillance, with the Ministry of Health conducting .a number of surveys and studies,
with support from GTZ and the University of Montreal operating initially in Mamou and Labe and
subsequently in N'zerekore and Kankan.
56.      Physical and financial monitoring. As discussed below, the FMA's financial monitoring and
contract management systems worked well from the beginning and provided timely and accurate
information. Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR) and annUal external audits were regularly submitted by
the project and routinely analyzed and commented on by the Bank. In addition, a technical audit was
conducted in December 2005 in the context of the mid-term review. The audit covered project operations for
2003-04, but it is not possible to determine the extent to which the comprehensive fmdings and
recommendations were incorporated into the project restructuring, which occurred in 2007.
57.      Project monitoring. Project M&E was consistently rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory
during project implementation 23 for the following reasons. First, the M&E unit produced: (i) regular
summaries of the status of project outputs (see Annex 2); (ii) consistent overviews of the progress in meeting
the PDOs and intermediate outcome indicators for the different supervision missions; and (iii) informative
annual reports. Second, a number of studies were carried out on a variety of subjects such as: (i) the
fmancing of local associations and community radios to increase information coverage among rural
populations; (ii) an evaluation of the use of antiretroviral drugs; and (iii) assessments of the medical waste
management program. Third, with the technical support of UNAIDS in particular, much of the necessary
data to monitor Guinea's progress was assembled periodically. These included: (i) the UNGASS reports of
2006, 2008, and' 2010; (ii) reports on progress toward universal access (2008) and on the state of the
epidemic nationally and in the Forest Region (2009). Somewhat surprisingly, given the amount ofIDV/AIDS
funding and the important involvement of UNAIDS, no periodic assessments of national IDVIAIDS
expenditures were carried out in Guinea during the period of the project.
58.       Surveillance and research. Outcome data from the 2001 DHS provided adequate baseline data fora
number of indicators, and the 2005 DHS provided the basis for revising some of the indicators at mid-term,
but the lack ofDHS data from after 2005 represents a weakness in the implementation of the M&E strategy.
Two other surveys also provided useful information: (i) behavioral surveys conducted in 2001 and repeated
in 2008; and (ii) sentinel surveys organized in 2004 and repeated in 2008 (both with project fmancial
support).
59.      Utilization. The availability and use of information were reviewed during the mid-term review, and
the following weaknesses were noted: (i) insufficient collaboration between the SElCNLS and the Ministry
of Health, which' reduced the interest of a principal provider and user of the information; (ii) inadequate
M&E capabilities within SElCNLS and a lack ofM&E personnel at regional levels, which may have reduced
the credibility of the information produced; and (iii) irregular meetings of the national institutions, which
eliminated the obvious settings for disseminating results. Despite these weaknesses, the regular fmancial
information provided by the FMA, the project management information, and especially the epidemiological
and behavioral surveys were of importance for making certain programmatic decisions.




22 As mentioned, most of the equipment (computers, photocopiers, etc.) provided to the ministries and regions was
destroyed in 2007.               .      .                                      .
23 The indicators used to measure M&E performance (Data Sheet Indicators 13 and 22) showed thilt one was achieved
and oile was partially achieved.

                                                                                                              10
60.      M&E is rated substantial, based on the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)'s criteria for assessing
the design, implementation, and utilization of the data as they are applied to the epidemiological, financial,
and implementation results data produced by the M&E system. Based on the detailed operational plan for
monitoring and evaluating the National Strategic Framework 2008-12, the M&E system will certainly be
sustained, though many of the specific project-related indicators will be eliminated and replaced by others.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
61.      Environment. The environment category of the project at the time of appraisal was B, with risks
related to the handling and disposal of HIV/AIDS-infected materials with the potential to affect health
personnel in hospitals, health centers and municipalities who handle waste; families whose income is derived
from the triage of waste, and the general public if the waste is not disposed of properly.
62.      A draft medical waste management plan was prepared by the Government and approved by the·
Bank in June 2002. Among its recommendations, the plan proposed that all of the national and regional
hospitals have medical waste disposal facilities. Since the plan called for the use of incinerators, the Bank
requested the Government to provide in the plan for adequate management and maintenance skills and for
monitoring of the potential risk for dioxin production. The Waste Management Plan was subsequently
revised and finally approved by the relevant national ministries in January 2003.
63.      In May 2004, a supervision mission noted that: (i) certain hospitals had begun to construct
incinerators to the proposed standards; (ii) personnel had been trained in preventive measures and
management of bio~medical waste; and (iii) equipment had been planned and ordered. In December 2004,
the Bank approved the procurement of 13 incinerators for 9 prefectures (Montfort) and 4 regional hospitals
(Turbo 2000).
64.       An evaluation of the management of medical waste, carried out in 2006 (prior to the mid-term
review), assessed practices in 2 national and 9 regionallprefectoral hospitals. Unfortunately, the quality of the
evaluation was deemed inadequate, and a subsequent evaluation in 2007 (by the author of the original waste
management plan) concluded that: (i) both knowledge of and commitment to the plan were insufficient; (ii)
implementation of the plan was inadequate due to the absence of an appropriate institutional framework; and '
(iii) none of the regulatory initiatives had commenced. The implementation of the originally planned
activities was judged to be uncoordinated and ineffective. The project budget of US$200,000 was partially
disbursed, essentially for training and equipment noted above. Disagreement about the choice of incinerators
delayed their procurement, and political unrest delayed installation. Ultimately, incinerators were installed in
the 4 regional hospitals in 2008, and it was agreed that the Bank health project would fmance incinerators for
the prefectures.
65.      The QSA7 concluded that the task team considered waste management as a priority issue and was
effective in having the Borrower recognize this priority as well, but without the necessary technical support
and government commitment, progress )Vas slow.
66.       Procurement, Disbursement, and Financial Management. As with all of the MAPs, there were
difficulties during the initial stages of project implementation in conforming to accepted Bank procedures for
procurement and fman~ial management. Unlike virtually all of the other MAPs, financial management was
never rated less than satisfactory throughout project implementation, and procurement was never rated less
than moderately satisfactory.
67.      Procurement. Early supervision missions (2003-04) emphasized the need to respect the conditions
established by the DGA, keep accurate and updated procurement plans, submit adequately prepared requests
for non-objections, and organize the records generated during the procurement process. These efforts were
hampered by inconsistencies between the PAD and Legal Agreement which were not fully corrected by the
August 2006, when the switch to new guidelines occurred for the final phase of the project. In addition, as
the QAG pointed out, it was not clear whether the procurement arrangements and the associated procedures,
manuals, etc. (especially on the community sub-grants component) had been updated and staff trained in
order to correctly apply them. Finally, there were unresolved tensions throughout the project concerning: (i)


                                                                                                            11
whether the threshold amounts were too high or too low; (ii) whether procurement was overly centralized
(within SElCNLS) or not; (iii) how much of the procurement should be done with prior or post review.
68.      Financial management. Financial management was contracted to KMPG and was characterized
overall by adequate accounting methods and tools (specifically, the accounting program SUCCESS-RSF),
the submission of accurate withdrawal requests and timely Financial Monitoring Reports, and unqualified
audits. The FMA also helped monitor contracts for the sub-projects. KPMG had periods of staff turnover, but
responded in an adequate and timely manner to Bank supervision requests to ensure sufficient,· qualified
personnel. Periodic reviews of the FMA contract were generally positive.
69.       The respective roles of the FMA and the SE/CNLS in aspects of fmancial management (e.g., in
verifying receipts for expenditures, which was eventually delegated to the FMA) were a continuing concern.
Relations between the two structures improved over time, in large measure due to the Bank's mediating role.
In addition, three problems were cited by the FM specialist during project implementation: (i) the
implementation of an accurate and timely budgeting system; (ii) the timely submission of Statements of
Expenditure (SOEs) by SElCNLS and the .line ministries24 to ensure the replenishment of the sub-accounts;
and (iii) the mobilization of counterpart funding. The first two were resolved satisfactorily over time by the
project and the FMA. The third was resolved by amending the DGA to accept the non-payment of import
duties and taxes by the project in lieu of counterpart funding.
2.5 Post-eompletion Operation/Next Phase
70.      The major issues affecting the post-completion phase of the operation generally concerned the
government's uneven commitment (at least prior to the political changes which occurred in 2009) and
specifically: (i) the continuing debate over the roles and responsibilities of the institutions leading the fight.
against IllV/AIDS; and (ii) the need to ensure adequate fuiancing from various sources to share the burden of
program expenditures.
71.      From an institutional perspective, the task team made a significant effort throughout project
preparation and implementation to work with UNAIDS to promote coordination between the SElCNLS, the
Ministry of Health, and their partners. A technical working group within UNAIDS (headed by the Executive
Secretary of CNLS) was set up and expected to meet quarterly to examine the implementation of the annual
operational plans. In addition, the task team urged the various actors to increase collaboration within the
framework of ''the three ones2S ."
72.      In practice, (essentially) parallel structures were initially established between SElCNLS and the
Bank on the one hand and the Ministry of Health, the Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM), and the
Global Fund on the other. As one of the last supervision missions noted, with the MAP accounting for more
than 90% of the operational costs of the SElCNLS, a number of the critical functions (including monitoring
and evaluation) were at considerable risk after the end of the project. Similarly, activities for ministries (other
than health) and communities were almost totally dependent on MAP support. By their nature, the private
sector activities were less at risk. The project was urged to prepare a plan describing how those activities at
risk would be continued in the absence of the project, but such a plan does not seem to have been submitted
to the Bank.
73.      From a financial perspective, with the MAP and the Global Fund assuming the major proportion of
IllV/AIDS funding, continued financing was·an obvious concern: external financing over the period 2006-
20~8 constituted about 98% of total fmancing, with the MAP accounting for 24%. In June 2008, the Ministry
of Economy and Finance formally requested Bank fmancing in the amount of USSSO million for a MAP 2.
The letter noted the positive developments under MAP I particularly with respect to civil society, but argued
for additional funding to address a number of other areas defined in the Second Poverty Reduction Strategy


24 The outstanding amounts were progressively reduced from $763,037 in October 2005 to $261,038 in June 2006 to
$US·ll,599 in October 2008.
25 One AIDS action framework, one national AIDS authority, and one M&E system.



                                                                                                               12
and the revised National mv/AIDS Strategy 2008-2012. In July 2008, the Bank responded negatively, urged
the Government to successfully complete the project to encourage other development partners to contribute,
and provided a list of potential sources of funding.
 74.      As the proposal for the Global Fund Round 10 shows, even with significant additional government
 funding (which has increased from around US$200,000 in 2009 to US$1.5 million in 2011), private sector
 funding (estimated at about US$750,000 per year), and external funding (including Global Fund funding
 from Round 6 and subsequently from Round 10), Guinea has a significant financing gap When compared
 with the planned activities in the National Strategic Plan for 2008-2012.

 3.     Assessment of Outcomes
 75.      To facilitate the assessment of outcomes, the following discussion is linked both to the summary of
 ratings by PD~ in Table 10 (the Overall Outcome Ratings) and to the specific results of the PDQ indicators
 and Intermediate Outcome indicators in the Section F of the Data Sheet.
,3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
  76.       The relevance of the project's development objectives, components,and specific activities is rated
  Substantial for the original and Substantial for the restructured credit based on consideration of the
  project's: (i) adherence to the basic objectives of the PRSP, the CAS and the principles of the MAP
. approach; (ii) support for Guinea's international and regional obligations as well as its national policies and
  directives 26 ; and (iii) contribution to the combined programmatic response of the various technical and
  fmancial partners.
 77.      The original project: (i) adopted as PD~ the objectives of the interim Poverty Reduction Strategy
 Paper to stabilize or reduce the incidence of mY/AIDS and control its socioeconomic impact; and (ii)
 followed the recommendation of the CAS Progress Report to use the decentralized structures and systems
 being strengthened in other programs as innovative methods for the MAP to implement mY/AIDS activities.
 The subsequent 2003 CAS (covering the period 2004-06) reiterated the operational principles of the MAP,
 but concluded that "the strategy could strike a better balance between treatment and prevention27 ". The
 Second PRSP (2007) sought to: (i) reduce mY/AIDS prevalence rate to 1.5 percent; (ii) provide adequate
 and comprehensive case management of persons living with mv/AIDS and persons affected, in particular
 orphans and vulnerable children; and (iii) reduce the socio-economic impact of mY/AIDS infection on
 infecte4 or affected persons, on society and on the country as a 'whole. While the restructured MAP project
 eliminated (i) from the PDOs, it continued to address (ii) and (iii).
 78.       The original project fully supported the National Strategy 2003-07, which was based on strategies
 aimed at: (i) the population as a whole (communication and behavior change, social marketing of condoms,
 treatment of STDs, blood safety, etc.); (ii) specific target populations (youths, women, and mobile
 populations including sex workers, armed forces, truckers, miners, etc.); (iii) persons infected by and affected
 by the epidemic (and particularly PMTCT); and (iv) management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation.
 The restructured project, which reflected the reduced funding and evolving role of the MAP, also adhered to
 the priorities of the National Strategy 2008-12, which: (i) reduced the focus on the population as a whole in
 favor of priority groups; (ii) increased the emphasis on treatment, care, and support of persons infected and
 affected by the epidemic; and (iii) maintained the priorities related to management, coordination, and
 monitoring and evaluation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
79.     As shown in the overview below, 80% of the project's objectives were completely or partially
achieved; of those not achieved, three result from the lack of DHS information to confirm achievement:

80.       Project efficacy is rated as Moderately Satisfactory, based om (i) the project's overall results
shown in the Data Sheet, in Annexes 2a and b, and in the following paragraphs; and (ii) the project's
weighted results as, a proportion, of actual disbursements at restructuring and at closing, as shown at the end
of this section.                      -
81. ' Project Development Objective 1: Increase HIV/AIDS knowledge and promote low risk
behaviors. While certain KPI results were positive, overall the project made a Modest contribution ''to limit
and contain the spread of the lllV/AIDS epidemic" prior to restructuring and to "increasing mY/AIDS
knowledge and promoting low risk behaviors" after restructuring. .
82.      Both prior to and after restructuring, the PDOs focused on interventions for the general population,
for youths, and for targeted, higher risk populations. Among the targeted, higher risk PQPulations, the results
were evaluated by behavioral surveillance surveys in 2001 and 2007. The results are presented below:

83.      Excepting miners, the project achieved the original and revised objectives for the higher risk groups.
For truck drivers, the rapid increase in the number of truck stops offering an lllV/AIDS prevention program
(10 2) was certainly a contributing factor.
84.     Among youths, the results are presented in the following table, but ambiguous indicators and
incomplete data complicate the interpretation of these results:

As shown in the table, only PD~ 1 offers clear and clearly positive results, while 103 was not achieved and
PD~ 7 would seem to be incorrectly stated.

85.     Among the general population, the results were not systematically measured because the EDSG-IV,
scheduled for 2009-10 was delayed until 2011. The situation is presented in the following table:

Indicators for PD~ 2 show some improvement although the target was not achieved. Results for the other
two indicators are incomplete.
86.      Though IllY prevalence was discarded after restructuring. HIV prevalence among urban pregnant
women between ages 15 to 24 years old was estimated to be below 5% in 2004 (4.2% in Conakry) but had
risen to 5.7% in 2008 (pDO Indicator 3). This is partially the result of the scale-up of treatment, but it
could also be an increase in incidence (new cases per year).



                                                                                                                                           15
87.      Project Development Objective 1: Improve the coverage and use of HIV/AIDS prevention,
care, treatment and support services. Though its contribution to many of the inputs required for the
expansion of care, treatment, and support was limited, the project did contribute throughout to rehabilitation,
equipment, and provision of goods and supplies. Overall; the project made Substantial contributions to a
number of important services.
88.       Condom distribution. The project used two mechanisms to acquire and distribute condoms:
      •   During the early ye~s of the project, funds were provided to NGOs and community groups to
          purchase condoms locally at stores supplied by PSI. In 2004, 10 4 to ensure a continuous supply of
          condoms in 90% of all sale points was met. In 2005-06, 81% of sale points had no stock-outs; and in
          2007, PSI replaced its retail approach with a wholesale approach so data are unavailable.
      •   Subsequently, the project contributed to the national condom supply and, in 2007-2008, procured
          more than 9 million male condoms and 80,000 female condoms (10 15). From 2003-2008, the
          project provided 20% of all condoms procured.
89.     Blood transfusion. With project support, 100% of blood units in hospitals were regularly and
adequately screened by 2005 (10 5), and, though there was a decline to 52% in 2006, the project achieved
100% screening in 2007 and 2008:
90.      Treatment of STDs. Over the period of the project, services .for STD treatment expanded to all of
the 38 prefectures in the country exceeding the 30 established as the project target (10 16). The project fell
short, however, in its objective to train 80% of health personnel involved in the treatment of sexually
transmitted infections and opportunistic infections by 2006 (10 6). In fact, only 48% were trained.
91.      Service Quality. All national and regional-level public hospitals were expected to have facilities to
dispose of hospital waste and use them regularly (10 9); this objective was achieved, although the MAP only
contributed incinerators to four regions. Private sector service delivery points were expected to increase by
5% per year and receive a logo indicating the quality of the services offered (10 8), but only 3 services were
awarded a logo.
92.     Voluntaty counseling and testing. The project contributed early to the operations of VCT centers
(1017), but the subsequent expansion of these centers was financed by other sources (especially the Global
Fund) and the project's contribution declined, as shown in the following table:
                                       Table 6: Expansion'ofVCT services

93.      Data on the numbers of persons tested were not available, but the behavioral survey of 2007 noted
that 10.6% of persons aged 15 and older received counseling and testing for lllV as well as their test results
(PD09).
94.      The project also contributed to counseling and testing by: (i) equipping 12 (of 18 planned) youth
centers which served as sources of information on STDs and lllV/AIDS (10 18); and (ii) training 325 (of
250 planned) traditional healers in lllV/AIDS prevention and counseling (1010).
95.      Treatment of PLWHA. Treatment services for men and women living with lllV/AIDS expanded
rapidly over the last 2-3 years of the project as shown by the results presented in the following table:

96.      The cumulative number of treatment sites increased significantly, but the project objectives were
not achieved: (i) the cumulative number of pregnant women living with mY who received antiretroviral
drugs to reduce the risk of MTCT (pDO 10) was 49% of the target; and (ii) the proportion of PLWHA
benefiting from STI and TB treatment (10 7) was 49.0% and 61.3% respectively. Finally, while the MAP
exceeded the project target for ARV treatment (pDP 11), the number of patients treated constituted only a
small proportion of the total number placed on treatment.
97.     Support for OrPhans and vulnerable children. The project's contribution to the support of orphans
and vulnerable children is summarized in the following table: .

98.      Over the first few years, the project made a significant contribution to school assistance for Orphans
and Vumerable Children (OVC): while the objective of 1,500 orphans by 2004 (1014) was not achieved, the
number of households (10 24) and OVC (10 23) benefiting from project support increased steadily, and the
objectives were achieved in 2008.
99.       Other Outcome and Intermediate Outcome Objectives. The remaining PD~ and 10 do not fit
easily into the restructuredPDOs but constitute important contributions in that they successfully: (i)
promoted a multisectoral approach; (ii) decentralized responsibility for implementing mY/AIDS activities;
and (iii) expanded accountability for results to communities and local authorities, thus expanding the national
capability from central level to a range of public and private sector entities at regional and local levels.
Project achievement of these objectives is rated substantial.
100.     Support for public sector ministries and local authorities. Both prior to and after restructuring, the
project aimed to involve key ministries and other public sector organizations in the fight against mY/AIDS.

In other words, the ICR argues that, while support for plannjng and implementing activities to increase
IllV/AIDS knowledge and promote low risk behaviors (pDQ 1 and Other) was substantial in creating the
demand for services, the. project's response in supplying services (pDO 2) was essentially modest.
3.3 Efficiency
  105.      As noted in Annex 3, the PAD for the Guinea MAP, like most other MAPs in the region, referred to
  the economic analysis carried out in previous reports and did not carry out a cost-benefit analysis. As a
  result, an assessment of the overall efficiency of the project before/after and with/without comparisons is not
. possible for either direct (savings from treatment costs) or indirect benefits (gains made from reductions in
  disability and death and associated economic productivity).). Annex 3 summarizes the arguments advanced
  by MAP 1 and MAP 2 and the extent to which the project addressed the most effective and efficient

                                                                                                                           19
interventions given the prevailing epidemiological situation in the country. In addition~ the following
paragraphs focus on the project's internal effici~mcy and assess its success in economizing on scarce capacity
and prioritizing activities29 •                                                              .              .

106.     MAPs are in some respects inherently inefficient at start-up since they must: (i) adapt the specific
components (and allocations) and the suggested institutional arrangements to the local context, (ii) improve
planning and budgeting to avoid consistently late approval of annual work plans (due to reviews of priorities,
unit cost corrections, potential duplication of activities, etc.); and (iii) invest the necessary resources to
strengthen management systems and train personnel at central, regional, and district levels. The Guinea MAP
was no exception, but it varied from other MAPs in two important ways: (i) it disbursed the project proceeds
in a timely manner and as planned (with the exception of the training category which was quickly
exhausted); and (ii) it employed several strategies to increase efficiency.
107.       First, recognizing the lack of implementation capacity, the project relied on contracting out specific
services to five large agencies already involved in service delivery in Guinea to ensure efficient and effective
implementation. These included four contracts for service delivery (condom distribution, behavioral change
capacity, STI treatment, and sentinel surveillance and counseling) and one for fm~cial management
services. In addition, the behavioral change communication (BCC), STI, and mv interventions were limited
initially to three regions (Kindia, Labe,.and Mamou). Performance on these contracts was evaluated at mid-
term, and the contracts were renewed on the basis of these results. Subsequently, other contracts were signed
for: (i) specific groups (fishermen, informal miners, OVC); and (ii) specific services (PMTCT in Conakry
and treatment in Kankan and N'zer6kore.
108.      Second, the project addressed the public s~tor by distinguishing between first and second tier
ministries, focusing initially on the former. Third, the project recognized the potential problems of providing
small grants to NGOs and local organizations and proceeded to: (i) conduct initial screening. and 'periodic
assessments of these groups to ensure their capacity to deliver the required services; and (ii) use procedures
developed by a companion Bank project (PACV) as the basis for assisting the CU and the CRD to award
small project grants. Fourth, though targeting preventive interventions for vulnerable groups was part of the
initial design, the project increased the emphasis on specific target populations (high risk groups, high,
prevalence regions, and underserved rural areas) after restructuring, but the M&E system does not allow for
an assessment of this trend.
109.     Finally, with Bank support, the project was constantly looking at administrative measures to
eliminate constraints and increase the pace of funding for activities, though not all of the proposed measures
were ultimately accepted (e.g. the use of a single selection committee for approving subprojects fmanced by
the MAP and the Global Fund).
110.     Based on this combination of ' technical and administrative measures to improve the project's
efficiency in achieving the PDO's, efficiency is rated as Modest for the project as a whole.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

after project restructuring, the following table presents the overall outcome rating for the project as

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
112.      Poverty. Though an integral part of the government's poverty reduction strategy, the project did not
explicitly target an impact on poverty. Revenue-generating activities,. for instance, were not included.
However, to the extent that the project promoted free care for those in need of services, financed
consumables for diagnosis and drugs for treating 150 patients, and supported educational assistance for
children affected by the epidemic, the project did contribute to poverty reduction.
113.     Gender. Though the feminization of the epidemic was recognized during project preparation, the
issue was not explicitly addressed during the early phase of project implementation. Beginning in January
2005, though, Bank supervision missions paid increasing attention, insisting that women's associations be
accorded priority by local governments in the selection of community level projects. Consequently, as
women were increasingly affected by the epidemic, they received a proportional increase in access to
prevention and treatment services (though data from the monitoring system are not adequately disaggregated
to demonstrate this).
114.     Social development. The project also focused on a range of socially marginalized groups (including
sex workers, miners in the informal sector, fishermen, etc.) seeking to raise their awareness about risky
sexual behavior, but also to help these populations understand the implications of the disease and its potential
impact on their lives. The project made major contributions in three areas: (i) the development of
associations of PLWHAs; (ii) the inclusion of an IllYIAIDS component in the school curriculum, which had
to overcome considerable opposition within the Parliament; and (iii) the encouragement of a small group of
Men who have sex with men (MSM) to organize itself to receive assistance. Though this last initiative was
ultimately unsuccessful, the Bank's commitment deserves mention.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
115.     As in other countries with UN, Bank and Global Fund support, there were tensions about the roles
and relationships of the CCM, the SE/CNLS, and the sources of financial and technical support. While the
Bank tended to work in close collaboration with UNAIDS (and their technical groups) and the SE/CNLS, the
Global Fund worked most closely with the CCM and the Ministry of Health. Working relationships were
constantly being revisited and clarified, which slowed the potential development of the different institutions
and the acceptance of the "three ones" principles. Efforts to create a Partners' Forum only succeeded after
the project was closed.
116.     The project was more effective in working with a wide range of public sector institutions to: (i)
promote a multi~sectoral response to the epidemic and to mainstream IllYIAIDS activities into the action
plans of key sector ministries; (ii) decentralize resources and responsibility for implementing these activities;

                                                                                                              21
and (iii) strengthen the management capabilities of a range of civil society and private sector entities to
improve results at regional and local levels.
117.     Other institutions benefiting from the project included both the public sector (where urban and rural
local governments benefited from project financing) and the private sector (where employer associations and
labor unions received project financing). The fmal evaluation of the project estimates that more than 130,000
miners were reached through the efforts of the project. The centers for discussion and counseling for
adolescents (CECOJE), of which more than 30 were established in the country (about a third with project
funding), also proved to be an especially effective institution (particularly in collaboration with AGBEF, the
Guinean Family Planning Association which provided adolescent health care and family planning services.
118.     A review of the quantitative and qualitative results of Annex 2 indicates the range of public and
private institutions which benefited from the project.
 119.     Guinea's approach for implementing the local iriitiative response included a number of elements of
 interesf°. First, the project built on the expertise of the PACV, with the intention of jointly reviewing the
 small projects to be implemented by the two projects in order to increase the efficiency of proposal review
 and avoid duplicative funding. Second, a capacity assessment of NGOs was carried out, and a roster of
.eligible NGOs was established during project preparation and updated regularly thereafter to include those .
 NGOs receiving training and satisfying the criteria.
 (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Iinpacts (positive or negative)
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
120.      A beneficiary assessment was not organized prior to the project but was being conducted at the time
of this ICR.
4.   Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Modest
121.      At the time of project closing in December 2008, the risk would have been considered substantial or
perhaps even high: political instability, reduced financing (with especially negative prospects for many of the
activities fmanced by the project), and an uncertain future for the SElCNLS. But there were also some bright
spots including: the expressed commitment to continuing the fight as part of the poverty reduction strategy, a
revised national strategy for 2008-12 which formed a consensus for moving forward, the continuing presence
of several contractors fmanced by the project (including GTZ, DREAM, AGBEF), and ongoing financing of
the Global Fund. These elements, as well as a greater fmancial commitment to the SElCNLS, an increased
reliance on the decentralized authorities to deliver services, .and success in receiving additional fmancing
from the Global Fund (Round 10) have contributed to lower the assessment of risk to the development
outcomes to Modest.
5.   Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
122.     No Quality at Entry Assessment was organized by the Quality Assurance Group. The project
preparation team made a major effort to avoid some of the ·weaknesses of the MAP 1 preparations, in
particular through the use of: (i) the PHRD grant to finalize the 2003-07 national strategy and to anticipate
future areas of project concern (capacity assessments of NGOs, condom distribution, orphans, waste



30The experience was written up and published by the SElCNLS, L 'extension de la couverture de la lutte contre Ie
VIHlSIDA dans les collectivites locales (2006).

                                                                                                              22
management, etc.); and (ii) the PPF to eStablish the SElCNLS, sensitize national and local authorities, and
initiate the sub project process. The team also invested significant time in developing a coordinated approach
with other agencies to implement the fight against lllV/AIDS.
123.      On balance, these efforts to improve the qualitY of the project had mixed results. First, the PAD's
conclusions were sound and ultimately correct (particularly with respect to fmancial management) even
though it had demonstrable weaknesses (related to use of the preparatory studies, justification of activities,
and institutional arrangements, particularly for M&E). Second, the PPF recognized and sought to contribute
to project start-up, though ultimately it was not able to anticipate and resolve several important issues related
to sub-project selection and implementation, including the need for the project to have a regional presence.
Third, the team attempted to collaborate with UNAIDS and SE/CNLS to enhance the program, but the
institutional tensions mentioned previously (between UNAIDS and the Global Fund and between SFJCNLS
and the Ministry of Health) proved impossible to overcome completely.
124.      An attempt to enhance quality through project restructuring was done as part of an umbrella
restructuring of eight MAP 1 and MAP 2 projects and intended to realign indicators to national strategies,
redirect funds to priority and high impact interventions, and better coordinate institutional arrangements. A
Bank issues paper (2006) addressed the challenges and lessons learned from the MAPs and proposed ten
potential revisions31 of which Guinea requested three: (i) modification of the PDO; (ii) elimination ~fthe KPI
"that are not realistic to measure"; and (iii) adoption of the revised Bank procurement guidelines of October
2006 to avoid implementation delays by removing procurement thresholds of the aggregate amount for some
procurement methods.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
125.   A Quality at Supervision Assessment was organized by the Quality Assurance Group (QSA7) in
September 200632 and accorded the supervision a rating of2 (Satisfactory) overall.
126.      Over the life of the project, Bank supervision was characterized by: (i) the continuity of the task
team (with a single TIL33 and little turnover among the fiduciary team members over the life of the project);
(ii) the consistent assessment of project performance34 during supervision; and (iii) the timeliness of the
agreements reached, with virtually every aide,.memoire signed by the CNLS, the Bank, and UNAIDS.
Intensive early supervision, the quality of the documentation, and the constant follow-up of the
recommendations of previous missions were all helpful to the project.
127.     The task team's technical and operational contributions to the project were both substantial. Of
particular importance technically were the team's actions to support: (i) legislation relating to the inclusion of
IllY/AIDS in school curricula; (ii) programs for men who have sex with men; and (iii) greater attention to
the issue of gender. Operationally, the team's flexibility in suggesting Or accepting proposals to improve the
operations of the different components contributed to increased project efficiency as noted previously.
Supervision was particularly effective in ensuring the quality of the mid-term review and the restructuring of
project objectives. Finally, the QSA noted the effectiveness of Bank management in assisting the task team.




31 In addition, the Africa Region and the Global IDV/AIDS. Program (HDNGA) proposed an IDV/AIDS results
Scorecard for all HIV projects, but this was not used in Guinea.
32 There was also a previous QAG assessment (QA6), but the author was unable to find the results in the IRIS.
33 A previous TTL managed the project preparation phase but was not heavily involved during project implementation.
34 The aide-memoire even periodically reviewed the risks and the DGA agreements, though they never referred to the
ISR ratings accorded to the project.

                                                                                                               23
128.    Supervision has been rated satisfactory (rather than highly satisfactory) due to: (i) inadequacies
noted by the QSA with respect to the supervision of procurement and financial management; and (ii)
somewhat inflated ISR ratings during the initial years of project implementation3s •
(c) Justification of Rating for OveraU Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
129..    Following ICR guidance in.dicating that when the rating for one dimension is in the satisfactory
range (for the quality supervision) and the other is in the moderately satisfactory range·(for quality at entry),
the rating for overall Batik performance depends on the outcome rating. Bank performance is therefore rated
Moderately Satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
130.      As described in the 2003 CAS, Guinea was a Low-Income Country Under Stress (LICUS)
confronted by: (i) external constraints due to the instability in the sub-region; and (ii) internal constraints
related to governance and a highly centralized public sector. Government commitment to the project at the
highest levels was uneven, as early interest gave way to more pressing socio-political concerns and internal
strife. From 2002 to 2008, Guinea was headed by six different Prime Ministers who were expected to preside
over the National Committee (which in fact met only twice during this period). Further, as mentioned,
Government contributions to the counterpart funding were often less than budgeted and arrived late; though
in the end all of the Government's fmancial obligations were met. Finally, the Ministry of Health's weak
contribution to project implementation demonstrated its lack of commitment to the project, due in part to
continuing debate over the roles and responsibilities of the Ministry and SElCNLS, and in part to the
availability of Global Fund financing.                 .
131.      Expanding government performance to include other central ministries as well as public sector
officials at regional and local levels provides a somewhat different picture of government performance.
These entities, especially many of which (including some fIrst and second line ministries as well as the urban
and rural local governments) rarely received external assistance to support their annual programs,
enthusiastically accepted MAP support to implement activities and used the MAP funding to achieve their
objectives and to demonstrate their capabilities to other potential sources offmancing. Though disbursement
tended to be slow and justifIcation of expenditures even slower, the authorities interviewed during the ICR
mission expressed satisfaction with what they were able to achieve.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
132.       Project implementation was shared by: (i) the Executive Secretariat of the CNLS, a public sector
entity under the auspices of the Prime Minister, created by decree in March 2002 and responsible for
coordinating policy and regulation, mobilizing financial resources, and facilitating program implementation
and supervision; and (ii) the Financial Management Agency, a private sector agency recruited by the CNLS
and responsible for financial management. While there were sometimes gaps and occasional ambiguities in
their respective functions, the division of responsibilities for project ID!plementation and oversight balanced
facilitation and fIduciary tasks, and these two agencies collaborated in a relatively harmonious manner.
133.     SE/CNLS. The performance of the Executive Secretariat was hindered institutionally by conflicts
(with theCCM and the Ministry of Health), and operationally by insufficient staff and counterpart fInancing



35 These ratings were subsequently downgraded following the recommendations of QSA6 but remained somewhat
higher than probably warranted.

                                                                                                              24
which particularly affected its performance at regional and local levels. Given the range of issues requiring
attention, the Executive Secretariat had a tendency to stray into implementation or to substitute itself for the
more appropriate technical agency. Several supervision missions had to remind the SE/CNLS of the limits of
its role and responsibilities, but both implementation progress (with one exception) and project management
were rated Satisfactory by the task team during the entire duration of the project.
134.      The SE/CNLS was less successful in carrying out its responsibilities for procurement, with
supervision missions pointing out deficiencies in procurement planning, numerous errors in the preparation
of tenders, frequent delays in the delivery of goods and the recruitment of services, and poor archiving of
documents. The task team somewhat generously rated procurement as Moderately Satisfactory throughout
the latter half of project implementation.
135.     FMA. The FMA (KPMG) played an important role in the project's success by providing both
financial management expertise and an institutional buffer between the SE/CNLS and other political and
technical influences. The fmancial results achieved by the FMA were considerable, including the submission
of acceptable Financial Management Reports (FMRs) mostly on time, and annual audits always on time. At
the same time, its dominance in controlling the fmancial functions (some of which were to be shared with the
SE/CNLS), its careful (and slow) processing of withdrawal applications, and the limited training to transfer
competencies were all sources of concern for the SElCNLS; and the outstanding advances to community
groups (and the inability to audit these groups in a timely manner) were a source of concern for the Bank.
Given these weaknesses, the performance of the FMA is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
136.     The Moderately Unsatisfactory performance of the Government and the Moderately Satisfactory
performance of the Implementing Agencies, combined with the overall project rating of Moderately
Satisfactory, yield a rating of Moderately Satisfactory for the Borrower.
6.   Lessons Learned
137.    The Guinea MAP confirms many of the fmdings of previous MAPs, but it offers several strategic
and operational lessons which merit consideration.
138.      First, Guinea offers an example of where program advances in the fight against HIV/AIDS can
occur even where political instability and political leadership (both of which are usually assumed to be
prerequisites) are not entirely adequate. To a large extent this was due to the project's ability to find
champions among those groups who were committed. In Guinea, these groups were found among: (i) the
public sector (especially, some of the "second tier" ministries and local authorities at regional and prefectoral
levels); (ii) the private sector (particularly the mining sector and several labor unions); and (iii) communities.
Eventually, these private sector and community-level initiatives were able to overcome (at least to a certain
extent) uneven government commitment and weak capacity.
139.      Correlated with this is the importance of pro-active project supervision (and effective management)
to identify opportunities and take advantage 'of them where they occur.
140.     Second, by their very nature, MAPs raise provocative issues, and the Bank's role as an advocate for
certain vulnerable populations can be a delicate matter. Some are obvious (women, orphans) and pose no
problems; and others might seem to raise some potential issues (commercial sex workers), but have tended to
be accepted, at least in West Africa; and some clearly demonstrate the potential limits for Bank success. In
Guinea, the Bank successfully argued for the introduction of HIVI AIDS instruction in the school curriculum,
but it was unsuccessful, despite important efforts, in encouraging organizational efforts by homosexuals.
141.     Third, Guinea demonstrates that insufficient attention is paid during project implementation to the
risks and risk mitigation measures proposed in the PAD. In the case of the Guinea MAP, three of the four
output to objective risks were correctly identified (though perhaps incorrectly rated), but the measures proved
to be wholly inadequate to alter the situation. While project preparation cannot be expected to pre-identify

                                                                                                               25
all of the potential solutions to pr~blems which might arise, supervision missions should be required to link
their recommendations at least in part to the risks so as to track the effectiveness of the mitigation measures
for future projects. This would seem to be the Bank's counterpoint to "learning by doiJ;lg."
7.   Comments on Issues Raised by BorrowerlImplementing AgeneieslPartners
142.     (a) Borrower/implementing agencies: The task team and the Borrower reviewed and agreed on the
results of the indicators .reported in the Data Sheef6. The Borrower has prepared a comprehensive fInal
evaluation report in French, which did not contain a summary. A summary of the Borrower's fInal report is
presented in Annex 7 in English. The Borrower's fInal evaluation report is available from the Project Files.
143.    The revised ICRR was sent to the Borrower for comments, which were received on December 21,
2010. The Borrower confirmed that the evaluation was done with rigor, that it reflected the points of view
and observations of the National Secretariat, and that there were no specifIc additional comments to add.

144.     Like most other MAPs, the PAD for the Guinea MAP referred to the economic analysis
carried out in previous reports for the Africa Region 37 and summarized the main findings as
follows:
    •   HIV/AIDS undermines the major determinants of economic growth (physical, human, and
        social capital) and has a negative effect on productivity levels, domestic savings and overall
        economic growth.
    •   HIV/AIDS increases health costs and runs the risks of crowding out other key public health
        programs, such as immunization, maternal and child health, malaria and parasitic diseases.
    •   Care and treatment of AIDS patients imposes high costs on families and reduces their
        earning capacity.
    •   Family coping strategies may result in children abandoning school or the family cutting
        other health or social expenditures to unacceptable levels.

145.    In the absence of analysis in the PAD, the question is whether the project focused on the
most effective and efficient interventions given the prevailing epidemiological situation in the
country. The table belo~8 provides estimates on the potential infections averted and the cost per
infection averted and suggests that Guinea was focusing on the appropriate interventions, even if a
number of them where not the most efficient.

146.      lEG suggests other criteria for assessing the benefits of MAPs,39 including: (i) enhanced political
commitment to controlling the epidemic; (ii) expanded and strengthened national and sub-national AIDS
institutions for the long-run response; (iii) mobilization ofNGOs in the national response and reinforcement

                Annex 7: Snmmary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

147.      Evaluation context. The Borrower's final report of the Multi-sectoral AIDS Project includes
chapters on: (i) the context, objectives, and methodology of the evaluation; (ii) the components, costs, and
justification of the project; (iii) the performance of the different project components; (iv) the management of
the fiduciary aspects of the project and a s~mary of project expenditures; and (v) the conclusions and
recommendations of the evaluation. The Borrower's report was explicitly considered "qualitative" and
 intended to "reflect" on the overall results of the project and their implications for the country.
148.     Country context. The Borrower's report briefly summarizes the overall characteristics of the
country and the current epidemiological situation; it describes in more detail the country's early efforts to
respond to the epidemic.
149.      Overview of the Project's Outputs. The Borrower's report briefly summarizes the project
components and activities; organizational arrangements for implementing the Government's response; and
the arguments justifying the necessity of the project including: (i) the prevalence rate in the country,
particularly among women; (ii) the efforts made by the Government to organize itself nationally and to
benefit from community and non-governmental organizations (including those representing people living
with lllV/AIDS); and (iii) the continuing lack of technical and financial resources, despite assistance from
UN, bilateral, andNGO partners. The Borrower's report provides both an overall assessment of the project's
results and a more detailed presentation by component.
150.     Loeal response. The report concludes that while the project's objectives were realistic: (i) the
organization of the local response was not sufficiently coordinated with the Bank-fmanced support to Rural
Development Committees (CRD) established at commune level; and (ii) the project's fmancial resources
were not sufficient to adequately cover the 303 CRD. Despite these weaknesses, the local response
component managed, according to those interviewed, to achieve its objectives, notably: (i) an
inventory/assessment of local NGOs capable of managing small projects; (ii) support for an effective
regional selection process for small projects. In particular, the evaluation cites the following results:

     •   at the commUne level: (i) training of local authorities and integration of the lllV response into ~e
         local CRD development plans; (ii) support for the implementation of sub-projects by 909
         community-based organizations; and (iii) the establishment of local networks of people living with
         lllV;
     •   at the yillage level: (i) village development agents were trained; (ii) communications equipment was
         distributed; (iii) traditional healers were trained to provide information; and (iv) condoms were
         distributed within the context of the Oncho initiative; and
     •   at the level of particularly wlnerable populations: (i) services were established for commercial sex
         workers; (ii) school fees ~ere paid for some 10,000 orphans and wlnerablechildren;

151.     In addition, the project worked closely with the four principal labor unions and fmanced six
operational plans which included establishment of three counseling and testing sites for miners.
152.      Sectoral response. Similarly, achievement of the objectives·ofthe sectoral response was estimated
at 80% even though there were variations itl the level of performance of the ministries. The bulk of the
activities focused on the health sector with: (i) training on a variety of topics; (ii) establishing of five
counseling and testing sites and five prevention of mother to child transmission sites; and (iii) provision of
drugs and consumables. Treatment was fmanced for: (i) persons living with mv/AIDS (350 in N'zerekore
in collaboration with GTZ-IS and 201 in Kankan in collaboration with the University of Montreal); and (ii)
sexually transmitted diseases in Kindia (21 health centers, 3 district hospitals and 1 regional hospital),
Mamou (17 health centers, 2 district hospitals and 1 regional hospital), Labe(58 health centers, 4 district.

hospitals and 1 regional hospital) and Kankan (30 health facilities).           Surveillance of STDs was also
strengthened in collaboration with GTZ-IS.
153.      Other government structures received support: (i) at central level, more than 90 operational plans
were financed and 5000 teachers were trained in the revised curriculum containing HIV-related material; and
(ii) coordinating committee members at regional and district levels received training. The project also
promoted: (i) legislative initiatives, policy documents (for orphans and vulnerable children, the handicapped,
and program strategies; (ii) youth services centers in 12 districts; (iii) local radio stations in 8 districts; .and
(iv) a range of sensitization activities.
154.     Capacity building. In addition to producing educational and informational materials, the project
successfully introduced HIV/AIDS into the curriculum of the medical and nursing schools.
155.     Coordination, facilitation and M&E. Development of monitoring and evaluation capabilities was
mixed: Materials and equipment were procured, but inadequate staffmg and fmancing at the regional level as
well as the destruction of project property resulting from political strife represented significant handicaps for
the project. Sentinel surveillance and behavioral change surveys were conducted and a strategy for
communicating the results (including a web site) was implemented.
156.     Summary of the Project's Results. The Borrower's report presents the results of the project
with respect to the PD~ and intermediate outcome indicators.
157.     Assessment of the Implementation Arrangements. The Borrower's report summarized the
implementation arrangements for coordination (through the National Committee), for project management
(through the Executive Secretariat and the Financial Management Agency) and concluded:

    •    At national level, the National Committee met only twice in six years was not considered effective;
         at regional and district levels, the committees were never operational due to a lack of financial
         resources.
    •    Both the Executive Secretariat and the Financial Management Agency were considered very
         effective in carrying out their responsibilities. This was due to: (i) the effective working
         relationships built on the existence of an implementation manual; and (ii) the management style of
         the Executive Secretary.
    •    Within the Executive Secretariat, the volume of work (particularly with the arrival of the Global
         Fund) was excessive for the existing staff.
     •   Particular weaknesses were noted in the organization of procurement, within the Executive
         Secretariat, within the different ministries, and at the regional and district levels.
     •   Particular strengths were noted in the organization of financial management and the achievement of
         its objectives, although there were somewhat different perceptions of its role by the ES and the FMA
         and debate over the responsibilities of the two agencies in validating expenditures.

158.     Estimation of project costs and expenditures. The Borrower's report reviewed: (i) the initial
estimates for project expenditures;. (ii) the unsatisfactory performance of the Borrower in meeting counterpart
funding obligations (and the subsequent amendment of the DCA to eliminate them); (iii) the procedures used
to disburse project funds through each of the respective accounts. A detailed presentation of project
expenditures was included as an annex.
159.      Conclusions. The Borrower's report cited in particular results achieved in collaboration with: (i)
civil society (and the implementation of more than 900 sub projects); (ii) the private sector (and especially
the Chambre des Mines); (iii) the public sector (with the expansion of testing and treatment services and
youth services centers); and (iv) the Executive Secretariat (through the development of program
implementation capacities).
