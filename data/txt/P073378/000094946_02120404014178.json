for Guinea is part of the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for\n            the Africa Region (report no. 20727). In accordance with the\n            main goal of MAP2, the overall objective of the project is\n            to limit and reverse the trend of the epidemic by preventing\n            new infections. There are four main components. The first\n            component empowers communities to address HIV/AIDS\n            prevention, care, mitigation, and support. Grant resources\n            will support a broad range of community, civil society, and\n            private sector initiatives. Under the second component, the\n            project supports annual action plans prepared by ministries\n            at the central and regional levels and by other public\n            agencies. It is expected that about half of the funds for\n            this component will go to the Ministry of Health. The third\n            component strengthens the capacity of government agencies,\n            civil society, rural organizations, and the private sector\n            to prepare and implement HIV/AIDS prevention and care\n            projects. It will reinforce the resource management,\n            monitoring and evaluation capacity of the HIV/AIDS\n            committees. The fourth component provides support to\n            facilitate the programming, coordination, and monitoring of\n            project operations, including support to the HIV/AIDS committees."}, "docdt": "2002-11-13T00:00:00Z"}
