The main project objectives will include\n            initiatives by the public, and private sectors to strengthen\n            the institutional framework, and build capacities responsive\n            to the epidemic. However, the presence of biomedical wastes\n            within the framework of the project, poses adverse\n            environmental impacts, due to the potential, inadequate\n            handling of infected materials. This environmental\n            assessment addresses specifically the management of\n            biomedical wastes, and examines the institutional capacity\n            within health institutions and local authorities, to propose\n            a feasible plan of action to reduce HIV/AIDS infection\n            risks. Measures to mitigate biomedical wastes disposal are\n            as follows. Institutional, legal and regulatory frameworks\n            will be strengthened through inter-governmental efforts, and\n            enforced environmentally sound waste management practices\n            will take effect. Health facilities will be provided with\n            sanitary equipment for the collection, and removal of\n            biomedical wastes, as well as trained personnel in\n            precautionary practices for handling infected, or\n            non-sterilized medical wastes. Incinerators will be\n            installed for hospital uses. Additionally, training and\n            specific programs will be conducted for health providers,\n            doctors, and municipal and sanitation personnel on the\n            related risks between AIDS and biomedical waste disposal.\n            Public awareness, and dissemination information on the\n            direct, and indirect risks of inappropriate wastes handling\n            will be organized through media channels, to sensitize\n            communities. Infrastructure related works should consider\n            adequate treatment of effluent discharges (at the municipal\n            level), including systematic incineration plans, and\n            compacted waste disposal."}, "docdt": "2002-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
