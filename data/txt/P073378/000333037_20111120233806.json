satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            Guinea offers an example of where program advances in the\n            fight against HIV/AIDS can occur even where political\n            instability and political leadership (both of which are\n            usually assumed to be prerequisites) are not entirely\n            adequate. To a large extent this was due to the\n            project's ability to find champions among those groups\n            who were committed. To a large extent this was due to the\n            project's ability to find champions among those groups\n            who were committed. In Guinea, these groups were found\n            among: (i) the public sector (especially, some of the\n            'second tier' ministries and local authorities at\n            regional and prefectoral levels); (ii) the private sector\n            (particularly the mining sector and several labor unions);\n            and (iii) communities. Eventually, these private sector and\n            community-level initiatives were able to overcome (at least\n            to a certain extent) uneven government commitment and weak\n            capacity. Guinea demonstrates that insufficient attention is\n            paid during project implementation to the risks and risk\n            mitigation measures proposed in theproject appraisal\n            document (PAD). In the case of the Guinea MAP, three of the\n            four output to objective risks were correctly identified\n            (though perhaps incorrectly rated), but the measures proved\n            to be wholly inadequate to alter the situation. While\n            project preparation cannot be expected to pre-identify all\n            of the potential solutions to problems which might arise,\n            supervision missions should be required to link their\n            recommendations at least in part to the risks so as to track\n            the effectiveness of the mitigation measures for future\n            projects. This will seem to be the Bank's counterpoint\n            to 'learning by doing.'"}, "docdt": "2011-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
