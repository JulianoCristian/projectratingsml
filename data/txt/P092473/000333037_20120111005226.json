Some\n            lessons learned included: regional projects with important\n            environmental and safeguards aspects such as the AELP should\n            be allocated sufficient implementation support funds to\n            allow participation in each mission of experienced\n            environmental and safeguards specialists from the Bank.\n            Given the potential reputational risks associated with\n            projects involving the use of chemicals that can have\n            negative environmental, health, and social impacts, and the\n            ensuing negative externalities at the regional level and\n            costs associated with compensations, it is essential that\n            due diligence of safeguards instruments be closely monitored\n            with adequate budget through Bank staff instead of local\n            consultants. In all frontline countries (Mauritania, Mali,\n            Niger, and Chad), the project supported the creation of a\n            national locust-control center whose services and\n            maintenance are earmarked in the countries' national\n            budget. Governments will need to disburse funds in a timely\n            manner to fully guarantee sustainability of project\n            achievements. The Bank's know-how with respect to\n            Community-Driven Development (CDD) and social protection\n            programs needs to be fully exploited in the design,\n            implementation, and monitoring of community micro projects\n            that seek to restore local livelihoods. This leveraging\n            could have helped mitigate shortcomings related to the\n            inadequate expertise of locust-control agents about key\n            community development requirements and the absence of clear\n            guidelines on compensation measures for victims."}, "docdt": "2011-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
