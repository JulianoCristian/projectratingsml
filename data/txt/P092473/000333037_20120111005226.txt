1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES, AND
DESIGN

1.1. Context at Appraisal

1.       In 2004, West Africa faced its worst desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria)
infestation in 15 years. The infestation spread and threatened agricultural productivity
from the Atlantic Coast to Eastern Chad. The following countries were directly affected,
resulting in major destruction of agricultural production: (i) Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and
Niger, the frontline countries where locust breeding areas are located; and (ii) Senegal,
Burkina Faso, and The Gambia, which, while free of breeding areas, are known as
invasion countries because locust swarms flew rapidly across them and caused significant
crop damage. Governments lacked the means to fight the pests, and available funding to
treat infested areas was inadequate.

2.      In consultation and in close collaboration with governments of affected countries,
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and donors, the Africa Emergency Locust
Project (AELP) was mounted. AELP reflected the Bank‘s areas of comparative advantage
in providing financing at the country level to complement funds committed by other
donors for regional initiatives. 1 It built upon existing Bank operations and achieved
positive synergies with ongoing IDA-funded agricultural and rural development projects
that provided credits for rural advisory services on pesticide use in agriculture and
supported environmentally friendly agricultural practices by farmers and agro-industry.
Bank assistance supported the governments‘ overall programs under the Bank‘s
emergency procedures (OP/BP 8.50).

1.2. Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

3.     The project development objectives (PDOs), as stated in the Technical Annex
(World Bank, 2004), were to reduce the vulnerability of the concerned countries to
present and future locust infestations by supporting improved strategies for prevention,
early warning, reaction, and mitigation at the national and regional levels.

4.      The PDOs were to be achieved by: (i) helping countries to control or manage
locust infestations; (ii) mitigating the effects of locust infestations on people and the
environment; and (iii) helping to ensure a more timely reaction to future infestations.




1
 AELP financing was intended to complement investments by the European Commission, the African Development
Bank, USAID, and the French aid agency (Agence Française de Développement) within the context of the Emergency
Prevention System for Trans-boundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases (EMPRES) of the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO).


                                                      1
1.3. Revised PDO (as Approved by Original Approving Authority) and Key
Indicators, Reasons, and Justification

5.     There were no revisions in the PDO and key indicators. However, in order to
improve synergies with the Emergency Prevention System for Trans-boundary Animal
and Plant Pests and Diseases (EMPRES) implemented by FAO at the regional level,
additional regional impact indicators were added to the results framework at the AELP
mid-term review in December 2006. The added indicators are underlined in Annex 1.

1.4. Main Beneficiaries

6.      The project was designed to directly benefit an estimated 4–5 million people
living in the vulnerable farming communities across the Sahel region affected by the
locust outbreak. The indirect beneficiaries were national institutions, whose capacities to
address all aspects of locust crisis prevention and management were to be strengthened.

1.5. Original Components

7.       The project included a number of emergency activities, post-emergency recovery
activities, and activities to improve future preparedness. These were organized into four
components:

8.      Component A: Emergency locust management: This included investments for the
emergency actions required to ensure timely, cost-effective, and environmentally and
socially sustainable locust tracking, eradication, and control operations (including
improved pesticide management and monitoring of the impact of pesticides used to
control locusts).

9.      Component B: Emergency agriculture investments: This included investments for
the emergency actions required to restore livelihoods and agricultural productivity in
rural areas badly affected by the 2004 locust invasion.

10.      Component C: Early warning and response: This included medium- and long-term
activities required to strengthen the national capacity for early warning and response to
outbreaks (including preparation of a locust-management financing mechanism and
research programs on biological control of desert locusts).

11.     Component D: Project management: The activities of this component were aimed
at effective project management, so AELP could be designed, adjusted, monitored, and
evaluated to reflect changing conditions.

12.    In addition to activities implemented at the national and local levels, the project
included interventions at the regional level that required regional collaboration, such as
coordination of locust control, research into alternatives to chemical control measures,
and monitoring and evaluation, especially in collaboration with FAO.




                                            2
1.6. Revised Components

13.    At mid-term review in December 2006, given that there had been no major
outbreaks, Components A and C were subdivided as follows, for more focus on
prevention and risk management:
     A1. Emergency locust control
     A2. Pesticide management
     C1. Surveillance and early warning
     C2. Sustainability of locust control, emergency funds, and risk management
     C3. Promotion of biopesticides

1.7. Other Significant Changes

14.     Changes were also made to (a) the project‘s schedule and (b) the funding
allocation across categories of expenditure.

         (a) Project schedule. The closing date of the project was extended twice. The first
extension (from June 30, 2009, to June 30, 2010) was approved in May 2009 for all seven
countries (Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, and The Gambia). The
second extension, approved in June 2010, covered a period of 11 months (from July 1,
2010, to May 31, 2011), with the exception of The Gambia (credit closed on June 30,
2010) and Niger (credit closed on December 31, 2010). The Gambia was not part of the
second extension, as this country had completed project implementation by the end of the
first extension. Niger needed only 6 more months after the first extension to complete
project activities. The extensions were necessary to accommodate (i) the late date of
project effectiveness (project was approved on December 16, 2004, and became effective
on May 25, 2005); (ii) political turmoil in Chad, which slowed the implementation of
project activities there; (iii) national institutional changes and political turmoil in
Mauritania, which led to suspension of disbursements from August 2008 to January 2009;
(iv) the slow pace of institutional reforms to establish independent national locust control
centers; (v) slow procurement processes and delays in the execution of civil works; and
(vi) delays in the elaboration of environmental management plans for pesticide storage
facilities.

       (b) Funding allocation. During implementation, reallocation of funds between
categories of expenditure occurred three times (2007, 2009, and 2010). The reallocations
were mainly done to shift funding from the procurement of large quantities of pesticides
for locust control to managing the existing stocks by upgrading storage facilities and
building new ones where needed to safeguard pesticides. Funds were also shifted for
equipment procurement to build countries‘ capacities for prevention, for the early
warning and response system (EWRS), and for reaction mechanisms.




                                             3
1.8. Implementation Arrangements

15.     The project aimed at strengthening the capacity of national institutions already
involved in locust-related operations through a variety of programs highlighting efficient
monitoring and surveillance systems. In each country, a leading national agency was
identified to oversee the implementation of the overall project (Annex 2). At the regional
level, partnership was established with the following regional donor-supported bodies to
ensure coherence of locust-management activities at the regional level:

      The Commission for Controlling the Desert Locust in North Africa and in the
       Western Africa Region (CLCPRO, Commission de Lutte contre le Criquet Pèlerin
       dans la Région Occidentale), in charge of coordinating locust operations in 10
       members countries and particularly in the frontline countries (an example of
       South–South cooperation)
      The Desert Locust Component of the Emergency Prevention System for Trans-
       boundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases (EMPRES), implemented by the
       FAO through the CLCPRO and financed by the African Development Bank, the
       French government, USAID, FAO, CLCPRO, and IFAD
      The FAO-led Emergency Center for Locust Operations (ECLO), the focal point
       for assistance to locust-affected countries and the Desert Locust Information
       System (DLIS) in charge of locust surveillance and early warning (worldwide).


2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND
OUTCOMES

2.1. Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

16.     Background analysis. The project‘s background analysis was generally adequate.
The background analysis highlighted a number of distinct and interrelated factors that had
directly led to the 2004 locust emergency, namely: (i) insufficient capacity and
preparedness of national technical departments to deal with crises (lack of equipment,
skilled human resources, and funding), absence of concrete contingency plans at the
national and regional levels, and weak capacity for sound pesticide management; (ii)
failure of the affected countries to maintain a minimum level of capacity during remission
phases; (iii) an inadequate communication system, leading to delayed and inadequate
responses to the infestation; and (iv) lack of an appropriate system for monitoring
environmental hazards.

17.      Lessons reflected in project design. The project benefitted from the experience of
ECLO and EMPRES for its design. It also partnered with CLCPRO in the design process.
This partnership was essential to the success of the project, as it permitted participatory
planning, exploited synergies between institutions, avoided duplication of efforts, and
provided the Bank teams with excellent technical and logistical support for Bank-funded
activities.

18.   Assessment of project design. The project design was based on sound institutional
mapping and adequate understanding of the comparative advantages of national and

                                            4
regional institutions that were already committed to emergency prevention, in general,
and locust control, in particular. The design stressed: (i) the relevance of a project
operating in an emergency situation that aimed to use best practices and lessons learned
from similar programs; (ii) the importance of building the capacity of national institutions
to meet necessary requirements for efficient implementation of planned activities; and
(iii) the key role of regional frameworks in supporting the efforts of individual countries
for locust-control operations. The design also included activities dealing with emergency
situations, including restoration of livelihoods of affected populations, and measures to
improve readiness for potential future locust attacks. It followed the governments‘ overall
programs and was aligned with the Bank‘s emergency procedures (OP/BP 8.50) and the
strategy of the New Partnership for Africa‘s Development (NEPAD) on the prevention
and management of natural crises.

19.     Lending instrument. The design of the project as an Emergency Recovery Credit
(ERC) was appropriate given the emergency situation at the time. A horizontal Adaptable
Program Loan (APL) would not have been appropriate because of the unpredictability of
the nature of infestation, which would have made the development of triggers difficult.

20.     Assessment of risks and their mitigation. Most risks were adequately identified
and rated; mitigation measures were also adequate. Uncertainty about total pesticide
quantities needed for the locust outbreak, and concerns about accumulation of obsolete
stocks as a result of large procurements and donations, increased the risk rating to
―substantial.‖ The risk was effectively mitigated through the establishment of strict
procurement guidelines based on pesticide quantities needed, storage capacity, and
spraying capacity on the ground. Funds initially budgeted for pesticide acquisition were
reallocated to upgrade storage capacity and improve pesticide management.

21.      Adequacy of government commitment, stakeholder involvement, and/or
participatory processes. At project design, there was concerted effort among participating
governments and project stakeholders to quickly eradicate the locust invasion and restore
livelihoods. The effort included representatives from ministries of agriculture, donor
partners (such as FAO), and producer organizations. Governments showed high
commitment by creating and funding the operation and maintenance of national locust
control entities. They maintained their support throughout project implementation, with
the shortcoming of delayed or partial counterpart funding to support activities under their
responsibility. But by project end, all countries met or exceeded their financial
commitments, with the following exceptions: (i) The Gambia disbursed only about 50%,
which affected overall implementation of the AELP in The Gambia by causing delays in
infrastructure works and friction with contractors who were to be paid by the project and
the Government of The Gambia on a pari passu basis. The works were completed by
project end and the contractors were paid directly by the Government after project closure
as reported by the country. (ii) Chad disbursed only 20%, resulting in the non execution
of (a) construction of water towers at locust-monitoring bases, (b) the sector-review study
on plant protection and pesticide management, and (c) full coverage of operating costs of
its national locust-control center.

2.2. Implementation

Mid-term review
22.     A mid-term review of AELP was conducted in December 2006. At that time,
implementation had slowed owing to sluggish procurement processes. Disbursement rates
for all countries were low, ranging from 17 percent in Mauritania to 35 percent in
Senegal. The low disbursement rate was in part justified by the fortunate fact that no new
major locust invasions affected the countries after the 2004 outbreak through 2006; hence
funds allocated for emergency locust management activities were not being disbursed and
could be reallocated to safeguarding the existing pesticides stocks. As shown earlier, the
mid-term review also led to subdividing components A and C for greater focus on
prevention and risk management.

23.    The mid-term review was also an opportunity to strengthen the level of
coordination between FAO, CLCPRO, and the World Bank, particularly concerning the
following elements: (i) sustainable long-term financing mechanism; (ii) the
socioeconomic compensation mechanism; (iii) biopesticides; (iv) the regional risk-
management plan; and (v) pesticide management. Actions to move forward in these areas
were clearly identified and included in the country dialogues.

24.     In addition, the mid-term review provided an opportunity to improve the regional
integration of the AELP countries‘ projects as it allowed for inter-country exchange in
each of the components of the project. In particular, important cross-fertilization occurred
in relation to future risk management (Components A and C) and compensation of
affected populations (Component B).

Project restructuring
25.     The AELP underwent level II restructurings in 2009 and in 2010. The
restructurings pertained to (i) a first extension of the closing date from June 30, 2009 to
June 30, 2010; (ii) a second extension from June 30, 2010 to May 31, 2011, except in The
Gambia, where the project closed on June 30, 2010, and Niger, where it closed on
December 31, 2010; and (iii) a reallocation of credit proceeds between categories of
expenditure. The restructurings did not change the PDO, the components, or the
indicators.

Performance
26.     The following factors hindered timely project implementation: (i) political
instability and civil unrest in Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger, which prevented key
field activities and hampered regular supervision by the Bank; 2 (ii) slow procurement
processes and subsequent slow disbursements; and (iii) delayed or partial counterpart
funding.



2
  In Mali, the project was directly affected by insecurity (project staff had been retained by kidnappers for over a month
and vehicles were stolen in two different circumstances). It should be pointed out that the Bank established some
‗palliative‘ solutions, through audio/video conferences and, in the case of Mauritania, ‗reverse‘ missions to Senegal.


                                                            6
2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

27.    M&E design. Country-specific M&E systems were established during project
preparation. In order to collect, compile, and harmonize national information and to take
regional activities into account, sharing a regional M&E system led by EMPRES was
also considered. Because the development of this system had been postponed to the
second phase of EMPRES, currently under preparation, the participating countries and
the project team complemented the existing country-specific systems with measurable
impact indicators common to all countries.

28.     M&E implementation. The implementation of the AELP M&E system was
generally satisfactory, with adequate collection and analysis of relevant data for all
components except component B, for which baseline data were lacking. This was due to
the fact that the project was prepared in a three-month period at a time of serious drought
and locust invasion. Given the emergency nature of the project it was not possible to
collect reliable baseline data on the respective roles of drought and locusts in crop losses.
Moreover, because this type of targeted help was new in the participating countries, it
was difficult to obtain accurate information on affected groups at the beginning of
project. To strengthen the M&E system, the project designed and implemented
an efficient system of scorecards, which were particularly useful for measuring the
progress of complex systems and institutions (i.e., the early warning and response system
for disaster management, Annex 4). In Burkina Faso, Chad, and Mali, where the capacity
of national institutions involved in project implementation was sometimes weak, locally
based Bank M&E specialists provided technical support, thereby enabling these two
countries to come up to speed with M&E data collection.

29.     M&E utilization. Appropriate data were evaluated and extensively used to assess
project achievements and constraints and to inform decision-making and resource
allocation. Although quantitative assessment in terms of restoration of productive assets
and revenues generated by micro-projects under component B could not be performed for
lack of baseline data, qualitative information obtained through beneficiary satisfaction
surveys was used to inform the M&E.

2.4. Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards
30.    For purposes of environmental assessment, the project was rated ―category B‖
with emphasis on preparing pesticide management plans to address the potential risks
associated with procurement of large quantities of pesticides. The safeguard issues were
well integrated into the project objectives by supporting improved strategies for
prevention, early warning, response, and mitigation at the national and regional levels.
The mitigation of safeguards risks focused on issues related to the utilization and
management of locust insecticides and associated environmental and human health risks,
as well as on the adoption of alternative locust-control approaches (mainly through
biopesticides).



                                             7
31.     The project triggered three environmental policies, OP 4.01 on environmental
assessment, OP 4.04 on natural habitats, and OP 4.09 on pest management. The country
projects prepared pest and pesticide management plans (in compliance with BP 4.01
annex C and OP 4.09), and environmental management plans (in compliance with OP
4.01 and 4.04). The methodology for safeguard review of AELP project documentation,
interviews with key stakeholders (including national locust-control units and village
brigades), and field visits to pesticide stores, health centers, and communal radio stations
were effective. Particular emphasis was placed on compliance with and implementation
of safeguard measures put forth in national pesticide management plans and
environmental management plans.

32.      An assessment of project compliance with environmental safeguards was carried
out from May to November 2007 by an international consultant. The assessment
highlighted a number of substantial achievements—chief among them improved
institutional and technical capacities of national locust-control units, high technical and
environmental standards in locust management, training of national control teams in the
use of biopesticides, and awareness among local communities and the general public
about risks associated with poor pesticide management. Some weaknesses were also
identified. These included variations among safeguards measures in terms of quality
resulting in different benchmarks, emphasis on the management of locust invasions rather
than on maintaining relevant capacities during recession times, and neglect of basic
safeguard measures for the storage of insecticides.

33.     The main recommendations formulated by the consultant‘s report included: (i)
harmonization of safeguard measures among AELP countries so that actions are based on
common environmental and human health standards and requirements; (ii) enhancement
of information exchange within and between the locust-control units of AELP countries
and their partners; (iii) more adequate design of pesticide storage, handling, and
management facilities; (iv) management of stocks in an effective, efficient, and
transparent way, preferably using the FAO Pesticide Stock Management System (PSMS),
or an equivalent system; (v) improvement of the capacity of health centers in the
treatment of pesticide poisoning incidents; (vi) joint surveys, (bio-) control operations,
and environmental/human health monitoring campaigns.

34.     Country-specific action plans for improved safeguards compliance were
implemented satisfactorily, and pesticide storage facilities were built in compliance with
key health and environmental principles3 in all of the participating countries. In Burkina
Faso, the construction of pesticide stores was hampered by difficulties in obtaining land
titles but completed during the last year of the project. In Senegal, the civil works
contract had to be interrupted in September 2010 because of accumulated delays; a new
procurement process was carried out to complete planned infrastructure. After project
closure, the pesticide stores will be managed in accordance with the environmental
management plans prepared before construction. Particular attention will be given to
maintenance of access roads, water supply, security, training of storekeepers, and buffer

3
 For instance, construction of access roads to stores, installation of grids to improve ventilation in stores, creation of
security exits, and respect for safety distances between human habitat and stores through the creation of buffer zones,
among other measures.


                                                            8
zones to prevent construction inside a 500-meter perimeter surrounding the stores. In
Mauritania, a special report on environmental safeguard activities was produced in 2010
and a detailed road map included systematic environmental screening of activities.

35.     The monitoring of environmental impacts was regularly carried out: (i) by the
Bank field missions, which verified adherence to sound environmental management
practices; and (ii) by the national QUEST (Quality, Environmental Protection, and Safety
of Treatments) teams, which ensured environmental and health monitoring and quality
control of all locust operations. Mali pioneered a program for management of
contaminated sites co-financed with the FAO. In collaboration with the World Bank‘s
Africa Stockpiles Program and the University of Wageningen in the Netherlands, six sites
were decontaminated based on the land-farming method. Maps of sensitive areas were
produced and digitalized, and empty pesticide containers were collected, treated, and
recycled.

36.     By project closing, compliance with safeguard policies was rated satisfactory in
all countries except Senegal (moderately satisfactory) where construction of a buffer zone
around the pesticide storage had not been completed by project end. The project team
worked closely with the government during the last supervision mission in May 2011 and
agreed on the measures required to ensure that the project will remain compliant with
Bank safeguards policies even after project closure. This is being closely followed up by
the project‘s task team leader, based in Senegal, to ensure satisfactory implementation of
the action plan related to the buffer zone. The overall safeguards rating is therefore
maintained as satisfactory.


Financial management

37.     Financial management is rated moderately satisfactory. Five audits were
conducted on time and financial reports prepared and transmitted in a timely manner.
Fiduciary management modalities and procedures varied by country. In Niger, it was the
ongoing Bank-financed Community Action Program (PAC, first phase), which ensured
fiduciary and financial management. In Mali and Mauritania, fiduciary responsibilities
were initially managed by Bank-financed projects—respectively, the Support to
Agricultural Services Project (PSAOP) and the Integrated Irrigated Agricultural Project
(PDIAM). These were later transferred to the national coordination units (NCUs) created
under the project (also referred to herein as national locust-control centers). The
remaining countries had their own financial management specialists.

38.     In Burkina Faso, ineligible expenditures in 2009 and 2010, mainly concerning
pre-financing of the counterpart funding, were subsequently reimbursed. However, the
main reason for the MS rating was the unsatisfactory financial management for The
Gambia, where the financial management review, conducted in July 2010, identified
ineligible expenditures in the amount of US$48,540 and raised suspicions of fraud
regarding training expenditures, which also increased the project‘s financial management
risk to substantial. This was reported to the Bank Integrity Unit (INT), which requested
that the Government of The Gambia conduct further investigations and take appropriate
measures regarding the suspicion of fraud. As a result, the ineligible expenditures were


                                            9
refunded, the government conducted investigations, and remedial measures were put in
place. A letter dated October 20, 2011 from The Gambian government declared that the
issues had been resolved. This was reported back by the task team to the INT for final
closure of the case.

Disbursement

39.      The project had disbursed the total loan proceeds by closure. Funds were
disbursed more slowly than planned over the first two years mainly due to slow
procurement processes and to partially unused funds of Component A, as discussed
earlier. However, disbursements increased substantially after restructuring, thanks to the
reallocation of funds and faster procurement. Funds were reallocated mainly from the
pesticides category (given that the stocks were sufficient and no more pesticides were
needed) to works for safeguarding pesticide stocks. In general, the gap between
disbursement estimates at appraisal and actual disbursements at project end is due to the
fact that the project was prepared very rapidly as an emergency operation and no
historical data were available to build upon, as this was the first project of its kind in the
Africa region. The project was therefore designed in a flexible manner to enable
adjustment of the funding as information became available. See annex 3 on project costs
by country, categories of expenditures, components and source of funds.

Procurement
40.      Procurement faced challenges at early stages of project implementation, generally
because Bank procurement policies had not been specifically adapted to the
characteristics of an emergency project. This was resolved when OP 8.00 came into effect
in March 2007. The main procurement issue related to laborious national procurement
procedures within national directorates of public procurement (directions générales des
marchés publics), resulting in long delays before contracting. Furthermore the general
procurement capacity of the NCUs was weak, owing to deficiencies in procurement
planning and monitoring, procurement cycle management, and procurement record
keeping. To address the capacity issue, Bank staff provided capacity-building support to
NCUs. The slow process of reviewing procurement documents by the national authorities
was brought to the governments' attention and pointed out during Country Portfolio
Performance Review meetings which resulted in an improvement of national
procurement processing timelines. At project closure, procurement was rated satisfactory
for all countries.

2.5. Post completion Operation/Next Phase

41.      There are no plans for a second phase of the AELP. The sustainability of its
initiatives is expected to be ensured by the national locust-control entities that have been
put in place or strengthened, with support from existing regional institutions
(FAO/CLCPRO). The PSMS and national databases will continue to be supported by
national resources. Overall, the monitoring and control of locust outbreaks remain high
on the governments‘ agendas given their potentially high destructive consequences. This
helps ensure a more resilient future scenario in case of new outbreaks. Under the
technical expertise of FAO/CLCPRO, the forthcoming second phase of EMPRES in West


                                             10
Africa will consolidate and build on the results achieved by AELP, provide more support
to preventive activities carried out by national teams, and strengthen regional
coordination and monitoring activities.

42.     The regional dimension of the project facilitated the sharing of lessons learned
among the seven participating countries. Experiences can be replicated to optimally
address future outbreaks in a much more efficient and timely manner. The respective
national locust-control units have the necessary equipment, logistics, practical knowledge,
and action plans to deal with future locust outbreaks.


3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation. Rating: Satisfactory

43.     Relevance is rated high. The project objective was and remains highly relevant
to past and current global priorities, and to Bank country assistance strategies in all seven
participating nations. In essence, the project has contributed to regional food security and
protection of agricultural production against migratory pests and natural disasters. These
are priorities in the countries‘ past and current assistance strategies. Furthermore, the
early warning and response system put in place can also be seen as a precursor of the
ongoing work on disaster risk management in line with the 2010 World Bank Climate
Change Strategy for Sub Saharan Africa, ―Making Development Climate Resilient.‖

44.     The main risks related to the project, such as environmental risks from poor
management of pesticides and their empty containers, as well as health-related issues
related to exposure to pesticides, were identified at the time of project preparation and
properly mitigated with environmental and social management measures that were
satisfactorily implemented. This further substantiates the high relevance of the project,
given its positive externalities in terms of environmental protection as a regional public
good.

45.     The project design and implementation approach were also highly relevant at the
time of preparation in 2004, as the project specifically focused on the Bank‘s areas of
comparative advantage in providing financing at the country level for activities that
complemented funds committed by other donors for regional initiatives. This relevance is
demonstrated by the AELP‘s ability to mobilize a regional Project Preparation Facility
(PPF) to control locust propagation and to support control campaigns throughout the
remainder of 2004 before main swarms began to migrate to areas with heavier rainfall.
This strategy was essential to eradicate the pests in a timely manner while the Board
approval process was underway. Other evidence of high relevance is demonstrated by the
fact that, during AELP, the three locust invasions that occurred between 2009 and 2011
in Chad, Mauritania, and Niger were controlled based on the timely prevention, early
warning, and reaction strategies put in place by the project. Without the project, these
outbreaks could have been major disasters on a par with the 2004 invasion, which
resulted in substantial agricultural and pasture losses in the region.




                                             11
46.     The quality-at-entry (QEA) review of June 15, 2005, rated the project‘s strategic
relevance and approach highly satisfactory, pointing out the appropriateness of its
approach and complexity, and the integration of lessons and of country and sector
knowledge in the project‘s design. The following quote from the QEA further
demonstrates the high relevance of the project: ―The panel rates the overall quality of this
operation, which was designed to join a group of international donors in helping to fight
an emerging locust invasion in West Africa, as Satisfactory. The panel believes the
configuration and design of the project are appropriate. This seven-country emergency
operation for countries at different levels of institutional capacity and readiness was
marked by the speed of the Bank's reaction (three months only between identification and
Board) and close coordination with FAO and other donors. Senior Bank, regional, and
country management helped assure that processing was expeditious. The three main
components covered emergency locust management (spraying, purchase of chemicals and
biological materials); emergency agriculture investments to help recovery of populations
affected by the current infestation; and improvement of national capacities for early
warning of locust attacks. The nature of the evolving emergency, and considerable
uncertainty as to which countries could be more affected, presented some design
challenges. At the same time, there was clearly a regional externality which had to be
addressed. These aspects were appropriately handled.‖

3.2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives. Rating: Substantial

47.    The PDO was to reduce the vulnerability of the participating countries to present
and future locust infestations by supporting improved strategies for prevention, early
warning, reaction, and mitigation, at both the national and regional levels.

48.     PDO attainment is measured by the following three indicators: (i) effectiveness of
the early warning and response system (as measured using the scorecard in Annex 4); (ii)
country risk-management plans clearly outlining roles and responsibilities of key
stakeholders and regionally coordinated with FAO and CLCPRO; and (iii) independent
national locust-control units in frontline countries operating with core government
funding.

49.     PDO-level Indicator 1: An effective early warning and response system for locust
infestations is established. Achievement of this indicator is measured by a scorecard
(Annex 4) consisting of the following six sub indicators, each rated by a performance
score between 0 (unsatisfactory) and 3 (highly satisfactory).

      Improved locust control (reaction): (a) control operations implemented according
       to an agreed upon regional contingency plan; (b) coordinated implementation and
       monitoring of locust detection and control plans; and (c) operating costs covered
       by Governments;

      Improved organization and reinforced locust-control capacity (operational
       readiness): (a) a nationally budgeted program to coordinate locust control; (b) a
       training plan targeting population, technicians, and higher level professionals, and
       (c) an equipment management plan including regularly implemented inventory,
       operating, and maintenance systems;

                                            12
      Improved pesticide management: (a) stocks inventory and PSMS updated
       regularly, including training and use of alternatives to pesticides; (b) percentage
       of volume of pesticides safeguarded in line with FAO norms; (c) percentage of
       empty pesticide containers collected; and (d) percentage of empty containers
       decontaminated and destroyed;

      Improved health and environmental monitoring: (a) health monitoring plan fully
       implemented by local health institution; and (b) environmental monitoring plan
       fully implemented by local environment institutions;

      Enhanced control and early warning systems: (a) elaboration and implementation
       of risk-management plan sustainably funded (more than five years) and reassessed
       annually with CLCPRO; (b) areas prospected for locust control; and (c)
       submission of progress reports to the DLIS Bulletin and to ECLO;

      Promotion of alternative locust-control measures through planned and
       implemented promotion of biopesticides.

50.     All countries exceeded the minimum score of 33 out of 48 required for effective
early warning. The national scores were as follows: Burkina, 37; Chad, 43; The Gambia,
40; Niger, 43; Mauritania, 44; Mali, 43; and Senegal, 39. PDO-level Indicator 1 was
therefore satisfactorily achieved.

51.     The effectiveness of the early warning system was also demonstrated by the
ability of three frontline countries (Niger, Mauritania, and Chad) to: (i) detect at early
stages three resurgences between 2009 and 2011 in their respective countries; (ii) react in
a timely manner to control the pests; (iii) prevent propagation in the region; and (iv)
avoid a major outbreak that could have wiped out the crops and pastures as in 2004.

52.    PDO-level Indicator 2: Country risk-management plans clearly outlining roles
and responsibilities of key stakeholders are regionally coordinated with FAO and
CLCPRO. Under the coordination of the FAO/CLCRPO, a regional workshop was
organized in Alger in 2006 and another in Bamako in 2008. IDA funds were leveraged to
enable the participation of all seven countries in the workshops. As a result, each country
developed a country risk-management plan including roles and responsibilities of key
stakeholders in locust control. This indicator was therefore attained in a satisfactory
manner.

53.     PDO-level Indicator 3: Independent national locust-control units in frontline
countries are operating with core government funding by the end of the project.
Independent locust-control units were created in Mauritania, Mali, Chad, and Niger, fully
staffed by the respective governments, and their recurrent costs earmarked in the national
budgets. The effective operation of the independent units was demonstrated by the ability
of the Mauritania, Niger, and Chad centers to control three resurgences as explained
above.



                                            13
54.     Through the attainment of the above three outcome indicators, the project
successfully established a prevention-mitigation system characterized by: (a)
strengthened capacity for surveillance and early warning during remission and upsurges
in order to reduce the risk of outbreak; (b) strengthened capacity to control locusts in case
of outbreaks and invasions in order to mitigate the impact of invasions by reducing locust
swarms and breeding; and (c) enhanced environmental and health management in order
to mitigate environmental and health risks related to locust-control operations.

55.     The project fostered regional integration in the fight against locust as shown by
the high score of 3 (highly satisfactory) of each participating country in the following
indicator of the scorecard (indicator 1a): locust control operations implemented according
to agreed upon regional contingency plan. This regional integrated approach in locust
control significantly contributed to the PDO achievement as evidenced by the quick
eradication of the three locust upsurges during project life conducted in line with the
regional contingency plan.

3.3. Achievement of Project Components

Component A: Emergency Locust Management. Rating: Satisfactory
56.     Performance of this component is measured through the following three
indicators: (i) national locust-control operations are established according to an agreed
upon regional contingency plan; (ii) national pesticide management practices meet
international safety regulations; and (iii) pesticide storage facilities are rehabilitated or
constructed.

57.     Indicator 1: National locust-control operations are established according to an
agreed upon regional contingency plan. As indicated above, all seven countries
participated in a CLPRO regional workshop in Algiers in 2006 and in another regional
workshop in Bamako in 2008. A regional contingency plan was agreed upon for the
implementation of future locust-control operations. The plan included: (i) the adequate
number of locust-control teams to be deployed for effective and timely control of the
pests in times of invasion; (ii) the elaboration of a locust detection and control plan; and
(iii) coverage of the operating costs of control by national governments. As per the
scorecard, this indicator has been attained satisfactorily by all participating countries.
This is evidenced by the rating of 3 (highly satisfactory) for six countries, and 2
(satisfactory) for Niger.

58.     The component also financed substantial training activities to support effective
control operations, including:

      Strengthening the capacities of key national institutions in crisis planning,
       prevention, and management, and training QUEST teams on health and
       environmental monitoring (including for potentially serious environmental side
       effects of the use of pesticides and verification to ensure that locust-control staff
       had been properly informed of the dangers linked to the use of pesticides);




                                             14
        Provision of scholarships to 28 civil servants for graduate and postgraduate
         studies mainly abroad in locust control and management 4 given the lack of
         national academic institutions in this area;

        Training on locust bio-ecology and control measures, and on risk prevention,
         including early warning and response systems and health and environmental
         protection through sensitization of producers and rural communities on correct
         use of biopesticides and secure management of pesticides and empty containers;

        Other specific training depending on local situations (for example, in The Gambia,
         locust teams agents, pilots, engineers, soldier trainers, and military officers were
         trained in the operation and maintenance of sprayers mounted on aircraft and
         other vehicles); and 5 civil servants trained in bachelor level degree in agriculture;

        General public awareness about locust risks and challenges in project countries
         through comprehensive communication strategies and the use of media (such as
         52 radio programs and 2 televised spots in Niger), in order to better involve
         various institutional actors in activities to prevent and combat migratory locusts;

        In Niger, acquisition of a locust-control airplane at the government‘s request to
         further strengthen the regional locust control capacity. Acquired in July 2009, the
         plane has not yet been used. Government funds to pay for pilot training, insurance,
         and spare parts were delayed. At project end, Niger confirmed that the plane‘s
         recurrent costs have now been budgeted, and it will be ready and available for the
         whole region to control locust outbreaks.

59.     Indicator 2: National pesticide management practices meet international safety
regulations. This indicator is measured by the following sub indicators in the scorecard:
(i) inventory of pesticide stocks and regular updates to the PSMS, including training and
use of alternatives to pesticides; (ii) percentage of volume of pesticides safeguarded in
line with FAO norms; (iii) percentage of empty pesticide containers collected; (iv)
percentage of empty containers decontaminated and destroyed; and (v) percentage of
empty containers decontaminated and recycled. The values of the scorecard for all
participating countries for these sub indicators vary between 2 (satisfactory) and 3 (highly
satisfactory). Only Niger received a 1 (moderately satisfactory) owing to the low
percentage (26 to 50%) of empty containers decontaminated and destroyed.

60.     The process of collecting, storing, treating, transporting, and recycling the empty
metallic and plastic containers proved to be complex and demanded extensive efforts in
certain countries. In Chad, where the number of containers was relatively limited (419),
60 percent were collected, rinsed, and safely stocked instead of being destroyed owing to


4
  This included two students in Chad, four in Mali, three in Niger, nine in Senegal, four in Burkina Faso, and six in
Mauritania. Many of these students went to the Hassan II Institute for Agronomic and Veterinary Sciences in Morocco,
where a strong partnership was created with the national locust-control center of Agadir, and to the AGRHYMET
center in Niamey, Niger.




                                                         15
the absence of adequate facilities. In Niger, about 600 metallic containers were treated
and stocked in a storehouse near Niamey. However, it was reported that some of the
additional empty containers were used by blacksmiths to make small furnaces or water
troughs for animals or even by households to store drinking water. Hence, the low
scorecard rating of 1.

61.     On the other hand, in Mali, about 15 tons of metallic containers and 10 tons of
plastic containers were sent for final treatment to a specialized private factory in Senegal.
In Mauritania, it was estimated that about 98% of the containers were successfully
collected and recycled.

62.     For sub indicators (i) stock inventory and (ii) safeguarding, the use by the
participating countries of the FAO-developed PSMS software, and other pesticide stock
management tools and guidelines under the Bank-financed Africa Pesticides Stockpile
Program, improved tracking of stocks and reduced risks related to the accumulation of
obsolete stocks. Thanks to assistance from FAO/EMPRES, USAID, and other donors,
risks of obsolete stockpiles were significantly reduced through a program allowing
countries with large stocks to transfer pesticides to countries in need.5

63.     Management of the pesticide stocks acquired for the 2004 locust invasion turned
out to be very complex owing to weak coordination of pesticide supplies from donors and
purchases of new pesticides by the countries. The result was large quantities of obsolete
stocks. Stocks of obsolete pesticides totaled about 161,000 liters in Mauritania (35% of
the total stock in the country), 217,000 liters in Senegal, 21,000 liters in The Gambia, and
122,500 liters in Mali. With support from AELP and EMPRES, a satisfactory system of
operational monitoring was put in place in the seven participating countries. Strategies
and procedures for safe management of locust-control pesticides were established and
implemented. The system fostered quality control of locust (and other pest) treatment in
compliance with standard pesticide application practices, through annual surveys of
sensitive areas. In Burkina Faso, for example, about 150,000 hectares were systematically
surveyed every year.

64.     Environmental impacts were evaluated and essential medical monitoring provided
for staff in all countries. In Mali, for example, 350 national technicians were tested each
year for cholinosterasis, 6 and in Mauritania all staff involved in treatment campaigns
underwent regular physical checkups.

65.     Indicator 3: Pesticide storage facilities are rehabilitated or constructed by the
project. In all project countries, pesticide warehouses have been completed in full
compliance with international standards. Pesticide warehouses include adequate
equipment, such as fire extinguishers, warning signs and sign boards, and tiling, as well
as buffer zones between warehouses and human habitats. In addition, regional storage
was built or rehabilitated in each country (Annex 5). These facilities enabled the

  In 2007, Mauritania donated about 70,000 liters of pesticide to Yemen; and in 2010, Mali gave large stocks to
Mozambique, Malawi, and Tanzania, as well as to Georgia.

  Blood test used to monitor the level of exposure to pesticides used in locust-control operations.


                                                      16
countries to safeguard obsolete pesticides destined for disposal once financing becomes
available to the country. Disposal was beyond the scope of this project.

66.     The component also supported the formulation, disclosure, and implementation of
an environmental and social management plan for the construction and management of
pesticide storehouses. In Senegal, a plan for pesticide and empty container management
(plan de gestion des pesticides et des emballages vides) was also formulated, and the
other countries developed similar tools. With support from CLCPRO/EMPRES, all the
countries created a national list of environmental requirements (cahier national de
charges environnementales) to minimize human and environmental risks related to the
use of pesticides.

Component B: Emergency Agriculture Investments. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
67.     This component aimed at making emergency investments to restore the
livelihoods of people affected by the 2004 invasions. The following indicators measure
the achievement of this component: (1) direct project beneficiaries whose livelihoods
were restored (households); and (2) a socioeconomic impact mitigation mechanism for
people affected by locust infestation.

68.    Indicator 1: Direct project beneficiaries whose livelihoods were restored
(households). The project supported approximately 400,000 households (approximately
4,000,000 people) affected by the 2004 invasion by providing agricultural inputs and
equipment, microgrants, revenue-generating microprojects, and community infrastructure
subprojects. Annex 7 provides details by country based on an evaluation of the
component conducted in May 2008 by an international consultant. The evaluation also
highlights the findings of national evaluations conducted by the countries.

69.    Based on the 2008 evaluation, qualitative data and satisfaction surveys of
beneficiaries indicate that the inputs allowed beneficiaries to resume production and to
reach or sometimes exceed pre-invasion levels. Where farming tools and animal traction
equipment were distributed (or purchased with microgrants), the local evaluation reports
observed a large increase in cultivated area, suggesting extensive development of rain-fed
production.

70.     Based on qualitative data, the project enabled the beneficiaries to restore their
livelihoods. The absence of baseline information discussed in the M&E section prevented
a quantitative evaluation of restored livelihoods.

71.     Indicator 2: A socioeconomic impact mitigation mechanism is established for
people affected by locust infestation. A mechanism has been established in all
participating countries, including risk-management and prevention plans developed by
the projects that also incorporate the impact mitigation mechanism. Details by country are
provided in Annex 7.

72.    On balance, given the lack of baseline information for indicator 1, which led to a
moderately satisfactory rating for that indictor, and successful achievement of indicator 2,
the overall rating of Component B is moderately satisfactory.


                                            17
Component C: Early warning and response. Rating: Satisfactory
73.     Results of this component are measured by six indicators: (1) preparation of
country risk-management plans; (2) national capacity for application of biopesticides for
locust control; (3) use of best practices by locust-control teams; (4) average response time
between warning of locust infestation and reaction; (5) number of operational locust
survey and control teams; and (6) regional locust-monitoring bases rehabilitated or
constructed.

74.     Indicator 1: Preparation of country risk-management plans. A key element to the
successful implementation of the AELP was the formulation of contingency and risk-
management plans. Following a joint EMPRES/AELP workshop in Bamako in 2008,
each frontline country received guidance on the formulation of a locust risk management
framework (cadre de gestion du risque acridien) that included two separate components:
(i) a locust risk prevention plan (plan de prévention du risque acridien); and (ii) a
national locust emergency plan (plan national d’urgence antiacridienne) in invasion
countries. CLCPRO had previously provided a framework for these documents at its
Algiers regional planning meeting in Algiers in 2006 (EMPRES 2006). The framework
described the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder involved in locust
management, according to the level of risks. In all seven countries, these management
and planning instruments were validated by technical workshops.

75.     Indicator 2: National capacity for application of biopesticides for locust control.
The AELP Technical Annex (World Bank, 2004) favored the adoption of biological
means of controlling locusts and grasshoppers, and strongly encouraged participating
countries to use the Green Muscle® mycopesticide, a naturally occurring fungus
(Metarhizium anisopliae), that is deadly to both locusts and grasshoppers but does not
damage other insects, plants, animals, or people. The biopesticide, according to
international safety regulations, provides a safe, natural alternative to chemical
insecticides in the fight against crop-destroying locusts and grasshoppers. However, the
adoption of Green Muscle proved to be more difficult than expected. Problems seem to
be related to its high cost, specific storage conditions, slow action, and difficulty of use
under natural conditions (the fungus prefers temperatures of 28–30°C and stops growing
above 35°). Prudence was also necessary, because of reports concerning the sensitivity of
camels to mycotoxins.

76.    In Senegal, the project supported the creation of a ―cold store.‖ Green Muscle has
been used since 2007, treating 71% of affected areas in 2010 (against 9% in 2008 and
43% in 2009), with mortality rates of about 95% after a 14-day treatment (aerial
treatment since 2009). In Niger, Green Muscle was used to treat about 36% of infested
areas.

77.     Mauritania adopted a very cautious approach, and carried out preliminary detailed
analyses (using the facilities of its laboratory in Akjoujt) on conditions favoring or
hampering operational use of Green Muscle. This approach, although scientifically
justified, prevented Mauritania from fully achieving initial plans to use the biopesticide in
20% of the affected areas.



                                             18
78.     In The Gambia, the biopesticides program was cancelled because of deficiencies
at the national agricultural research center.

79.     Six of the seven countries have the capacity to apply biopesticide for locust
control. However, because of specific storage conditions, slow action, and difficulty of
use under natural conditions, FAO recommended improving the durability, efficiency,
and physical stability of Green Muscle before using it on a large scale.

80.     Indicator 3: Use of best practices by locust-control teams. Achievement of this
indicator is evidenced by the successful eradication of three resurgences during the
project. To ensure that best practices methods are reinforced, the project financed
research on biological control of locusts and integrated pest management through several
joint research programs at regional and national levels.

        In Niger, activities were jointly implemented with the Directorate of Plant
         Protection and the Laboratory for Public Health and Expertise (LANSPEX) to
         train senior laboratory technicians and carry out analyses of pesticides, as well as
         analyses of samples of soil, water, and plants from areas infected in 2004. The
         project also established in 2008 an agreement with the Centre Regional de
         Formation et d'Application en Agrométéorologie et Hydrologie Opérationnelle
         (AGRHYMET) for research on biopesticides.
        In Mauritania, the national locust-control center carried out a comprehensive
         research program in areas such as the genesis and evolution of a gregarious locust
         population and production of vegetative maps of locust swarming areas.
         Furthermore, an information and knowledge sharing program was established
         with the Institut Supérieur d’Enseignement Technologique and the national
         university. At the international level, collaboration was also established with
         AGRHYMET, the University of Cordoba (Spain) and the International Center for
         Agricultural Research and Development (CIRAD, Montpellier, France).7
        In Senegal, in June 2010, a formal partnership agreement was established by the
         Plant Protection Directorate (DPV) with the Fondation CERES–Locustox
         (Regional Center for Research in Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety), in
         the areas of impact assessment and environmental monitoring of treatments
         against pests, toxico-vigilance, analysis of pesticide residues, pesticide
         formulation, and compliance. Most of the countries produced detailed maps of
         sensitive areas. In Senegal, these maps were digitized by the Ecologic Monitoring
         Center.
        In Mali an agreement was established with the Institute of Rural Economy (IER)
         in order to improve knowledge about locusts. Maps of sensitive areas were
         digitized by the Malian Geographic Institute (IGM).
        In Burkina Faso, a national locust observatory was put in place as an essential
         instrument to monitor the situation using GIS spatial data.
        In Chad, an agreement was signed with the Chadian Institute for Agronomic
         Research and Development (ITRAD) concerning research on biopesticides.


7
 Unfortunately, lack of funds prevented more in-depth research on the lethal effects of pesticides on Chilochorus
bipustulus, a ladybug enemy of the palm tree killer Parlatoria blanchardi (a white cochineal).


                                                       19
81.     As part of the effort to build national capacities for best-practice methods in locust
control, graduate and postgraduate scholarships were awarded to 28 people in six
countries, as indicated earlier. The scholarships were explicitly or implicitly conditional,
in the sense that after graduation the students were committed to spend a certain number
of years in professional activities related to national locust control (10 years, in the case
of Mali) or to reimburse part of the costs incurred (conditions specifically highlighted in
Mauritania).

82.     Indicator 4: Average response time from warning to reaction on locust infestation.
In every participating country, in conformity with the PDO, a functional early warning
and response system was put in place before the end of the project, including the requisite
human resource capacity, infrastructure and the equipment for rapid response to pest or
locust infestations.

83.     The average response time from warning to reaction was evidenced in three
countries when the three earlier mentioned swarms occurred: one day in Niger, and two
to five days in Mauritania and Chad.

84.     In an effort to further reduce the response time, in The Gambia, the early warning
and response system surveyed 1,800 hectares on a monthly basis and provided timely
reports of key information to regional locust and pest monitoring teams. About 5,800
farmer brigade trainers were trained on identification and reporting of outbreaks, while
226 women vegetable producers in 113 villages were taught to report locus infestation.
Furthermore, simulations exercises showed an average response time of one day.

85.     In Mali, a bottom-up feedback system, with the involvement of communities and
local authorities, is based on ―village ranger units‖ made up of local volunteers who are
put in areas at risk where eco-botanic characteristics appeared to offer favorable
conditions for outbreaks. The presence of the village rangers will ensure early
transmission of information and shorter response times. At the time of this ICR, Mali
confirmed a response time of one day in the event of an outbreak, based on its early
warning system and prevention measures in place.

86.     In Mauritania, the early warning and response system comprised annual
operations of between six and 15 monitoring units over a period of six to nine months. By
making the best use of its excellent relationships with nomadic pastoral communities, the
project set up an informal bottom-up information system on key locust-control
parameters (such as unusual presence of insects, color of locusts, behavioral changes,
etc.), to trigger early warning measures, thereby enabling further reduction of the
response time in case of future outbreaks.

87.    Indicator 5: Number of operational locust survey and control teams. In each
country a satisfactory number of survey and control teams were established in line with
the recommendations at the 2006 EMPRES regional planning meeting in Algiers
(Annex 5).




                                             20
88.     Indicator 6: Regional locust-monitoring bases rehabilitated/constructed. These
results have been achieved, as recorded in Annex 5: three in Burkina Faso and Chad; six
in The Gambia; two in Niger; four in Mauritania; four in Mali; and eight in Senegal.

Component D: Project management. Rating: Satisfactory
89.     Achievement under this component is measured by one indicator: Countries using
information to adjust priorities of the project to respond to locust infestation emergencies.
In all of the countries, the NCUs played a valuable role in formulating a communication
strategy and facilitating knowledge sharing among the seven countries through regional
workshops and combined supervision missions. This enabled good coordination and
preparedness, and adjustment of priorities to respond to locust infestation emergencies.
This is evidenced during the three outbreaks that occurred in the midst of AELP, by the
quick reaction of the national locust-control centers, acting as NCUs of the project.

90.     In all seven countries, the NCUs also played a key role in supervising and
coordinating relationships with ministerial departments and other national and
international stakeholders to build regional readiness to manage potential infestation
emergencies.

Activities with Regional Scope
91.     In addition to activities at the national level implemented by the NCUs, two areas
of project interventions warranted regional integration: (i) coordination of national locust-
control activities and (ii) research into alternatives to chemical control measures.
Coordination of countries‘ activities in these two areas took place through a series of
annual meetings organized by CLCPRO as indicated above.

92.     The leveraging of IDA funds to support participation of the seven countries in
these events has enabled regional capacity building and sharing of experiences among the
countries, thus ensuring a regionally coherent approach to the fight against desert locusts,
while safeguarding pesticide stockpiles so that they are readily available for future
invasions in the West Africa region and beyond (particularly for South–South
collaboration). This was the case in 2007, when Mauritania donated about 70,000 liters of
pesticides to Yemen, and in 2010, when Mali gave large stocks to Mozambique, Malawi,
and Tanzania, as well to Georgia. Furthermore, successful environmental safeguard
procedures fostered through IDA funding ensured protection of the environment as a
public good.


3.4. Efficiency. Rating: Substantial

93.     Economic analysis. The AELP is part of the EMPRES‘s joint and longer-term
effort. Therefore, project impacts and results represent only a fraction of the potential and
longer-term benefits. The joint effort is expected to generate substantial benefits in terms
of averted locust infestation for all the locust-prone countries of Sahel and the Maghreb.

94.    An ex ante economic analysis was not performed during the AELP preparation
due to the emergency nature of the project. The benefits accruing from the project are


                                             21
significant but could not fully be assessed—again because of the emergency nature of the
AELP. Those benefits include the averted health burden (malnutrition and its effect on
diarrhea and acute respiratory infection), environmental degradation (loss of biodiversity),
loss of economic opportunity (from reduced agricultural yields and livestock mortality),
and social distress (pauperization, stress, and migration). An ex post AELP economic
analysis followed a very conservative stance, using as an averted loss only 0.1% of the
agricultural value added and pasture yield (mainly focusing on agricultural economic
opportunities as a proxy), whereas the three resurgences of a locust outbreak that were
detected and effectively mitigated during the AELP implementation could have wiped out
at least 10% of the agricultural value added in each of the seven countries.

95.     The ex post AELP economic analysis, which covers the project life (2005–11),
was performed for the overall project, by country, and for infrastructure and equipment
disbursements (Annex 6). The analysis was performed at three levels: (i) the entire
project; (ii) the project components (considering IDA-only as well as IDA and country
disbursements); and (iii) IDA infrastructure and equipment. Because more precise health,
environmental, economic, and social data were not readily available for a full ex post
economic analysis, the IDA and country investment costs, including the four project
components, were adjusted by a standard conversion factor (shadow prices), and the
benefits (factor costs) were derived by proxy as noted above (i.e., a conservative 0.1% of
the agricultural GDP based on an FAO suggested method and 0.1% of pasture land—dry
matter yield under a very conservative rainfall of 250 mm/year on average over the
period—in the seven countries).

96.     The economic analysis estimated the ex post benefits accruing to society. The
overall AELP‘s four-component analysis yields a net present value (NPV) of US$49.0
million over seven years and a benefit/cost ratio of 2.5 associated with a positive
economic internal rate of return (IRR) greater than 200 percent. Considered individually,
6 countries revealed positive net economic benefits. The exception was The Gambia,
which had the second-slowest agricultural GDP growth over the period (+9 percent
against 10.3 percent for the seven countries as a group) mainly because of lower budgeted
funds for the project and the sector. When considering IDA disbursements alone, the
four-component analysis shows the same overall project outcomes (Table 3.1).

97.     The overall project infrastructure and equipment analysis NPV, discounted at 12
percent, is also positive at US$29.2 million over seven years. The benefit/cost ratio is 3.3,
while the IRR is considerably positive and higher than 200 percent. Moreover, when
taken individually, all countries show positive economic benefits except Mauritania. This
was caused by the comparatively low actual growth of its agricultural GDP over the
period (5 percent against 10.3 percent for the seven countries as a group), due mainly to
high variability of rainfall, especially in 2006 and 2007.

98.      A sensitivity analysis conducted to test the robustness of project benefits (0.08%
for both the agricultural value added and affected pasture land instead of 0.1%), reveals
that the project is still viable on both counts: the four-component analysis (NPV of
US$40.3 million with an IRR greater than 200% and a benefit/cost ratio of 2.3); and the
infrastructure and equipment analysis (NPV of US$20.7 million with an IRR >200% and
a benefit/cost ratio of 2.6). The Gambia and Mauritania, already with negative NPV, fail
in the sensitivity analysis to pass the benefit/cost criteria (The Gambia for the four-
component analysis, and Mauritania for the infrastructure and equipment analysis). Niger
also fails to pass the infrastructure and equipment analysis, mainly because an airplane
was purchased but not used during the AELP. For the infrastructure and equipment
analysis, the plane is considered as a negative benefit during the project lifetime, although
it is expected to be used in the future. For the full economic analysis, see Annex 6.

3.5. Justification of Overall Outcome. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

99.     Evaluation of the achievement of outcomes under the AELP should take into
account the following elements: (i) The project was prepared as an emergency response
to an unprecedented locust invasion and little was known at the time about the magnitude
of the infestations or the extent of the livelihoods destroyed;(ii) The project was prepared
within a three-month period at a time when Bank experience with locust control was
limited, which required ―complex donor coordination done with great skill,‖ as quoted by
the QEA of June 2005 report.

100. The overall project outcome is rated moderately satisfactory on the basis of: (i)
high relevance, (ii) substantial efficacy, and (iii) substantial efficiency in most countries,
with shortcomings in The Gambia, which has a negative IRR for all components owing to
poor agricultural growth over the period due to lower budgeted funds for the project and
the sector; Mauritania, which has a negative IRR for the project components and for
infrastructure/equipment, owing to factors lying outside the scope and control of the
project; and Niger, which has a negative IRR for infrastructure/equipment because a
purchased aircraft was not used during the project life.


                                                                  23
3.5. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
101. In its design and implementation, the project directly aimed to benefit vulnerable
populations living in areas affected by locust infestations. Project activities were highly
consistent with the current development priorities of participating countries in terms of
poverty reduction strategies. Vulnerable households in all countries were directly targeted
by compensation measures in the form of distribution of agricultural inputs and
equipment, revenue-generating microprojects, microgrants, and community infrastructure
subprojects. Women and youth were the main focus of the compensation measures,
except in Burkina Faso and Niger, where women constituted the large majority of
beneficiaries compared with youth. The decontamination of polluted sites helped protect
populations against both health and environmental risks.

Institutional Change and Strengthening
102. Despite its emergency aspects, the project had a substantial, long-term impact on
institutional development at the national level through the creation and operation of
national locust-control centers, the formulation of comprehensive national locust
emergency plans (PNUAs), and the staffing of national institutions with skilled people.

103. The process of identifying, planning, implementing, and monitoring the various
activities of the project helped revitalize technical line departments, strengthening their
relationships with other sectors, and facilitating the inclusion and participation of rural
producer associations.

104. Governments‘ capacities have been specifically strengthened as follows. (i) A
results-based M&E system was rolled out in all institutions involved with project
implementation; (ii) Fiduciary management included better procurement, financial
management, and environmental and social safeguards through specific technical support
from Bank staff; (iii) An early warning and response system has been established to
counter future locust invasions; (iv) Technical knowledge in locust control and
management has been increased through academic and on-the-job training for key staff
involved in locust monitoring and control activities, pesticide management, and
environmental and health safeguards.

Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
105. The project helped to efficiently link national researchers to international
networks and allowed proactive forms of knowledge management and sharing, even
beyond locust-related issues.




                                            24
4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

4.1. External risks. Rating: Significant

106. Political instability and unrest and civil insecurity. The present situation in the
Northern Regions of Mali and Niger, as well as some western parts of Mauritania towards
the Malian border is still unclear. This situation could have an impact on the
sustainability of many future activities and affect the long-term flow of benefits.

4.2. Internal risks. Rating: Moderate

107. Readiness of government to deal with future infestation. National governments
have to deal with multiple social, economic, and financial problems linked to global and
volatile economies. They could therefore emphasize other current development issues at
the expense of preparedness and response to unpredictable future locust crisis. Because of
long remission periods between upsurges, governments of member countries could fail to
maintain even the minimum capacity necessary to continue sound prevention practices.
However, the close involvement of national governments in project implementation has
increased their awareness to the risk posed by locusts and should ensure the continued
priority of the agenda.

108. Balancing the availability of pesticides with disposal of expired stocks. National
agencies will need to better manage and coordinate potential incoming new pesticides for
future outbreaks and ensure the safety of current stocks and their future disposal when
they become obsolete. Otherwise health, natural resources, biodiversity, and the economy
could suffer severe detrimental effects.


5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1. Bank performance. Rating: Satisfactory

Quality at Entry (QAE): Rating: Satisfactory
109. The operation was QEA reviewed and assessed by QAG on June 15, 2005. The
overall rating of the quality was ―Satisfactory‖ based on the fact that the configuration
and design of the project were appropriate. Other strong aspects substantiating this rating
as underlined by the review are: ―(i) use of existing institutions, mechanisms, ongoing
projects to benefit from synergies for an effective and quick start; (ii) complex donor
coordination handled with great skills; (iii) flexible design to permit reallocation of funds
to priority investments on the basis of discovered facts as well as the audit of the locust
elimination covering Bank, FAO and other donor efforts; and (iv) strong handling of
M&E for an emergency operation, with a clear path to defining specific benchmarks,
complementing with surveys on longer-term impacts.‖ The review however suggested
that 100% financing could have been made and that allocation of funds to the countries
could also have been more flexible, with a ―common minimum for each country plus a
fund from which differential needs as they emerged could have been treated
differentially‖.


                                             25
Supervision: Rating: Satisfactory
110. The Bank actively and successfully acted in order to integrate the project into the
existing regional institutional architecture (the EMPRES system, since 1994, had given
priority to transboundary pest and disease problems; and the CLCPRO was already
promoting, through the EMPRES program, regional and national action, research, and
training). During implementation, working relationships with CLCPRO/EMPRES were
excellent and many supervision missions were conducted jointly. Very quickly, the Bank
was considered a partner strongly supporting existing prevention strategies and providing
much needed funding. The overall result, highlighted also by the mid-term evaluation of
the EMPRES program in Western Africa Region, held in 2009, was excellent
collaboration and complementarity, with the aim of avoiding duplication of initiatives
and seeking to cofinance some facilities (such as pesticide storehouses, whose costs had
been underestimated by EMPRES).

111. Effective implementation of activities was also supported by biannual supervision
missions specifically stressing environmental issues and challenges. Supervisions were
supported by an adequate number of specialists including pesticides, environmental and
social safeguards specialists who provided the technical skills mix needed to address
sectoral concerns. Furthermore, operations, procurement, financial management and
monitoring and evaluation specialists were also part of the supervision team. There was
low turnover of task team leaders as the TTL was changed only once due to a
reorganization in the Bank in 2008. Furthermore, in each country a locally based TTL
ensured close monitoring of project activities. Adequate measures were taken to speed up
the implementation process (in Senegal, for instance, during the last 6 months of the
project, a joint task force made up of representatives of the Bank, the DPV, and the
National Coordination Unit, held weekly meetings in order to solve procurement issues,
monitor pending activities, and hasten their implementation before the end of the project).
Audio/video conferences were organized when political and social unrest did not allow
regular supervision missions. Budget constraints were such that the involvement of a
social safeguard specialist from Washington was once a year instead of two. To
overcome this constraint, the team recruited a local safeguards consultant and in the end,
the budget constraint did not limit effectiveness of implementation support. Please see
annex 8 for the team list and related financial resources.

112. Senior Bank, regional and country management helped assure that processing of
the project was expeditious to adhere to its emergency nature. Throughout
implementation, Bank regional and country management staff remained supportive of the
project by helping to address national slow procurement issues and bring up the issue of
counterpart funding at the Ministry of Finance levels, thereby facilitating release of the
funds. They also provided supervision budgets based on the regional norm, which is tight,
but as indicated above, with locally recruited consultants, the team managed to ensure
effective implementation support.

113. The two cases of fiduciary irregularities discussed in the ICR were quickly
identified by the Bank team who proactively brought them to the attention of the
respective governments and to INT. The matters were followed up closely by the Bank
team to ensure proper handling by the governments through investigations ordered by


                                            26
INT. These resulted in refunding the Bank of the ineligible expenses. The cases have now
been resolved and closed.

5.2. Borrowers’ performance. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

114. The governments of the seven participating countries generally supported the
project, facilitating administrative decisions, creating adequate institutions to implement
and monitor activities, supporting the involvement of a network of national public and
private stakeholders, and earmarking funds for locust control. All the national ICRs
rightly praise the performance of their respective governments and their commitment to
project activities. In Senegal, for instance, at the very outset of the preparatory phase, the
government had disbursed about US$8 million from its budget to start locust-control
operations and committed participation of the army to coordinate operations. Furthermore,
countries have put in place National Locust Emergency Plans and Locust Risk Prevention
Plans.

115. Also the governments of Burkina Faso and The Gambia decisively handled the
two cases of fiduciary irregularities mentioned earlier, which led to their timely resolution
and closure.

116. A weak area in Borrower‘s performance relates to late earmarking (2011 national
budget) of recurrent costs of an SCI Turbothrush aircraft for locust control, bought in
Niger in July 2009. Due to this, purchase of spare parts, insurance, and refresher training
for pilots)8 could not be completed during the project life.

117. In The Gambia, future institutional sustainability has been jeopardized by the
decision, following the restructuring of the Ministry of Agriculture, to streamline plant
protection into a service rather than a separate Department. The result was that the service
would no longer be able to ensure the coordination of the regional locust-control teams—
established and strengthened by the project—and of the early warning and response
system put in place (which would require a single chain of command for a well
coordinated rapid response to locust or other migratory pest invasions). It is uncertain
how future coordination of locust control will be ensured in this country.

118. Furthermore, counterpart funding release was delayed in all participating
countries, although fully or exceedingly disbursed by project closure, except for The
Gambia, where only about 50 percent of the committed funds were disbursed.




8
  An article published by a local newspaper in December 2010, at the time of the public conference of the anti-
corruption commission, highlighted prolonged delays and possible waste of funding (purchases costing US$1.7
exclusive of tax, in addition to recurrent costs estimated at US$100,000 for 150 hours of operations). A budget of
US$230,000 was allocated in the 2011 annual budget of the national locust-control center for the purchase of spare
parts, insurance, and refresher training of pilots. The Government committed to resolve all the logistical problems and
to organize an inaugural flight before the end of the grace period, which ended on April 30, 2011. However, the aircraft
has been stored at the aerial base of the crop protection department in Niamey and, at the time of the present ICR, the
aircraft had not yet flown for its inauguration.


                                                          27
5.3. Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

119. In the seven AELP countries, the general performance of all the institutional
actors involved in the implementation for the different activities was moderately
satisfactory. This includes national agencies, specialized laboratories, private service
providers, national NGOs, and producer associations, as well as national agencies in
charge of public works (such as the Malian AGETIER and the Mauritanian
AMEXTIPE)9. The MS rating is due to the fact that the collaboration with AMEXTIPE in
Mauritania did not always result in timely and efficient completion of works. The
problem was linked to the fact that AMEXTIPE was supervising both implementation of
the works through local entrepreneurs and their quality control through local bureaus.
This was identified and avoided for subsequent works. In Chad, the level of commitment
of managers and staff of the implementing agency was low and this, coupled with the
social and political unrest in the country, impacted timely implementation of the project.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance. Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory
120. The overall performance of the participating countries is considered moderately
satisfactory given: (i) the systemic counterpart funding delays and shortfalls in all
participating countries throughout project implementation; (ii) the unavailability of funds
to operate the aircraft purchased in Niger for locust control until project closure on May
31, 2011 (although its recurrent costs have now been budgeted in the 2011 national
budget); and (iii) the institutional change in The Gambia discussed above, which might
jeopardize the project‘s long-term impact in that country.


6. LESSONS LEARNED
121.        A number of lessons can be drawn from the AELP experience:

Monitoring and evaluation. It is important to collect baseline data for effective
measurement of interventions of the community-driven development (CDD) type. Such
data are needed to substantiate qualitative data collected through surveys of beneficiaries‘
satisfaction. If it is not possible to collect baseline information during preparation,
extensive efforts should be made to do so during implementation. In the event this proved
impossible because of the absence of national statistics, project restructurings should be
used as opportunities to review the objective of CDD-type components, possibly reducing
their scope and selecting quantitatively measurable indicators for which baseline data are
available.

Design and implementation of CDD-type component. The Bank‘s know-how with respect
to CDD and social protection programs needs to be fully exploited in the design,
implementation, and monitoring of community microprojects that seek to restore local
livelihoods. This leveraging could have helped mitigate shortcomings related to the
inadequate expertise of locust-control agents about key community development
requirements and the absence of clear guidelines on compensation measures for victims.

Implementation support and supervision funds. Regional projects with important
environmental and safeguards aspects such as the AELP should be allocated sufficient
implementation support funds to allow participation in each mission of experienced
environmental and safeguards specialists from the Bank. Given the potential reputational
risks associated with projects involving the use of chemicals that can have negative
environmental, health, and social impacts, and the ensuing negative externalities at the
regional level and costs associated with compensations, it is essential that due diligence
of safeguards instruments be closely monitored with adequate budget through Bank staff
instead of local consultants.

Counterpart funding. To avoid implementation challenges caused by unavailability or
delayed counterpart funding, it might be appropriate to look into financing projects by
100% if in line with the country financial parameters.

Sustainability
 Although no plans presently exist for a second phase of the AELP, it is important not
   to lose the momentum built by the project. Appropriate measures should be taken in
   order to systematically mainstream pest control, in general, and locust control, in
   particular, into future Bank-supported agricultural development and natural resource
   management projects, as well as into crises preparedness and response components of
   social protection policies. The Bank, for instance, through the Global Facility of
   Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) should establish close strategic
   partnership with the forthcoming second phase of the EMPRES Western Africa
   Region project implemented by CLCPRO, which will provide more sustainability for
   preventive activities carried out by national teams, and strengthen regional
   coordination and monitoring activities.

   In all frontline countries (Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Chad), the project supported
    the creation of a national locust-control center whose services and maintenance are
    earmarked in the countries‘ national budget. Governments will need to disburse funds
    in a timely manner to fully guarantee sustainability of project achievements.

Annex 6. Economic and Financial Analysis of Project

Background
1. The economic analysis or the national profitability analysis aims to identify and
measure the net economic benefits of the project from the society point of view.
Moreover, the national profitability analysis is determined with the help of adjusted
prices (i.e., shadow prices) that are deemed to be an approximation of true economic
prices (reflecting the social opportunity cost). Similarly, in the case of national
profitability analysis, the social discount rate is applied, i.e., the rate at which the
Sahelian countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, The Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and
Senegal) can borrow money taking into consideration the country risk.

2. The Africa Emergency Locust Project (AELP) is part of the EMPRES‘s joint and
longer term effort. Therefore, the AELP impacts and results are only a fraction of the
potential and longer term benefits of the joint effort that would hopefully generate
substantial benefits in the future for all the locust-prone countries of the Sahel and the
Maghreb.

3. An ex ante economic analysis was not performed during the AELP preparation due to
the emergency nature of the project, i.e., time constraints. The ex post economic analysis
only covers the AELP during the lifetime of the project, i.e., the 2005–11 periods. Three
indicators will be considered to determine the viability of the project:
     The net present value (NPV) which is the difference between the discounted total
        benefits and cost;
     The internal rate of return (IRR), which is the discount rate that zeroes out the
        NPV or, the interest rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows equal
        to zero; and
     The benefit-cost ratio, which is the ratio of the present value (PV) of benefits over
        the PV of costs over the lifetime of the project.

Economic Analysis Process
4. The ex post economic analysis was performed for the overall project, by country and
for the infrastructure and equipment disbursements. Hence, the analysis was performed at
3 levels: project level; four components level considering IDA alone as well as IDA and
country public disbursements; and IDA infrastructure and equipment level:
      The project level considers the aggregation of the four components as well as the
         aggregation of infrastructure and equipment disbursements (see below).
      The combined four components of the AELP include: (i) helping countries to
         control/manage locust infestations; (ii) mitigating the effects of locust
         infestations on people and the environment; and (iii) helping to ensure a more
         timely reaction to future infestations. Whereas component B is by far the most
         important in terms of budget allocation and mitigation (sustaining targeted
         people livelihood after the devastating effects of the 2004 locust infestation that
         sometimes led to the increase of the harvested land area prior to the infestation).


                                            45
        it is important to note that both components A and C of leveraging the
        component B benefits. For instance, under components A and C, the
        strengthening of the national centers for locust control (CNLCPs) proved
        effective: (i) locust outbreaks between 2009 and 2011 were rapidly neutralized in
        Mauritania, Niger and Chad, in compliance with environmental standards and
        social practices; and (ii) early warning and prevention capacities developed for
        locust invasions were efficiently used against grasshoppers, in particular in
        Senegal where 80% of infested areas were treated, and Burkina Faso, for training
        purpose. Hence, the four components are considered simultaneously in the
        economic analysis.
       The infrastructure and equipment investment disbursement are considered in the
        analysis. For instance, a plane was bought for Niger that was not utilized during
        the 2005–11 periods. Since the economic analysis focuses on the project per se,
        an alternative analysis was performed that considers the plane as a negative
        benefit as it was not utilized during the AELP implementation although it could
        eventually be used in the future.

5. A number of socioeconomic and environmental benefits could accrue with the
implementation of the project but could not be valued due to time constraints and readily
available data. Estimates of the benefits based only on averted direct crop losses clearly
underestimate the true cost of the disasters. A ―without project‖ scenario could notably
have the following health, environmental, economic and social negative direct and
indirect effects:
     Morbidity and mortality: malnutrition incidence increase, especially among
        infants and children under 5 years old that could have probably increased the
        children under-5 year mortality rate. Malnutrition is a condition that increases the
        risk of contracting other opportunistic diseases such as diarrhea and acute
        respiratory infection.
     Soil degradation: threatened habitat, loss of biodiversity and increased
        desertification.
     Opportunity loss: cash crop cycle disruption and livestock decline will have a
        direct loss of productive assets/capacity that will have negative effects on future
        production with direct effects on general consumer prices for food and animal
        fodder.
     Human and social capital: increase in pauperization, rise of psycho-physical
        stress, erosion of the coping mechanism and likelihood of migration and possibly
        settlement in peri-urban areas.

6. Incidentally, poor pesticide management under component B could have had
detrimental health, environmental, economic and social effects if safeguards were not put
in place, namely:
     direct or ―second hand‖ exposure of pesticide handlers and local residents to
        unsecured/obsolete pesticides;
     direct and indirect effects on natural resources including water, biodiversity and
        soil (food and water contamination);
     direct economic effects on yields (honeybees, fish, etc.); and


                                            46
      direct social pain, suffering and coping (disease), and migration due to livelihood
       disruption.

7. Yet, pesticide distribution was judiciously managed in all countries especially in
terms of storage and spending was kept to a bare minimum and was reduced from an
originally budgeted US$5.3 million to an actually disbursed US$0.60 million. Hence, any
social externalities are assumed to be minor during project implementation and are not
considered in the economic analysis.

8. Precise economic analysis is made difficult by the complexity and heterogeneity of
the AELP health, environmental, economic and social expected outcomes. For instance,
potential income generation, the well being improvement and the state of the commons
accruing to the targeted population estimated at 4 million people and their habitat across
7 countries during the project implementation were not quantitatively monitored.

9. Therefore, proxies were used to perform the ex post economic analysis as it only
covers the reduction of the agricultural value added due to a possible ―without project‖
disruption attributed to locust infestation. A without project could have increased the risk
of locust infestation as time series show cycle resurgence of locust infestation that can
sometimes be triggered by droughts.

10. The FAO‘s Global Assessment of Soil Degradation (GLASOD) survey data was not
used in the economic analysis as it dates back to the 1990, which is self-defeating for the
2005–11 periods. The retained method to derive the social benefits for the economic
analysis is derived from FAO (Moussaoui, 2010) and considers a fraction of the
agricultural GDP as well as the dry material in pasture land (for livestock feed) that will
be affected by locust prevalence. A very conservative 0.1% of the agricultural value
added and the 0.1% reduction of the dry material on 1% of pasture land for each country
under the lowest rainfall scenario (250 mm/year to avoid precipitation variability) for
each country in terms of averted losses was retained. The FAO also suggests two other
scenarios that were not retained: a 1% and 10% relative figure of the agricultural GDP in
terms of losses due to locust infestation: indeed, a major production collapse could occur
as demonstrated by the previous locust outbreaks with ample health, environmental,
economic and social ramifications.

11. The initial dataset is illustrated in Tables A7.1 and A7.2. Total IDA actual
disbursements amount to US$63.1 million over the 2005–11 periods. The government
actual disbursement estimates were derived from the original project document and
amount to US$13.5 million. As for the agricultural GDP, all trends are positive over the
2005–11 periods as illustrated in Table A7.1 and Figure A7.1. Nevertheless, Chad
registers a significant decline in 2009 due to poor rains and pestilence, and Mauritania
and Senegal show slight variability over the 2005–09 periods. Moreover, all these figures
need to be considered with caution as they are not adjusted for price, market and
institutional distortions. Table A7.3 provides the disbursements on infrastructure and
equipment for each country.

12. A number of key assumptions have been considered for the economic analysis:
     The economic analysis is carried out over a period of 7 years from 2005 to 2011.
     A real discount rate of 12% per annum is used.
     The overall standard conversion factor for adjusting market prices to shadow
       prices is set at 0.71 based on professional judgment in the Sahel region. The
       shadow wage is 1 as most labor needed for the whole project, microprojects and
       other activities are assumed to be locally hired.
     The agricultural GDP was adjusted by 0.8 to provide the agricultural value added
       at factor cost.



                                                                49
      Droughts and precipitation related variability are already factored in the actual
       agricultural GDP.
      Dry material averted through locust prevention is equivalent to the border
       (international) price of the equivalent amount of barley to feed the livestock.
      Both the agriculture value added averted reduction and the averted pasture
       degradation are only used for the 4 components analysis whereas only the
       agriculture value added averted reduction is used for the infrastructure and
       equipment component.
      Priority investments, which do not include undisbursed funds, are disbursed
       equally over the 7 years of the implementation of the project as exact figures are
       not available per year.
      Disbursed government funds were estimated to represent 80% of the original
       budgeted funds (Table A7.1).
      The right-of-way including the price of land and any structures upon it is zero as
       it is owned by the government.
      Real operations and maintenance (OMEX) cost is used in the analysis.
      The actual gross domestic product (GDP) per year was adopted for the calculation
       from the 2005–11 periods (World Bank WDI, 2010, data for 2005–09; and IMF
       Article IV, 2011 for the 2010–11 projection estimates).
      All benefits are assumed to begin to accrue in 2005.

Economic Analysis Results
Determination of NPV, IRR, and Benefit/Cost Ratio
13. The overall project four components’ economic NPV discounted at 12% is positive
with US$49 million over 7 years. The benefit/cost ratio reaches 2.5 while the economic
IRR is considerably positive and greater than 200%. (Table A7.4). Despite the
conservative stance and the few benefits considered in the economic analysis, the project
is economically viable and was worth implementing. Yet, when looking at each country‘s
economic analysis, 6 countries show economic viability whereas only The Gambia fails
to pass the benefit/cost analysis criteria due to both endogenous and exogenous factors.
Despite the irregularity of government disbursement funds and the complicated
procurement procedures, both Mauritania and Chad have faced climatic variability during
the implementation of the project, which however did not affect the economic viability of
project. As for The Gambia, the counterpart fund (only 5% of IDA funds and the lowest
among the 7 AELP countries) disbursement was an issue all over the project lifetime,
which could have affected the economic results although most outcomes were reached
according to the monitorable indicators.

14. The same calculations were performed only with IDA funds and the results are almost
similar than the ones illustrated in Table A7.3 with a NPV of US$54.6 million, a PV
benefit/cost ratio of 3 and an IRR greater than 200% with the same 6 countries showing
economic viability.

15. The overall project infrastructure and equipment economic net present value (NPV)
discounted at 12% is also positive with US$29.2 million over 7 years. The benefit/cost
ratio reaches 3.3 while the economic IRR is considerably positive and higher than 200%.


                                           50
(Table A7.4). By country, all infrastructure and equipment investment spent show a
positive return except for Mauritania due to both exogenous (rainfall variability during
the 2006–09 periods) and endogenous factors affecting its agricultural production (Table
A7.4).

Note: A plane was bought for Niger and was not used. For the infrastructure and equipment analysis, the
plane is considered as a negative benefit during the project lifetime although it could eventually be used in
the future.

Sensitivity Analysis
16. The sensitivity analysis is conducted to test the viability of the benefits representing
0.08% of the agricultural value added and 0.08% of the pasture instead of 0.1% or each.

with an economic IRR greater than 200% and a benefit/cost ratio of 2.3 (Table A7.5).

18. The overall project infrastructure and equipment component economic NPV
discounted at 12% is also positive with US$20.7 million over 7 years. The benefit/cost
ratio reaches 2.6 while the economic IRR is considerably positive and higher than 200%
(Table A7.3). By country, all infrastructure and equipment spent also show a positive

 Annex 7. Details on Component B

 Evaluation of indicator 1 of component B—Direct project beneficiaries that restored their
 livelihood (households)—is drawn from the 2008 evaluation conducted by an
 international consultant. Based on his report, which also highlights the findings of
 evaluations by national consultants in each country, it is estimated that about 400,000
 households, approximately 4,000,000 people, benefitted from project direct support. The
 table below provides data on the beneficiaries reached as well as the types of investments
 provided to help restore their livelihoods.

 1.      For the monitoring of impacts of agricultural distributed inputs, only Chad and
 Niger have collected some information on the agricultural production capacity of affected
 groups.
 2.      Niger. In 2007, a national consultant was commissioned by the project to conduct
 a survey assessing the situation prevailing before the 2004 locust attacks based on
 agriculture statistics and beneficiaries‘ interviews. The consultant collected data on
 cultivated surface areas and agricultural yields. The survey showed (i) yield increases
 associated with more productive varieties of seeds provided by the project, compared to
 the ones initially used by the farmers before the invasions; (ii) restoration of agricultural
 production capacity and (iii) more cultivated areas than before the attack. However, the

                                                  52
weakness of this study relates to the fact that the collected data do not allow extrapolating
these important yields and production gains to all project interventions in surveyed areas.
3.     The first inputs were distributed nine months after the locust attacks and the
majority of subprojects started only in 2006, two years after the attacks. This was far too
long for people who had lost everything and who received no other support.
4.      Chad. A baseline survey was conducted. Based on some data from the survey, the
national consultant concluded a considerable increase in surface areas cultivated (greater
than 50 percent compared to 2005) following distribution of inputs and animal traction
equipment distributed by the project. However, the report quality was evaluated as poor
by the country and therefore not validated at the national level.
5.     The Gambia. The Gambia conducted an agricultural loss assessment that provides
information on surface areas, yields and production before and after attacks by
grasshoppers and other pests, but not related to locust attacks.
6.      Mali. A survey on households and communes affected by the locust attacks was
done in 2007. That survey proposed indicators that could be used to assess component B
impacts. The national consultant that evaluated component B impact does not make any
concrete reference to these indicators, but his report concludes that, thanks to micro
grants, there was an important increase of yields and revenues among the affected
population.
7.      Burkina Faso and Mauritania. No baseline surveys were performed. But the
national evaluation consultants noted in their reports important yield gains and an
increase of cultivated surface areas compared to the situation before the attack, thanks to
the purchase of animal traction equipment and the use of the inputs distributed by the
project.
8.      In general, the inputs and equipment distributed to restore productive capacities
were greatly appreciated by recipients and were generally used for their intended
purposes when distributed at the right time. According to few qualitative data and
satisfaction surveys of beneficiaries, the inputs allowed them to restart production and to
reach or sometimes exceed their levels before the invasion. Where farming tools and
animal traction equipment were distributed (or purchased with microgrants), consultants
observed an important increase of cultivated surface areas suggesting an extensive
development of rain fed production. Even though input distribution impacts are
considered very positive, it should be noted that these measures were implemented more
than two years after the invasion.
9.      Income generating microprojects (IGMs) were implemented very late in 2006 and
2007, with the exception of a few microprojects in Senegal (production of green beans)
that started in late 2005. However, the IGMs were not closely monitored to assess their
impacts and pertinence in term of rapid generation of revenues for the affected population,
and their efficiency (income generated versus projects investment costs).
10.    The delay was mainly due to the fact that this targeted support was new, and it
was difficult to distinguish locust-only damage from drought-related damage, which was
not covered by the project. Also contributing to the delay were: (i) the absence of clear



                                             53
guidelines on compensation for victims; and (ii) inadequate expertise on the part of
locust-control agents about key community development requirements.
11.     Furthermore, the project‘s main focus was to ensure control and management of
locusts through prevention and preparedness, and by taking steps to reduce impact after a
disaster has occurred. The latter objective included measures to mitigate the health and
environmental impact of locust-control operations—through disposal of empty pesticide
drums, improvement of pesticide warehouse and storage conditions for remaining
pesticides, and monitoring of environmental and health impact. The overarching goal of
protecting the population made it necessary to undertake these activities as a priority and
in a timely manner, which contributed to delaying the provision of agricultural inputs and
development of microprojects.
12.    Indicator 2: Socioeconomic impact mitigation mechanism established for people
impacted by locust infestation has been achieved. Below are the results by country:
13.      Burkina Faso. A national mechanism for prevention and management of food
crisis is functional. Mechanisms have been set up for emergency intervention and socio-
economic impacts mitigation in case of infestation.
14.   Chad. The locust socioeconomic impact mechanism has been developed and is
now part of the overall national crisis management mechanism.
15.   The Gambia. An emergency funding mechanism for future invasions has been
completed.
16.     Mauritania. The National Plan for Natural Disaster Management has a
socioeconomic compensation component. The national locust-control center contributed
to its development. This system of management of socioeconomic compensation against
damages of locust infestations was introduced and passed via a communication to the
Council of Ministers in January 2010. It is now housed at the national platform for
disaster risk management within the Ministry of Environment.
17.     Mali. A study was conducted to establish a sustainable mechanism for
compensation and emergency. This study has been validated and the mechanism will be
part of the country‘s calamity fund (fond de calamité).
18. Niger. A study was conducted and recommendations made. The food crisis
compensation mechanism already managed at the level of the Prime Minister‘s cabinet
will also support locust invasion victims in the future.
19.     Senegal. A national system for prevention and management of food crisis has
been developed into which a specific locust-related compensation mechanism is
integrated.

Annex 9. Summary of Borrower’s ICR

Introduction
In order to prepare their own national ICRs, the seven participating countries were
provided with clear guidelines concerning both the general structure of the document and
its key analytical elements. This annex focuses on three key aspects highlighted by the
national ICRs:
   a) Presentation of major achievements as well as main constraints and issues faced
      during the implementation of the AELP;
   b) Assessment of the pertinence of the project, its main implementation modalities,
      physical achievements, lessons learned and, whenever possible, impact of project
      activities on national development policy; and
   c) Key recommendations to ensure the sustainability of the achievements of the
      AELP.


Burkina Faso

General institutional arrangements
      The Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Halieutic Resources was in charge of the
       implementation of the project;
      A Steering committee was put in place to coordinate and monitor the
       implementation of all the activities of the project;
      A Project Coordination Unit was created, made up of: one coordinator, one
       procurement specialist, an administrative/financial expert, an M&E specialist, a
       secretary, and two drivers.

Presentation of major achievements as well as main constraints and issues faced during
the implementation of the AELP
Overall, the design of the project was satisfactory. The project efficiently integrated
concerns related to the sustainability of the achievements and the continuity of the role of
public services. Key results are the following (presented by component):

Component A - Emergency locust tracking and pesticide management: Activities
significantly improved response capacities and skills of actors involved in locust control
and safe and environmentally sensitive management of pesticides through: (i) training of
four specialists abroad as well as of 150 agricultural agents and 26,000 producers; (ii)
annual survey of 150,000 ha; (iii) acquisition of material and equipment; and (iv) creation
and operationalization of a database for the management of pesticides, and rehabilitation
of a decontamination center (for the treatment of empty containers).

Component B - Emergency agriculture investments: Activities of this component
contributed to providing short-term food security to a number of households and to
reconstitute productive assets of about 76% of populations affected by locust invasion,


                                            58
through 911 microprojects (for a total cost of about US$1.8 million). A total of about
490,000 persons benefitted from the activities of the project, and, according to the results
of an independent survey, about 86% of them manifested their full satisfaction. Although
formal activities ended in 2008, some self-financing activities (such as livestock fattening
schemes and gardening activities) are still benefitting some households.

Component C - Early warning and response: Activities focused on strengthening the
early warning, intervention and supervision capacities of the DPV. Other activities
focused on: rehabilitation of three pest control facilities and storehouses, building of DPV
training facilities (with adequate equipment), connection to water and electricity of three
regional antennas, and provision of six pest control facilities with radio
transmitters/receivers. In addition, DPV facilities were rehabilitated after the 2009 floods
(total cost estimated at about US$400,000). Finally, the project put in place the National
Locust Observatory, a key early warning instrument for spatial database and transmission
of data via VSAT.

Assessment of the pertinence of the project, main implementation modalities, physical
achievements, lessons learned and impact of project activities on national development
policy
      The Bank provided efficient support to the implementation of the various
       activities of the project. Particularly important was the 2006 mid-term review held
       in Nouakchott, which refocused objectives and areas of intervention and allowed
       better targeting mechanisms in the specific context of each country. Furthermore,
       the Bank ensured advisory services to monitor the activities, through regular
       consultations between experts. Workshops were organized to focus on specific
       issues, such as M&E and harmonization of the results framework, with indicators
       and targets specific to each country;
      The change of the Director of the DPV (the structure in charge of implementing
       components A and C) was a main constraint affecting the efficiency of the
       implementation of various activities;
      At the end of the project, a special committee recommended the transfer to the
       Ministry of Agriculture of all project equipment. The national budget will assume
       recurrent costs, and the maintenance of vehicles (a total of about US$26,000).
      The agreement between IDA and the Government of Burkina concerned SDR 5.7
       million, equivalent to US$8.4 million. For the period 2005–08, the total
       contribution of the Government was estimated at US$1.44 (of which US$1.2
       million as tax exemption), and a counterpart funding of FCFA 122 million (or
       about US$240,000). On September 20th, 2011, the cumulated value of the
       investments was about US$8.9 million, equivalent to an implementation rate of
       86.9%.

Key elements to ensure the sustainability of the achievements of the AELP in Burkina
   1. Integrate maintenance costs of teams in charge of locust control into the annual
      programs of the DPV;



                                            59
   2. Ensure permanent operations of the satellite-based monitoring and control system
      (ONCP);
   3. Ensure functioning and maintenance of infrastructure and equipment;
   4. Strengthen provincial committees in charge of selecting microprojects (by
      involving new stakeholders);
   5. Institutionalize an ‗Emergency response fund‘; and


Chad
The agreement between IDA and the Government of Chad concerned about SDR6.1,
equivalent to US$ 9.5 million.

Presentation of major achievements as well as main constraints and issues faced during
the implementation of the AELP
Overall, the design of the project is satisfactory.

Component A - Emergency locust tracking and pesticide management:
 Environmental protection activities concerned the following: Collection and analysis
  of existing legal texts on pesticide management; preparation of guidelines concerning
  the management of pesticides and empty containers and related information/ training/
  communication products; environmental evaluation of contaminated areas;
  establishment of an environmental and social management plan (building of
  pesticides storehouses); inventory of pesticides; operationalization of QUEST teams.
 Facilities for emergency control operations: building two main storehouses and three
  additional storehouses (equipped with equipment compliant with norms); and
  reforestation of buffer zones (around main storehouses).

Component B - Emergency agriculture investment: Preparatory activities included:
Socioeconomic studies of sensitive areas; identification of most affected villages and
producers (9,373 producers, in 40 villages in 13 subdistricts), and assessment of
emergency mechanisms to assist the targeted communities. Investments aimed at
mitigating negative impact of locust invasions on local populations: agricultural and
veterinary inputs were distributed to more than 7,500 producers and 16,000 animals were
vaccinated; 93 microprojects benefitted local populations through microgrants; eight
wells and three boreholes were built or rehabilitated; and 10 ha were used for irrigation
and four micro water-catchment works were built.

Component C - Early warning and response:
 Creation of the ‗National Agency for Locust Control‘ (ANLA), with establishment of
  legal support documentation, recruitment of staff, creation of facilities and acquisition
  of adequate equipment. However, government funding has not been fully disbursed to
  this date (September 2011);
 Local training of agents on locust control: bio-ecology, detection techniques, and
  information processing and management; specialized training of two civil servants



                                              60
    (acridology); training of four agents on use of software (Map Info and Ramses V3
    and Elocust 2);
   Research on sensitive areas (mapping), agreement with the national research institute
    (ITRAD), experimental use of biopesticides and training of teams on the use of
    biopesticides;
   Participation in regional initiatives aimed at coordinating project activities (including
    participation in a regional workshop on use of biopesticides); and
   Various activities supporting locust-control operations (including establishment of an
    annual monitoring plan and production of regular newsletters on locust-control
    operations).

Assessment of the pertinence of the project, main implementation modalities, physical
achievements, lessons learned and impact of project activities on national development
policy
The achievements of the AELP in Chad have been satisfactory. Good results of activities
of components A and C are a result of timely use of locust-control field teams and
capacity building measures. Good results of activities of Component B are a result of
adequate provision of agricultural inputs and funding of microprojects.
Major constraints faced by the project
       Low level of commitment of managers and staff of implementing agencies;
       Laborious national procurement procedures, together with Bank own procedures,
        resulted in long implementation delays.
       Bank‘s requirements not fully adequate with financial capacity of local service
        providers;
       Insufficient capacities of national consultants;
       Insecurity because of armed conflicts (at least until the beginning of 2008).
Lessons learned
       Need to adapt laborious national procurement procedures, together with Bank
        own procedure, to the characteristics of emergency projects;
       Emergence of a positive dynamic at the level of local communities and
        community-driven development.

Key recommendations to ensure the sustainability of the achievements of the AELP in
Chad
1. Make the ANLA fully operational (with adequate financial means).
2. Ensure the sustainability of the achievements (infrastructures, logistics, equipment,
   studies, and management plan).

The Gambia

Presentation of major achievements as well as main constraints and issues faced during
the implementation of the AELP
Overall the project Development Objective has been attained. Overall, the project has the
capacity to react and control future locust invasions.

Component A - Emergency locust management: The project undertook a nationwide
inventory taking exercise to recover obsolete pesticides and safeguard the acceptable
ones (a total of 21 tons of pesticides was recovered and safeguarded). In a bid to create
public awareness on the dangers of pesticides, the project conducted various activities
(sensitization of some 5000 farmers, over 20,000 other people benefitted from radio
programs). Activities targeted the mainstream extension service, soldiers and farmer
brigades (training of 210 trainers for established teams; six Control and three Regional
QUEST teams were trained on control and safeguards). Other segments of society were
sensitized/trained on pesticide management (national assembly members, police officers,
NGO personnel, teachers, students, etc.).

Component B - Emergency agriculture investment: To restore agriculture productivity in
priority rural areas damaged by locusts, activities included provision of seeds and
fertilizers to affected communities so that they can restore their livelihood. In this regards,
the following tasks were accomplished: 179,000 farmers from 230 villages were
compensated with seeds/fertilizers; Rice production of 12,000 farmers was improved by
the distributing of 15 tons of rice seeds to 230 villages; 230 affected communities
received mangos, cashew, orange seedlings, cassava cuttings; 97,000 small ruminants and
poultry of 230 villages were vaccinated against PPR/NCD, 1500 watering cans
distributed to vegetable producing villages; and 15 tons and 500 tons of rice seeds were
distributed (in 2008 and 2010 respectively).

Component C - National capacity for early warning and response: The expected output
for this component was the improvement of national capacity for monitoring and
reporting of future outbreaks. Participatory monitoring was the cornerstone for this
component. Hence various stakeholders and relevant service providers were trained on
the monitoring, identification and timely reporting of outbreaks. A major prerequisite to
this effect is the strengthening of the capacity of these partners. Consequently: 5,840
farmer brigade trainers on identification and reporting of outbreaks; 226 women
vegetable producers in 113 villages trained on vegetable production and identification
and reporting of locust infestation; five technicians were trained to the bachelor level in
agriculture; one pilot and one technician trained on operation and maintenance of two
locust-control aircraft; constructed a hangar for two control aircrafts; exposed 30 locust
teams on tour to Mauritania and Senegal to enhance their knowledge in locust control and
management.

Component D - Project management: The project was managed (that is, designed,
adjusted, monitored and evaluated) effectively to meet the, possibly, shifting
requirements and priorities of the effort of assisting with management of locust


                                              62
infestation and its impact on people and the environment in concerned countries. A
project coordinating unit (CPU) was set up to look into the implementation process
(members of the PCU were trained in various professional disciplines, for improved
overall project management).

Assessment of the pertinence of the project, main implementation modalities, physical
achievements, lessons learned and, whenever possible, impact of project activities on
national development policy
Lessons learned
   The counterpart fund was a big issue throughout implementation of the project which
    impacted on overall implementation in terms of delay and friction with contractors.
    The availability and adequacy was greatly questionable. Government was supposed to
    disburse 21 Million GMD in four years but disbursed only 50% of the total over a
    five years period.
   The financing plan was also a big issue that the percentage by category allocated to
    Government by IDA example for civil works (30%) was high and Government was
    unable to meet such conditions.
   The third issue was the project funds could not be used to control other pest when the
    country was experiencing other pest infestations.
Key recommendations to ensure the sustainability of the achievements of the AELP in
The Gambia
   Counterpart fund should be waived where feasible or be kind to facilitate the smooth,
    effective and efficient implementation of the project;
   Where counterpart fund must be involved, it should be conducive for the effective
    and efficient implementation of the project and the percentage of counterpart
    financing should be at most 10% or below;
   Pest control projects could be appraised to be a bit flexible in intervening in all pest
    problems.


Mali

Presentation of major achievements as well as main constraints and issues faced during
the implementation of the AELP in Mali
Component A - Emergency locust management:
    Emergency. In spite of no major outbreaks since 2004, national capacities for
      locust control have been significantly improved through acquisition of material
      means. Technical capacities and skill of locust-control agents have been
      improved through adequate training sessions (doctorate studies in acridology
      abroad for four agents).
    Emergency operations. Planning capacities have been improved with the
      formulation of an annual locust-control plan (there was no plan before the
      project). Today, the Locust Risk Management Framework includes two separate


                                             63
        components: (i) a Locust Risk Prevention Plan (PPRA), and (ii) a National
        Locust Emergency Plan (PNUA).
       Pesticide management. With adequate support by the AELP, a satisfactory
        system of health and environmental monitoring has been put in place, with the
        creation of a multidisciplinary team, which fosters quality control of locust
        treatment in compliance with standard pesticide application. A guide for key
        environmental tasks has been formulated (it included 87 different requirements to
        minimize human and environmental risks related to the use of pesticides). About
        15 tons of metallic containers and 10 tons of plastic containers were sent for final
        treatment to a specialized private factory in Senegal. A strategic stock of
        pesticides (about 72,000 liters) has been created and managed according to FAO
        norms.

Component B - Emergency agriculture investments:
   About 5,000 households received about US$2 million as microgrants, in order to
     purchase agricultural inputs and equipment. Their revenues substantially
     improved (from US$2 million in 2005 to about US$7 million in 2008);
   About 25 microprojects contributed to the improvement of local livelihoods,
     through the creation of infrastructures and facilities, such as feeder roads, wells,
     markets, community cereal stores) (total cost about US$ 0.8 million).

Component C - Early warning and response:
   In Mali, as in the other frontline countries, a national locust-control center was
     established in 2006 (reporting to the Minister of Agriculture). A plan of action
     was elaborated and implemented, in compliance with the National Locust
     Emergency Plan. Six monitoring teams ensure full coverage of locust traditional
     habitat;
   A bottom-up feedback system has been put in place around rural communities in
     areas at risk;
   The project supported the creation of the headquarters of the national locust-
     control center (CNCLP) in Bamako, as well as an operational unit in Gao and
     three branches at the local level;
   With the AELP support, the CNCLP engaged in the promotion of biopesticides
     (including the construction of a store and the conduct of tests).

Component D - Project management: Overall expenditures for this component were
about US$3.9 million (with a budget implementation rate of 98.9%).

Assessment of the pertinence of the project, main implementation modalities, physical
achievements, lessons learned and impact of project activities on national development
policy
The impact of the project is considered positive, for many reasons:
   Support to the creation of an efficient national locust-control center;
   Strengthened local intervention capacities;
   Effective managed emergency situations (through adequate equipment);


                                            64
   A functioning system of environmental and health monitoring (with good results in
    preventing contamination and intoxication of the environment and population);
   Restoration of the productive capacity of households affected by the 2004 invasion;
   Productive infrastructures (microdams, stores, ponds) to affected communities.


Lessons learned
   Future projects should stress the need to adequate training on M&E (lack of
    capacities hindered adequate activities of the AELP coordination unit at the beginning
    of the project). Through consultations, a number of measurable, clear and pertinent
    indicators should be defined;
   Support to affected population, through the involvement of NGOs, has to be properly
    defined. As NGOs do not cover the entire national territory, adequate and sustainable
    monitoring of activities would be better done through the involvement of line
    departments.

Key recommendations to ensure the sustainability of the achievements of the AELP in
Mali
       Sustain the funding of locust-control operations (maintenance of vehicles and
        equipment, training of staff, etc.);
       Share information among the countries affected by locust invasions should be
        pursued and strengthened (trough joint operations, tour visits and exchange of
        experiments;
       Delegate responsibilities for micro projects to local governments;
       Continue decontaminations of polluted locations.


Mauritania

General institutional arrangements
       The Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) was in charge of the implementation
        of the project.
       A Steering committee was put in place by the Secretary of the MRD to supervise
        the implementation of all the activities of the project.
       A Project Coordination Unit was created, made up of: one coordinator, one
        procurement specialist, an M&E specialist, and an expert in charge of Component
        B.

Presentation of major achievements as well as main constraints and issues faced during
the implementation of the AELP
The general design of the project is good. It allowed a satisfactory implementation of the
project, particularly Components A and C, which are part of the mandate of the CNLCP.
More difficult was the implementation of activities of Component B, because of their



                                            65
characteristics exogenous to the mandate of the CNLCP. Overall the main expected
results have been achieved.

Component A - Emergency locust tracking and pesticide management: Activities
significantly filled the gaps in terms of means of emergency control that had been found
during the invasion. Acquisition of considerable equipment and material as well as
building the capacities of the national locust-control center (CNLCP) in terms of
pesticide management allowed the achievement of key results of this component. CNLCP
was enabled to control different outbreaks during the project implementation period, in
compliance with environmental and social practices and norms.

Component B - Emergency agriculture investments: Through the activities of this
component, the project provided assistance to populations affected by the crisis, in order
to restore their productive capacities. About 340,000 people benefitted from a variety of
measures: Agricultural equipment for gardening work, rehabilitation of rural
infrastructures, and support to pastoral producers. A system of socioeconomic
compensation was defined, and included into national mechanisms for disaster
management.

Component C - Early warning and response: A key element to the successful
implementation of the activities was: (i) the definition and operation of an efficient early
warning and response system, (ii) the strengthening of the CNLCP which is now
endowed with significant administrative and financial autonomy, and (iii) the promotion
of Green Muscle® (in collaboration with FAO and IFAD). Research activities were
carried out on a variety of topics.

Assessment of the pertinence of the project, main implementation modalities, physical
achievements, lessons learned and impact of project activities on national development
policy
   Overall fiduciary management was satisfactory (in terms of audits, DRF, RSF) and
    procurement. Major constraints were related to unsatisfactory mobilization of
    government funds. Positive results were achieved in the areas of communication and
    information;
   Services provided by the Bank ensured efficient implementation of the project. Close
    and regular monitoring of activities contributed, among others, to the achievement of
    the project main objectives;
   Through numerous decisions, the government favored the implementation of the
    project (creation of an autonomous administrative agency in charge of locust control,
    nomination of the director of the center as the AELP coordinator);
   A substantial part of recurrent costs were ensured by the State (national budget);
   CNLCP human resources largely contributed to successful implementation of the
    activities;
   Most of human resources and skills developed by the AELP were transferred to the
    CNLCP at the end of the project (although additional funds will be required to sustain
    intervention mechanisms, research and trainings well as maintenance of equipment).

Key recommendations to ensure the sustainability of the achievements of the AELP in
Mauritania
       Sustain advocacy to mobilize required financial resources from the Government;
       Support human resources and skills developed and their progressive replacement
        to take over;
       Ensure proper operation and maintenance of infrastructures and equipment;
       Strengthen regional and international frameworks for partnerships and
        consultations;
       Find a solution for the disposal obsolete products (within the context of the
        PASP).


Niger

General institutional arrangements
   The Ministry of Agricultural Development (MDA) was in charge of the
    implementation of the project (however, today, this ministry has been replaced by two
    separate ministries, Agriculture and Livestock);
   A Steering committee was put in place to coordinate and monitor the implementation
    of all the activities of the project;
   The project has been managed by a National Coordination Unit made up of: one
    coordinator, one procurement specialist, an administrative/financial expert, an M&E
    specialist, a secretary, and supporting staff.

The total cost of the AELP/Niger was about US$12,820 of which US$9.94 million IDA
and US$2.88 million from the Government of Niger.

Presentation of the major achievements as well as main constraints and issues faced
during the implementation of the AELP
The general management of the project is satisfactory. The «scorecard» is 43 out of 48
Key achievements are the following:

Component A - Emergency locust tracking and pesticide management: Activities related
to training, sensitization, health monitoring and pesticide management achieved
important results, such as: operationalization of the emergency locust tracking system
(resumption of detection in Tamesna areas, part of the breeding area; improved pesticide
procurement, transport and storage practices (access to and use of equipment);
compliance of stores to standard practices; collection and treatment of empty containers.

Component B - Emergency agriculture investments: A range of activities were carried
out: improved access of households to improved seeds (2005–07); improved agricultural
yields (34% for millet and 47% for sorghum, in 2005–07); increased agricultural
production (rain fed and irrigated); increased revenues of vulnerable producers (through a
range of microprojects with significant net margins, for livestock fattening schemes and
breeding and production of groundnut oil (by women‘s groups).

                                           67
Component C - Early warning and response: Major results were the following: Building
the capacities and skills of 97 agents (prevention, early warning and use of biopesticides)
including four students in acridology (one at doctorate level); improved information
management; functionality of the national center for locust control; acquisition of an
agricultural aircraft for large scale treatments; strengthened intervention system;
improved locust control (through regular monitoring mission); control of all the
outbreaks between 2009–11 (5,000 ha); and improved information sharing among the
affected countries.

Assessment of the pertinence of the project, main implementation modalities, physical
achievements, lessons learned and impact of project activities on national development
policy

The performance of the Bank was satisfactory through: organization of 10 supervision
missions, fast and regular treatment of reimbursement claims, rapid treatment of no
objection procedures, close monitoring of project activities through numerous
videoconferences, organization of training for project staff (namely on M&E procedures),
and a disbursement rate of about 99.77% (i.e. about US$ 10.2 million).

The government efficiently supported the implementation of the project, through:
resumption of consultations with the donor community after the locust invasion, rapid
recruitment of a coordinator and creation of a project steering committee, support to the
participation of administrative authorities in the implementation of the project, financial
support to the national locust-control center (CNLCP), and role of officials of the MDA
in implementing different agreements, as well as disbursement of counterpart funding (a
total of about US$1.14 (including tax exemption). However, recurrent costs (maintenance
of buildings, equipment, agricultural aircraft, etc.) amount of about US$400,000/year
over the first five years after the end of the project should be supported by the
government.

Key recommendations to ensure the sustainability of the achievements of the AELP in
Niger:
      Empower agencies, which will ensure future monitoring of activities;
      Adequate budget support by the Government to CNLCP and its operations.


Senegal

Presentation of the major achievements as well as main constraints and issues faced
during the implementation of the AELP
Overall, the project was successful as it contributed to reduce the vulnerability of the
country to future locust invasions. This included: improved prevention, early warning and
control strategies for locust invasion, formulation of a National Locust Emergency Plan,
strengthening of a locust-control framework, support to population affected by locust

                                            68
invasion, and reduction of negative health and environmental impacts. More specifically,
main achievements are the following:

Component A - Emergency locust tracking and pesticide management: Implementation of
the key provisions of the National Locust Emergency Plan; acquisition of material and
equipment; promotion of biopesticides (use of Green Muscle against grasshoppers and
adequate equipment); pesticide management and rehabilitation of stores in compliance
with international health and environmental norms.

Component B - Emergency agriculture investments: Support to about 86% of targeted
population (to restore productive capacities and livelihoods of more than 12,000
households through 305 micro projects); integration of lessons learned by the project into
national food security mechanisms; inventory of key plant protection issues and
formulation of recommendations.

Component C - Early warning and response: Building the capacities of stakeholders
(training of an agronomist in acridology, 8 technicians in plant protection, as well of 200
agents and 6,600 producers). Creation of a central store (to stock up to 9,000 tons of
products), six secondary stores, seven locust units at the local level, and a central unit in
Richard Toll. Acquisition of 24 vehicles (4x4), and 10 motorbikes.

Assessment of the pertinence of the project, main implementation modalities, physical
achievements, lessons learned and impact of project activities on national development
policy
The project implementation was satisfactory (with a scorecard of 39 out of 48) and a
disbursement rate of 99.9%.

Key recommendations to ensure the sustainability of the achievements of the AELP in
Senegal:
      Implement the investment plan recommended by the plant protection review;
      Continue the effort of the Government to support all running costs (estimated at
       about US$22,000 for the secondary locust unit at the local level and about
       US$110,000 for the headquarters in Richard Toll;
      Transfer all the equipment and material of the project to the DPV;
      Continue the implementation of the recommendations of the national list of
       environmental referents;
      Ensure compliance of store management with the ESMF;
      Strengthen the intervention capacities of the QUEST teams; and
      Improve the management and quality control of pesticides of the 2004 campaign
       (about 217,000 liters)
