Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, where large-scale\n            introduction of new crops on existing estates is envisaged,\n            prior assessment of the technical capability of staff to\n            carry out such a program should be required. Second, when\n            local procurement of large quantities of highly specialized\n            factory equipment is envisaged, the capability of local\n            producers to deliver quality products in a timely manner\n            needs to be ensured. Third, when launching a major factory\n            rehabilitation program, besides renovation, emphasis should\n            be given to innovation to modernize the industry and enhance\n            productivity. Fourth, tenders for complex technical\n            installation, including civil works, equipment, and\n            auxiliary supplies, should be issued on a package basis.\n            Fifth, adequate staff allocation should be made to ensure\n            timely auditing. Lastly, care should be taken in selecting\n            suitably qualified consultants to develop monitoring and\n            evaluation systems."}, "docdt": "1990-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
