diversify unprofitable low yielding tea lands out of tea\n            into spices and fuelwood. The project would help improve\n            management systems and also strengthen financial control and\n            information systems in major tea producing public\n            corporations, stabilize eroding lands, and improve welfare\n            of tea estate workers. The project comprises: tea\n            replanting, and factory rehabilitation infilling programs in\n            high country and low country areas; greenleaf and made tea\n            transport; rehabilitation of labor housing and improvement\n            of water supply and medical facilities; provision of\n            processing and storage facilities for spices and field and\n            nursery equipment; and technical assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1982-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
