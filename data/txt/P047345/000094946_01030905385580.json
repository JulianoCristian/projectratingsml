The two main\n            components will: 1) support wastewater investments in the\n            Anhui Province in eight municipalities, through the\n            implementation of the first phase of the wastewater Master\n            Plan. Investments include the construction of secondary\n            sewers, and house connections; interceptors; pumping\n            stations, and pumping/transmission mains. In addition,\n            construction of wastewater treatment plants will also be\n            financed in Guoyang, and Luan municipalities. The capacity\n            of the Anhui Environmental Monitoring Center will be\n            strengthened, by upgrading its equipment, and municipal\n            laboratories, providing vehicles for field sampling; and\n            improving technical, and managerial skills. Technical\n            assistance (TA) will be provided for institutional\n            development, for construction management, and will support\n            as well staff training; and, 2) support wastewater systems\n            investments in the Shandong Province to three\n            municipalities, and in Juxian, Rizhao. It includes\n            construction of secondary sewers, and house connections;\n            interceptors; pumping stations, pumping/transmission mains;\n            and wastewater treatment plants.
