satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            negligible; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: project design needs to be more realistic in terms\n            of the range of activities and how they are implemented.\n            Teams need to better appreciate the importance of getting\n            the results framework right at the outset. This means\n            ensuring that the objectives accurately reflect the project\n            activities and the real intent of the project-in this case,\n            laying the foundation through legal, regulatory, and\n            institutional reforms and capacity building. Despite its\n            complexity and ambitious time frame, FSP is a good example\n            of a high-risk, high-reward operation in a sector where\n            reforms are difficult and take time. Notwithstanding the\n            goal of mainstreaming, project management should be\n            structured to make sure that the incentives are in place for\n            implementing agency staff to give sufficient attention to\n            project implementation. Given the implicit capacity building\n            objective of this type of project, south-south learning\n            exchange is highly valuable."}, "docdt": "2013-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
