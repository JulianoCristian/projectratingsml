The closing date for the project will be\n            extended from July 31, 2011 until January 31, 2013. The\n            extension of FSP is critical because the project provides a\n            comprehensive coverage of the financial sector in Tanzania\n            and supports most of the activities recommended by the\n            Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update (September\n            2010) under the government's financial sector\n            framework. If no extension is made, a grace period of more\n            than 18 months will be needed for some of the ongoing\n            contracts whose expiry period extends up to 18 months\n            according to the World Bank requirements. The extension of\n            closing date is therefore critical to achieve the project\n            development objective (PDO) and ensure its sustainability.\n            This will be the first extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2011-07-21T00:00:00Z"}
