                         DfID grant, a USD 15 million IDA credit and a USD 2 million in-kind contribution from the Government of Tanzania (GoT). The Project was approved on June 15, 2006 and the
                         financing agreement was signed on August 30, 2006. The Project became effective on November 28, 2006. In June 2011 the Project closing date was extended by 18 months to
                         January 31st, 2013. The main reason for this extension was to allow the GoT to follow-up on the recommendations arising from the Financial Sector Assessment of Tanzania carried
                         out in late 2010. The pace of project implementation, which had been a major problem with the Project till then, picked up subsequently and at the request of the Government of

                         Tanzania the closing date for the Financial Sector Support Project (FSP) was extended in December 2012, by an additional five months from Jan 31st 2013 to June 30th 2013. The
                         rationale for the extension is to ensure smooth completion of some on-going contracts which are a follow-up on activities previously concluded under the same project. During this
                         phase contracts are being wound down within a timeframe such that all stakeholders have a chance to review the final products.

                         RELEVANCE: The FSP provides support to the Second Generation Financial Sector Reforms (SGFSR) being implemented by the GoT. The roadmap for SGFSR identifies ten key
                         priority areas, namely, Legal and Judicial Reform; Monetary Policy Reform; Banking Sector Reform; Financial Markets; Pensions; Insurance; Long Term Development Finance; Micro
                         and Rural Finance; Land; and Employment. Six out of the ten components are covered under the FSP. These include;

                         i.       Strengthening the Banking Sector;
                         ii.      Developing Financial Markets;
                         iii.     Reforming the Pension Sector;
                         iv.Strengthening the Insurance Industry;
                         v.       Facilitating the Provision of Long Term Development Finance; and
                         vi.Strengthening Micro and Rural Finance.

                         EFFICACY: The impact of the activities carried out under the FSP was constrained by the uneven pace of project implementation. It is worth noting that even in the early phase of
                         project implementation the client expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the quality of support being delivered via the Project. Nevertheless, a vast majority of the planned
                         activities under the project have been carried out in the last year and a half of the Project's life. There are many reasons for this delay in the project implementation. The main reason
                         is that several of the planned activities were contingent on a baseline of institutional reforms taking place in Tanzania. Delays in these institutional reforms deferred the activities that
                         were contingent on them. Some of the activities concluded earlier in the project are also now beginning to show onward impact. For instance, building on the support provided by FSP
                         to drafting the regulations and software and hardware purchases related to a credit reference databank, the Bank of Tanzania recently licensed 2 private bureaus and a third
                         application is under consideration.

                         In light of the sustained uptick in the pace of project implementation the rating for overall implementation progress (IP) for this project is moderately satisfactory. The rating for the
                         progress towards achievement of the PDO is also retained at moderately satisfactory. As the results framework indicates, progress on some of the PDO indicators has been
                         somewhat uneven. Specifically:

                         PDO Indicator 1, Credit to the private sector: From a baseline figure of 9.8 percent of GDP the figure has gone up to 19.2 percent. It is worth noting that in September last year this
                         indicator was actually a little above the closing target of 24 percent, having grown steadily during the life of the project from the baseline of 9.8 percent in June 2006 . Thus the slide in
                         the reported closing number could well reflect a temporary macroeconomic fluctuations, whereas the long-term trend reflects the gains from the reforms carried out during the project.

                         PDO Indicator 3, Adult population with access to formal/semi-formal finance: In the case of the access indicators it could also be that the data are stale and do not reflect the current
                         situation. The reported values rely on the data from the FinScope Surveys. The last such survey was carried out in 2009 and is not likely to take into account subsequent
                         developments especially o the mobile money front. Financial Sector Deepening Trust which carried out these surveys plans to put out an update later this calendar year. Other proxy
                         indicators (number of SACCO members, mobile money users) indicate that there have been gains in access to finance but for historical comparability purposes the FinScope data are
                         best.

                         PDO Indicator 4, Compliance with capital adequacy ratios. The trends in the reported ratios could be attributed, in some part, to improved monitoring by the regulator. This is
                         especially true for insurance companies where the regulator has enhanced the supervision of insurance companies as compared to when the baseline numbers were set.

                         It could also well be that give the delays in project implementation in the early life of the project some of the impact of t he efforts undertaken will only be felt with a lag. Thus, the MS
                         rating maybe an accurate reading of the indicators as they are now but could well be an understatement of the medium-term impact of the project. A post-closure impact assessment

                         PROJECT-END DISBURSEMENT RATE: Subsequent to the second extension of the closing date the client requested a a withdrawal of the almost USD 3 million which has since

                         been processed. The implementing agency has indicated that they are a committed to the full amount of the remaining IDA funds on existing contracts, and will be utilizing these
                         funds a 100 percent via withdrawal applications or direct payments by the disbursement deadline of October 30, 2013 (4 months after the project closing date). As of March 31st this
                         year actual expenditures under the various components of the totaled USD 18.8 million (this includes the in-kind Government contribution and equals 85 percent of the basket fund)
                         with additional commitments totaling USD 3.6 million, so that the expenditures (disbursed and committed) at closing are projected at USD 22.4 million. Since the total project basket
                         fund is comprised of USD 5 million DfID grant, a USD 15 million IDA credit, and a USD 2 million in-kind contribution from the Government, at this point there is a small projected
                         overrun of USD 400,000.

                         The extension of the project closing date and the sustained pace of project implementation has ensured that project beneficiaries have been able to avail of technical assistance on
                         several important fronts. The list of on-going activities currently include:
                         (a)Drafting a new law to govern deposit insurance operations in Tanzania
                         (b) IFRS training for Bank examiners, finance and internal audit staff.
                         (c)Studies relating to setting up a commodity exchange in Tanzania
                         (d)Developing a five-year strategic plan for the CMSA
                         (e) Public education and awareness program for the pensions regulator
                         (f)Purchase of risk-based supervision software for the insurance regulator


                         FINANCIAL MANGEMENT: The Financial Management rate remains satisfactory based on the fact that there are sound financial management arrangements which include adequate
                         and skilled staff handling the project. The Project audit report for the period ending June 2012 was un-qualified (clean) opinion and was submitted to the WB on time. IFRs are
                         submitted on time. In addition, there has been an increase of disbursement rate (from 78.355 to 95.46%).

                         PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT: The processing of procurement activities such as preparation and approval of Terms of Reference (TORs) for consultancy services and
                         specifications for goods/ equipment has continued to improve . The improvement is due closer to close follow up by the Project Coordination Committee (PCC), respective
                         components leaders, and BOT’s Procurement Management Unit (PMU) without waiting for formal meetings. The overall conclusion is that progress in procurement management
                         remained moderately satisfactory.
