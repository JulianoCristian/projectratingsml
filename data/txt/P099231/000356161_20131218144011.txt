1.    Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design
1.1    Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Context

1.      The Government of Tanzania adopted its national Strategy for Growth and Reduction of
Poverty (referred to as MKUKUTA) in June 2005. The strategy identified three clusters of broad
outcomes: (i) growth and reduction of income poverty; (ii) improvement of quality of life and
social well-being; and (iii) good governance. Accordingly, key activities sought to scale up
investments towards the modernization of small, medium and large-scale enterprises, improve
efficiency in service delivery, and ensure effective public administration so that government
systems would be managed in a transparent manner. Integral to the Government’s shared growth
strategy was the need to increase credit to the private sector and enhance the poor’s access to
general financial services.

2.      Initial reforms in the financial sector had begun in the late 1980s and focused on the
liberalization of the sector together with setting up the required legal and regulatory framework.
During the following decade, further reforms (supported by the World Bank) included initial
steps in the privatization of the largest state-owned commercial bank, the strengthening of
banking supervision, and development of the insurance industry and capital markets. The World
Bank financed two Financial Institutions Development Projects – FIDP I (FY96, US$10.9
million, closed June 30, 1999) and FIDP II (FY99, US$ 27.5 million, closed December 31, 2006)
– that helped create a sound foundation for a sustainable financial sector. Specifically, the main
focus of FIDP II was bank restructuring and privatization of the remaining state-owned banks,
strengthening the supporting financial infrastructure by inter alia enhancing the capacity of the
financial sector regulators, and increasing savings and investment opportunities by promoting
development of contractual savings and capital markets.

3.      A joint Bank/IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) conducted in 2003
noted the significant improvements in the sector and also identified areas for continued attention.
The FSAP revealed that large swaths of the economy were working with little formal credit and
that there was a noticeable lack of medium and long-term financing. Based on the FSAP
analysis, the Government prepared a comprehensive Action Plan for Second Generation
Financial Sector Reforms (SGFSR) involving ten components. The Government sought
assistance from the Bank for the Financial Sector Support Project (FSP) that would implement
reforms in six of the ten areas: banking sector, financial markets, pensions, insurance, long-term
finance, and micro finance and rural finance. Bank financing was to be co-mingled with a DFID
grant of US$5 million through a basket fund. Reflecting the spirit of the 2005 Paris Declaration
on Aid Effectiveness, the FSP would complement other multi-donor basket funds, including the
Business Environment Strengthening for Tanzania (BEST) program that would take the lead in
implementing reforms in the other four areas – legal and judicial reform, monetary policy
reform, land, and employment. It would also coordinate closely with other development partners
such as the IMF, IFC, and the FIRST Initiative.



                                                1
Rationale for Bank Assistance

4.      The rationale for Bank support for the FSP was based on the institution’s track record in
supporting the Government’s financial sector reform program over the preceding two decades. In
fact, the project was a follow-on from FIDP I and II. The Bank was considered to be the lead
donor in the financial sector at that time as reflected by the fact that the Bank was able to support
most of the SGFSR components while other development partners were only able to support
selected activities. In this respect the Bank played a major role in coordinating the efforts of the
various development partners, in line with harmonization goals of the Paris Declaration. And the
Bank’s financial support provided the Government credibility to leverage other partners’
resources.

5.     The FSP was consistent with the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy prevailing at the
time (approved in FY2000) which focused on facilitating higher growth, reducing poverty, and
undertaking institutional reforms to improve governance. [The subsequent multi-development
partner Joint Assistance Strategy for Tanzania was endorsed after FSP’s approval in 2007 and
had similar objectives.] In particular, two FSP-supported activities addressed the Government’s
concerns with access to long-term development finance by small and medium enterprises and
enhanced availability of rural and microfinance to small savers. Also, the project’s focus on
deepening the financial sector was considered an important measure to help mitigate any
potential negative impacts of large and increasing aid flows to Tanzania.

1.2       Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

6.     The Project Development Objective (PDO) for FSP was: “to promote increased
household and firm access to financial services, facilitate efficient financial intermediation, and
support financial stability and integrity.”

7.        The four key project outcome indicators were (see Data Sheet for details):
         Credit extended to the private sector as a percentage of GDP
         Interest rates spread (lending versus deposit rates)
         Proportion of adult population that uses financial services provided by formal and semi-
          formal financial service providers [words in italics were added in 2008]
         Proportion of financial institutions in compliance with capital adequacy ratios (banks and
          insurance companies, and pension funds) [words in italics were removed in 2008]

8.      The above PDO indicators were complemented by the following intermediate results
indicators related to specific components:
      * Indicates indicator was added in 2008 # Indicates indicator was dropped in 2008
Component 1: Strengthening the Banking Sector
   Proportion of non-performing loans *
   Number of Basel Core Principles with which the Bank of Tanzania is compliant
   Credit Information Index

                                                  2
         Proportion of financial institutions that are out of compliance with the regulations #

Component 2: Developing Financial Markets
   Annual turnover at the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange in relation to total market
     capitalization
   Percentage of market capitalization of government securities traded on the secondary
     market
   Total value of the stock of corporate bonds

Component 3: Reforming the Pension Sector
   Number of institutions that are actuarially sound
   Operational costs in relation to total contribution
   Number of members of pension funds *

Component 4: Strengthening the Insurance Industry
   Insurance penetration / annual premium income in relation to GDP (percent)
   Number of insurance policies (excluding motor-vehicles) *
   Percentage of firms in compliance with regulations #

Component 5: Facilitating the Provision of Long Term Development Finance
   Medium term loans (2-5 years) in relation to the lending portfolio (value) of commercial
     banks
   Long-term loans (5 years and above) in relation to the lending portfolio (value) of
     commercial banks *
   Volume of mortgage lending in relation to lending portfolio of financers

Component 6: Strengthening Micro and Rural Finance
   Number of savings accounts in financial institutions supervised by BOT
   Number of SACCOS members *
   Number of licensed MFCs and FICOs *
   Proportion of investment of formal micro and small enterprises financed through the
     formal financial sector #

1.3       Revised Key Indicators and Reasons/Justification

9.      The above 17 indicators were those that were presented and monitored in the
Implementation Support and Supervision Reports (ISRs). While quite consistent with the set of
indicators outlined in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), modifications in 2008 sought to
improve the results framework by providing more defined indicators for which data would be
easier to collect and monitor. This resulted in three intermediate indicators being dropped and six
being added. In addition, two of the PDO outcome indicators were adjusted, specifically: “semi-

                                                   3
formal” was added to PDO indicator #3 to capture the increase of access to financial services
provided by microfinance institutions (MFIs) and savings and credit cooperative societies
(SACCOs); and “pension funds” was removed from PDO indicator #4 since the capital-adequacy
ratio was more meaningful for banks and insurance companies.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries

10.     As a follow-on to FIDP II, FSP was intended to support the same beneficiaries – Bank of
Tanzania (BOT) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF). In addition, the project targeted the
following institutions: Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security and Cooperatives; Ministry of
Labor, Employment and Youth Development; Capital Markets and Securities Authority; Dar es
Salaam Stock Exchange; Tanzania Insurance Regulatory Authority; National Board of
Accountants and Auditors; Tanzania Investment Bank; Tanzania Postal Bank; Peoples Bank of
Zanzibar; Social Security Regulatory Authority; Deposit Insurance Board; and Tanzania
Association of Microfinance Institutions. During implementation, other beneficiaries were
targeted, including: Zanzibar Social Security Fund (ZSSF); Ministry of Finance and Economic
Affairs of Zanzibar; Prime Minister’s Office; and Tanzania Investment Centre.

1.5    Original Components (as approved)

11.    Closely aligned with the Government’s SGFSR program, the project concentrated on six
of the ten focus areas. The six components included a number of activities that were not
completed under the FIDP II including the privatization of People’s Bank of Zanzibar, setting up
a credit databank at BOT, and implementation of recommendations on the setting up of a
regulatory framework for pensions.

12.     Component 1: Strengthening the Banking Sector (US$7.7 million).This component aimed
to enhance the soundness and efficiency of the banking sector. Activities were to include:
strengthening the capacity of banking supervision; strengthening the capacity of selected banks;
review of banking regulations; improvement of risk management programs for small banks;
establishment of the framework for operation of credit reference bureaus; review of the deposit
insurance framework; development of reporting systems for anti-money laundering; and
strengthening the financial reporting framework.

13.    Component 2: Developing Financial Markets (US$2.6 million). This component focused
on creating vibrant primary and secondary markets, supported by appropriate and secure
settlements system and robust oversight. Activities were to involve: strengthening the regulatory
and supervision function of the Capital Markets and Securities Authority (CMSA); development
of the secondary market for money and government securities markets; development of the
framework for corporate and municipal bond markets; promotion of good corporate governance;
and improving public awareness of financial markets.

14.     Component 3: Reforming the Pension Sector (US$2.5 million). This component intended
to promote an efficient and competitive pension sector supported by appropriate legal and
regulatory structures. Activities were to include: strengthening the regulatory framework;
establishment and operationalization of a pensions regulator; improving the investment capacity

                                               4
of pension funds to manage investments and undertake actuarial analysis; outreach to the
informal sector; and strengthening capacity for formulating and implementing pension policies.

15.     Component 4: Strengthening the Insurance Industry (US$1.1 million). This component
sought to promote an efficient, sound, and competitive insurance industry with wider outreach
and market-based investment policies. Activities were to involve: strengthening the capacity of
the Insurance Supervisory Department in risk-based supervision and actuarial analysis; acquiring
insurance supervision software; development of the banc assurance framework; review of
investment policies; and review of the life assurance framework.

16.     Component 5: Facilitating the Provision of Long-Term Development Finance (US$3.4
million). This component was meant to support improvement in the availability and access to
long-term financing for enterprises, infrastructure, and housing. Activities were to encompass:
establishment of a policy framework for provision of long-term financing; setting up a
development finance guarantee scheme and long-term finance facility; development of an
infrastructure financing framework; establishment of a development finance institution;
strengthening the small and medium enterprise guarantee scheme; establishment of a framework
for leasing; development of a framework for mortgage financing; development of a framework
for infrastructure finance; and strengthening the capacity for formulating and implementing long-
term finance policies.

17.      Component 6: Strengthening Micro and Rural Finance (US$1.9 million). As a
complement to the then existing initiatives under the multi-donor Financial Sector Deepening
Trust and the Bank-financed Private Sector Competitiveness Project (PSCP; FY05; US$95
million) this component was to focus on promoting a viable and sustainable microfinance
industry with wide outreach operating under an enabling legal and regulatory framework.
Activities were to involve: strengthening the regulatory framework for MFIs and SACCOs;
enhancing the capacity of the supervisors; supporting transformation of MFI and SACCO
umbrella organizations; and the creation of networks and apex institutions for SACCOs. In
particular, FSP complemented the activities of the Financial Sector Deepening Trust which was
primarily responsible for working directly with commercial banks and nonbank financial
institutions to improve the scale and quality of their provision of micro-finance and SME finance
services particularly to low-income market segments.

1.6    Revised Components and Other Significant Changes

18.     Most of the components envisioned during the project design remained generally intact
throughout project implementation. However, some planned activities were not implemented due
to poor response to the call for expression of interest, change in Government stance, or
insufficient time. Similarly, additional activities were added when there was a strong need or
good rationale to exploit synergies and there was available financing. The specific activities are
noted in Annex 2.

19.    The project closing date was extended twice. The original Closing Date of the Agreement
was July 31, 2011. The project was first extended in June 2011 for 18 months. In January 2013
an additional five-month extension requested by the Government was granted, in order to

                                                5
provide additional time for smooth completion of several activities (e.g., drafting of the deposit
insurance law, establishment of the commodity exchange, development of the national policy on
insurance). The project thus closed June 30, 2013 about two years later than its planned
completion date.

20.     In terms of other significant changes, it is worth noting that a 2010 FSAP update
recommended the review of the legal and regulatory framework for mergers and acquisitions, the
legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework for Islamic banking, and the development of
supervisory framework for finance leasing. All three activities were aligned with SGFSR but
because support through FSP was not available, financing was sought from the FIRST Initiative.
Accordingly, three related technical assistance activities were developed and managed by the
BOT; the activities are set to be completed by June 2014. There has been close coordination
between all teams – Bank, FIRST and the relevant BOT units – to ensure synergy and avoid
duplication.

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1       Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

21.     FSP was designed in the context of a broader financial sector reform program, which also
included a wide range of reforms cutting across the entire financial sector and supported by
various Development Partners. As envisaged by the Paris Declaration, various partners identified
the specific action plan activities to support. The Bank’s support through FSP was the most
comprehensive, covering six of the ten themes. The Bank’s financing was complemented by
significant support from DFID, which committed US$5 million through the “FSP Basket Fund”.
This approach not only assured strong Government ownership, but it also enabled maximum
leverage for the Bank by fostering coordination of disparate interests and activities.

22.     The design of FSP effectively drew upon the lessons of the FIDP II predecessor project.
The basket funding structure was meant to provide more flexibility than the previous FIDP II, to
enable quick response to changing needs and priorities. A sector-specific basket fund approach
was preferred to a general budget support operation since it was more targeted and thus increased
funding predictability for related activities. It also had the advantage of fostering a single forum
for dialogue between the Government and Development Partners on financial sector reforms.
The FSP design also appreciated that successful financial sector reforms would be subject to the
proper functioning of other related sectors, such as the legal and judicial system, land and
foreclosure laws, and labor laws. The Bank / DFID support to FSP was, therefore, coordinated
with two other basket funded programs that supported these aspects of the Government’s
program.1

23.     Notwithstanding the fact that the project responded well to the Borrower’s program and
effectively leveraged other donor funding, the design was complicated. This complexity was due

1
      The other basket funds were the BEST and FSDT which received funding from DFID, CIDA, DANIDA, Netherlands, and
      SIDA as well as the World Bank through the ongoing Private Sector Competitiveness Project (FY 2005, for which an
      additional financing operation of US$60.2 is under preparation, for a project total of US$155.9 million).


                                                            6
to the fact that the project was comprehensive and covered six development areas, each with a
dedicated technical team. Not only did this make coordination challenging for the implementing
agency, but unsurprisingly the capacity of the teams was uneven. The design was further
complicated by the way in which several activities were sequenced. For instance, many capacity
building activities could not be implemented until the legal and policy framework was
established for a particular area. In this regard, the project was quite ambitious in terms of
initially planning for only a four-and-a-half year implementation period, which didn’t allow for
any delay. Nevertheless, it was a program that the Government fully owned and which the Bank
and Development Partners strongly supported due to the medium to long-term benefits
anticipated well beyond the life of the project. For these reasons, the project could have been
considered high-risk, high-reward (although the risk was not adequately appreciated in the PAD).

2.2       Implementation

24.    The implementation arrangements for FSP were similar to those of FIDP II. BOT was the
implementing agency and individual project activities were undertaken by responsible
beneficiary agencies. During the implementation of FIDP II, BOT’s capacity had been built up
which allowed for the full mainstreaming of project management within BOT. Project
governance involved government-wide teams as well as sector-specific Technical Teams that
were set up to support the SGFSR Action Plan:

         Inter-Institutional Committee (IIC): Appointed by the Minister of Finance committee
          membership included eighteen institutions at the Permanent Secretary level, and Chief
          Executive Officers of other stakeholder institutions. The IIC was responsible for the
          SGFSR Action Plan and was the main interface between the Government and the Basket
          Funding Development Partners. Chaired by the Governor of BOT, the IIC met on a
          regular basis to provide overall strategic direction and oversight of the program. This
          involved reviewing policy and legislative proposals under the FSP and submitting them
          to Government for consideration.

         Program Coordinating Committee (PCC): This committee was chaired by the IIC
          Secretary and was made up of six directors of the BOT and invited heads of responsible
          agencies and the Technical Teams; the committee met frequently depending upon
          program needs. The PCC was responsible for program coordination (including day-to-
          day communications with the Bank) and quality control, mainly reviewing the terms of
          reference for consulting services and the reports prepared by consultants. The PCC also
          reviewed policy and position papers prepared by the Technical Teams for onward
          transmission to the IIC. In addition, it had responsibility for preparing FSP’s annual work
          plan and budget in consultation with the Technical Teams and the Program
          Administration Team (PAT).

         Program Administration Team (PAT) and Project Management Unit (PMU): The PAT,
          which also implemented FIDP II, was composed of staff from the BOT Directorate of
          Banking Supervision and was headed by the Deputy Director for Banking Supervision in
          charge of Operations and Policy Review. It was responsible for the day-to-day
          implementation of FSP activities including financial management, disbursements, and

                                                   7
       related reports; support to the Technical Teams and various member agencies;
       procurement processes based on terms of references prepared by Technical Teams;
       preparation and updating of annual procurement plans; and preparation of regular
       implementation progress reports. The PAT was dissolved in 2011 and its duties were
       assumed by the newly formed Project Management Unit (PMU) at the Directorate of
       Strategic Planning and Performance Review.

      Technical Teams: Six Technical Teams were set up to align with each of the FSP
       components. These teams included representatives of the relevant beneficiaries and other
       stakeholders. The primary responsibility of the Technical Team was to prioritize
       technical needs and to review the terms of reference for an activity, prepared by the
       relevant beneficiary, and then to pass it to the PCC for approval.

25.     Coordination between the Government and the Development Partners was to be done
through FSP Joint Review Meetings held twice a year. These meetings reviewed progress,
endorsed the annual work plan and budget, and approved the release of program funds. To
streamline coordination, in 2009 these Joint Review Meetings were aligned with the Bank’s
twice annual supervision missions. DFID participated in the missions but as per the agreement,
the Bank took the lead on providing implementation support. Overall, coordination between
DFID and the Bank within the context of the Basket Fund arrangement was strong and no
difficulties emerged.

26.   Despite the extensive coordination mechanisms, organizational structure, and strong
government ownership, implementation got off to a very slow start and really didn’t pick up
momentum until 2011. Delay can be attributed to a combination of factors, discussed below.

27.     As noted above, because the project design was complicated, coordination proved to be
quite challenging. For instance, in several cases there was considerable back-and-forth between
the Technical Teams and the Program Coordinating Committee responsible for quality control.
Because several Technical Teams had limited relevant experience, their outputs often required
several iterations. Partly because of the uneven level of capacity, it was not surprising that some
components were implemented more quickly and smoothly than others.

28.     Although the Program Coordinating Committee took its role very seriously and proved to
be very effective in ensuring that the Government got the quality it wanted, there was significant
feedback that related processes took too long. To some extent, this perception can be attributed
to a lack of understanding of the processes. For instance, members of the Technical Teams may
not have been aware that when there is a poor response to a tender, it must be re-advertised. But
there is no doubt that because the procurement processes, even though they were largely similar,
generally required consecutive approvals within two large bureaucracies – the BOT and the
World Bank – timely progress was constrained. Even so, a few beneficiaries said that they had
been frustrated at several points about BOT’s lack of responsiveness on non-procurement related
matters.

29.   Slowness may also be attributed to the nature of some activities. This was the case for
many activities which were sequenced to follow the establishment of the relevant legal and

                                                8
policy regulatory framework. For instance, technical consultancies were initially engaged to
research and draft policy and legislation. These outputs would then go to an inter-ministerial
technical committee for review and eventually to Cabinet for consideration and then on to
Parliament for final approval. Only then could other related project activities begin to gear up,
such as technical assistance to the newly approved pension regulator, procurement of office
equipment and software, and preparation of public awareness campaigns. Thus any delays
encountered in this upfront work, negatively reverberated on other activities. Another example of
this is the FSP-supported microfinance strategy which was still under Cabinet review at the time
of project close. As a result, several activities for the micro and rural finance component had
been streamlined due to the delays in the adoption of the strategy. Similarly, the project closed
before the planned office, ICT equipment, and capacity building activities could be financed for
the restructured National Board of Accountants and Auditors and new member body (Institute of
Certified Public Accountants of Tanzania), for which the draft bill is still under review.

30.      Perhaps the most significant reason for slow implementation up until 2011 was that FSP
activities did not receive priority attention by the Program Administration Team within BOT.
Although project implementation was to be fully mainstreamed into BOT, which generally had
adequate capacity and internal systems, FSP-related work was considered by staff to be above
and beyond their regular responsibilities. Without the appropriate incentives and management
mandate, progress was limited. This was especially apparent regarding procurement, which
requires not only knowledgeable and full-time staff but also sustained attention.

31.     All these factors transpired to create an extremely low disbursement rate for the IDA
credit. In 2011 there was a reallocation of project funds to support the implementation of the
recommendations of the 2010 FSAP update, specifically an increase for Components 2
(Developing Financial Markets) and 6 (Strengthening of Micro and Rural Finance). But as of
2011 when the project was originally set to close, less than one-quarter of US$15 million had
been disbursed. To some extent, the Basket Fund arrangement which required the annual DFID
disbursement of £600,000 (over five years) contributed to this. However, as the Bank supervision
documents point out (ISR# 10), even taking this into account project progress was considered
“unacceptably poor”. Accordingly, the project was downgraded to moderately unsatisfactory at
the end of 2011. All the same, it was recognized that a number of beneficiaries were highly
satisfied with the quality of deliverables.

32.     To accelerate implementation, in April 2011 BOT created a new Project Management
Unit (PMU), which included a full-time BOT coordinator and three other dedicated staff
(including procurement and financial management consultants) to be funded by the project. In
tandem, the Project Coordinating Committee sought to mainstream and minimize internal
clearance processes and generally improve coordination with the Technical Teams. The impact
of these measures was apparent relatively quickly. By mid-2012 disbursement had significantly
improved.

33.   Concerns remained, however, about the rather uneven progress and attainment of the
PDO indicators. As noted by Bank supervision documents (November 2011 Aide Memoire)
implementation progress played out according to the relative strength and weaknesses of the
Tanzanian financial sector. The project was most efficient in delivering support to those

                                               9
subsectors that were generally better developed. In this regard, the Strengthening the Banking
Sector appears to be the component that most fully carried out its activities. On the other hand,
activities related to the insurance and micro/rural finance components took considerable time to
start up and outputs were more limited. (Annex 2 provides a complete list of FSP-financed
activities)

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

34.     As stated in the PAD the project sought “to promote increased household and firm access
to financial services, facilitate efficient financial intermediation, and support financial stability
and integrity.” Although the PDO was rather broad, the four PDO indicators were generally
aligned with the project objective.

35.     Neither the PDO nor the relevant outcome indicators, however, really accurately reflected
what the project components and activities were about. The PAD description of the components
emphasized: “strengthening capacity… strengthening the regulatory and supervision function…
supporting appropriate legal and regulatory structures… establishment of a policy framework…
strengthening the regulatory framework”, etc. Hence the project really sought to establish the
legal, regulatory, and institutional framework and build capacity in order to strengthen market
confidence and encourage new entrants and, in turn, improve access to affordable and
appropriate financial services. In hindsight it would have been better to select a PDO and
outcome indicators that better reflected this, specifically, including the explicit objective of
building capacity and strengthening institutions. This would have demonstrated a more direct
causal link to the project’s activities.

36.      The 17 intermediate indicators were more mixed. For those that were output-oriented
(e.g., establishment of Credit Information Index, number of Basel Core Principles with which the
BOT is compliant), it was easier to attribute the results to the project interventions. But for those
intermediate indicators that were subject to exogenous factors (e.g., proportion of non-
performing loans), it is hard to assess the actual impact of the project. It should be noted that at
the time the project was prepared, these types of M&E issues were not uncommon especially for
projects that focused on technical assistance and capacity building.

37.     Following the January-February 2008 supervision mission (ISR#4) the results framework
was updated and several of the indicators were revised, although some problems were not
addressed. (Minor revisions to only two of the four PDO outcome indicators were made at that
time.) For instance, the presentation of the revised results framework did not explicitly indicate
how the end-project targets were changed and there were also several instances in which the
indicator end-project target changed from one ISR to another, without an explanation in the
supervision documentation. Because of this poor reporting, it is difficult to determine which,
when, and why targets were changed. BOT has responded that adjustments to the targets were
documented in the minutes of the Program Coordinating Committee meetings but not in the
results framework matrix. In addition, BOT notes that the main reason for revision was that the
target had been achieved so there was no point to continue having a lower target than the actual.



                                                 10
38.     Some indicators were difficult to accurately evaluate because the tracking methodology
was incorrect, the data was wrong, or the data was not available. For instance, there was a
misconception about how to define “the Credit Information Index established”. The initial
definition was construed to mean number of licensed credit reference bureaus (hence the original
target of 5), when in fact the Doing Business indicator measures whether rules and practices etc.
are established (which was met). This indicator was eventually adjusted in the ISR monitoring
but other errors persisted. Specifically, the outcome indicator regarding interest rate spread was
difficult to evaluate since the baseline indicator changed, and the revised target was actually
higher than the actual prevailing at the time.

39.    Another data challenge concerned the monitoring of the PDO outcome indicator
“Proportion of adult population that uses financial services…” which relied on the FinScope
survey which was supposed to be conducted every two years, but which was actually only done
in 2006 and 2009 (the next one is expected to be available in early 2014). Notwithstanding the
timing of FinScope analysis which can make it difficult to evaluate progress and inform decision
making during project implementation, it is a robust source.

40.     The downgrading of the project in 2011 sent a strong signal to the Borrower that
implementation needed to substantially pick up, even though there was a high degree of
Borrower satisfaction. Notwithstanding this clear message, there could have been more realistic
reporting earlier in project implementation. For example, M&E was rated as satisfactory for the
first two years of the project, even though baseline values for many of the indicators were not
specified. Similarly, it is surprising why procurement was considered in the satisfactory range all
the way through the end of 2011, past the original closing date when disbursements were less
than one-quarter of the credit amount. Certainly the initial weak procurement capacity within
BOT contributed to slow disbursement. There was also at least once instance of incomplete
monitoring of the indicators; ISR #9 (March 2011) did not include the list of indicators (this may
have been caused by a systems glitch since there was a change in ISR formats at that time).
Similarly, there was no explanation in ISR #7 why financial management continued to be rated
unsatisfactory.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Issues

41.    The project was classified as a Category C and no safeguard policies were triggered.

Fiduciary Compliance

Procurement

42.     The procurement processes were mainstreamed into the BOT procurement system and
ensured compliance with the Public Procurement Act and World Bank guidelines. However, in
the initial years of the project implementation, BOT lacked specific and dedicated procurement
staff for the project, which resulted in slower implementation of project activities. (This risk was
flagged in the PAD which rated procurement risk as high but the ISRs did not highlight this as

                                                11
noted above.) The new PMU that came on board in 2011 with two dedicated procurement staff,
significantly helped to improve the processing of procurement activities such as preparation and
approval of Terms of Reference. Notwithstanding these institutional challenges, in several cases
procurement was delayed due to the difficulty in identifying consultants for certain highly-
specialized tasks, with the requisite technical abilities as well as an appreciation of the country
context.

Financial Management

43.     Reflecting the low risk rating assessed in the PAD, BOT was judged capable of
producing timely, understandable, relevant, and reliable financial information. The project’s
financial management arrangements were fully integrated into BOT accounting and financial
management systems. It remained adequately staffed with qualified accountants. All audit
reports under the operation had unqualified (clean) opinions.

44.    There was one blemish to financial management performance, however. During the
March-April 2009 mission it was found that the FSP holding account in BOT had been debited
with two transactions amounting to over US$18 million. It was determined that this was caused
by using two different software packages and the wrong exchange rates. But the fact that the
anomaly remained unresolved for nine months was disconcerting. The ISR rating for financial
management was downgraded to unsatisfactory in June 2009 (ISR#6) and it subsequently
improved once corrective actions were taken.

Disbursements

45.     Disbursements from the IDA credit followed the agreed pooled fund disbursement
modalities as stipulated in the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Government,
the Bank, and DFID (“Basket Funding Development Partners”). Specifically, the arrangements
called for a yearly disbursement from DFID of £600,000, up to its total commitment of US$5
million. IDA funds were disbursed to the FSP Basket Holding account established at BOT. The
amount of IDA disbursed was on the basis of the annual work plan and budget. However,
because of the low level of activities in the early years whose costs were already covered by the
required annual DFID disbursement, IDA withdrawal applications were limited. When DFID
funds were fully disbursed and the pace of activities significantly picked up, IDA disbursements
sharply increased beginning in 2011.

2.5    Post-completion Operation / Next Phase

46.     Several key objectives of the Government relating to increased household and firm access
to financial services, efficient financial intermediation, and financial stability and integrity have,
to varying degrees, been met (discussed in Section 3). Nevertheless, at the time the project closed
much work remained on the SGFSR action plan. To sustain and further deepen financial sector
reforms supported by FSP, additional financing of about US$60 million is under consideration
for the World Bank-financed FY06 Private Sector Competitiveness Project (PSCP). Of the
additional financing, US$10 million will support efforts to improve access to financial services,
including:

                                                 12
         Strengthening legal and regulatory structures to fill the gaps in the legal and regulatory
          framework that hinder the uptake of available financial products. Activities will target:
          improving consumer protection by establishing a coordination mechanism for financial
          protection among financial sector regulators; supporting deposit insurance through
          preparation of regulations and capacity support; boosting the microfinance sector by
          developing minimum financial reporting standards and other regulations for microfinance
          institutions; addressing weaknesses in collateral system; improving the legal and judicial
          infrastructure to encourage the use of mobile channel and other alternate channels to
          bring more users into the formal financial system.
         Supporting new products tailored to specific users so as to expand financial access.
          Initiatives will include: operationalization of finance leasing; development of Takaful
          (Islamic insurance); support M-Akiba bonds a savings bond that will be intermediated
          through the mobile channel but will also trade at the Dar es Salaam stock exchange.

47.     An explicit project development indicator of the additional financing is the number of
new financial products for which the legal/regulatory framework is developed. The BOT will be
responsible for the relevant component, building upon its experience of managing FSP. This
additional support to improve access to financial services will complement the Bank-financed
PSCP additional financing for land administration, business registration, and other relevant
reforms. All supported areas are cross-cutting/horizontal investment climate reforms that seek to
further improve legal certainty and lower the costs of doing business for all sectors of Tanzania’s
economy.

48.     Beyond the additional financing to PSCP, the Government intends to further reform
pension entitlements rules to help restore actuarial balance in the funds. The Social Security
Regulatory Authority (SSRA) is preparing new benefits guideline that harmonizes contribution
rates and benefit package. In collaboration with the Ministry of Labour and Employment, SSRA
is also developing a Social Security Reform Program that outlines the Social Security Schemes
reform process.

3.        Assessment of Outcomes
3.1       Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

          Rating: Significant

49.     FSP support for the Government’s financial sector reforms was quite relevant when the
project was designed and the approach continues to remain highly relevant to Tanzania’s
development priorities. This is reflected by the 2009 Investment Climate Assessment which
highlighted access to finance as a key constraint faced by the private sector. Similarly, the Joint
Bank/IMF 2010 FSAP noted that the banking system was small and relatively inefficient and
access to finance was very low and it emphasized the importance of capital market development
for increasing access to long-term funding.

50.     The current Country Assistance Strategy (FY2012 – 2015) emphasizes inclusive and
sustainable private sector-led growth and a key outcome indicator is financial intermediation.
                                                  13
The high relevance of the objectives is also reinforced by the strong demand by Government for
continued sector support, as demonstrated by its request for additional financing for PSCP. And
the Country Economic Memorandum currently under preparation also provides the analytical
underpinnings for continued financial sector reforms.

51.     The project’s six components and related activities were generally designed well,
reflected consultations with the beneficiaries, and addressed what needed to get done, closely
aligned with the Government’s own program. Specifically, the components focused on creating
the necessary legislative and regulatory foundation and strengthening the underlying capacity –
all fundamental to the goals of the Government’s financial sector reform program. But because
of the wide-ranging scope of the project – both in terms of the range of sectors as well as the
sequenced approach to activities – the project timetable was too ambitious.

52.     FSP design drew on lessons from FIDP II and other basket funding arrangements in
Africa. In this respect, the design was considered to be in full accordance with the Paris
Declaration. In particular, there was strong government ownership of the FSP project as reflected
by the Government fully preparing its own action plan and reform program. This ownership was
apparent during implementation when there was strong Borrower emphasis on ensuring high
quality outputs. Ownership and accountability was also fostered by the mainstreaming approach
to project management – a key feature of a coordinated donor approach. Furthermore, the basket
funding structure allowed for a flexible design to respond to evolving priorities. For example,
with only one disbursement category a reallocation among components was relatively quick. For
all these reasons, FSP is shown to be a good example for harmonization efforts arising from the
Paris Declaration.

53.     Although not anticipated when the project was prepared, FSP proved to be quite relevant
during the global financial crisis. Because of the strong dialogue established by virtue of the
project, the Bank was able to provide just-in-time advice to BOT on emerging financial sector
issues. In this respect, Component 1 – strengthening the banking sector – proved to be
particularly prescient in addressing potential problems related to the crisis.

54.    In summary, while the relevance of objectives can be considered high, because the design
did not accurately connect the PDO to the project activities and several of the indicator targets
were overly ambitious, the rating for relevance is only significant.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

       Rating: Significant

55.     In evaluating whether the intended outcome was achieved, several aspects are assessed.
In terms of the PDO indicators, 3 of the 4 indicators were achieved (see the Data Sheet). Of the
17 intermediate indicators, 8 were totally achieved; 3 can be considered partially achieved; and 6
were not achieved. Strictly considering the indicators, a case could be made that the project
achievement was significant based on the fact that 3 of the 4 PDO target indicators were met.
However, as discussed in Section 2.3 the PDO and associated indicators did not capture well the
technical assistance nature of the project. Moreover, the outcome of several of the intermediate

                                               14
indicators (many of which were the ones not achieved) was influenced by exogenous factors and
may not necessarily be attributed to project interventions.

56.      Despite deficiencies in the results framework, the project did significantly achieve what it
set out to do – specifically, FSP established the necessary conditions and underlying foundation
to increase household and firm access to financial services, facilitate efficient financial
intermediation, and support financial stability and integrity. As is readily acknowledged in
development economics, these outputs are necessary steps to achieve the PDO, but they are not
sufficient ones. It will take time to see the full impact of the foundation that FSP has laid for
achieving the PDO, which reflects a higher level objective. Some pieces of legislation still need
to be promulgated, the regulatory framework has yet to mature for some of the targeted sectors,
markets still have not fully responded to new opportunities, and some politically sensitive
reforms will have to be ramped up. Nonetheless, as examined in-depth below, FSP outcomes
reflect significant achievement towards the project development objectives.

57.    To promote increased household and firm access to financial services, project-
supported activities (especially Components 1 and 6) had many good results, including the
following highlights.

58.     Foremost was the increase in credit extended to the private sector as a percentage of GDP
(PDO Indicator #1) from less than 10 percent when the project started in 2006 to nearly 25
percent by 2013. Although there are some attribution issues with linking the project activities
directly with this result, there is justification for asserting that the financial sector reform
program supported by FSP and the FIDP I and II projects did contribute to this outcome. In
particular, the expansion of banking services stimulated by the privatization of several public
banks during the 1990s, kindled growth of credit to the private sector. This was complemented
by building strong supervisory capacity and filling in the gaps in the legal and regulatory
framework so as to increase confidence in the banking sector. Also, FSP’s support in 2008 for
review of the Prudential Regulations Banking Supervision, in line with the Basel Core Principles
and FSAP recommendations contributed to improved access to credit. Additionally it is likely
that once the new credit information indexes (Component 1) become fully operational,
commercial banks will be able to take better informed lending decisions and continue to expand
credit to the private sector. However, Tanzania still lags behind regional peers in terms of credit
to the private sector. For example, according to the World Bank Group’s 2014 Doing Business
Report, Tanzania ranks only 130 in the world on Getting Credit indicator (compared to Uganda
and Rwanda ranked 42 and 13, respectively).

59.     The other relevant measure to evaluate trends in access to financial services was PDO
indicator #3 – the adult population that uses financial services provided by formal and semi-
formal financial service providers. Although the FinScope 2013 survey results are not yet
evaluated, there is a strong likelihood that the target of 22 percent will be met.2
2
    FinScope obtains data through an actual survey which will be evaluated and completed in early 2014. BOT used proxy data
    (aligned with the FinScope methodology) to determine that approximately 6.3 million people hold accounts in relevant
    formal and semi-formal financial institutions. Based on Government and UN data, the adult population is estimated at about
    22.5 million. Hence 6.3/22.5 is 28 percent.



                                                             15
60.     In September 2011, BOT made a commitment to the Alliance of Financial Inclusion that
by 2015 at least 50 percent of the population will have access to formal financial services.
Increasing access to micro and rural finance will be an important contribution to achieving this
goal. To pave the way, FSP supported an improved legal and regulatory framework for
microfinance institutions (MFIs) and savings and credit associations (SACCOs), which had not
been adequately covered by financial regulation and supervision policies. In addition to creating
a modern regulatory framework, activities involved: providing guidelines to SACCOs to improve
their financial structure and operations; training inspectors to accurately analyze, diagnose, and
resolve problems using risk based approach; and conducting workshops and study tours for
relevant government agencies on financial literacy and financial inclusion. Similarly, the
umbrella organization for MFIs/SACCOs, TAMFI, was restructured and benefitted from several
capacity building activities. As a result, TAMFI’s membership has grown, training is offered to
members such as how to develop new products for rural financing, and there is now a platform
for dialogue with the regulator. FSP also funded a rural financial services strategy as well as a
microfinance policy for Zanzibar. The beneficiaries interviewed emphasized that these studies
really helped them to understand how to use micro and rural finance to tap the potential
economic impact of the poor.

61.    The second aspect of the project development objective sought to facilitate efficient
financial intermediation through developing financial markets (Component 2) and facilitating
provision of long-term development finance (Component 5).

62.     To lay the regulatory foundation for the modernization of the capital market, the project
financed a five-year strategy and business plan for the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange and also
for the Capital Markets and Securities Authority (CMSA). Project activities also aimed to
develop the secondary market for money and government securities through various group and
individual training programs for staff in BOT, the stock exchange, CMSA, and the Ministry of
Finance. CMSA further increased its regulatory capacity through training on risk-based approach
to securities regulations, how to conduct on-site inspections and handle distressed market
intermediaries, and study tours to learn how to develop municipal bond markets. Resident
advisors provided assistance to establish risk management guidelines and another consultancy
outlined the legal and regulatory framework for a new commodity exchange that will make the
market for commodities more transparent. And, to improve public awareness of financial
markets, FSP supported a media campaign conducted by CMSA. A survey to evaluate the
effectiveness of the media campaign indicated that most found the materials very useful in better
understanding capital markets and the advantages of investing in securities.

63.     Secure and efficient settlement systems – critical to efficient financial intermediation –
were supported by the procurement of computer hardware and software for CMSA (market
surveillance system, general operational support) and the stock exchange (central depository
system, disaster recovery). Selection of a dedicated central depository system for BOT involved
a careful assessment of options, including a study tour to India. A national switch system,
however, was not implemented by BOT since the main stakeholders (commercial banks) were
reticent since they had already invested in their own systems. Further capacity on mobile


                                               16
banking systems is also a remaining need since it will be critical to have common standards for
mobile systems.

64.    The project financed a study on developing municipal bond market. Yet development of
this market is probably premature since it will require building the capacity of municipal officials
to identify and structure products and prepare relevant documents, a huge challenge. As one
observer noted, “It’s like having a brand new car but no gas.” Hence, project funds for this study
could have probably been put to better use.

65.     Notwithstanding the extensive project support, the relevant intermediate indicators (#4,
#5, #6) were not achieved – annual turnover at the stock exchange; market capitalization of
government securities; value of the stock of corporate bonds. In hindsight, these indicators were
too ambitious given that the relevant markets were nascent and first required fundamental
building blocks. The Dar es Salaam stock market remains small in terms of capital invested. In
this regard, additional reforms are still required, including addressing the system of capital
controls which limits foreign investments in the stock market. In addition, to expect trading of
government securities to increase from 5 to 50 percent in just five years underestimated the
importance of having in place a well-established primary market. And this, itself, is affected by
several exogenous factors such as the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy which will
influence the available liquidity to purchase government bonds, interest rates, the taxation policy
on securities, and the overall financial infrastructure (the trading systems, the fee structure of the
brokers, etc.). The market for corporate bonds is similarly undeveloped and corporations may
prefer to raise funds in the bank market because of the lower costs and speed of accessing
funding.

66.     Other ways that FSP supported the improvement of financial intermediation led to more
opportunities for long-term development finance for enterprises, infrastructure, and housing
(Component 5). This involved establishing a policy framework including the publication of
regulations for development finance institutions (DFIs) which allows room for them to operate
but in a prudentially secure environment. These regulations will form the basis for establishing
the Tanzania Agriculture Bank that will address the gap for the agricultural sector where there is
tremendous demand. Because the borrowing needs are longer term, commercial banks generally
haven’t addressed agricultural infrastructure projects like irrigation.

67.     The new regulations also facilitated the transformation of the Tanzania Investment Bank
(TIB) into a development finance institution. FSP supported a consultancy to help restructure
TIB as well as the procurement of computer systems and training. TIB is now in the position to
offer long term (10-15 years) development financing. Initial focus will be on agro-processing
(value added to primary commodities) which can promote stability in farmers’ incomes. TIB will
also finance small infrastructure that can help small-medium sized enterprises. In addition, TIB
is considering financing for industrial parks and market centers in urban areas.

68.      Another key project intervention to support long-term development financing was the
establishment of the policy, legal, and institutional framework for private-public partnerships
(PPPs). Project support involved the creation of a PPP unit within the Ministry of Finance whose
role is to lead the financing aspect of PPPs. Complementing this unit is the Tanzania Investment

                                                 17
Center, also supported by FSP, which promotes PPPs (and FDI) and coordinates their approvals.
Capacity building activities helped relevant government officials develop a better understanding
of PPPs. Officials said that they now appreciate the importance of PPP issues such as risk
allocation, accountability, public goods, value for money, and duration. One senior government
official noted: “The training was eye-opening. It gave us the sense of what critical factors make a
good PPP arrangement. That’s what we are exploring in the current negotiations with the
Chinese [for the development of the Bagamoyo Port]”. Another official said that following the
training “improvement was seen immediately in terms of the quality of appraisal reports.” This
enhanced capacity will be very important as FDI inflows to Tanzania increase, especially for
large infrastructure and natural resource based projects.

69.     The project’s long-term development finance (Component 5) helped lay the basis for
increasing mortgage financing through amendments to the Mortgage Finance (Special
Provisions) Act in 2008 which has created significant momentum within Government for the
development of housing finance. Legal changes such as the passing of the Unit Title Act 2008 as
well as reforms to the titling process have significantly improved the prospects for mortgages.
This work laid the foundation for another Bank-supported project for Housing Finance (FY10;
US$40 million) whose development objective is to expand access to affordable housing finance
under market-based conditions for the purchase, construction, or improvement of housing. Also
thanks to FSP, options for financial leasing were expanded, through the development and
enactment of related legislation and regulations. A public awareness program to promote leasing
as a financing option was also carried out.

70.      There were important achievements and impact related to supporting financial stability
and integrity, the third aspect of the PDO. These outcomes were supported by activities for
Component 1 (strengthening the banking sector), Component 3 (reforming the pension sector),
Component 4 (strengthening the insurance industry), and Component 6 (strengthening micro and
rural finance).

71.     FSP activities built upon the numerous reforms implemented over the proceeding decades
to significantly improve the soundness of the banking sector. That said, however, the relevant
PDO indicator #4 was not achieved – proportion of financial institutions in compliance with
capital adequacy ratios (banks and insurance companies). BOT attributed this to the significant
increase in the number of banks and insurance companies during the project period.
Notwithstanding this growth, the fact that only 85 percent of banks and 44 percent of insurance
companies are in full compliance means that there are, in fact, weak institutions. But the trends
could also be attributed, in some part, to improved monitoring by the regulator.

72.     The intermediate indicator target for the proportion of non-performing loans was also not
reached. (But the underlying reason for this is more likely to macroeconomic factors rather than
attributable to project interventions.) Similarly, BOT is not fully compliant with all 25 Basel
Core Principles especially related to market and operational risks. And, one of three of the
pension-related intermediate indicators – operational costs in relation to total contribution – was
also missed.



                                                18
73.      Notwithstanding these results, the project can still be considered successful in building
the capacity and laying the framework to effectively manage financial sector risks, especially
critical during and post-global financial crisis. Based on ICR interviews and a review of IMF
reports, the BOT is considered one of the strongest supervisors in the region. And, as was
highlighted in the IMF’s May 2013 report, “Financial soundness indicators show that the
banking sector remains sound and stable”.

74.    FSP has played an important role in helping BOT strengthen its capacity. This ranged
from numerous training activities such on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for
bank examiners, to the development of a risk based supervision framework, to financing of new
examination software. The project also focused on strengthening the capacity of selected banks
as well as the envisaged privatization of the People’s Bank of Zanzibar. Although the Zanzibar
bank was able to achieve major improvements in performance without privatization, the project
nonetheless had an impact in that it evoked the stimulus for action.

75.    Both BOT officials and commercial bank representatives emphasized that as a result of
FSP-supported activities BOT’s supervisory capacity had greatly improved over the past several
years. As noted by one large commercial bank: “The quality of the interaction with BOT has
shown a really big improvement. Their onsite supervision now takes quite a different approach.
They’re able to assess more rigorously and they are more proactive. We also have an ongoing
dialogue with them. They reach out to us to get our insights on liquidity, for instance”.

76.     Another achievement was the creation of credit reference bureaus. FSP supported BOT
staff study tours to peer countries (Egypt, Ecuador, Brazil, and the Czech Republic) which
greatly informed the development of an appropriate framework for the new credit reference
bureaus. This was followed by the acquisition of hardware and software for a credit information
databank, which allowed BOT to license two private credit bureaus. The creation of credit
reference bureaus will provide for the exchange of information about the risks of potential
borrowers. Banks can then adjust costs accordingly which will ultimately lower intermediation
costs.

77.     In addition to BOT’s role, another critical element of financial reporting was the
strengthening of the National Board of Accountants and Auditors (NBAA). The project
supported a twinning arrangement between the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales and NBAA. This arrangement, along with other training and workshop activities,
significantly increased NBAA’s capacity to enforce accounting and auditing standards. In
addition, a new professional accountancy body was put forth and the development of university
curriculum was financed. NBAA also benefitted from new computer hardware and software.
And, new financial reporting legislation was prepared and is under review in Parliament.

78.     FSP supported the stability and expansion of mobile banking through the creation of the
Deposit Insurance Board (DIB). Analysis financed by the project recommended the operational
autonomy of DIB from BOT which retains its role as the regulator. This was followed up by the
drafting of a new law and policies that recognize mobile companies can maintain trust accounts
with banks. Although the legislation is still subject to parliamentary approval, it sends a clear
signal about the integrity of mobile banking. Specifically, it will give comfort to mobile users

                                               19
that their money is safe (up to a certain amount). As noted above, the additional financing for the
PSCP will support preparation of regulations and building capacity to make the DIB-related fund
operational.

79.     Another important aspect of financial stability and integrity was the establishment and
operationalization of the pensions regulator, the Social Security Regulatory Authority (SSRA).
Considering that the pension framework, one that had been in place for over 50 years, had never
been subject to regulatory oversight, the fact that the legislative, policy, and regulatory
framework was actually established during the project period is notable. Support was also given
to conduct an actuarial evaluation of the mainland pension funds3 and also the Zanzibar Social
Security Fund. In addition, the project sought to address concerns regarding the investment
portfolio of pension funds by conducting an investment portfolio review. As a result of these
studies, guidelines were issued for investments, actuarial valuation, data management,
membership, and governance structure of the board of trustees. A long-term advisor was also
financed to support SSRA and the project also sponsored capacity building for staff, as well as
equipment and furniture for the new regulator. In addition, a public awareness program to create
buy-in among various stakeholders for the pension reform agenda.

80.     The project also supported reforms to the Zanzibar pension scheme. While an actuarial
study revealed some serious sustainability issues and recommended an overhaul of the entire
system (from defined benefit to defined contributions) it was considered too drastic. But several
critical recommendations were adopted related to long-term investment strategies and risk
management. What was particularly innovative was a new pension scheme to reach the informal
sector in Zanzibar. According to the beneficiary, the project “opened our vision…we wouldn’t
have come up with new products for the informal sector otherwise; it gave us the push”.

81.     Although two of the three intermediate indicators related to the pension component were
achieved or partially achieved – number of members of pension funds and number of institutions
that are actuarially sound – there remain serious concerns over the sustainability of the pension
funds and the appetite for the reform of the sector. In particular, the Government continues to be
behind on making compensation payments to the Public Service Pension Fund (PSPF) for paying
pre-1999 pension benefits on its behalf, which risks creating an imminent cash flow crisis for the
fund. In addition, the sequencing of reforms also raises some concerns with the introduction of
choice of social security fund before harmonization of their benefits potentially causing the
deficit position of weaker funds to actually worsen over the long-term. It is acknowledged that
the nature of these reforms is difficult and highly sensitive politically and that it is complicated
by the fact that the impact will not really be seen until well in the future.

82.     In comparison, the two intermediate indicators for strengthening the insurance industry
(Component 4) were generally achieved (one partially and one exceeded the target). Most
noteworthy was the improved performance of the insurance regulator, Tanzania Insurance
Regulatory Authority (TIRA). As a result of FSP-supported activities such as intensive training
on risk-based supervision and new insurance software, TIRA significantly improved its capacity.

3
    The results of the actuarial evaluation of the five mainland pension funds (PSPF, LAPF, NSSF, GEPF, PPF) were released
    by the Government in April 2013 and revealed that PSPF was not actuarially sound. This was consistent with the
    independent actuarial report funded by FSP.
                                                            20
As one insurance broker noted “there was a big impact in terms o f how TIRA conducted their
inspections before and after the project… It is now one of the most effective regulators in East
Africa.” TIRA is also better equipped to advise boards of insurance companies, including how to
reach underserved rural areas where there is tremendous potential to provide useful insurance
products to individual consumers, which could help the poor. FSP also financed the development
of the banc assurance framework which will allow banks to sell insurance, addressing another
large market potential. This will still require the reconciliation of banking and insurance
regulations.

3.3    Efficiency

       Rating: Significant

83.    Because the project was essentially a technical assistance project it did not include an
economic analysis. Therefore, alternative considerations are used to substantiate the different
aspects of project efficiency.

84.     The project effectively leveraged Bank and DFID resources. The Basket Funding
arrangement allowed for more streamlined administration and flexibility for the Borrower. As
seen from Annex 1 the final costs at project closure were US$22.58 million, which means that
the IDA credit and DFID grant were fully utilized (the excess amount can be accounted for by
exchange rate fluctuations). Although there were implementation delays and IDA disbursement
seriously lagged, outputs were impressive – nearly 250 activities were eventually completed, as
outlined in Annex 2. The project proceeds tapped expertise from over 50 consultancies, trained
approximately 200 public servants and officials of stakeholder institutions, and purchased
equipment worth about US$3.3 million.

85.    The Bank of Tanzania was keen to ensure that the project got value-for-money for all
work. This was demonstrated by how seriously it took its quality control role for reviewing the
terms of reference and consultant outputs. Indeed, in a few instances poor performing contracts
were flagged as being deficient. For instance, the consultant advisor for pensions was not
resident in Tanzania as expected and BOT picked up on the poor performance relatively quickly.
Similarly, the initial consultant for the credit reference bureau did not perform as envisaged and
the contract was eventually cancelled. But several stakeholders did say that for FSP the outputs
were more customized than in previous cases and that consultants sought to understand the local
context. “In the past, the consultants came to impose their will, but this time because it was
designed by stakeholders we got pretty much what we wanted.”

86.     In 2011 there was a reallocation among components. Because of the flexibility built into
the design of the project – only one withdrawal category – this was a relatively easy process.
Annex 1 shows that Components 1 (banking sector) and 2 (developing financial markets)
accounted for significantly increased spending compared to appraisal estimates. In contrast,
allocations to Components 5 (long-term development finance), and 6 (micro and rural finance)
were less than originally estimated; reductions to these components reflected to some extent less
momentum as well as the fact that some activities were to be financed by other Development
Partners and the Government.

                                               21
87.     In several cases, there were significant variances between the budget as approved for an
activity/good and the final bid price. This was attributed to a few factors. Because of the initial
implementation delays the cost estimates at the time of appraisal likely had gone up, especially
related to ICT items. Although the BOT procurement team regularly revisited the budgets and
researched other purchases, given the technical issues related to software this expenditure type
was usually more expensive than anticipated. (It has been remarked by observers more broadly,
however, that the Bank needs to improve its estimates for ICT.) Also, given the technical nature
of much of the work, consultant costs tended to be higher. Even then, response to tenders often
did not solicit sufficient interest. And, since high-level financial expertise is more difficult to find
in the region, contracting consultants outside Africa added significantly to travel and related
expenses.

88.     The most noteworthy reallocation was increased financing to project management costs,
an increase of over 300 percent compared to appraisal estimates, with a final cost of US$1.78
million. Nonetheless, FSP’s total program management costs were generally lower compared to
similar projects because the project had been fully mainstreamed within BOT. The higher than
expected costs were due primarily to three consultants (two for procurement and one for
financial management) hired for the project when BOT’s project management was reorganized.

89.     For the Bank, lending (project preparation) costs were quite modest – a total of about
US$15,000. No doubt, this was due to the fact that FSP was a successor project to FIDP II
allowing for significant economies of scope. (It is also noteworthy that FSP laid the foundation
for the Bank-supported project for Housing Finance.) Nonetheless, it does reflect a high level of
overall efficiency given that several of the components were new. Similarly, the Bank continued
to sustain efficiencies during supervision. Total Bank administrative costs for project supervision
(not including ICR preparation) over the six-and-a-half year implementation period were about
US$693,800, or an annual average of about US$107,000, which was slightly lower than the
Africa regional annual average of US$113,000.

90.     While all of the above reflects a high level of efficiency, the rating for efficiency is rated
only as significant. This is because the rate of disbursements was extremely low during most of
the project implementation period; it only picked up during the final two years of the project
(which had been extended a cumulative two years). Slow disbursement delayed activities and
their potential impact and thus represented an opportunity cost.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.     The overall rating of the outcome of this project is moderately satisfactory. This rating
takes into account the significant relevance of the project at the time of design as well as at
completion, the significant achievement of project development objectives, and the significant
efficiency in use of resources.



                                                  22
3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspect, and Social Development

92.     FSP promoted a viable and sustainable microfinance industry with wide outreach
operating under an enabling legal and regulatory framework. This will have a positive impact on
poverty alleviation and social development. For the poor who have no access to types of
financial services delivered by regulated financial institutions, they must otherwise depend on
informal and often expensive and unreliable mechanisms for saving and protecting themselves
against risks. Greater financial inclusion can help improve household welfare and spur small
enterprise activity.

(b)     Institutional Change / Strengthening

93. FSP focused on institutional strengthening, raising awareness, and building capacity
specifically in BOT and the beneficiary agencies, discussed throughout this report. In terms of
institutional reforms, FSP was considered to have significant value added, reflected by such
beneficiary comments describing the project as “eye-opening”, “big impact”, and “improvement
was seen immediately". Many of the project activities were predicated on these institutional
reforms, so while it took a while, the impact on policy dialogue is already apparent. For instance,
the Governor of BOT is now emphasizing financial inclusion. According to observers, this was
not on the agenda five years ago when the focus was primarily on financial stability. The project
structure itself, also fostered learning across a sector. Although the skills mix within a Technical
Team varied and was often uneven among the team members, there were important benefits to
all participants thanks to the opportunity to interface.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
       Rating: Negligible

94.     The risk that development outcomes will not be maintained is negligible. This is
primarily because sustainability is grounded in the Government’s ownership of its financial
sector reform program. It is noted that since some of the work related to policy, legislative,
regulatory changes only came to fruition relatively late in the project, the required government
follow-on approvals, adoptions, etc., were still pending when the project closed (e.g.,
restructuring and privatization of Tanzania Postal Bank). However, there are generally robust
systems to ensure that they continue to be fully operationalized, including sufficient capacity in
the targeted institutions. Sustaining the momentum for some reforms, however, may be more
politically challenging than others, such as in the pensions sector. Other objectives supported by
the project, like a reduction in interest rate spreads and proportion of non-performing loans, will
continue to be affected by broader economic factors.




                                                23
5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality of Entry

       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

95.      FSP sought to create the enabling environment to allow for better performance of the
financial sector. The design was significantly relevant when the project was prepared and
remains so today. Although project interventions were appropriate given the objective to support
the Government’s financial sector reform program, the PDO and its indicators were not well
formulated (including a few that were overly ambitious or not easily attributable). But this was
not an uncommon problem with projects of similar vintage. In addition, the complicated
coordination of six different components, especially given the sequenced nature of many
activities, should have been better recognized when the project was prepared (related risks were
noted as a “modest” risks in the PAD). In any case, however, the risk generally paid off. Because
the project design clearly addressed financial sector priorities and effectively dovetailed the
Government’s program and counted on its strong ownership, the project outcomes were
significant. Indeed, to the extent that the design may have been too ambitious, it reflected the
high aims of the Borrower.

(b)    Quality of Bank Supervision

       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

96.     Over the nearly seven year implementation period, the project was supervised by three
different Task Team Leaders, all three of whom were based outside the country (the third was
based in a neighboring country). The turn-over of Task Team Leaders and their location outside
the country always makes supervision more challenging. This was aggravated when during the
transition from the second and third Task Team Leaders in 2011, there was a prohibition on field
missions due to Bank budget constraints. It is noteworthy that this was the same period when
project performance declined to moderately unsatisfactory, so a full-fledged field mission rather
than video conferences would have been desirable. Nevertheless, almost all stakeholders
expressed satisfaction and appreciation for the Bank team’s support throughout implementation.
A few interviewed, however, noted that the interaction with the Bank’s supervision team was
primarily through meetings with the larger Technical Teams. They said that they would have
liked to have had more opportunities for one-on-one interactions with the team. While
supervision was generally satisfactory, the significant delay in developing baselines for the
results framework, several instances of poor reporting, and not sufficiently addressing the very
slow disbursement rate over the first half of the project, justifies a moderately satisfactory rating
for supervision.




                                                 24
(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

97.     Based on a moderately satisfactory rating for quality at entry and a moderately
satisfactory rating for supervision, the overall rating for Bank performance is moderately
satisfactory.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

       Rating: Satisfactory

98.     Government performance is rated satisfactory primarily thanks to the strong ownership of
the project and commitment to its objectives that was demonstrated by BOT leadership.
Although performance varied among other beneficiary agencies, it is evident that there was also
strong interest and high level support by every stakeholder institution. It is especially noteworthy
that the Inter-Institutional Committee met every six months and was always chaired by the
Governor. When lack of progress became a serious issue in 2011, the committee responded by
establishing a new Project Management Unit. Also, the fact that the same committee was also
responsible for the Government’s SGFSR Action Plan meant that there was full alignment
between the project objectives and activities, and the Government’s broader financial sector
reform program.

99.     There were project ownership challenges related to involving Zanzibar, however. While
project interaction could have probably been better, to some extent coordination issues reflect
more fundamental political and governing arrangements.

(b)    Implementing Agencies (BOT and Beneficiary Agencies)

       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

100. FSP was a challenging project to coordinate given its six components, as well as the
basket fund financing arrangements between the World Bank and DFID. Fortunately, BOT had
the experience and capacity to do so, which allowed implementation to be fully mainstreamed
within BOT. But overall performance of BOT is rather nuanced. The project was initiated at a
time when there was a strong desire to have complete mainstreaming. But this proved somewhat
problematic given the weak incentive structure for staff working on the project. As a result,
project activities were never given priority. The pendulum swung back a bit when a dedicated
project management unit within BOT was created in 2011 and proved to be more effective at
handling the rather heavy bureaucratic project structure. This wasn’t necessarily a step
backwards, but rather an evolution of what it means to be mainstreamed.




                                                25
(c)       Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

          Rating: Satisfactory

101. Based on a satisfactory rating for the performance of the Government and a moderately
satisfactory rating for the performance of the implementing agencies, the overall rating for
Borrower performance is satisfactory.

6.        Lessons Learned
102.      Key lessons for the Bank and Borrower include the following:
         Project design needs to be more realistic in terms of the range of activities and how they
          are implemented. Although BOT was generally up to the task, coordination of six
          components was nonetheless complex especially when the capacity level varied
          significantly across the six related Technical Teams. Similarly, streamlining the heavy
          bureaucratic structure to which the project was subject needs to be considered.
         Teams need to better appreciate the importance of getting the results framework right at
          the outset. This means ensuring that the objectives accurately reflect the project activities
          and the real intent of the project – in this case, laying the foundation through legal,
          regulatory, and institutional reforms and capacity building. Even so, the project was
          overly ambitious in terms of what it sought to accomplish within the relatively short
          initial four-and-a-half year implementation period. In addition to improving the results
          framework, teams also need to pay sufficient attention to standard implementation
          indicators such as progress on procurement and disbursement, which can signal
          bottlenecks that need to be addressed.
         Despite its complexity and ambitious time frame, FSP is a good example of a high-risk,
          high-reward operation in a sector where reforms are difficult and take time. In this regard,
          the Borrower’s strong ownership will continue to be the essential ingredient to ensure
          that benefits are sustained over the long term.
         Notwithstanding the goal of mainstreaming, project management should be structured to
          make sure that the incentives are in place for implementing agency staff to give sufficient
          attention to project implementation. A dedicated PMU reporting to BOT management
          along with specialized procurement and financial management staff, appears to be an
          optimal arrangement.
         Given the implicit capacity building objective of this type of project, south-south learning
          exchange is highly valuable. Indeed, most of the study tours were to peer developing
          countries who had experimented with similar reforms. This proved to be highly relevant
          in addressing the specific challenges facing Tanzania.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower
(a)    Comments Received from BOT

103. In general we are satisfied with the ICR as it reflects what has been in official documents
such as the Project Appraisal Document, Financing Agreement, Aide Memoires and the input we
provided during the ICR Mission. Some comments are noted below:

104. PDO Indicators and Intermediate Outcome Indicators: Some indicators were changed
and in the ICR it is stipulated “revised … but no explanation given”. Actually the reasons were
documented in the minutes of the coordinating committees meetings but not in the Results
Framework Matrix. The main reason for revision is when a target is achieved; there is no point to
continue having a lower target than the actual. [ICR NOTE: This explanation was subsequently
added to Section 2.3] Other reasons: in 2008, a major overhaul of the PDO and key indicators
was done due to a huge discrepancy of the actual data on the one hand and the baseline and the
targets on the other. The methodology of arriving at the baseline data and targets and their
respective assumptions and sources of data were not clear. The reason for lack clarity is the
change of personnel who were involved in the monitoring and evaluation of the project either
due to absence in office or resignations. Accordingly, new rules or assumptions or sources of
data had to be drawn up for reliability and consistency. For example, proportion of financial
institutions in compliance with capital adequacy ratios (banks and insurance companies, and
pension funds) [words in italics were removed in 2008]. For this case, under all circumstances no
sources of capital adequacy ratios for pension funds could be found as the law/regulation which
prescribes capital adequacy ratios for pension funds is not in place to date and it is not known
whether such law exists somewhere else in the world.

105. Intermediate outcome indicator #2: Number of Basel Core Principles with which the
BOT is compliant (Component 1) – the actual value achieved is based on FSAP updates of 2009.
No independent assessment has been done since then. However, an internal assessment by BOT
indicates target was fully achieved.

106. The ICR provides a clear read out of the program and an assessment of its performance, it
is very informative. We support the assessment and recommendations. In particular, a dedicated
PMU would have been helpful to ensure implementation is a success and to help share
information with partners in country.

                            UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
                       FINANCIAL SECTOR SUPPORT PROJECT (FSP)
                 INPUT TO IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT (ICR)
                                 PREPARED BY BOT
                                  NOVEMBER 2013

As per agreement between the Government and Development Partners the Financial Sector
Support Project (FSP) was a five year project. Project closing date was estimated to be 31st
July 2011. However, during the Mid-Term Review of the Project which was carried out in
November/December 2009 it was agreed to extend duration of the project for 18 months.
Consequently, the new closure date of the project was 31st January 2013. The project closure
date was further extended for five months to 30th June 2013 with no additional funding. The
rationale for the five months extension was to ensure smooth completion of some on-going
contracts which were a follow-up on activities previously concluded under the FSP.

Implementation arrangements

The project was implemented over a period of seven years, from its effectiveness in
November 2006 (within five months following World Bank Board approval) until closing on
30th June 2013 (following a 24 months extension). The project was supervised by three
different Task Team Leaders over the implementation period.

The BOT was the implementing agent for the Government in respect of the FSP. In this
regard, the BOT had the overall responsibility for day-to-day implementation and
management of FSP funds in terms of: procurement of goods and consulting services;
project monitoring, reporting and evaluation; contractual relationships with IDA and other
co-financiers; and financial management and record keeping, accounts and disbursements.

The implementation arrangements under FSP reflected the multi-institutional involvement
and interaction. The FSP was coordinated and managed by three teams responsible for
strategic direction, planning, monitoring, quality control, procurement and financial
management: Inter-Institutional Committee; Project Coordinating Committee; and Project
Administration Team.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization
                                            49
The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the FSP was to promote increased household
and firm access to quality financial services, facilitate efficient financial intermediation, and
support financial stability and integrity. Key PDO indicators at the outcome level were: Credit
extended to the private sector as a percentage of GDP; Interest rates spread (lending versus
deposit rates); Proportion of adult population that uses financial services provided by formal
and semi-formal financial service providers; Proportion of financial institutions in compliance
with capital adequacy ratios (banks and insurance companies)

Credit extended to the private sector as a percentage of GDP was 9.8 percent at the
inception of the project. This indicator improved consistently towards the target which was
set at 24.0 percent. It finally reached 24.651 percent as at 30th June 2013.

Interest rates spread (lending versus deposit rates) was another indicator identified at the
inception of the project, which stood at 7.1 percent. The spread was expected to remain 7.1
percent by the time of FSP closure. However, the spread declined to 2.722 percent as at 30th
June 2013 due to probably increase in number of banks and financial institutions hence
increased competition among banks and financial institutions.

At the project inception, proportion of adult population that uses financial services provided
by formal and semi-formal financial service providers was 11.00 percent according to the
Finscope Survey, 2006. The proportion increased to 16.70 percent as per Finscope Survey,
2009 versus the target of 22.00 percent.

At the project inception, proportion of financial institutions in compliance with capital
adequacy ratios for banks and insurance companies was 56.25 percent and 85 percent;
which, as at 30th June 2013 stood at 85 percent and 44 percent respectively. The target was
100 percent for both banks and insurance companies. The reasons for the insurance sector
to be behind the target were due to the fact that in 2006 (baseline) there were fewer
companies compared to 2013 and most of them were complying with capital requirements.
In addition, in 2009 the Insurance Act and its regulations were amended and the capital
requirements of insurance companies were tightened. As for the banks and financial
institutions, could be explained by the rapid increase of new banks and financial institutions
in the market.

The above PDO indicators were complemented by the following intermediate results
indicators related to specific components:

Component 1: Strengthening the Banking Sector
Generally, the results indicators were on the right direction towards the targets. The Bank of
Tanzania was in compliance with all 25 Basel I Core Principles. However, the proportion of
non-performing loans deteriorated from 5.89 percent to 7.57 percent3, while Credit
Information Index remained at zero as per the baseline scenario vis-à-vis a set target of 4;
the reason being, a misconception of the definition used at the inception. While the
definition was construed to mean the number of licensed credit reference bureaus, the
meaning as per Doing Business, World Bank,IFC is a measure of rules and practices affecting
the coverage, scope and accessibility of credit information available through either a public
credit registry or a private credit bureau. Therefore, while two private bureaus were
licenced, they are yet to start distribution of credit data.

Component 2: Developing Financial Markets
This was the most active component under the project in terms of activities accomplished.
However, indicators under this component do not show significant progress as expected
due to a number of reasons, namely;
     few listings than planned since some of the parastatals/ companies/corporation that
       were planned to be divested through capital markets were done through other
       means; as a result, “Annual turnover at the DSE in relation to total market
       capitalization” which was expected to reach a target of 7.50 percent by the end of
       the project from a baseline of 2.49 percent at the inception but the indicator ended
       at 1.90 percent4;
     Inactive trading of government debt instruments since most of investors of debt
       instruments hold them to maturity as they pay high yields; consequently, the
       “Percentage of market capitalization of government securities traded on the
       secondary market” which was expected to reach a target of 50 percent by the end of
       FSP against a baseline of 5.53 percent, ended at 14.0 percent5.

Regarding the “Total value of the stock of corporate bonds”, with a baseline value of TZS
72.1bn, and a target of TZS 100bn, reached TZS 76.67bn as at 30th June 2013, showing a
reasonable performance against the target.

Component 3: Reforming the Pension Sector
Pension sector indicators recorded significant progress. The number of institutions that are
actuarially sound rose to 5 from a baseline of zero. According to Actuarial valuation report
(2011), Operational costs in relation to total contribution stood at 11.90 percent versus the

254,0006 to 1,674,9327 as at June 2013.

Component 4: Strengthening the Insurance Industry
Performance towards targets for the Insurance component was satisfactory. Insurance
penetration /annual premium income in relation to GDP started at the level of 0.78 percent
with the target of reaching 1.50 percent and ended up with 0.918 percent as at end of
December 2012. Number of insurance policies (excluding motor-vehicles) also increased
from the baseline of 141,000 to 249,6009 as at 30th June 2013 surpassing the target of
227,500.

Component 5: Facilitating the Provision of Long Term Development Finance
The project performed well in facilitating the provision of Long Term Development Finance
within the financial sector. Medium term loans (2-5 years) in relation to the lending portfolio
of commercial banks with a baseline value of 16.3 percent at the inception had increased to
27.810 percent as at 30th June 2013 surpassing the target of 24.17 percent. Long-term loans (5
years and above) in relation to the lending portfolio of commercial banks increased from
5.19 percent recorded at the inception to 8.0111 percent as at 30th June 2013, surpassing a
revised target of 3.71 percent. Volume of mortgage12 lending in relation to lending portfolio
of financiers reached a 9.3913 percent exceeding the set target of 8.5 percent.

Component 6: Strengthening Micro and Rural Finance
There was an impressive progress recorded in the Micro and Rural Finance component
based on the identified indicators. Numbers of savings accounts in financial institutions
supervised by BOT were 1.59m at the inception of the project. The number grew to 3.43m14
as at 30th June 2013 slightly below a set target of 3.52m. The number of SACCOS members
grew from 570,743 at the start of the project to 1,153,24815 members at the end of the

     It seems there was big discrepancy between the actual data and the targets. The reason may be the wrong source of
     data for the baseline or reluctance of the Pension Funds to disclose their information because there was no a regulator
     for the sector in 2006. Later the SSRA was formed under the FSP funding and therefore credible information could be
     accessed.

MFCs and FICOs stood at 216 reaching the target.

Financial Management

The project performed well with regards to financial management, It was fully integrated
into the BOT existing accounting and financial management systems and arrangements
capable of producing timely, understandable, relevant and reliable financial information that
would allow the project Management and the World Bank to monitor compliance with
agreed procedures and appraise progress towards its objectives. It remained adequately
staffed with highly qualified accountants who were able to manage and report on project
management affairs. All audit reports under the operation had unqualified (clean) opinions.
Overall, the project had a satisfactory financial management performance.

Procurement Function

Generally, the procurement function was successfully undertaken during the project
implementation period. The procurement processes were streamlined into the BOT
procurement system and ensured compliance with Public Procurement Act and World Bank
regulations. However, in the initial years of the project implementation, the Bank of
Tanzania lacked specific and dedicated procurement staff for the project, which resulted in
slower implementation of project activities. In order to speed up procurement processes,
two procurement specialists were recruited in 2011. The Bank of Tanzania was keen to
ensure that the project gets value-for-money for all work undertaken and sometimes had to
cancel poor performing contracts.

Procurement processes experienced some             challenges including inadequate capacity in
developing the terms of reference by some          of the beneficiary institutions. Also, in some
instances, there were significant variances        between the budget as per the approved
procurement plan and actual quotations,            necessitating cancelation of activities and
reallocations.

Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Following the completion of the FSP, BOT set aside funds for continuation of incomplete
activities and negotiations with the IDA-financed Private Sector Competitiveness Project
(PSCP) to finance some outstanding activities are underway.

Lessons Learned
Positive Lessons Learned
   i. Involvement of key stakeholders during project appraisal and negotiations assisted
        greatly in identifying reform areas which led to effective implementation of the
        project;
  ii. Congruency of the project objectives and BOT interest alongside placement of the
        project management function at the BOT led to smooth implementation;
 iii. Existence of the dedicated Project Management team with qualified staff assisted in
        assessing deficiencies by the beneficiary institutions in developing TORs and
        Technical Specifications and addressing them in a timely manner, therefore speeded-
        up the project implementation pace and improved quality of output of activities;
 iv. During project implementation, flexibility in assessing the changing financial
        landscape, legal and regulatory environment and ability to review plans and
        obtaining timely World Bank approvals led to achievement of project objectives;
  v. Having a focal point for coordination of Development Partners is of paramount
        importance. The World Bank agreed to take a leading role in the administration of the
        project thus reducing the burden of reporting by the implementing agency to
        multiple Development Partners;
 vi. Formation of multi-skilled Technical Teams for each project component enhanced
        ownership and sharing of technical skills which resulted into quality output of
        consultancy services.
Negative Lessons Learned
  i. Bureaucratic design of the implementation arrangement: While the bureaucratic
       implementation arrangement had some positive attributes, it also had a downside of
       causing delays in approval of budgets and annual work plans, cash flows forecast and
       consultancy work;
 ii. The correlation between the project activities and the results framework for some
       indicators was weak in the sense that some indicators were not driven by the
       respective identified project activities. It is therefore very critical to have well-
       thought indicators right from the beginning and flexibility of reviewing the same
       during the implementation phase. Also, the methodologies and sources of
       information for the baseline data should be clear, well-documented and statistically
       robust for consistency and institutional memory in case of change of project
       management staff;

Project rating criteria during the support implementation mission focused more on
disbursement rather than activities accomplished. There is a need to have a balanced view of
the project’s success based on both disbursement rates as well as accomplished activities.
