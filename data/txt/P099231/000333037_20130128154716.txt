A. SUMMARY

1. The closing date for Tanzania, Financial Sector Support Project (FSP), (Credit No. 4191-
   TA), P099231] will be extended for a period of five months from January 31, 2013 until June
   30, 2013. Building on the uptick in the rate of project implementation the extension will make
   possible the completion of several activities that will bring the project closer to achieving its
   development objective.

2. Targets for the PDO indicator Interest Rate Spread will be revised to better align them with
   the baseline data.


B. PROJECT STATUS

3. The FSP Financing Agreement was signed on 30th August 2006 and the Project became
   effective on 28th November 2006.1 The Project’s initial closing date was 31st July 2011. The
   duration of the project was extended for 18 months in the first project restructuring on June 7,
   2011. Consequently, the current project planned closure date is 31st January 2013.

4. After a relatively slow start the FSP has shown a remarkable uptick in the pace of project
   implementation over the last year or so. As of November 2011 the project had disbursed less
   than one-third of IDA funds. As of Oct 2012 the disbursement rate of the IDA funds had
   climbed to 76 percent. As per the latest Implementation Support Report the ratings for both
   the progress towards PDO and implementation progress are Moderately Satisfactory. All
   audit reports for the project have been submitted on time and there are currently no
   outstanding audit reports.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

        Results/indicators {Please see Annex 1 }

5. The targets for the indicator interest rate spread will be revised to better align them to the
    baseline data. Interest rate spreads, the difference between the lending and the deposit rates,
    measure the efficiency of financial intermediation. The lower the spread the more efficient
    the financial intermediation in that market.



    1
       The FSP is supported by DFID, the Government of Tanzania and the International Development Association
    (IDA) through a basket funding arrangement. The Project Development Objectives are to promote increased
    household and firm access to financial services, facilitate efficient financial intermediation, and support financial
    stability and integrity.


                                                           4
6. In the absence of baseline date at the time of project design the current results
   framework puts the target for interest rate spreads higher than the actual baseline
   figure. The revision of the targets will take into account the information on the
   baseline data.


         Closing date

7. In a letter dated October 9, 2012 the Government of Tanzania (GoT) requested an extension
   of the closing date of the FSP by 5 months to ensure that all ongoing activities and contracts
   are completed in a timely manner. The new closing date for the FSP will be June 30, 2013.
   There are a number of activities in the pipeline that will close the sequence on several
   interconnected activities under the project and bring the project closer to achieving its
   development objectives.

8. The implementing agency has prepared a complete procurement plan covering the period
   between January 31, 2013 and June 30, 2013. Under this plan by the time of the proposed
   new closing date the project will have fully disbursed all IDA funds. (see Table 1).
