Assistance Project\n            supports the related structural adjustment loan and credit\n            which is being submitted separately. It aims at promoting\n            institutional capacity to support export-oriented\n            manufacturing industries and assisting the Government in\n            monitoring the execution of the public sector investment\n            program and in controlling expenditures. It includes\n            financing of about 100 man-months of consultant and expert\n            services to: (i) establish an Export Development Fund (EDF);\n            (ii) carry out export market studies; (iii) provide advisory\n            services in industrial development and export promotion; and\n            (iv) strengthen the monitoring of the execution of the\n            public sector investment program and improve expenditure\n            control systems. On-the-job training of local staff in these\n            activities would be provided. Risks involved in project\n            execution would arise from shortage of counterpart staff and\n            delays in decision-making on the selection and appointment\n            of consultants and experts. Nevertheless, since the\n            Government is committed to carry out the structural\n            adjustment program as early as possible, the risks may turn\n            out to be minor."}, "docdt": "1981-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
