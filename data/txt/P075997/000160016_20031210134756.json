framework for South Africa's Cape Action\n            Plan for the Environment Project, which is a large-scale,\n            multi-faceted GEF funded conservation program aiming to\n            conserve, restore, and enhance biodiversity in the Cape\n            Floral Kingdom and the adjacent marine environment, and\n            deliver significant economic benefits to the region. The\n            report identifies potential impacts from project activities\n            consolidating key protected areas, such as socio-economic\n            impacts due to restricted/loss of access to resources\n            (affecting communities impacted by the mega reserve process;\n            loss of agricultural land or productivity; impacts\n            associated with the upgrading or construction of\n            infrastructure (linked to tourism development or the\n            development of small and medium enterprises); and management\n            plans for the estuaries that involve developing\n            infrastructure in the (unlikely) event that rivers are\n            diverted or weirs constructed. Only project activities\n            related to developing infrastructure for an extensive\n            concessioning program for eco-tourism facilities and\n            services in protected areas will also  trigger the\n            environmental assessment process (EIAs). Infrastructure\n            would include roads, sewage treatment works, al structures\n            below the high water mark (HWM), dams, reservoirs, schemes\n            for bulk water supply, and waste disposal would require\n            EIAs. Activities such as land reclamation below the HWM,\n            changes in land use, and any anticipated damage to natural\n            habitats and cultural property will also require EIAs."}, "docdt": "2003-12-04T00:00:00Z"}
