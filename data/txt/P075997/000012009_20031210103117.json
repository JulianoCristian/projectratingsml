Program, in accordance\n            with the Bank operational directives, and the country's\n            environmental laws and regulation, aimed at ensuring the\n            living standards of those affected by the implementation of\n            the project are improved, or at least restored. Eligibility\n            shall apply to landowners, corporate institutions, farm\n            occupiers, land users, users of marine resources, and,\n            individuals or companies providing support to commercial\n            forestry. Involuntary resettlement shall be avoided as\n            possible, though viable alternatives shall be explored to\n            ensure sustainability to those affected. The environmental\n            nature of the project entails a project design that provides\n            potential opportunities for building capacities, and benefit\n            communities as a result of its environmental protection\n            components, and eco-tourism possibilities, as well as\n            markets for environmental services. Nevertheless, tenure\n            security, loss of income, and restriction of land use, and\n            access, including physical relocation will occur. To this\n            end, the Executing Agencies have embarked on an extensive\n            concessioning program for eco-tourism facilities, and\n            services in protected areas, and, one of the key sources of\n            benefits for local populations is the opportunity that\n            arises from these concessions. The content of concession\n            agreements will include provision for them to address\n            resettlement impacts, and access government programs for\n            housing and land subsidies. Capacity building and training\n            will be provided as a safeguard across a wide range of\n            institutions. Monitoring and evaluation should ensure\n            compliance with the principles of this framework, and\n            grievance mechanisms will be in place should conflict occur."}, "docdt": "2003-12-04T00:00:00Z"}
