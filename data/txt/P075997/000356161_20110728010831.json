satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: biodiversity conservation and\n            sustainable development project. The project demonstrated\n            the catalytic effect that strategic use of incremental\n            Global Environment Facility (GEF) resources can have in\n            bringing about substantial change. The project was designed\n            and implemented with the donor and governmental financing\n            situation in mind, so that it could focus on incremental\n            benefits that otherwise will not likely be attained. Project\n            implementation involved considerable use of adaptive\n            management to adjust to changing conditions, unforeseen\n            constraints, and new opportunities. Achieving success in\n            biodiversity conservation-and many other aspects of\n            sustainable development-typically requires sustained\n            commitment over a relatively long time frame."}, "docdt": "2011-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
