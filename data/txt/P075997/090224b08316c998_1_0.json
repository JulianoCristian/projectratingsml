The Cape Floristic Region (CFR) is\n            the smallest and richest of the world\u2019s floral kingdoms and\n            entirely contained within South Africa, with more than 9,600\n            species of plants. The CFR biodiversity hotspot provides a\n            multitude of essential ecological services and livelihood\n            opportunities. The project enabled the more effective use of\n            economic incentives to induce changes in land user behavior\n            in favor of conservation stewardship. The project\n            successfully refined conservation planning, promoting\n            biodiversity considerations in spatial planning and water\n            resource management, thus mainstreaming biodiversity into\n            economic development and poverty alleviation strategies,\n            while at the same time leveraging the alignment of normal\n            government budgets. Notably, it resulted in successfully\n            expanding the area of terrestrial habitats under\n            conservation management, between the mountain and lowland\n            habitats to the sea. The project also resulted in an\n            increase of endangered and critically endangered ecosystems,\n            under conservation, from an initial 16,115 hectares to\n            61,603 hectares, through stewardship agreements with private\n            landowners and communities."}, "docdt": "2012-04-13T08:22:05Z"}
