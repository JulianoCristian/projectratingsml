assist the\n            Government's program to intensify agricultural\n            production, thereby raising rural incomes and foodgrain\n            production, and to improve the quality of rural life. It\n            would also support the decentralized decision-making and\n            self-help features of the Saemaeul (New Community) Movement.\n            The project includes: the irrigation of about 9,200 ha,\n            consisting of about 60 subprojects; the construction of\n            water supply systems in about 7,400 villages; the\n            construction or improvement of about 2,500 km of river\n            banks, consisting of about 8,300 subprojects; the connection\n            of about 2,700 villages to the telephone network and the\n            installation of about 75,000 subscriber's lines at the\n            subdistrict town level; and training and project monitoring\n            and evaluation. The project would benefit about 7.7 million\n            people or about 48% of Korea's rural population. Of\n            these, about 500,000 (the beneficiaries of the irrigation\n            component together with those to be served by the private\n            telephone lines) would benefit to a larger degree than the\n            remaining 7.2 million beneficiaries. The project faces no\n            special risks."}, "docdt": "1978-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
