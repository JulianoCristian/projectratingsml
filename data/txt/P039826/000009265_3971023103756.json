Some lessons\n            learned included: the Bank strategy of taking a firm but\n            reasoned stand on all of the loan conditions played a key\n            role in bringing the program to a satisfactory conclusion.\n            In particular, this consistency of position was crucial to\n            bringing the program back on track at various points. More\n            detailed attention needs to be focused on achieving and\n            maintaining sustainable consensus for the reform program.\n            From the beginning, support for the program was mixed and\n            fragile because inadequate attention was given by Government\n            to disseminating public information on the need for economic\n            reform and on the objectives of the program. To ensure\n            effective implementation of the reforms and their\n            sustainability, solid and long term political commitment is\n            needed. To this end, support for the reform program should\n            be built by involving all elements of society including the\n            bureaucracy, the polity and stakeholders in civil society."}, "docdt": "1997-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
