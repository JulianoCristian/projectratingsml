    to strengthen the capacity of the government to attract more\n            investment in the mining sector and to help develop a\n            vibrant industry consisting of small-, medium- and\n            large-scale mines financed with both foreign and local\n            capital.  The project comprises two main components.  The\n            policy and strategy component consists of several studies,\n            audits, and advisory services to help design and implement a\n            new policy and strategy for the mining sector.  The studies\n            will cover the legislative, economic, fiscal, institutional,\n            artisanal, and environmental aspects of the mining sector.\n            Implementation of the strategy will involve restructuring\n            the institutional framework of the sector, revising relevant\n            legislation and procedures, and closing and/or selling\n            public enterprises and their holdings in the sector to\n            private investors.  The investment promotion component will\n            consist of financing consulting services, equipment, and\n            some works to:  (a) organize the documentation center's\n            information and rehabilitate its facilities; (b) synthesize\n            existing geological data and improve the geological\n            information system; (c) fill the gaps in the geochemical\n            data coverage of prospective mining areas of the country;\n            and (d) promote specific mineralized areas to potential investors."}, "docdt": "1992-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
