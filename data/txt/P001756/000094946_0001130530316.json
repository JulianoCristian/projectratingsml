Capacity Building Project was rated as satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned include: 1) Project Preparation Facility\n            should be used in project preparation to build ownership of\n            the project and to establish the project coordination unit\n            (PCU). 2) All hard conditionalities should be accomplished\n            during project preparation and before project approval\n            and/or effectiveness for faster project implementation. 3)\n            Senior level commitment to the objectives of the project and\n            inter-ministerial coordination are crucial for success. 4)\n            Effective integration of the PCU into the line Ministry is\n            important for smooth project implementation. 5) The Bank\n            should build into the procurement procedures mechanisms to\n            facilitate greater use of the local consulting firms\n            services and individual national consultants during project\n            preparation and implementation. 6) Reforms in the mining\n            sector will not be effective without the Government's\n            commitment to transparent governance. 7) To deal with issues\n            beyond the mining sector, selection of a strong and dynamic\n            country project team leadership is essential. 8) Staff\n            working in the mining sector should be kept informed in a\n            timely manner on the market dynamics, best practices, bench\n            marks and other related matters."}, "docdt": "1999-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
