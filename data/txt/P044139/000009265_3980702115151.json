The success of this\n            operation provides a good example of close collaboration\n            with the borrower during the design and implementation\n            phases. The program design was made comprehensive enough for\n            the government to adopt it as its own medium-term\n            development agenda which could also be used in addressing\n            the concerns of a number of other key development partners\n            of Jordan. Since the reform program had been implicitly\n            endorsed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the\n            European Community and other major donors, its justification\n            and rationalization were no longer the issues to be resolved."}, "docdt": "1998-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
