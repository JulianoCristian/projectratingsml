Summary
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
ECONOMIC REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT LOAN
(LOAN 4115-JOR)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second Economic Reform
and Development Loan (ERDL-II) to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, for which Loan 4115-
JOR in the amount of US$120 million was approved on December 11, 1996, and became effective
on December 16, 1996.
This single tranche loan was disbursed on December 19, 1996. The loan was closed on
December 31,1997 in accordance with the original schedule. Parallel financing was provided by
the Government of the Netherlands.
The ICR was prepared by Christian Petersen, Social and Economic Development Group
of the Middle East and North Afiica Region (MNSED), and reviewed by Jayanta Roy, Lead
Economist (MNCMS) and Tufan Kolan, Projects Advisor (MNCMS). The Borrower provided
comments that are included as an appendix to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision/completion mission
in April 1998. The report is based on materials in the loan file, interviews in the field and
contributions by the borrower.
Mr. Adil Kanaan was the managing Division Chief for ERDL-II. Mr. Christian Petersen
had the Task Manager responsibilities from inception to closing of this operation.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
SECOND ECONOMIC REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT LOAN
(LOAN 4115-JOR)
Evaluation Summary
i.          Background. The Government of Jordan has pursued a comprehensive economic
reform program since 1989. The program was briefly interrupted during 1990-91 due to the Gulf
Crisis. Although, a serious economic blow was dealt to Jordan's economy due to a large influx
of gulf war returnees; a massive shortfall in exports and virtual elimination of concessional aid
from the Gulf countries, the Government of Jordan remained steadfastly committed to restoring
its economy through market oriented economic reforms. As a result, real GDP rebounded in
1992 with a growth of 16 percent. GDP growth settled down to about 7 percent during 1993-95,
while inflation was contained at below 4 percent. The trend has continued during the last couple
of year although the present increase in regional uncertainty is in part responsible for growth to
fall to 5 percent.
ii.         The Government's medium term macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform
program was supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) through two successive
Extended Fund Facilities (EFF) in 1994 and 1996. Based on a successful review of the EFF
program, the Fund replaced the previous EFF ahead of time with a new one in an amount
equivalent SDR 200.8 million in February 1996. This again was augmented in February 1997
with an additional SDR 37.24 million.
iii.        As a follow-up to the sector adjustment loans, Industry and Trade Policy
Adjustment Loan (ITPAL), 1990; Energy Sector Adjustment Loan (ESAL), 1993; and,
Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL), 1994, the Bank initiated a new strategy of
assistance to strengthen Jordan's foreign exchange reserves and to expedite the implementation of
wide ranging structural reforms. Under this strategy, approved in the Country Assistance
Strategy paper (CAS) on October 4, 1995, the Bank agreed with the Jordanian authorities to
extend three single-tranche adjustment operations to support the government's program during
1995-1998. An understanding was reached between the Bank and the Government on a broad
framework of reforms that the government would implement during this period.
iv.         The first Economic Reform and Development Loan (ERDL-I) was approved in the
amount of US$80 million in October 1995. An Implementation Completion Report for ERDL-I
was prepared and submitted to the Board on February 21, 1997. That ICR rated project outcome
as satisfactory, institutional development impact as substantial, sustainability as likely and Bank
performance as satisfactory. OED agreed with those ratings. Evaluated here is ERDL-II, the



iii
second loan in this series in an amount equivalent to US$120 million, approved on December 11,
1996, and fully disbursed within a week. A proposed ERDL-III is now under preparation.
v.           Loan Objectives.  The principal objectives of ERDL-11, in line witlh the
Government's Five-Year Development Plan, were to support trade liberalization through trade
facilitation and gradual reduction in tariffs; enhance the investment climate through financial
sector reform, regulatory reform, as well as removal of investment barriers; and increase private
sector contribution to the economy through further privatization of public enterprises, thereby
implementing a strategy for reduction of the cost of logistics and infrastructure services.
vi.          The Government vision is that these reforms will further improve the business and
investment environment, increase the level and efficiency of investments, and lead to a higher level
of exports and tourism earnings. Thus, these improvements would reflect positively in enhanced
foreign exchange reserves and increased direct foreign and domestic investment moving Jordan
closer to the goal of economic sustainability.
vii.         Within the framework of this program, the Government for 1997 expected to
maintain a steady growth of GDP at about 6 percent supported through increased private sector
competition in an investment friendly legal framework, and exports. The Government also hoped
to reduce the current account deficit to below 4 percent of GDP and to build-up  addiitional
international reserves of about US$400 million to US$1.1 billion (or equivalent to about three
months of imports) by end 1997.
viii.       Implementation Experience and Results. All significant targets agreed to under
ERDL-II program were achieved well in time by the Jordanian authorities.  The overall
implementation of this operation can be considered as superior. Since the loan was designedl as a
single tranche operation with prior actions taken before Board approval, all substantive conditions
were satisfactorily achieved prior to Board presentation and loan approval. The only exception
noted for delay in implementation was the implementation of the pre-shipment certification
procedure. Although the Government announced that this system were to become effective by
the end of January 1997, the selection of certification company was delayed until end of 1997 due
to procedural delays needed for evaluation of various proposals. In addition, the Government
became a bit worried about the record of PSI in some countries which received adverse press
coverage. There is a possibility that the Government in light of this may reconsider its earlier
decision. However, the Government of Jordan deserves special commendation for adoptinlg the
new import tariff structure on March 4, 1997.
ix.          Despite increased regional uncertainties the macroeconomic objectives for 1997
were broadly met and in several cases exceeded the government's targets. GDP growth in 1997
is estimated at 5 percent.' The Government was able to reduce the rate of inflation to 3 percent,
below the target level of 4 percent per annum for 1997. Another strong indicator of astute
economic management is that the demand for the JD has strengthened as shown by a decline in
dollarization from 19.8 percent in December 1996 to 18.3 percent by September 1997. On the
'This estimate from the April 1, 1998, IMF Staff Report is likely to be revised down.



iv
fiscal side, the budget deficit (excluding grants) for 1997 is estimated to be 3.6 percent of GDP
relative to 4.6 percent of GDP in 1996, an improvement of 1 percent.
x.           The new investment friendly legislation paired with reduction in import tariffs
achieved under ERDL-I and ERDL-II have already resulted in a positive impact, both in the rate
of growth of real investment, and the level of direct foreign investment in Jordan. During 1997,
net private sector capital flows, including portfolio investment, almost have grown more than
fivefold to US$328 million compared to US$59 million in 1996.
xi.          One of the most notable achievements was the increase in the level of foreign
exchange reserves from a low of US$700 million at the end of 1996 to US$1.7 billion at the end
of 1997 or more than five months of imports, against a target of US$1.1 billion envisioned at the
onset of the program. Similarly, the balance of payments deficit excluding official transfers was
reduced from 8.7 percent of GDP in 1996 to 4.2 percent in 1997. A year ago projections of
balance of payment financing gaps were on the order of US$300-400 million p.a. for the next two
years. The efforts of the authorities are already paying off. The medium-term program financing
needs are by now expected to be fully covered two years ahead of time.
xii.         The outcome of this operation has been highly satisfactory in all respects. The
reforms have been continued in unison with the government's own development plan, the IMF's
EFF, and the program agreed with the European Union (EU). The reform agenda would be
deepened and accelerated further in conjunction with the proposed Third Economic Reform and
Development Loan (ERDL-III).
xiii.        Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned.
Government's economic reform strategy remains consistent in its direction and objectives. The
continued implementation of the reform program since 1990-91 has instilled enough confidence in
the business community to contribute steadily to the country's economic growth. In 1997
macroeconomic stabilization has to large extent been achieved. The biggest contributions to
growth came from manufacturing, transport, communication, and other services, while traditional
sectors such as mining, agriculture, and government services contributed less. Given a reasonably
comfortable reserve situation, the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) was able to lower the CD interest
rates by 300 basis points to reflect the market situation, and at the same time institute full capital
mobility. The increased level of foreign exchange reserves has also contributed significantly to
diminishing the risk that the reform momentum could be threatened due to sudden shifts in JD-
denominated savings caused by regional uncertainties beyond Jordan's control.  Jordan's
economy, nevertheless, still remains highly sensitive to the regional events such as the recent
threat of military intervention in Iraq.
xiv.         ERDL-II would be followed by a proposed ERDL-III, the third adjustment
operation as envisioned in Jordan's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). ERDL-III is expected to
be presented to the Board in the summer of 1998 and will address issues related to further
economic integration of Jordan's economy with global markets through trade facilitation, export
development, financial sector and legal reforms, and concrete actions taken on the government's
privatization program.



v
xv.         The success of this portion of the reform program can be attributed mainly to four
key factors: (a) cohesive and coordinated approach taken by the Government, the IMF, the Bank
and the key donor community; (b) total ownership of the program by the borrower; (c) flexibility
in identification of program conditionality; and (d) a successful track record of the first EBDL.
Because of the singularity of objectives, the Government of Jordan was able to address the
concerns of all key donors through a single program of objectives.  The close working
relationship between Bank staff and the government officials also allowed the program
implementation to move in an expeditious manner through technical assistance and advice as and
when needed.
xvi.        The reform program had been developed together and with full cooperation orf the
government.  There was no hesitation on the part of the government to maintain its
implementation in a sustainable manner. The experience gained during the implementation of
ERDL also helped the Bank and the Government to anticipate problems and resolve them in a
timely manner. Frequent and longer preparation missions also helped in keeping the lines of
communication open between the implementing team and the Bank staff.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
ECONOMIC REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT LOAN
(LOAN 4115-JOR)
Background
1.          In the aftermath of the economic dislocation caused by a bust in the oil prices in
the mid-eighties, the government of Jordan embarked upon a systematic reform and stabilization
program of the economy in 1989. This program has been pursued meticulously since then with
the exception of a brief interruption during 1990-91, necessitated by the events of the Gulf crisis.
Although, the Gulf crisis impacted very seriously on Jordan's economy through a massive
reduction in its exports to Iraq, previously, its major trading partner; a virtual elimination of
concessional assistance from its traditional Gulf donors; and a large influx of refugees, the
government continued its commitment to move ahead with the implementation of the stabilization
program. The pace of the program was attuned to make it socially and politically acceptable and
to ensure that a proper social safety net program was put in place to minimize the negative effects
of the reform on the poor and disadvantaged segments of the population.
2.          Based on the government's strong resolve to put its economic house in order, the
international community responded positively by providing financial and technical assistance to
support the reform program. Significant levels of assistance were provided by the governments of
Japan, Germany, France and the United States. The European Union also continued to provide
important economic and financial assistance in the infrastructure sectors. The International
Monetary Fund approved a three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of SDR 127 million
equivalent in May 1994. This EFF was replaced with a new facility of SDR 200.8 million
equivalent in February 1996, and subsequently augmented with an additional SDR 37.24 million
equivalent in February 1997. The adjustment efforts were also supported by successive debt
rescheduling through the Paris Club, a Debt and Debt Service Reduction (DDSR) operation with
the London Club, and by a debt buy back arrangement with the former Soviet Union. Official
bilateral debt reductions were granted by several creditor countries (U.S., U.K., Germany, France,
Italy, and Switzerland among others) in the order of US$1.2 billion equivalent.
3.          The World Bank initial support to the program came through an Industry and
Trade Policy Adjustment Loan (ITPAL) of US$148.5 million in 1990, an Energy Sector
Adjustment Loan (ESAL) of US$80 million in 1993, and an Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan
(ASAL) of US$80 million in 1994. The World Bank chaired three Consultative Group meetings
during the period 1993-1996 to mobilize additional international resources to support the
program and to close the financial gap.



2
4.          Continued efforts on the part of the government together with a concerted effort
by the international donor community paid off well in terms of building a sound foundation for
economic recovery in Jordan. Because the reforms were a part of an overall "building block"
process, their sustainability was virtually assured. Despite the continuing regional uncertainties,
Jordan has seen a sustained growth in its economic indicators over the last five years. GDP
growth averaged 6.7 percent over 1994-1996; inflation was maintained in the order of 4 percent;
the fiscal deficit fell to 4.6 percent of GDP in 1996; external Debt/GDP ratio also fell from an
alarmingly high level of 180 percent in 1991 to 99 percent in 1996. The unemployment rate
which had peaked at about 25 percent after the Gulf crisis in 1991 has come down considerably
but still remains seriously high.
5.          In order to further support the government's adjustment program, in consultation
with the government, the Bank initiated a series of three adjustment operations to be undertaken
through 1995-1998. These operations were designed to address specific objectives of supporting
Jordan's economic integration, developing and enhancing its exports, creating an enabling
business environment conducive to private sector development, assisting the government in
reforming the legislative environment for commerce and finance. The first such operation, the
Economic Reform and Development Loan (ERDL-I) was approved by the Board in an amount of
US$80 million in October 1995 with parallel financing of US$80 million from Japan and US$12
nillion from Italy. Preparation for ERDL-II, the second operation in the series followed soon
after the closing of ERDL-I. Objectives of ERDL-II were built upon the success of ERDL-1. A
proposed ERDL-III loan is currently being prepared.
Loan Objectives
6.          The government's reform program outlined under the ERDL-I operation was
expanded and deepened considerably under ERDL-II. In order to sustain and further consolidate
macroeconomic performance, this operation was designed to continue to assist the government in
removal of remaining trade and investment barriers paving the way for further economic growth
and enhancing the country's export earnings. The second key objective was to further broaden
the financial intermediation reforms to improve the business environment and increase private
sector contribution to economic growth. Furthermore, the loan was to assist the governmernt in
reinforcing its foreign exchange reserves to provide the economy with a cushion against external
shocks related to regional events. Under this operation, support was also provided in order to
expedite the implementation of the government's privatization program.
7.          Under ERDL-II the government would further streamline and expedite the
import procedures to approve a new Customs Law, and start to computerize and implement the
ASYCUDA system. The government would also implement the Green Channel concept for
imports of major exporters in order facilitate customs clearance to for major exporters. In
accordance with the government's strategy to boost exports, the average maximum tariff irate
would be reduced to 40 percent except tariffs on alcohol and tobacco. The government would
also eliminate tariff on most capital goods by January 1997 and announce a policy of no new
tariff exemptions to be granted or extended once the current agreements expired. In its efforts to



3
reform customs administration, the government would revise the existing bonus system for
customs officials so as to reduce the possibility of arbitrary decisions. To further facilitate import
procedures, the government would introduce the services of a pre-shipment certificate provider
for establishing classification and valuation of goods.
8.          According to the planned reforms in the taxation area, the government would
reach an agreement to equalize all sales taxes on imported and domestically produced goods, and
implement this decision according to the World Trade Organization (WTO) schedules.
9.          In the Banking Sector, the government would formulate and adopt measures to
strengthen banking supervision and regulation; eliminate prior approval by CBJ of foreign
currency lending to exporters; and make the Housing Bank subject to the same regulation as is the
case of all other banks.
10.         Financial Sector reforms to be supported by ERDL-II were expected to make a
profound and positive impact on making this sector more business friendly and less cumbersome
for new investments. In this respect, the government would strengthen legal and regulatory
capacity of supervisory agencies for the capital markets, insurance, pension funds, and banking
industries. The objective was to make Jordanian companies more attractive to foreign investors
to increase financial sector's efficiency, and broader intermediation.
11.         For the Amman Financial Market (AFM), the government would finalize and
approve a modern and comprehensive Securities Law and introduce necessary revisions to the
companies law to allow for modernization of procedures and reduce the cost of transactions.
12.         ERDL-II would also support the government's privatization program through
institutional strengthening and specific technical assistance to expedite a number of privatization
transactions that were in the pipeline. The government would register the Telecommunications
Corporation (TCC) as a public shareholding company; convert Jordan Electricity Agency (JEA)
into a public shareholding company; and approve the establishment of an autonomous regulatory
body for the electricity sector. The government would continue the process of privatization of
Jordan Cement Factories, the Ma'in Tourism and Spa Complex, and the Public Transport
Company.
Achievement of Loan Objectives
13.         In line with the agreed medium-term macroeconomic objectives, the program for
1997 aimed at (a) sustaining the real GDP growth at about 6.5 percent; (b) maintaining inflation
at 4 percent, despite the impact of subsidy reductions and increases in the sales tax; (c) further
reducing the external current account deficit to below 4 percent of GDP; and (d) achieving a
foreign exchange reserve level of about US$1.1 billion (equivalent to about 3 months of imports).
The overall fiscal deficit was also to be further reduced to 3.1 percent of GDP.



4
14.         The government was able to broadly meet all macroeconomic program objectives,
although GDP growth fell somewhat short. Nevertheless, despite the increased uncertainty in the
region, which hurt exports and investment, GDP growth in 1997 is estimated at 5 percent.2 The
average annual inflation rate registered at 3 percent well below the program target of 4 percent.
Fiscal adjustment continued in 1997. While expenditures as percentage of GDP remained on
target, revenues were affected by the slower than anticipated growth. The government took
several corrective measures, which resulted in an improvement in the budget deficit excluding
grants from 4.6 percent of GDP in 1996 to 3.6 percent in 1997. Including grants the budget was
in surplus.
15.         The Central Bank of Jordan, through prudent monetary policy, was highly
successful in increasing its foreign exchange reserves. In January 1996, foreign reserves stood at
a low of US$300 million which was of great concern to the government. The reserves increased
to US$700 million by end of 1996 as against the lIMF target of US$620 million. The situation
improved dramatically during 1997 when at the end of 1997 the reserves stood at about US$1.7
billion, US$750 million higher than expected under the IMF's EFF program. In September 1]997,
the CBJ instituted full capital mobility. The show of confidence in the Jordanian economy and the
authorities policies is illustrated further by the fall in the interest spreads from 400 to 100 basis
points.
16.         The macroeconomic situation can be characterized as stabilized by now, and the
balance of payments financing gaps, which were projected to linger until 1999 has been closed
two years earlier than previously anticipated.
17.         In the area of customs reform, a new Customs Law was enacted; import fees and
surcharges were consolidated into one basic tariff rate; and customs tariff was eliminated on a list
492 capital goods. The maximum tariff rate was further reduced to 40 percent with the exception
of alcohol and tobacco. The concept of a Green Channel for established exporters was
implemented and later extended.
18.         During the past two years, the government has undertaken a comprehensive
modernization program in the financial sector. A modern Securities Law was enacted in June
1997 which allows for the separation of the regulatory functions from the technical side of the
Amman Financial Market. Under the new Law, Jordan's Securities Commission has been
established which reports to the Council of Ministers and has well-defined powers. This enables
the Commission to institute internationally accepted standards and practices in order to increase
investors' confidence and protect their rights. It would also allow for free and transparent flow of
information between market institutions, participants, and investors.  In addition to the
Commission, the Law also mandates the establishment of three other bodies: (i) a private sector
stock exchange; (ii) a private depository to act as the clearing house; and (iii) an association to
represent the private sector participants in the securities industry.  At the same time, the
Companies Law was amended in order to enable further development of the securities market.
2 GDP estimates for 1996-97 are from the April 1, 1998, IMF Staff Report and are likely to be revised down.



5
All of these initiatives are expected to increase the effectiveness of the Amman Financial Market
in attracting and sustaining domestic and foreign investments in Jordanian businesses.
19.         In the Banking Sector, the CBJ is now preparing a new draft law which would
clarify and define the scope of the banking business; spell out licensing procedures; strengthen
prudential requirements; and strengthen CBJ's authority to intervene in problem banks. CBJ has
also removed all special privileges previously given to the Housing Bank and made it subject to
the same Central Bank regulation as is the case for all other banks. At the same time, banking
supervision is being strengthened.
20.         Improvements in the Investment Law were introduced to enhance foreign direct
investments in the AFM. As of July 1997, the government abolished limits on foreign equity
ownership of companies in the Amman Financial Market involved in transportation, insurance,
banking, telecommunications, and agriculture sectors which were previously restricted to no more
than 50 percent foreign ownership.
21.         As agreed, the government established the necessary institutional structure to
oversee and direct its privatization program. The Executive Privatization Unit (EPU) was
established under the Prime Minister's office to coordinate the preparation of divestiture
transactions; manage teams of technical experts and advisors; execute transactions; and to
disseminate information regarding the progress of the program.  Substantive progress was
achieved on the privatization of TCC, the Ma'in Spa Complex, and the Public Transport
Company. The privatization activities for Jordan Cement factories was delayed, however.
Amongst the primary reasons for this were lack of foreign investor interest and difficulties in
dealing with pricing issues of domestic production versus imports. These issues have now been
resolved and a financial advisor has been hired to sell 33 percent out of the government's 49
percent stake to a strategic investor.
22.         The privatization program has been broadened. The Cabinet has approved the
privatization strategy for Jordan Water Authority (JWA) based on a four-year performance based
management contract. The contract is targeted to be awarded by summer 1998. Progress has
also been achieved towards privatization of Royal Jordanian Airlines. The government has
decided to complete this process in three phases. The first phase which will include a financial
restructuring of the company is already underway. The overall privatization strategy was
approved by the Cabinet in July 1997.
23.         The collective impact of all reforms undertaken in association with ERDL-II has
undoubtedly been extremely positive. The government's commitment to maintaining a consistent
approach in implementing these changes has provided confidence and optimism in the market
place. The development of new legislation and regulatory procedures has been done with
complete and full participation of the legislative, business, and government leaders. All inputs
were given due importance throughout the development process of these reforms. Drafting of
new legislation through this participatory process, although took a little longer than expected, but
nevertheless produced an end result which was acceptable to all parties. The proposed ERDL-M
will build upon the achievements attained under ERDL-II. A number of important laws that were



6
drafted during 1997 are scheduled to be finalized and approved during 1998. ERDL-IH vvould
also enhance the effectiveness of these achievements through the provision of technical assistance
in the shape of training, advice with institutional development, and drafting of detailed rules and
regulations to support the new laws.
Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Loan
24.         The government's overall reform momentum was accelerated under ERDL-ll.
Since this operation was designed as a single-tranche loan, actions were taken prior to the Bloard
presentation. Some of the delays in drafting and finalization of legislation, cited earlier, were well
justified given that a completely participatory and interactive process was followed by the
government. The outcome was fully in-line with the expert advice and direction given to the
concerned parties within the government. In this process, the government also employed local
legal experts who provided opportunities for capacity building and training in the private sector.
25.         In total, the government has fully complied with the conditionalities specified and
the implementation record has been excellent. The close cooperation and unity of purpose
amongst the Government of Jordan, the Bank, the IMF, and the key donors were instrumental in
achieving a successful implementation of the objectives.
Sustainability
26.         The most important factor to be credited for the success of this operation has been
the clarity and predictability of the shared development strategy for Jordan. At the base of the
strategy was the proposal to pursue three successive adjustment operations which were closely
linked, yet, clearly delineated in their objectives and milestones. The medium-term program
covered in this strategy was made transparent and fully understood by the borrower. It helped
both parties to focus attention on the fundamental nature of the changes that were required to
reach the government's goals of self-sustenance through enhanced exports, foreign investments,
private sector growth, and public sector efficiency.
*  Trade Liberalization.  Reforms achieved by tariff reduction and rationalization,
modernization of import and export procedures, and the new customs law will all enhance
Jordan's export potential. These reforms are likely to substantially reduce cost of business
transactions, both for the public as well as for the private sector. These changes are
further consolidated by the Association Agreement signed with the EU in November,
1997.
*  Legislative reforms. These reforms have been designed in full cooperation with the
business community and have been field tested in several public forums through meetings
and seminars. Implementation of these laws, thus, should not cause any resistance or
difficulty, once appropriate training and operational guidelines for implementation are
appropriately implemented. ERDL-III will concentrate on these issues further.



7
*  Privatization. The government has opted to take a cautious approach in privatizing its
public sector enterprises. Due precautions are being taken to ensure satisfactory treatment
of employees, their vested interests, and to ensure that no new private sector monopolies
are created as the old public sector monopolies get dismantled. This route, will ensure
that the privatization program does not run into serious public opposition and remains
socially acceptable.
*  ERDL-M. The proposed ERDL-III and successive operations will cap the sustainability
of all changes introduced in this program.  It will provide the necessary technical
assistance to consolidate the progress achieved so far. The Government of Jordan's
steadfast commitment to continue with this program and to bring along public support
through tackling the social safety net problems in a timely manner supports this entire
effort. The Bank is assisting the government in financing and implementing a Social
Productivity Program (SPP) which aims directly at the twin problems of unemployment
and poverty.
Macroeconomic Framework
27.         With a strong adjustment and structural reform program in place, Jordan is
entering the ranks of moderately indebted countries. The debt service to exports ratio is well
below the 25 percent mark above which liquidity concerns rise. Standard and Poors' (BB-) and
Moody's (Ba3) assigned their first rating to Jordan's foreign debt in 1995 at speculative grade. In
September 1997, Jordan Phosphate Mines Company issued US$100 million corporate bond at
LIBOR plus 155 basis points which sets a new benchmark for international investors for Jordan.
Bank Performance
28.         Based on the experience and lessons learned from the implementation of ERDL,
Bank staff intensified its involvement and technical assistance provided to the borrower in
implementing ERDL-1I. In addition to the Trust Funds from IDF and PHRD in the order of
US$800,000, technical assistance funds were provided by the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID), which facilitated the recruitment of local experts to help with the drafting
of legislation. The World Bank also chaired a Consultative Group meeting for Jordan to
coordinate additional concessional assistance needed for closing the financing gap identified under
the program. The government was also given assistance to design and implement a Social
Productivity Project (SPP) which complemented the social safety net requirements essential to
successful implementation of the reform program. Timely and expeditious review by the Bank
staff of various draft pieces of legislation was instrumental helpful in completing the tasks in time.
Similarly, with the help of intensive technical assistance support, the government is now well
under way with its comprehensive privatization program.



8
Borrower Performance
29.         Jordanian authorities showed excellent grasp of all key issues that needed to be
addressed in implementing this operation. An enormous amount of complex work was achieved
in a very short time reflecting the serious commitment on the government's part to move quickly
with the reform process. It was also beneficial that full participation and input was received from
the government during the conception and design stage of this loan. The government maintained
a fully participative spirit in obtaining input from all relevant quarters on issues affecting large
segments of business and private community. Clarity of rationale and singularity of objective
between the borrower and the Bank on all segments of the reform process were the most
important aspects for the successful outcome of this operation.
Assessment of Outcome
30.         Major legislative and financial sector reforms achieved under ERDL-II have laid a
strong foundation for unleashing the latent potential of the Jordanian economy. The reforms have
brought the Jordanian economy to the threshold of the twenty-first century, ready to integrate
with the world economy through the membership in agencies such as the World Trade
Organization and the European Community. The overall impact of these changes will be felt: over
the coming several years as and when domestic productive capacity reaches its optimum level.
Reforms achieved under this loan also mandate the actions required to finalize and complete their
application in the real market place. The proposed ERDL-HI is designed to further this objective.
Future Operations
31.         ERDL-II will be followed by ERDL-I1 in the summer of 1998. The proposed
loan would strive to achieve the twin objectives of continuing and deepening the reform process
and to give a practical shape to the reforms achieved under ERDL and ERDL-II through
designing necessary guidelines and training to make the application of new laws effective and
efficient. In addition, the Bank and International Finance Corporation would continue to provide
financial and technical assistance to support the government's Social Productivity Prograrn for
employment generation, micro-enterprise support and poverty alleviation projects.
Key Lessons Learned
32.         The success of this operation provides a good example of close collaboration with
the borrower during the design and implementation phases. The program design was made
comprehensive enough for the government to adopt it as its own medium-term development
agenda which could also be used in addressing the concerns of a number of other key
development partners of Jordan. Since the reform program had been implicitly endorsed by the
IMF, the European Community and other major donors, its justification and rationalization were
no longer the issues to be resolved.



9
33.         The roadmap for the reform program was made clear early on and ownership by
officials at the highest levels of government was secured through the clarity of shared objectives
and design. Thanks to the responsiveness of the preparation and implementation team it was
possible to achieve the many goals in record time.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
SECOND ECONOMIC REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT LOAN-II
(LOAN 4115-JOR)
Borrower's Assessment
Background
1.          The government of Jordan fully concurs with the World Bank's Implementation
Completion assessment for the Second Economic Reform and Development Loan (ERDL-l1).
Although the target objectives set forth under this operation were extremely complex with
profound social implications, that in many cases required lengthy public debates, the government
was able to accomplish them with ease in the longer-term interest of national economic and
financial stability. The implementation of reforms and policy changes under ERDL-II, albeit much
more intense and difficult in comparison to the first operation, was made easier by the fact that the
process of change initiated under the first adjustment operation provided the necessary impetus to
carry on the tasks to their next phase.
2.          This operation also provided us an excellent opportunity to involve the Jordanian
private sector expertise in close cooperation and with supervision of the World Bank staff in a
number of difficult tasks with extremely positive results. Thus, we believe that the project
implementation resulted in enhancing our local capacity building in many highly technical areas
such as: banking legislation, competition laws, financial market operations, etc. We also wish to
acknowledge the positive significance of having a frank and informal dialogue with the World
Bank staff to iron-out any possible bottlenecks during the project preparation stage. This
collaborative process was also helpful to govermnent authorities in discussing and formulating our
medium-term objectives with other key development partners.
Achievement of Major Loan Objectives
3.          Primary objectives under this operation aimed at: (i) the development and
finalization of business and financial sector related legislation; (ii) trade reforms and trade
facilitation; and (iii) privatization and private sector development. Based on these reforms and the
government's overall economic strategy, we had also established certain macro-economic
objectives against which we could self-assess the national economic performance. These macro-
economic targets were also endorsed and supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
through an enhanced Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement.



12
Assessment of Outcome
4.          In our view, the success of our agreed objectives under ERDL-II was crucial, if
the government's overall economic development and reform strategy were to be continued.
ERDL-II has taken us one step closer towards the globalization of the Jordanian economy. Since
our objectives under this operation were formulated in strict conformance with the government's
agreed and publicly announced and well debated strategy, all tasks were completed with ease in a
record time. Although the new legislative changes were well debated by the law makers, they
were endorsed with large and broad based popular support and were viewed as significant
positive steps in bringing our laws and procedures in line with the best practices employed
elsewhere. Due diligence was also taken to reflect our unique cultural and social heritage in
customizing these laws to suit indigenous requirements.
5.          We feel that our overall performance, as evidenced by the macro statistics, has
been fully satisfactory. All significant tasks covered under the first and second set of objectives
(para 3) were completed or even exceeded. Progress under the third set of objectives related to
actions on the privatization activities, has been slower than anticipated. This reflects, partially, the
government's deliberate decision to take a more cautious approach, particularly in new areas
where we did not have a sufficient experience base. Partly, it has also been due to the continued
difficult and uncertain external environment in the region.
Key lessons Learned
6.          Full and complete understanding of the main objectives of the reform program
between the Bank and the government, we believe was the major underlying factor in ens,uring
the success of this operation. The feasibility and input management entrusted to the government
allowed us to "own" the program and to proceed with its implementation as part of our national
economic agenda. The second most important feature of this operation was its "building block"
design as mentioned in the Bank's report. It allowed us to build upon the success of its
predecessor operation in an unambiguous environment. This demonstration of close cooperation
and mutual understanding of the issues between the World Bank team and the government team
has been strengthened even further during the preparation of the proposed ERDL-III.

1.1 Macroeconomic Adjustments    Substantial progress was made including a sound external financing plan and
the adoption of the necessary measures to consolidate the fiscal adjustments and
l___________________________________ to restore the level of gross official reserves.
2. Tariff Liberalization
2.1 Tariff Structure             The maximum tariff was reduced to 40% excluding tariffs on adcohol and
tobacco. The number of tariff bands was lowered to six: 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and
40%.
2.2 Customs Law                  a new WTO consistent Customs Law was submitted to Parliamkent, which

Table 9: Economic Costs and Benefits
Benefits
ERDL-II supported the government's economic reform program aining at the maintenance of high
GDP growth supported by robust export performance and a much greater role for the private sector
competing in an enabling legal framework. It: (a) strengthened the incentives for export production
through reducing the import costs of capital goods and intermediate goods; (b) benefited domestic
consumers by lowering the costs of imported consumption goods; (c) boosted national income growth and
helped to alleviate poverty; (d) improved resource efficiency and raised factor productivity; (e) helped
Jordan to attract direct foreign and domestic investment; (f) facilitated Jordan's move toward closer trade
relations with the EU and regional economies; and (g) supported Jordan's balance of payments financing
requirements.
Costs: Social Impact
Social costs induced by the ERDL-II include increases in domestic and import prices and in taxes,
thereby reducing private purchasing power in the short term. Also, the reduction in government
expenditures has slowed the pace at which the public sector has hired new employees. On the other hand,
as the economic reform measures supported by the ERDL-II take hold, employment and incomes in the
private sector, both rural and urban, have increased in the longer term, consumer welfare will benefit
from increases in the efficiency of resource mobilization and use that would result from trade and price
liberalization. An important concomitant measure is to ensure that the reforms are politically and
socially robust and to address poverty in the short term through the provision of compensatory
mechanisms (consistent with the outward-oriented growth goal) for the poor and those who may suffer
temporarily from these reforms. The Government has adopted a broad strategy to address the problems
of poverty and unemployment, prepared with collaboration of the World Bank. The "Social Productivity
Program" (SPP) has two "tracks". The first is a set of measures directly targeting poverty and
unemployment including improving and extending the income transfer program to all poor households,
and strengthening the microenterprise sector. The second track is a broader and longer-term program to
address the underlying requirements for increasing social productivity through improvements in health,
education, information and technology, infrastructure, and governance. This second track gradually
absorbs the first as the poor are brought actively into the mainstream of social and economic life.
Costs: Budgetary
The ERDL-II did not support the Government budget directly, but was a loan directed to strengthen
international reserves of the Central Bank. As such, the funds have not been used for Government
expenditures, but to cover the foreign exchange costs of large capital outflows associated with the shift in
portfolio preferences of citizens of the West Bank. The benefits of exchange rate stability and averting a
BOP crisis dictated by factors exogenous to Jordan are estimated to greatly outweigh the financing cost
of the loan.
