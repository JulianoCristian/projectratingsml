Further\n            objectives are: to broaden and deepen financial\n            intermediation, to provide an enabling business environment\n            and increase the private sector's economy share.\n            Furthermore, the loan will provide Jordan with short-term\n            balance of payments support in order to strengthen its\n            international reserves position.  The ERDL-II supports trade\n            and investment policy reforms to: a) further reduce\n            anti-export bias, to foster integration with world market,\n            and reduce administrative obstacles; b) improve banking\n            competition and the efficiency of financial intermediation;\n            c) improve viability of financial institutions and eliminate\n            special privileges; d) encourage long-term saving and\n            promote development of new financial instruments and\n            markets; e) encourage entry, improve incentives, and offer\n            national treatment to foreign investors; f) modernize a\n            broad range of business laws; and g) improve opportunities\n            for private sector firms, increase competition, allow the\n            Government to concentrate on its core functions, and achieve\n            greater efficiency through privatization and restructuring."}, "docdt": "1996-11-14T00:00:00Z"}
