strengthening of the agricultural extension service by\n            upgrading Government-operated centers for extension activity\n            and farmer training; constructing housing and offices,\n            improving field supervision; and establishing a training\n            center and visual aids center for extension workers; (b)\n            improving livestock production by expanding animal health\n            campaigns through the provision of vaccines, drugs,\n            equipment,transport and training for field staff; better\n            utilization of dry-weather grazing through the provision of\n            water and stock routes; introduction of better livestock\n            husbandry through the provision of staff and a pilot cattle\n            fattening program; and the construction of a limited number\n            of cattle markets, stock routes and holding grounds; (c)\n            supplying farming inputs as credit in kind to farmers\n            through a strengthened and better trained cooperative\n            movement; (d) improving crop marketing; (e) providing a\n            Project Coordinator and supporting staff; (f) aiding the\n            introduction of improved agricultural practices to\n            illiterate farmers through a pilot functional numeracy\n            program; and (g) providing funds for the preparation of a\n
