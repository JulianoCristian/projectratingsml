REPORT ANID RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECtlTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE E;PUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA FOR A RURAL
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of The Gambia in an amount equivalent
to US$4.1 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a rural develop-
ment project.  US$2.2 million of this credit will be onlent to The Gambia
Cooperative Union. 'he United Kingdom would make a grant for this project
equivalent to US$4.1 million; and the Arab Bank for Economic Development
in Africa (BADEA) would provide a loan of US$3.3 million at a 2 percent
interest rate and repayable over 25 years following five years of grace.
PART I: THE ECONOMY*
2.        A report entitled "The Economy of The Gambia" (907-GM) dated
December 12, 1975 has been circulated to the Executive Directors. Its
conclusions are reflected Ln the following analysis. Country data sheets
appear as Annex I.
3.        The Gambia is a r,mall but densely populated country with 500,000
inhabitants occupying a narrow stri3 along both sides of The Gambia River
and forming an enclave of 10,000 km inside Senegal. The population growth
rate is estimated at about 2.5 percent for the country as a whole but, due
to the urban drift, at 5 percent in the capital area. The population is
predominantly illiterate (90 percent). Economic growth is slow in real
terms, about 2.6 percent p.a., about equal to the population growth rate.
In 1974 per capita GDP was estimated to be US$200.
4.        The economy consLsts mostly of traditional small holder rural
activities; agriculture, livestock and fisheries account for 60 percent
of the country's total GDP and employ about 85 percent of the active popu-
lation. Agriculture is mostly rainfed, characterized by a short produc-
tion period limited to the six months of the rainy season, and dominated
by groundnuts, which are aLmost the only cash crop of The Gambia. Ground-
nuts are the main source oE foreign exchange and constitute the basis for
the country's major industrial activity, groundnut oil milling.    Income per
capita of the 98,000 urban population, estimated at US$470, is 3.6 times
higher than that of the 400,000 rural population, estimated at US$130.
5.        Economic activity in The Gambia reflects its structural weak-
nesses: (a) low productivity of the rural sector; (b) wide seasonal fluc-
tuations in output and emp:Loyment (there is full employment at the height

of the agricultural season but this is followed by six months of sharply
reduced activity in most economic sectors, including trade, transport and
industry, all linked to groundnuts); and (c) extreme vulnerability to var-
iations in groundnut prices and production levels (the latter essentially
a function of rainfall).
Recent Developments
6.        The Government has undertaken both to diversify the Gambian eco-
nomy in order to reduce its dependence on groundnuts, and to increase the
productivity of the rural sector. This is reflected in the shift in capital
expenditures between the 1967/68-1970/71 and the 1971/72-1973/74 Development
Programs to emphasize rural development. Under the latter program, the Gov-
ernment has undertaken action aimed at diversifying agriculture by develop-
ing irrigated rice along the Gambia River, cotton in the East, and vegeta-
bles around the urban areas. Irrigation allows year-round rice production,
and the IDA financed Irrigated Rice Project (333-GM) is estimated to have
provided 1,500 families with additional production of 5,000 tons of rice
p.a. (about 12 percent of the national consumption requirements of rice).
In 1972, the Government requested the U.K. to conduct a Land Resource Sur-
vey which was completed in February 1975; its data were used to formulate
this project.
7.        The Government has also actively promoted the establishment of
hotels and modern fish processing plants, mostly with private financing,
by ensuring provision of infrastructure facilities, pa-rticipating in the
equity of some of these enterprises, and granting tax holidays and other
incentives. These activities have had a beneficial impact on the balance
of payments and have resulted in the creation of about 2,500 jobs (about
20 percent of employment in the modern sector). Although the employment
generated by tourism is largely seasonal, it comes at a time when employ-
ment in the agricultural sector is at a low ebb. In order to spur small-
scale industrial and services development, mobilize local savings and
channel them together with foreign financing to local entrepreneurs, the
Government established in 1972 The Gambia Commercial and Development Bank.
8.        The foregoing measures have had some impact on The Gambia's
economy but performance continues to be dominated by developments in the
groundnut sector. Thus, the doubling of groundnut prices was the major
determinant in the miarked upturn of the Gambian economy in 1973/74. Com-
bined with an increase in the volume of production, the price increases
resulted in a near doubling of farmers' income; a jump in public and semi-
public (The Gambia Produce Marketing Board) sector savings, which rose to
a record high of about US$20 million (about the equivalent of two years of
central Government tax revenues); an improvement in the current account of
the balance of payments from minus US$4 million in 1972/1973 to plus US$10
million in 1973/1974; and an increase in foreign exchange reserves to US$35
million (equivalent to over 10 months of imports) by the end of 1974. This
dramatic price increase more than compensated for the increased petroleum
bill and the effects of world wide inflation and contributed to an improve-
ment in The Gambia's terms of trade.



- 3-
Development Prospects and Constraints
9.        This favorable situation is not expected to last.     Projected de-
creases in groundnut prices together with increases in the prices of imports
are expected to cause a substantial deterioration in The Gambia's terms of
trade from 120 in 1973/74 (base 1967-69 = 100) to only 67 in 1979/80. In
terms of the real purchasing power of the economy, in 1973/74 gross domestic
income was 8 percent higher than GDP, while in 1979/80 it is expected to be
13 percent lower.
10.       The Government is completing its first Five-Year Development Plan
which will cover the 1976-80 period. This Plan continues to emphasize the
productive sectors: agriculture, livestock, fisheries, tourism, and mining
projects (exploitation of rutile and kaolin deposits). The Plan is further
expected to include urban and transport infrastructure and to stress the
development of skilled manpower.
11.       Lack of skilled manpower is one of the major bottlenecks hindering
economic development and has slowed down the preparation and execution of
development projects in the past. The Plan will include a human resources
development program which will aim at creating in the shortest possible time
a stock of trained manpower at all levels. The Infrastructure and Tourism
Project as well as the proposed Rural Development Project both have substan-
tial training components, but further improvement is needed in the education/
training system to make it more responsive to the needs of the labor market;
there is an oversupply of secondary school graduates coupled with a lack of
persons with specialized skills.
12.       Gross public investment under the Five-Year Development Plan is
estimated at US$67 million in current prices. This corresponds to annual
expenditures of about 11 percent of GDP, a sharp increase over the past
when total public investment averaged only 5-6 percent of GDP.
Financial Prospects and Foreign Aid
13.       The financing needed to implement the Development Plan is ex-
pected to come from a combination of foreign aid, drawing down of existing
reserves, and public savings generated during the Plan period. In recent
years the Government has managed to generate small budgetary surpluses as
a result of its efforts to improve tax collection and restrain the growth
of recurrent expenditures. However, these surpluses will disappear by
1979/80 because of the implementation of agricultural and public works
programs which will require larger recurrent expenditures and because of
the need to compensate for inadequate material and maintenance expenditures
in the past. Assuming that groundnut prices decline as forecast, the Gambia
Produce Marketing Board will be unable to generate significant surpluses over
the Plan period. Consequently, public savings, which reached a high of US$17
million after debt service in 1973/74 are expected to total only US$1 million
for the entire period 1976 to 1980.



- 4 -
14.       With respect to foreign aid, IDA, the U.K., the Federal Republic
of Germany, the People's Republic of China, the ADB, and the European Com-
mon Market countries are expected to provide about US$50 million in assis-
tance (at current prices) during the Plan period. The balance (about US$15
million) of financing necessary to implement the Plan would be provided from
the presently high reserves of the public sector and would require that for-
eign exchange reserves be reduced from the equivalent of 10 months of imports
to 4 months of imports over the period 1975 to 1980.
15.       In summary, our projections show that Government will be able to
finance approximately 20 percent of its Five-Year Development Plan, princi-
pally from reserves. However, these projections are particularly sensitive
to the groundnut situation. A single bad crop, a slower rate of growth in
groundnut output, a drop in groundnut prices beyond forecasts or a combina-
tion of these factors could seriously affect realization of the Plan's ob-
jectives and cause a sharp drawdown of the country's reserves.
16.       The Government is therefore justified in seeking external financing
on concessionary terms. With a continuation of present policies we expect The
Gambia to be successful in mobilizing the necessary finance on appropriate
terms; accordingly debt service will not impose an unduly heavy burden on
budgetary receipts. Because of the diversification of foreign aid donors, the
exposure of IDA is expected to decrease from 40 percent of total outstanding
debt in 1973/74 to 20 percent in 1985.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE GAMBIA
17.       To date the Bank Group has financed three operations in The Gambia.
One credit of US$2.1 million in FY70 (187-GM) was for rehabilitation of
the port of Banjul, essential for a country so vitally dependent on foreign
trade. Due to a sharp increase in construction costs following the appraisal,
a US$2.4 million supplementary credit was added in FY74. The second opera-
tion involved a US$1.3 million credit (333-GM) for the irrigation of 3,000
ha under rice cultivation and for the preparation of a follow-up project.
The third operation, for which a US$4.0 million credit (602-GM) was signed
January 12, 1976, focuses on the development of the tourism sector in which
The Gambia has some comparative advantages; it also aims at improving pub-
lic utilities in bozh the Banjul urban community and tourism areas. 1/ The
present project supports the Government's efforts to increase rural produc-
tivity and diversify the economy. It will provide improved agricultural
extension services, farmers' training, transport and marketing infrastruc-
ture and agricultural credit. The lack of these essential services and in-
frastructure has been the main impediment to increasing the yields of The
Gambia's main rainfed crops (groundnuts, millet, rice) and improving the
productivity of the livestock herds.
1/   Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of April 30,
1976 and notes on the execution of these three projects.



18.       The Government has asked the Bank to support its increasing empha-
sis on manpower training programs. There is an acute shortage of trained
manpower at nearly every skill level in The Gambia, but the most pressing
needs in the near term are for clerks and mechanics, para-medical personnel,
and middle management. The Bank is working with Government now with a view
to identifying possible projects in technical and vocational training and
upgrading of secondary schools.
19.       Due to the shortage of IDA funds and the relatively high cost of
projects in The Gambia, the Association is actively promoting co-financing
with other donors. The project described in this report is to be co--financed
by two other donors in addi.tion to the Association.
PART III - THE RURAL SECTOR
20.        In The Gambia, agriculture accounts for 67 percent of GDP and 99
percent of exports. Farms are small and productivity low, with ruraL incomes
averaging only about US$134. Groundnuts grown as a cash crop use some 50
percent of the farmed area.. Food grain production (sorghum, millet, rice)
tends to be low, and farm families are often forced to buy cereals to meet
their subsistence requirements; annual rice imports average up to 20,000
tons. All families keep small animals (sheep, goats, poultry) but onLy about
20 percent own cattle.
21.       The Gambia has a single peak wet season from June to October and
an average rainfall of 1,200 mm per annum in the south and 900 mm in the north.
In the Sahelian countries (The Gambia is one of seven countries so cLassified)
droughts of varying severit:y occur about one year in five. As a consequence,
an overall crop shortfall of 20-30 percent is expected once every 20 years,
as was the case in 1973. Recent studies indicate that 50 percent of the
soil is suitable for crop production, of which less than 20 percent is under
cultivation and 45 percent under fallow. The highest proportion of fertile
soil is found in the Western and Northern Bank Divisions, which constitute the
major area of the proposed project. The Gambia River, a dominant natural land-
mark and potentially the most important natural resource for agricultural
development, is tidal throughout its length in the country. During the dry
season, the reduced flow of' fresh water permits salt water to penetrate 240Qkm
upstream. As potentially irrigable and productive land remains largely un-
exploited due to the'salt intrusion, means of river regulation are being
studied. It will be many years however before any major irrigation schemes
can be realized.
The Structure of Agricultural Production
22.       Crop Production.   The basic farming unit is the compound, an en-
closed group of dwellings i.nhabited by nuclear families (dabadas) alL related
by blood. The average compound size is 22 members, with the eldest male mem-
ber as head. Several compounds constitute a village. Land tenure, shaped



by history and religion, and backed by law, recognizes no individual right
of possession, only a collective right of use. Land is held in trust by
the District Council, whose chief arbitrates between village headmen. Each
headman in turn allocates to compound heads, at the beginning of each farming
season, land recognized as belonging to his village.
23.       Studies suggest that the area cultivated per adult is similar
throughout the country, ranging from 0.6 ha to 0.8 ha. Data collected for
a number of years si'ggest that the productivity of land has been rising
but also that the growth of rural population is faster than that of culti-
vated area. Thus the apparent increase in land productivity, still low by
general standards, appears to result from an increase in labor input rather
than from improvement in the techniques of production. For cereals, average
productivity is 500-600 kg/ha; for groundnuts, 900 kg/ha. Crop production
figures are given below. The low figures for 1973/1974 reflect the end of
the recent Sahelian drought.
--------- ('000) tons --------------

Millet and Sorghum                 22                        32
(threshed grain)
24.       Methods of cultivation, with the hand hoe the dominant tool employed,
have remained largely unchanged over the years. The use of ox-drawn equipment
was introduced in the 1950s but only some 6,000 pairs of oxen are in use.
Labor provided by the compound is under-employed for the greater part of the
year but becomes insufficient from mid-May to the end of July, when outside
labor is often needed. Shortage of labor has been identified as the single
most important constraint on the expansion of potentially profitable double-
cropping of irrigated rice. This is because all available family labor in
May/June is needed on groundnut fields and none can be spared to prepare
paddy fields for the wet season crop. In addition to the fluctuation in labor
employment, lack of improved and high yielding seeds impedes the growth of
agriculture production. Farmers are aware of the value of fertilizers but
onrly about 4,000 tons of chemical fertilizers are used (about half on
irrigated rice); hcusehold waste and sheep and goat manure are used on rice
fields and cattle are tethered on the sorghum and millet fields during the dry
season.
25.       Livestock Production.   In 1974 cattle, mainly the indigenous
N'Dama breed, were estimated to number 280,000 head. With a low off-take
of 10 percent and a current annual growth rate of 3 percent, livestock con-
tributes less than 5 percent to GDP. Calving percentage is low at 40 percent
and mortality during the first 12 months is high at 20 percent. Sheep are
of the West African dwarf breed and goats mostly the Guinea type, with off-
take rates of about 30 percent and mortality rates of 15 to 20 percent.
National annual beef production is estimated at about 3,000 tons cold dressed
weight, mutton about 900 tons, and poultry, 300 tons.



26.       Government Intervention in the Rural Sector.   Government interven-
tion in the sector falls in three broad categories. First, the Gov-
ernment provides nationwide support services for farmers and livestock pro-
ducers, but the impact on production and farm incomes is small due to the
lack of well-planned programs or means to execute them. The second cate-
gory of intervention concerns the marketing of major crops and the fixing
of controlled prices at producer and retail levels for a range of agricul-
tural commodities. The third category is the subsidization of the sales
price of fertilizers.
Agricultural Institutions
27.       Government intervention takes place through four governmental and
parastatal institutions. The Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources
(MANR) provides agricultural and livestock services to farmers through its
Departments of Agriculture (crop extension, training and research), Animal
Health and Production (veterinary services and animal husbandry extension),
and Cooperation (support to the Cooperative Movement). Because of limited
manpower and the geographic separation of the headquarters and various
operating departments, coordination of programs has been poor in the past
and the quality of services provided inadequate.
28.       The Gambia Produce Marketing Board (GPMB) buys, processes, and
exports groundnuts and palm kernels, buys locally produced paddy rice from
some participants in Government-sponsored irrigation schemes, and imports
rice and agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers and chemicals. For ground-
nuts, it has a monopoly of purchase and export. GPMB is well managed, and in
spite of some transfers to the Price Stabilization Fund (PSF), its reserves
now stand at over US$30 million due to recent high world market prices and
good harvests of groundnuts in 1973/74 and 1974/75.
29.       The Livestock Marketing Board (LMB), created in 1972/73, purchases
live animals up-country and transports them to Banjul for resale to butchers.
Since poor management and procedures resulted in sizeable losses, the Gov-
ernment is reorganizing the Board by recruiting better management and field
supervision personnel with the help of bilateral financial assistance.
30.       The Cooperative Movement.   The Government gives direction and sup-
port through its Department of Cooperation in MANR to 64 primary societies
of farmers organizel by The Gambia Cooperative Union (GCU). At present, these
societies buy 45 percent of marketed groundnuts on behalf of GPMB, and GCU
provides centralized accounting, purchasing and administrative services as
well as subsistence loans tO primary society members. However, little pro-
duction credit has been made available to farmers.
Pricing Policies
31.       Producer prices for groundnuts are set by Government on the advice
of GPMB which takes account of projected world prices and the costs of sub-
sidies on various basic foodstuffs and fertilizers met by GPMB from the



Price Stabilization Fund. Pr-oducer prices have traditionally been set to
be rather more attractive than those in neighboring Senegal; this is to
discourage an outflow of produce. Since Senegal fixes its producer prices
for groundnuts at levels sufficient to generate substantial revenues, The Gambia
has been able to pay its growers considerably less than the world price and at the
same time attract some groundnuts from Senegal. Government policy is changing
however, and for 1975/76, Government has set a price 20 percent higher than
in 1974/75 which, it states, it will maintain in real terms despite an antic-
ipated fall in the world price for groundnuts.
32.       GPMB also buys paddy rice, but its purchases have been very small
apparently because of the low prices it has offered. For 1975/76, Govern-
ment has increased the price by 14 percent in line with a new policy of
improving returns to farmers even though this may involve increased prices
for domestic consumers. The Gambia imports about 20,000 tons of rice annually
which in the past has been sold at a 15 percent subsidy. The subsidy has been met
from the Price Stabilization Fund. As a consequence of new policies in
1975/76 consumers are to pay the market value for rice whether imported or
domestic. Another important food staple that has been similarly subsidized
is groundnut oil; for 1975/76 the subsidy has been halved.
33.       The official retail price of beef was D 1.65/kg in early 1976,
but actual retail price at that time had been permitted to drift up to D
2.80/kg, roughly in line with the price on Senegal's free market. It is
hoped that when LMB commences operations, it will seek to retain these
higher retail prices and thus permit better returns to producers.
34.       The principal subsidy on inputs is on fertilizers, and is met from
the Price Stabilization Fund. Farmers pay about 25 percent of farm gate cost.
In 1975 about 4,600 tons of fertilizers (about half for rice and half for
groundnuts) were sold, involving a subsidy of about US$0.8 million. This
subsidy is paid out of the reserves of GPMB which derive from an effective
tax on groundnut farmers. Its immediate removal is likely to dampen demand
which would be undesirable. Government policy now is to raise fertilizer
prices to farmers only to the extent of the general rate of inflation. With
the anticipated fall in world fertilizer prices, the subsidy would be eroded
to about two-thirds of its present level by 1980.
35.       Given The Gambia's unusual physical location and small size, the
current level of GcGernment intervention in the marketing of farm produce
appears appropriate. Government's pricing policies also appear sound and
currently are correctly designed to reduce the level of subsidization of
urban dwellers by rural people.

Development Effort, Policies and Long-Term Strategy for the
Rural Sector
36.       The Government has initiated four major agricultural development
efforts with external assistance. Three programs have concerned irrigated
rice development through small pumping schemes along the Gambia River. The
first of these schemes, under which about 2,000 acres were developed satis-
factorily, started in 1966 and was implemented with technical and financial
assistance from Taiwan. The second was financed by IDA in 1972 and was
designed to develop 3,000 acres of double-cropped irrigated rice. To date
some 2,000 acres have been developed. In 1975 these efforts were followed
by an agreement between The Gambia and The Peoples Republic of China under
which the latter has undertaken to provide financial and technical assistance
for future irrigated rice development. The remaining major development has
been an African Development Bank-financed project designed to introduce cotton
growing. This project started in 1974 but is making relatively slow progress
due to the low price for cotton compared to groundnuts.
37.       The objectives and strategies formulated in The Gambia's first
Five-Year Development Plan for 1976-1980 are clear and pragmatic: to in-
crease rural incomes and through them the quality of life in rural areas,
especially in nutrition; to eliminate rice imports; and to diversify pro-
duction. The Government intends to attain these objectives by retraining
and better equipping its field services to deliver proven technology pack-
ages to farmers in regions of productive potential; by offering credit
through the channels of a strengthened cooperative movement; and by im-
proving rural infrastructure, especially feeder roads and marketing and
storage facilities. Such Government policy and strategy will be supported
by the project described in this report.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
38.       The project was identified and prepared by the FAO/IBRD
Cooperative Program and appraised in October 1975. Negotiations
were held from May 12 to May 14, 1976, with a Gambian delegation
led by Mr. F.A.J. M'Boge, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Agricul-
ture and Natural Resources. The Staff Project Report [No. 1089a-GM] is
being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. Annex III provides
a credit and project summary and the attached map [IBRD 11974] shows the
project area.
Prject Concept
39.       The crop production and livestock husbandry components of the
project would be limited to the three administrative divisions in the
western part of the country--Western, Lower River, and North Bank Divi-
sions (see map). The population of these three divisions, almost wholly



- 10 -
rural and illiterate, represents about half of the rural population of the
country. The animal health and cattle marketing components of the project
would cover the entire country.
40.       Over a four-year period, the project aims to increase the cereal
and cash crop production and livestock husbandry of some 48,000 people living
in 65 selected villages (2,200 compounds). Increased production would be
achieved through the introduction of proven package programs for crop produc-
tion, supported by better coordinated and strengthened government services
and improved communications and marketing.     Project implementation would be
through existing agencies and departments of the Government. A Project Coor-
dinator located in the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources and
responsible to the Permanent Secretary would ensure the overall coordination
of project activities. The principal objectives and components of the project
would be:
(a) strengthening of the agricultural extension
service by upgrading Government-operated
centers for extension activity and farmer
training; constructing housing and offices;
improving field supervision; and establish-
ing a training center and visual aids center
for extension workers;
(b) improving livestock production by expanding
animal health campaigns through the provision
of vaccines, drugs, equipment, transport and
training for field staff; better utilization
of dry-weather grazing through the provision
of water and stock routes; introduction of
better livestock husbandry through the provi-
sion of staff and a pilot cattle fattening
program; and the construction of a limited
number of cattle markets, stock routes and
holding grounds;
(c)  supplying farming inputs as credit in kind
to farmers (fertilizers, seed, draught oxen
and implements) through a strengthened and
better trained cooperative movement. The
establishnent of a Seed Multiplication Unit
would ensure seed supplies to farmers and
agricultural research services would also
be expanded;
(d) improving crop marketing through the con-
struction and improvement of cooperatively
owned produce markets and the development
of a limited number of crop extraction
roads;



- 11 -
(e) aiding the introduction of improved agricul-
tural practices to illiterate farmers through
a pilot functional numeracy program;
(f) ensuring coordination of project implementa-
tion by providing a Project Coordinator and
supporting staff; and
(g) providing funds for the preparation of a second-
phase agricultural project; for a feasibility
study of developing a potential rice grow-
ing area, the Jakhaly Swamp; and for a study
in methods of improving groundnut marketing.
The result of this last study would be re-
viewed by the Government and those of its
recommendations which are acceptable to the
Government and the Association would be
promptly implemented [Section 4.03 of the
draft Development Credit Agreement].
The basic concepts of the project, as well as the technology pack-
ages offered, are similar to those of other projects in West Africa, for
example in Senegal where the farming conditions and the people are similar.
In these projects innovations have been well received by the project bene-
ficiaries and the value of the packages proven. A special feature of the
project would be its functional numeracy program. In the absence of a more
comprehensive functional literacy program, this project component, directly
related to agricultural prodluction, represents the most practical and
promising avenue for raisinly the aptitude of a largely illiterate farming
community the majority of kwom cannot count, weigh or measure.
Project Costs and Financial Arrangements
41.       Total project costs, excluding duties and taxes, are estimated at
US$11.7 million, of which foreign expenditures are US$6.9 million or 60 percent.
Physical and price contingencies account for US$1.7 million or 17 percent of total
base cost. The proposed ID.\ credit would be complemented by parallel financing
from a British Government grant and from a BADEA loan. The signature of their
respective agreements with the Government will be a condition of effectiveness for
the IDA credit agre_2ment. Farmers who will be beneficiaries of the project will
also contribute in the form of a down payment for oxen and equipment. The
financing plan is shown in the following table.
US$ Million
Total Cost

Total       11.7                       100



- 12 -
42.       Of the IDA credit, US$1.0 million would be passed on to MANR;
US$0.4 million would be passed on to PWD; and US$2.2 million would go
to primary cooperative societies through the rediscount facilities of the
Central Bank and The Gambia Cooperative Union (GCU); and US$o.5 million
would be unallocated.
Procurement and Disbursement
43.        US$2.3 mi'Llion of farm inputs, equipment, and vehicles
would be procured through international competitive bidding, in accordance
with standard IDA guidelines. Contracts worth less than US$50,000 would be
let on the basis of local competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance
with local procedures which are acceptable to IDA. Work oxen, estimated to cost
about Us$0.6 million, would be purchased by MANR through the agency of either
licensed cattle buyers or LMB. Procurement of items financed by the British
grant (mostly building construction and other civil works) and BADEA (vehicles
and equipment) would be carried out under their regulations.
44.       Disbursements under the IDA credit would be for:
100 percent of foreign expenditures for vehicles, plant, farm inputs and
equipment (if purchased locally, disbursements would cover 90 percent of the
invoice amount); 100 percent of the costs of consulting services and training
fellowships; 90 percent of the cost of work oxen; and 100 percent of the cost
of staff salaries and operating expenses of the Project Coordinators office.
Implementation
45.       Agricultural Credit Arrangements.   The US$2.2 million of the IDA credit
will be passed on to GCU at 3 percent through the Central Bank as an agent to the
Government. GCU would establish a revolving credit fund to provide seasonal and
medium-term credit to farmers for farm inputs and equipment and would relend
at 6 percent to primary societies. [Section 3.04 of draft Development Credit
Agreement]. Compound heads would pay 11 percent for both seasonal and medium-
term credit. Seasonal credit would be repaid at the next groundnut marketing
period and medium-term loans would be repaid in three equal annual install-
ments. At present no society is eligible for further credit unless 95 percent
of outstanding loans are repaid; this rule would be maintained (Section 4.04 of
the draft Development Credit Agreement].
46.         Organization and Management. Overall responsibility for the
project implementation would lie with the Permanent Secretary of MANR
but execution of project components would be by participating Departments of
MANR and concerned parastatal organisations. Participating organisations would be
the Departments of Agriculture, Animal Health and Production, Cooperation;
GPMB; LMB; and GCU.  While the capability required to implement the project
exists within the organizational structures of Government
and its parastatal bodies, lack of cooperation and coordination has hiindered
efficient operations in the past. The project would therefore strengthen
these existing structures by providing staff, training and facilities and by
improving administrative and financial procedures. To enable these improve-
ments to be carried out smoothly over a period of time, there would be no
field development in the first year of the project.    During this time efforts
would be devoted to construction of required infrastructure, purchase of
equipment,and staff recruitment and training.



- 13 -
47.       The Permanent Secretary of MANR would delegate day-to-day management
authority to the Project Coordinator. Broad policy guidelines and goals would
be formulated by a Projects Coordinating Committee to be established under
the chairmanship of the Permanent Secretary of MIANR and including senior
representatives of GPMB, GCU, the Ministries of Finance and Economic Planning
and Industrial Development, and heads of participating Departments of MANR.
The Project Coordinator would act as Secretary to this Committee and ensure
that its decisions are carried out. During the first two years of project imple-
mentation and with the assistance of a Project Officer, the Project Coordinator
would function as p.oject manager. He would be responsible inter alia for
preparing financial estimates and annual work programs in cooperation with
heads of participating departments and agencies and reporting progress in
project implementation to the Coordinating Committee through the Permanent
Secretary of MANR. In the remaining two years of project implementation, the
Project Coordinator would relinquish some of his day-to-day responsibilities
for project implementation to the Project Officer and assume a broader role in
the coordination of all agricultural development projects. [Section 3.03(c)
and Schedule IV 1(c) to the draft Development Credit Agreement.] The Government
has agreed to appoint a quaLified and experienced Project Coordinator and Project
Officer satisfactory to the Association (Section 3.03(b) and (c) of the draft
Development Credit Agreement).
48.       The project would create a regional headquarters for MANR to house
a Regional Agricultural Officer at Mansa Konko, a town served by roads leading
to all parts of the project area. The Regional Agricultural Officer, as the
field representative of MAMR, would supervise and coordinate the project
activities of all departments. This would fill the gap that exists between the
MANR headquarters staff located in or near Banjul and representatives at the
administrative division level.
Benefits and Risks
49.       Impact of Project on Yields and Production.   It is estimated that
after a five-year period of project participation the average project farmer
would have increased his yields as follows:
Present Yields
in the Project
Crops                                      Area         After Five Years
----- --(kg/ha)-------------
Groundnut oilseed (in shell)                     900               1,500
Groundnut confectionary (in shell)               800               1,400
Rice upland (paddy)                              800               1,300
Rice swamp (paddy)                             1,000               1,400
Sorghum (threshed grain)                         500               1,000
Through such yield increases, the project would generate at maturity (1983)
annual incremental production of 10,000 tons of groundnuts, 400 tons of con-
fectionary groundnuts, 5,000 tons of rice and 1,000 tons of sorghum. For
livestock, improvements in l:he calving and reductions in overall mortality
rates would generate, after seven years of project activity, an annuaL incre-
ment of beef production of about 10,000 tons on a liveweight basis.



- 14 -
50.       Economic Analysis.   The project's direct economic benefits would
be an increase in the production of groundnuts, rice, sorghum and meat. At
full development the annual economic value in 1975 terms of incremental
project production is estimated at US$5.1 million. Of this, US$1.5 million
would be derived from groundnuts, about US$1.5 million from farm rice and
sorghum, and US$2.1 million from meat. The net contribution of the project
to foreign exchange earnings, through export expansion and import substitu-
tion (rice) would be US$2.0 million per year at full production.
51.       The weighted average economic rate of return for the project as
a whole is 23 percent. The livestock component which costs US$1.6 million
(15 percent of project cost before price contingencies) has an estimated
rate of return of 45 percent. The crop production component costing US$8.8
million (85 percent of project cost before price contigencies) has an esti-
mated economic rate of return of 17 percent. The project's overall rate of return
has been tested to determine the impact of changes in costs and benefits as well as
of potential droughts. These tests show that the project could withstand
circumstances more adverse than may be reasonably expected and yet remain
economically justified. Project costs could increase by 20 percent, for
example, and still a satisfactory rate of return of 16 percent would be
achieved.
52.       Risks.  The risks involved in the project are moderate.   Improve-
ments in crop husbandry techniques have been successfully tested elsewhere
in West Africa. Moreover, the rate of return has been calculated on the
assumption that only 60 percent of the farmers in the project area would
participate in the project. Undoubtedly the project would impose a major
problem of absorption on MANR, for it involves logistical management prob-
lems of a size and type not encountered so far. While technical assistance
will be provided, it will be essential for MANR to identify early any in-
cipient weaknesses in either project staffing or personnel. The livestock
component of the project is the most difficult to evaluate. While proposed
project actions are clearly sound and can be costed with reasonable accuracy,
estimates of benefits are subject to a wide margin of error in the absence
of detailed data. Fortunately, the benefits of this component could fall to
only 45 percent of the present forecast and still generate a rate of return
in excess of 10 percent. No environmental risks are expected to result from
project implementation. The only toxic materials involved would be very
small quantities of seed dressings which would be employed under controlled
conditions. Indeed, the erosion control measures of the project should
produce some environmental improvements.
53.       Farmers' Benefits.   The crop production component of the project
is intended to help some of the poorest farmers in The Gambia whose present
per capita income is only about US$65. Per capita incomes would on the
average increase in real terms by 200 percent. Earnings per man day would
increase from US$0.42 to US$1.05. In addition to raising compound members'



- 15 -
incomes to the national rural average, the project would stimulate an increase
in per capita cereal production from an annual average of 200 kg to about 300
kg, thus ameliorating nutrition.
54.       Financial Impact of the Project on Government and Public Agencies.
External sources would provide virtually all the funds needed for the
project. Expenditures by G'overnment and public agencies participating in the
project would be limited to fertilizer subsidies and the cost of supporting pro-
ducer prices for groundnut,, in line with Government policy. After project devel-
opment, expenditures by public bodies would be required to meet the costs
of continuing project activities at the same level and or replacing equip-
ment acquired during the development period. The project is also expected
to give rise to public revenues in the form of trading profits for GPMB,
export taxes on groundnuts and indirect taxes on expenditures by project
farmers out of their increased incomes. In addition, of course, Government
would have to meet the debt service on the IDA credit and the BADEA loan.
55.       The project's cash flow indicates that if groundnut prices remain
at the low levels predicted producer price supports would require a draw-
down of GPMB reserves of some US$1.5 million over the period 1978-1982,
with a peak of US$0.6 millLon in 1980. Fertilizer subsidies would cost a
further  US$0.2 million. On a nationwide basis, Government's price support
and fertilizer subsidy policies would require a net drawdown of US$9-10 mil-
lion in GPMB's reserves by 1982. These reserves now amount to about US$35
million and could easily support this burden in the event that the world
market price remained depressed throughout this period. Taking the ten-year
period 1976-1985, the project shows a cumulative cash flow of some US$2.4
million before debt service and US$0.9 million after debt service. Thus its
implementation would not cr:eate an insupportable burden on the resources of
the Government and participating public agencies. However, in view of the
continuing uncertainty of the world price for commodities input and output
prices must be kept under constant review. The Government would discuss each
year with the Association price policies for paddy, rice, groundnuts and
fertilizer [Section 4.06 of the draft Development Credit Agreement].
Conclusion, Recommendations and Loan Conditions
56.       The proposed proJect is economically and technically sound and seeks to
improve the standards of living of large numbers of rural people who are poor by
any standards.  The risk that the project will fail to achieve its objectives is
moderate and depends princi:pally on the Government's ability to manage the various
components of the project. To strengthen Government's planning and coordinating
ability, the project would provide a Project Coordinator and his staff within
MANR and would upgrade and expand its field organization and facilities.

PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
57.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
The Gambia and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee pro-
vided in Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed
credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
58.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Annex IV, Section
III. An additional condition of effectiveness would be the signing of
co-financing agreements with U.K. and RADEA. A condition of disbursement
of funds for livestock marketing development would be the establishment
of LMB under competent management and on sound legal and financial bases.
59.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
60.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

B.   Projects in Execution
Cr. No. 187     Banjul (formerly Bathurst) Port Project; US$2.1 Million
Credit of May 26, 1970; Effective Date: August 14, 1970;
Fully disbursed.
Supplementary Credit of US$2.4 million of April 1, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
This project consists mainly of the replacement of an old berth
and the repair of an existing wharf. It also provides for purchase of a
dredger and other equipment, and for engineering and consulting services.
The project experienced a cost overrun on civil works, explained
by the fact that (a) appraisal was based on preliminary engineering; in
the course of completing final engineering, quantities needed had to be
increased; and (b) there was a sharp increase in the cost of building mate-
rial between the times of appraisal and tenders.



ANNEX II
Page 2
On March 26, 1974, the Board approved a supplementary IDA Credit
of US$2.4 million to finance the cost overrun. Total project cost has in-
creased from US$2.4 million to US$5.3 million; correspondingly, IDA financ-
ing has increased from US$2.1 million to US$4.5 million.
The project has been progressing satisfactorily; however, the
closing date has beer postponed from December 31, 1975, to December 31,
1976, to allow more time for completion.
Cr. No. 333     Agricultural Development Project; US$1.3 Million
Credit of September 29, 1972 ; Effective Date: April 20, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The project has developed irrigated rice production along the
Gambia River. The physical progress of the project has been quite satis-
factory with over 1,600 acres of land developed for irrigation up to the
end of 1975. It is estimated that a further 325 acres will be developed in
the first half of 1976; therefore, the closing date has been postponed from
June 30, 1976 to December 31, 1976.
Cr. No. 602     Infrastructure and Tourism Project; US$4.0 Million Credit of January
12, 1976; Effective Date: May 11, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The project would provide: tourism infrastructure, including
access and secondary roads in the tourism area, extension of telecommunica-
tions facilities, sewerage services in the resort sites, public, market and
food storage facilities, and a hotel training school; public utilities dev-
elopment, including expansion and improvement of the electric power and
water supply systems in the Banjul/Kombo St. Mary area, equipment to convert
existing electricity generators to use heavy fuel oil and construction of
a fuel oil reservoir; a program to promote tourism investment and three
studies, one on the socio-economic impact of tourism, one on the feasibil-
ity of using groundnut shells to generate electricity and one on the man-
agement and tariffs of Gambia Utilities Corporation; and technical assistance
to strengthen Gambia Utilities Corporation (GUC). The credit is not yet
effective.

Rural Development Project
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:               Republic of The Gambia
Amount:                 US$4.1 million
Terms:                  Standard
Co-lenders:            United Kingdom through Overseas Development
Ministry and the Arab Bank for Economic
Development in Africa.
Project
Description:            Over a four year period, the project aims to
increase the cereal and cash crop production
and livestock husbandry of some 48,000 people,
living in 65 selected villages (2,200 compounds).
Increased production would be achieved through
better-coordinated and strengthened government
services, improved communications and marketing,
and the introduction of proven package programs
for crop production. Project implementation
would be through existing agencies and depart-
ments of the Government, with project actions
being coordinated by a Project Coordinator
located in the Ministry of Agriculture and
Natural Resources and responsible to the
Permanent Secretary. The main components
would be:
(a)  strengthening of the agricultural exten-
sion service by upgrading Government-oper-
ated centers for extension activity and
farmer training; constructing housing and
offices, improving field supervision; and
establishing a training center and visual
aids center for extension workers;
(b) improving livestock production by expanding
animal health campaigns through the provision
of vaccines, drugs, equipment, transport and
itraining for field staff; better utilization



ANNEX III
Page 2
of dry-weather grazing through the provision
of water and stock routes; introduction of
better livestock husbandry through the provi-
sion of staff and a pilot cattle fattening
program; and the construction of a limited
number of cattle markets, stock routes and
holding grounds;
(c) supplying farming inputs as credit in kind
to farmers (fertilizers, seed, draught oxen
and implements) through a strengthened and
better trained cooperative movement. The
establishment of a Seed Multiplication Unit
would ensure seed supplies to farmers and
agricultural research services would also
be expanded;
(d) improving crop marketing through the con-
struction and improvement of cooperatively_
owned produce markets and the development
of a limited number of crop extraction
roads;
(e) ensuring coordination of project implementa-
tion by providing a Project Coordinator and
supporting staff;
(f) aiding the introduction of improved agricul-
tural practices to illiterate farmers through
a pilot functional numeracy program; and
(g) providing funds for the preparation of a sec-
ond phase agricultural project; for a feasi-
bility study of developing a potential rice
growing area, the Jakhaly Swamp; and for a
study in methods of improving groundnut
marketing. The result of this last study
would be reviewed by the Government and such
of its recommendations as are acceptable to
the Government and the Association would be
promptly implemented.
Estimated Cost:
The estimated cost of the project, net of taxes, is US$11.7 million
with a foreign exchange component of US$6.9 million. Details are given below:
