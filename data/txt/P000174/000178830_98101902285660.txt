INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMIIENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR A DEVELOPMENT BANK PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Burundi for the equivalent of US$3.4
million on standard IDA terms to help finance the foreign exchange require-
ments of the National Economic Development Bank of Burundi (BNDE) during
1977-1979. US$3.0 million of the proceeds of the credit would be relent
to BNDE at an interest rate of 5 percent per annum for a period conforming
substantially to the aggregate of the amortization schedules of BNDE's sub-
loans. The balance would be made available to BNDE as a grant to finance
technical assistance.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last economic report on Burundi (504a-BU) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on January 14, 1975. This was followed by an
economic memorandum (885a-BU) distributed on October 24, 1975. An updating
economic mission is scheduled for June, 1977. Country data are provided in
Annex I.
3.        On November 1, 1976, the Army dismissed the regime that had been
in power since 1966 and suspended the Constitution. A new Government was
appointed, and it has stated that it will pursue policies of sound economic
management and national unity in respect of ethnic and regional differences.
Project implementation and the preparation of new development projects are
being accelerated.
4.        Burundi is one of the 25 least developed countries as defined
by the United Nations. It has a per capita income estimated at US$100 in
1975. Over the past five years GDP has grown by no more than 2 percent
annually in real terms. Of a population of 3.7 million, only 115,000 are in
wage employment; the remainder depends mainly on subsistence agriculture. The
agricultural labor force is largely untrained, and the level of enrollment in
formal education is one of the lowest in Africa.
5.        The economy is dominated by the agricultural sector.   Food crops
account for over half of GDP; other crops, of which coffee remains by far
the most important, account for a further 10 percent. In the 1974/75 coffee
season, production reached a record of about 28,000 tons, 35 percent higher
than the preceding year. The large harvest combined with a higher producer
price resulted in a 62 percent increase in farmer incomes derived from coffee
with consequent multiplier effects in both industry and services. Production



- 2 -
in 1975/76 fell sharply to about 15,000 tons adversely affecting rural incomes,
but in 1976/77 increased to 20,000 tons yielding about US$50.0 million of
export revenues as a result of the markedly higher coffee prices in the world
market following the frost damage of Brazil's coffee trees. Farmers' income
improved when the Government adjusted the producer price from BuF 39 per kg
in 1975 to BuF 64 per kg in 1976.
6.        Burundi has become increasingly dependent on coffee for foreign
exchange earnings; the share of coffee in total exports rose from 79 per-
cent in 1965 to 87 percent in 1975. The higher coffee prices have greatly
strengthened Burundi's balance of payments. By the end of 1976, reserves
stood at a level equivalent to about eight months of merchandise imports.
Rising import prices, combined with increased internal demand, caused, how-
ever, a record 23 percent jump in the cost of living index for low income
urban families during the year ended March 1975. Since then price increases
have been moderate.
7.        The level of investment has remained consistently low, averaging
only 8 percent of GDP between 1970 and 1975. Domestic savings have amounted
to only 5 percent of GDP over the same period, approximately equal to net
capital inflows. Close to half of total gross capital formation was financed
by external aid.
8.        Due to higher coffee prices, government revenues in 1974 were 14
percent above the level attained in 1973, while current expenditures grew
at only 9 percent. Thus, the Government's budgetary savings as a per-
centage of total Government investment increased from 13 percent in 1973
to 28 percent in 1974. In 1975, expenditures increased 10 percent whereas
revenues remained static, giving rise to a small current budget deficit.
9.        Burundi faces a formidable set of disadvantages, including
excessive dependence on coffee as the single export for foreign exchange,
long and inefficient transport links for external trade, rudimentary in-
frastructure, and a largely untrained labor force. In the past, civil
strife has disrupted development and diverted resources. The lack of a
coherent development strategy was an obstacle in overcoming these defi-
ciencies. In the past year some encouraging measures have been taken
to address these problems. A Ministry of Planning has been established,
improvements are being made in financial administration and a number of
agricultural projects are under preparation. The Ministry of Planning,
whose staff is being strengthened with IDA assistance, has embarked on the
preparation of a comprehensive development plan and is initiating and moni-
toring new projects and coordinating external aid.
10.       The short term prospects for the economy are favorable, as coffee
prices are expected to remain at substantially higher levels than before
1976. In the longer term, if the Government continues to focus on develop-
ment and strengthen its administration, it may achieve steady, albeit
slow, improvement in per capita incomes. If mining of Burundi's nickel
deposits proves feasible the prospects over the next ten years would be



- 3 -
much better. However, although such a development appears technically pos-
sible, the commercial viability of exploiting these deposits has yet to be
established. Regional development in Central Africa will also be important to
Burundi's economy. On September 20, 1976 Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire signed a
convention establishing the "Economic Community of the Countries of the Great
Lakes". The Community, which has its seat in Gisenyi, Rwanda, aims interalia
at stimulating and intensifying intra regional trade and cooperation in a wide
range of activities. Preparation of a regional power project and a cement
factory are underway and discussions are being held to facilitate the circula-
tion of persons and goods within the Community.
11.       Disbursments of official loans and grants have averaged US$16.7 mil-
lion p.a. during 1974-75, the main contributions coming from Belgium, the UN
agencies, IDA and the European Development Fund. Technical assistance has
accounted for about half this aid. In the 1971-75 period, total net foreign
capital inflows amounted to about US$70 million, of which US$57 million was
in grants. On December 31, 1975, Burundi's external medium and long-term debt
amounted to about US$14.6 million excluding undisbursed amounts. Of this the
Bank and IDA together hold 30 percent. Debt service averaged 4.0 percent of
export earnings during 1972-75, with the Bank Group receiving 26 percent of
all debt service payments. Due to the large grant element in external assis-
tance, the Bank Group will probably continue to hold a high proportion of
Burundi's debt as well as be the recipient of a large share of its debt
service. Notwithstanding the low debt service ratio, however, the country
because of its poverty is not able to absorb any borrowing on commercial
terms. External aid should finance a high proportion of total project costs,
including part of the local expenditures, and it should be on grant or very
concessional terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BURUNDI
12.       Since independence, eight credits have been made to Burundi, total-
ing US$30.7 million. The first credit for US$1.1 million, was made in 1966
for the rehabilitation and extension of Bujumbura's water supply system.
A credit of US$1.8 million was made in 1969 for the improvement of coffee
production by smallholders, followed by a second credit of US$5.2 million for
the same purpose in November 1975. The latter project is cofinanced by the
Kuwait Fund and Belgium in an aggregate amount of about US$1.8 million. A
credit of US$5.9 million for a highway maintenance project of 1974 was based
on an engineering and highway maintenance study financed with a US$380,000
credit of 1970. A Technical Assistance credit of US$1.5 million was made
in 1976 to help strengthen planning, statistical services and project
preparation and a US$6.0 million credit for a Fisheries Development Project
in 1976, to increase fish production in Lake Tanganyika and prepare rural
development projects. The Fisheries Project is cofinanced by a US$1.2
million loan from the Abu Dhabi Fund. A US$10.0 million credit was made in
April, 1977 to help finance a primary education project. Project execution



- 4 -
is generally satisfactory. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA
credits as of April 30, 1977 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.       The future lending program aims in particular at increasing agri-
cultural productivity to improve the nutrition and living standards of the
impoverished rural population. In September 1976, a mission visited Burundi
to discuss a possible rural development project including the establishment of
agricultural development centers in several parts of the country. The project
is being prepared by the Government of Burundi with assistance of our Resident
Mission in Eastern Africa. We will continue our assistance for expanding and
improving the road network, a prerequisite for rural development, and have
appraised a second road project in February, 1977. In addition, we expect
to expand our assistance to Burundi to improve primary and technical educa-
tion as well. We expect also to continue our assistance to improved planning,
project preparation and project implementation, and expect to provide funds
for project management and technical assistance in our lending operations.
Finally, we expect to provide further assistance to industrial development in
Burundi by supporting the activities of the Banque Nationale de Developpement
Economique.
PART III - INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT
Manufacturing
14.       Manufacturing in Burundi is at an early stage of development.    The
principal manufacturing activities include coffee processing, beer and soft
drinks, building materials, textiles, shoes and furniture. Most of the
enterprises are located in Bujumbura, the capital. About 4,000 people are
employed in manufacturing, generally less than 50 persons per unit. Thus
far investments in manufacturing have been modest, and averaged about US$1.5
million per year since 1972. In 1975, value added by the manufacturing sec-
tor amounted to an estimated US$23.5 million equivalent which accounted for
7.9 percent of GDP.
15.       The growth of the manufacturing sector is hampered by the overall
constraints to economic development in Burundi, in particular the limited
market resulting from the low purchasing power of the population, and the
high cost of transportation resulting from the inadequate road network.
Moreover, Burundi has a lack of accumulated capital and experienced per-
sonnel at all levels.
16.       The overall objectives of the Government's industrial develop-
ment strategy are to earn foreign exchange for its import needs and to
stimulate employment. It hopes to achieve these objectives by limiting
imports through import substitution and expanding the processing of agri-
cultural products. To this end the Government is actively promoting the
establishment of factories for the processing of rice and tea, and meat
and vegetables; it is also considering the construction of a flour mill,
a tannery and a textile factory, and the manufacture of agricultural tools



-5-
such as hoes and machetes. The production of pharmaceutical products, in-
secticides, bricks and ceramic tiles is also envisaged. Part of the financing
required for these projects is expected to be provided by the private sector.
Due to the limited number of Burundian entrepreneurs the Government encourages
foreign investment and management. The provision of foreign assistance for
this purpose should act as a catalyst for a thus far relatively sluggish
private sector.
17.       The Government promulgated an Investment Code in 1967.    Under it
investments exceeding US$34,000 equivalent for existing enterprises and
US$56,000 equivalent for new enterprises must be submitted for approval by
the National Investment Commission. The Commission is headed by the Vice
Minister in charge of planning and is authorized to grant tax advantages for
periods ranging between five and fifteen years depending on the significance
of the project to the national economy.
Tourism
18.       Burundi's natural features include picturesque Lake Tanganyika,
which borders the country from Bujumbura to its southern frontier with
Tanzania, and scenic mountains in the interior. These constitute good long-
term potential for tourism particularly if Burundi is integrated into East
African tourist circuits, but because of the country's limited infrastructure,
tourism has not been developed thus far.   The Government is anxious to
stimulate tourism and has plans to improve recreational facilities in the
capital and in the interior. It is also considering the opening of a wildlife
park. However, apart from a new hotel which is currently being constructed in
Bujumbura (see paragraph 31), these plans are not expected to be realized in
the near future.
Financial Environment
19.       The banking system includes the Central Bank (Banque de la Repub-
lique de Burundi), three commercial banks which are largely foreign owned
(Banque de Credit de Bujumbura, Banque Commerciale du Burundi and Banque
Belgo-Africaine), the Banque Nationale de Developpement Economique (BNDE),
the Government owned Savings Association, the Postal Checking System and
the Social Security Fund.
20.       The Central Bank formulates credit and monetary policies and man-
ages the country's international reserves. A primary objective of the Gov-
ernment's generally cautious monetary policy has been to keep the balance of
payments in equilibrium and domestic prices stable. These objectives have
been achieved.in that foreign reserves have steadily increased and price
rises have been relatively limited as compared to those of other African
countries. However, these cautious credit policies may also have contributed
to the fact that industrial development opportunities have not been not fully
exploited. Although the Government intends to maintain a conservative
approach, it will permit the Central Bank to expand credit facilities for
the development of the manufacturing sector.



-6-
21.       The Banque de Credit de Bujumbura was established in 1922 with a
share capital of FBu 75.0 million which is mainly Belgian owned. In 1976,
the Banque de Credit had outstanding loans, mainly on short-term, totaling
US$13.0 million equivalent. The Banque Commerciale du Burundi was established
in the early fifties, also with a share capital of FBu 75.0 million of which
51 percent is held by the Financial Corporation for Overseas Countries, a
company based in Geneva, 22 percent by the Government and 27 percent by local
investors. In 1976, the Banque de Credit had outstanding loans amounting to
US$24.5 million, mainly to finance coffee exports. The Banque Belgo-Africaine
was established in 1949 with a share capital of FBu 36.0 million of which
60 percent is Belgian owned and 30 percent held by the Government of Zaire.
The Banque Belgo-Africaine is mainly active in short term financing and in
1976, had outstanding loans totaling about US$4.5 million equivalent. The
only other major source of loan funds is the Savings Association established
in 1964. Its deposits totaled US$3.3 million equivalent as of September 30,
1976, most of which consisted of compulsory savings and term deposits of
civil servants and military personnel. Its activities concern mainly the
medium and long-term financing of housing and personal loans.
The Interest Rate Structure
22.       Interest rates in Burundi are generally low.   There is little dif-
ferentiation between interest rates on savings with varying maturity. Savings
deposits in the commercial banks and the Savings Association yield only 3
percent interest. The commercial banks have the possibility of investing
surplus funds in one year treasury bonds but their yield is only 4 percent.
23.       Short term loans by the commercial banks generally carry a 9 percent
per annum interest rate; if rediscountable at the Central Bank the rate varies
between 5.75 percent for export financing and 7.5 percent for other purposes.
Medium and long term loans which represent only 10 percent of total bank
credit are mostly extended by BNDE and the Savings Association. Interest
rates on these loans are even marginally lower than on short term loans and
vary between 5 and 9 percent. The weighted average interest rate for BNDE
loans is 8.3 percent for medium term and 8 percent for long term loans.
24.       The Government has kept interest rates for lending at a low level
as a means to stimulate investment and because at the present level of
Burundi's development a low interest rate structure is unlikely to distort the
pattern of resource allocation. It fears that because of the economic dis-
advantages of Burundi, in particular the small size of the market and the
limited number of feasible projects, higher interest rates would adversely
affect the financial rate of return on investments and thereby discourage
potential investors. These fears are not wholly justified as for several
projects under preparation, the financial rate of return has been estimated
at 20 percent or more. Moreover, it appears from discussions with local
entrepreneurs that the risks involved in industrial enterprises, in partic-
ular the uncertainty of access to regular supplies of raw materials and
equipment and the lack of skilled manpower, cause far greater concern than the
level of interest.



-7-
25.       In addition, the interest rates for lending are only slightly
higher than the rate of inflation in Burundi, which was about 7 percent in
1976 for consumer goods and is expected to remain at this level during the
next few years. Thus, to make interest rates for lending more positive in real
terms an upward adjustment of the present level seems justified (see paragraph
40 below).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Banque Nationale de Developpe-
ment Economique (BNDE)" (Report No. 1460-BU, dated June 10, 1977) is being
circulated separately. Following exploratory discussions with BNDE in October
1975, the project was appraised in October-November 1976. Negotiations were
held in Washington from May 31 to June 3, 1977. The Burundi delegation
consisted of Messrs. Jean Ndimurukundo, economic counselor at the Ministry of
Economy and Finance,and Bonus Kamwenubusa, President of BNDE.
Background
27.       BNDE was established in 1967 as a limited liability company to
assist in the economic development of Burundi by providing financing to
productive enterprises in the agricultural, industrial, artisanal and tourism
sectors and to housing. Its initial share capital of FBu 60 million has been
increased twice, lastly in 1975, to PBu 160 million or about US$1.8 million
equivalent. The Government and other Burundian public institutions are the
main shareholders with 45 percent of BNDE's share capital, followed by the
Deutsche Entwicklungs Gesellshaft and the (French) Caisse Centrale de
Cooperation Economique (each 16.5 percent), the Brasseries du Burundi (6.4
percent), the Banque Belgo-Zairoise, a commercial bank not operating in
Burundi (6.3 percent) and the three local commercial banks (9.3 percent
combined).
Management and Organization
28.       BNDE's Board of Directors consists of twelve members of which six
represent the Government and the public sector. The Caisse Centrale, the
three local commercial banks, the Brasseries du Burundi and the Banque Belgo-
Zairoise each occupy one of the six remaining seats. The Board members,who
are experienced executives,meet at least five times a year and have to approve
all loans made by BNDE. The Chairman of the Board is well qualified and
has been President of BNDE since 1970.



- 8-
29.       The President of BNDE is assisted by a Director-General presently
seconded by the Caisse Centrale. The Bank's three departments (Personnel,
Administration and Small Equipment Loans, Accounting and Loan Recovery,
and Industry, Handicraft and Housing Loans) are each headed by an Assistant
Manager. The BNDE staff of 38 employees is efficient and includes ten pro-
fessionals, three of whom are experts provided by foreign aid including the
Director-General, the Assistant Manager for the department of Accounting and
Loan Recovery and a technical assistant for organization and management.
30.       Although BNDE's management is competent, the current staffing
does not permit BNDE to make the necessary technical economic and financial
appraisals of industrial projects nor to play a promotional role in the
industrial sector. BNDE's appraisals of industrial projects, mostly small
scale enterprises, are presently carried out by the Industry Division of
the Ministry of Economy and Finance and are reviewed by BNDE. To enable
BNDE to play a leading role in the industrial expansion of Burundi, BNDE
intends to establish an Industrial Development Unit responsible for the pro-
motion, appraisal and monitoring of industrial projects. The Unit would be
staffed by two experts in engineering and industrial economics/financial
analysis, and their counterparts (Section 2.11 (a) and (b) of the draft
Project Agreement). It would cooperate with the Industry Division in the
preparation of feasibility studies and project appraisal. It would also
advise industrial promoters on project preparation and implementation.
The establishment of the Industrial Development Unit and the employment of
the two experts are a condition of credit effectivenesss (Section 6.01 (c)
and (d) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Policy Statement
31.       BNDE's objectives and its investment and financial policies are
stipulated in its Statutes and Rules of Procedure adopted at its establish-
ment in 1967. BNDE will consolidate these policies in a Policy Statement
(Section 2.10 of the draft Project Agreement) to which it will add the fol-
lowing statements: (a) BNDE will not accept the foreign exchange risk on
foreign borrowings; (b) BNDE's maximum intervention in any individual enter-
prise or project will be limited to 20 percent of BNDE's paid-up share capi-
tal and reserves; (c) BNDE's term debt will not exceed four times the total
amount of its unimpaired subscribed share capital, surplus and reserves, and
(d) BNDE will make provisions for losses on its portfolio. The adoption by
BNDE of a Policy Statement satisfactory to the Association is a condition
of credit effectiveness (Section 6.01 (f) of the draft Development Credit
Agreement).
Operations and Financial Results
32.       Between January 1971 and September 1976 BNDE approved 322 medium and
long term loans totaling about US$12.4 million equivalent, and four equity
investments amounting to US$300,000 equivalent. Forty seven percent of the
total amount of medium and long term loans and 89 percent of the equity invest-
ments were for two specific projects for which BNDE is acting as a financial



- 9 -
channel and supervising agency. The first project concerns the construction
of a hotel of international class in Bujumbura with funds made available to
BNDE by the African Development Bank in an amount of US$3.8 million equiv-
alent. The hotel would be owned by the Societe Hoteliere et Touristique du
Burundi, in which BNDE has also made an equity investment of FBu 23 million
(about US$250,000 equivalent). The Government holds 43 percent of the share
capital of the Societe Hoteliere, 32 percent is held by local private in-
vestors and 16 percent by foreign investors (mainly Italian). The second
operation concerns a Fisheries Project financed by the Abu Dhabi Fund for
Economic Development and an IDA credit (No. 626-BU; see Annex II) for which
BNDE is the designated intermediary for about US$3.0 million. Under this
project, BNDE has contracted to relend these funds to the Regional Develop-
ment Society (RDS), a parastatal agency which executes the project. The
repayment of principal and the payment of interest on BNDE's loans to the
Societe Hoteliere and RDS are fully guaranteed by the Government.
33.       Of BNDE's other loans, about US$3.7 million (or 29 percent) was
approved for small industrial enterprises and US$2.9 million (or 22 percent)
for housing. The relatively high portion of lending for housing is explained
by the fact that housing development was one of the first sectors in which
BNDE became active. The size of the average loan for industrial projects
was relatively small and amounted to about US$120,000 equivalent.
34.       About 5,000 short term loans totaling US$11.0 million equivalent
were approved during the same period. Most short term loans (about 4,500)
were for small equipment and were for limited amounts totaling about US$1.0
million. About 145 short term loans were for crop financing and accounted
for US$10.0 million or 90 percent of total short term lending.
35.       The quality of BNDE's loan and equity portfolio is generally satis-
factory. Arrears of US$124,000 affect about 24 percent of BNDE's total out-
standing portfolio, a relatively high figure. However, the risk of loss
is limited as most of the affected portfolio is for housing for which there
is adequate security. Net profits recorded between 1971-1975 have been low,
ranging between 1 and 4 percent of average equity (about US$30,000 in 1971
and US$69,000 in 1976), due mainly to BNDE's fixed administrative costs which
are high in relation to its assets. Profits on equity are expected to grow
progressively in the next few years as BNDE's loan and equity portfolio will
be increasing substantially while administrative expenses will grow more
slowly. BNDE's net profits are expected to increase to about US$280,000
equivalent in 1981 representing 9.2 percent of average equity, which is
acceptable. Administrative expenses are expected to decline from about 3.6
percent of average total assets in 1976 to a more acceptable level of 1.8
percent in 1980.
36.       In view of the expected increase in the size and number of its
operations, BNDE will prepare detailed procedures for project appraisal and
supervision. The adoption of such procedures, satisfactory to the Association,



- 10 -
is a condition of disbursement of the proceeds of the credit allocated to the
financing of subloans and investments (Section 2.03 (a) (i) of the draft
Development Credit Agreement). For all projects submitted to the Association
for approval, BNDE will calculate an internal financial rate of return and for
projects that are import substituting, it will also calculate an economic rate
of return (Section 2.02 (b) of the draft Project Agreement). Finally BNDE
will prepare a standard loan agreement regarding medium- and long-term sub-
loans. Approval by the Association of such a standard loan agreement would
be a condition of disbursement against subloans and investments (Section 2.03
(a) (i) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Prospective Operations and Resource Requirements
37.       BNDE's past activities have not been fully in line with its objec-
tives as a development bank. Initially, BNDE was mostly engaged in providing
financing for housing development, crop financing (mostly for coffee exports)
and consumer equipment, a function which is also partially being fulfilled by
the local commercial banks. This situation is explained by the fact that
because of Burundi's slow moving economy, development-oriented investment
opportunities for BNDE were limited. The Burundian authorities want to correct
this situation and use BNDE as an instrument for industrial development.
Since 1975, BNDE has been actively seeking investment opportunities and has
gradually built up a pipeline of projects for the next five years, including
about twenty medium to large projects, the total cost of which is estimated at
about US$36.0 million equivalent. About US$24.0 million or 66 percent would
be for large projects including recycling of metal scrap, the manufacture of
glass products and the processing of peat, flour and sugar. BNDE will also
continue to finance housing with funds solely provided by the Government for
this purpose. However, the share of BNDE lending for housing relative to its
total operations is expected to decline substantially.
38.       BNDE's financial requirements for the period 1977-78 have been
estimated at about US$10.0 million with a foreign exchange component of about
US$8.0 million. As of January 1977, BNDE had about US$1.0 million available
in foreign exchange. BNDE is negotiating with the Caisse Centrale de Coopera-
tion Economique, the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau and the European Invest-
ment Bank to obtain lines of credit totaling about US$3.7 million. The UN
Capital Development Fund has committed about US$280,000 to assist BNDE in
the development of small scale industrial enterprises. If these funds are
obtained, BNDE would still have a foreign exchange gap of about US$3.0 mil-
lion. The Central Bank has agreed to provide BNDE with the funds needed for
local cost financing.
Proposed Credit and Onlending Terms
39.       To cover BNDE's remaining estimated foreign exchange require-
ments, an IDA credit of US$3.4 million is recommended, of which an amount
not exceeding US$400,000 would be used to finance the cost of two experts
for the Industrial Investment Unit to be established within BNDE (see



paragraph 30). The IDA funds available for project financing would represent
22 percent of BNDE's foreign exchange requirements during 1977-78.
40.       As discussed in paragraphs 22-25, the Government of Burundi main-
tains interest rates at a low level as a means of stimulating investments
in industrial enterprises. After intensive discussion with the Government,
it does not seem feasible to achieve a substantial modification in the
country's interest rate structure at this stage. As a first step the interest
rate for medium and long term lending would be set at least at the maximum
level prevailing for short term loans and the proceeds from the proposed IDA
credit used for subloans and investments, therefore, would be relent by the
National Economic Development Bank at not less than 9 percent per annum
interest. This would be a modest increase over the current average interest
rate of about 8 percent for medium and long term financing. A further upward
adjustment can only be achieved following the revision of the entire interest
rate structure in Burundi and we intend to pursue our dialogue with the
Government on this subject.
41.       The Government would assume the foreign exchange risk.    In line with
its position regarding the level of interest rates, the Government feels that
this risk cannot be passed on to the ultimate borrower since it would discour-
age possible investors. However, BNDE's borrowers would be required to pay
the Government a fee of 1 percent per annum to compensate the Government for
assuming this risk.
42.       BNDE's maximum debt/equity ratio would be 4:1, which would be stipu-
lated in BNDE's Policy Statement (see para. 30; Section 3.04 of the draft
Project Agreement). Because of the increase expected in BNDE's lending activ-
ity, BNDE will need to increase its share capital in about five years to be
able to respect the maximum debt limit. To this end, BNDE will undertake
all action necessary to increase its authorized share capital when its
debt/equity ratio reaches the proportion of 3.5:1 (Section 3.06 of the
draft Project Agreement). From the computation of the debt/equity ratio
will be excluded all loans contracted and extended by BNDE which are fully
guaranteed by the Government of Burundi.
43.       The Government would onlend the proceeds of the credit to BNDE at
5 percent per annum interest, for a period substantially conforming to the
aggregate of the amortization schedules of the subloans. This would permit
BNDE a spread of 4 percent, sufficient to cover its administrative expenses
and the risks incur-red in its operations and to allow it to make a profit.
Amortization of each subloan would be over a period not exceeding 15 years
(Section 2.02 (d) of the draft Project Agreement). The free limit for in-
dividual subloans is US$100,000 equivalent, and US$1,000,000 in the aggre-
gate (Section 2.03 (d) of the draft Development Credit Agreement). The
technical assistance component of the IDA credit estimated at US$400,000,
would be made available by the Government to BNDE as a grant.



- 12
Auditors
44.       BNDE's accounts are presently reviewed by the Government's account-
ing office and one external accountant provided by a private shareholder.
This review does not meet Bank Group requirements in that it is not suf-
ficiently independent. However, there is no independent auditing firm in
Burundi. The Central Bank, which has been training a group of auditors,
has agreed to carry out BNDE's audits until such time as qualified independent
auditors will be available in Burundi.
Procurement and Disbursement
45.       Procurement will be handled through normal commercial channels.
Disbursements will be made against 100 percent of foreign expenditures of
imported items; 80 percent of expenditures in Burundi francs for goods
supplied from the territory of Burundi but previously imported through
normal trade channels and 65 percent of expenditures in Burundi francs for
civil work contracts. The credit is expected to be disbursed in about four
years.
Economic Benefits and Justification
46.       BNDE's impact on the economic development of Burundi has thus far
been limited; it has provided mainly term financing for agriculture crops,
housing and consumer equipment. Since about a year BNDE has been seeking to
expand its role in industrial development in conformity with its objectives
and has taken steps to reorient its activities in this direction. The pro-
posed IDA credit together with the contributions of other foreign aid institu-
tions, would assist BNDE in achieving its objectives and constitute an impor-
tant part of the foreign exchange needed for industrial investment. The proj-
ects proposed for BNDE financing would contribute substantially to conserving
foreign exchange revenues and stimulating employment. The technical assist-
ance provided by the credit to assist the Industrial Development Unit would
greatly improve BNDE's technical capabilities, improve the selection of
sound projects and provide developing enterprises with technical advice
regarding prospective investments.
Risks
47.       A risk of the project is that the planned operations would not
materialize as soon as predicted and BNDE would not be able to use a sub-
stantial portion of the credit for lending to productive enterprises during
the period of the project. For several of the development projects BNDE
intends to help finance, potential investors are still being sought. The
Industrial Investment Unit to be established by BNDE is expected to play
an important role to encourage such investors to assure that viable projects
will be undertaken. Naturally, it remains possible that Burundi's economic



- 13.-
disadvantages affect the profitability of such projects. However, the cur-
rent economic situation in Burundi is improving, in particular because of
the country's increased revenues from high coffee prices as a result of
which an increase in economic activity may be expected. In spite of these
risks, the project is well justified as the realization of the Government's
plans to stimulate industrial development could mean a substantial improvement
in Burundi's socio-economic climate which would constitute an important step
towards economic development.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Burundi and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Associa-
tion and the National Economic Development Bank, the Recommendation of the
Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agree-
ment of the Association and the text of a draft resolution are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.
49.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of Annex
III of this report.
50.       Conditions of disbursement are that a) BNDE would adopt detailed
procedures satisfactory to the Association for appraisal and supervision
of projects financed by BNDE and b) BNDE would adopt a standard Loan Agree-
ment for manufacturing and tourism projects satisfactory to the Association.
The following are additional conditions of credit effectiveness (Section 6.06
of the draft Development Credit Agreement): a) BNDE would adopt a Policy
Statement satisfactory to the Association; b) BNDE would establish an In-
dustrial Development Unit and employ an engineer and an industrial economist/
financial analyst for the staffing of said Unit; and c) the Borrower and
BNDE would sign a subsidiary loan agreement.
51.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.

development of the road sector and feasibility studies. The project is
co-financed by the UNDP (US$1.05 million for technical assistance), Germany
(US$1.33 million) and Belgium (US$400,000). Execution of the project is
generally satisfactory. Procurement of equipment is underway to mechanize

preparation of an integrated rural development plan for the coastal region
along Lake Tanganyika and the implementation of pilot development activities.
The project is cofinanced by a US$1.2 million loan from the Abu Dhabi Fund for
Arab Economic Development. Key staff has been recruited and project execution
is underway.

Terminal Date of Effectiveness: July 28, 1977

the reform of primary education. It aims at substantially expanding primary
school enrollments and improving equal opportunity for education. It provides
technical and material assistance to the Rural Education Bureau responsible
for the execution of the reform of primary education as well as for teacher
training. Although the credit is not yet effective, key staff is already in
