SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Banque Nationale de Developpement Economique (BNDE) was estab-
lished in 1967 to assist in the economic development of Burundi, to provide
loan and equity funds to agricultural, industrial and tourism enterprises
and to finance housing. The Government of Burundi and public institutions
own 45% of BNDE's share capital; the remaining 55% are distributed between
local private companies and foreign institutions.
ii.       The manufacturing sector which accounts for about 8% of GDP in
Burundi is still at an infant stage. There are about 70 manufacturing
enterprises above the handicraft level in the country, most of which are
located in Bujumbura. Obstacles to the development of the manufacturing
sector in Burundi include the low purchasing power of the population, limited
export possibilities, the -:hortage of competent and experienced personnel at
the managerial and technica levels, the non-monetization of a large segment
of the economy, the high cost of internal transport because of the poor con-
dition of the national road network. Despite these difficulties, the Govern-
ment is determined to promote the development of industry and agro-industry in
order to optimize the use of local resources, create employment and develop,
as much as economically feasible, import-substitution activities. Its main
objectives for the industrial sector are to develop the processing of agricul-
tural and mining products and manufacture tools and equipment to be used in
agriculture. The strategy is to integrate industry and agriculture through
the development of forward and backward linkages between the two sectors.
iii.      Tourism is almost totally undeveloped in Burundi, despite a few
natural attractions. It is hoped that with an adequate infrastructure the
country could attract some of the visitors to Kenya, Tanzania and the Kivu
area in Zaire. Hotel capacity suitable for international tourism is still
very low; it is, however, in the process of expanding with the construction
of a 150 room hotel in Bujumbbura. The Government is presently formulating
its tourism development strategy; current plans for the development of the
sector include the improvement and expansion of existing facilities in
various parts of the country.
iv.       BNDE which wants to play an active role in the development of the
manufacturing and tourism sectors is managed by a competent Burundi as
President assisted by a Director General seconded by the French Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE). BNDE which has been financing
mainly agricultural and housing development is not, at present, equipped to
undertake comprehensive technical, economic and financial evaluations of
industrial projects. Management has agreed to create within the institution a
unit in charge of industrial investments. This was confirmed at negotiations.
v.        Between 1971 and 1976, BNDE approved 322 long- and medium-term loans
and 4 equity investments for a total of BuF 1,168 million (US$13 million),
divided between tourism (1 loan and 1 equity investment in a hotel company



- vi-
accounting for 31% of approvals), industry (29%), housing (22%), fisheries
development (16%), agriculture and other projects (2%). During the same
period, BNDE approved short-term loans totaling BuF 985 million (US$11 mil-
lion), mostly for crop financing. As of December 1976, BNDE's total term
loan portfolio amounted to BuF 455 million. BNDE financial situation is sound
although its profitability has been modest. Its term debt/equity ratio which
has been less than 1:1 in recent years, is expected to increase significantly
because of the large term borrowings that the expected expansion of BNDE's
activities will necessitate. Given BNDE's good record and sound portfolio, a
debt/equity ratio of 4:1 is acceptable.
vi.       BNDE has a pipeline of industrial projects of which the total cost
is estimated at BuF 3.2 billion (including a large sugar project the total
cost of which is BuF 1.6 billion); BNDE's forecast investments in these
projects would amount to BuF 840 million (US$9.4 million). BNDE's total
approvals from early 1977 through the end of 1978 (including non-industrial
projects) are expected to amount to BuF 931 million (US$10 million), the
foreign exchange cost of which is estimated at BuF 699 million (US$8.0 million).
BNDE which, as of January 1, 1977 had BuF 69 million (US$0.8 million) available
in foreign exchange, expects to obtain lines of credit totaling BuF 355
million (US$4 million) from Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE),
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), European Investment Bank (EIB) and
the UN Capital Development Fund. This would leave a foreign exchange gap
of about US$3 million equivalent to be filled by the proposed IDA credit.
In addition, US$0.4 million IDA funds would be provided to help BNDE develop
its industrial project processing capabilities through recruitment of 2
expatriates for a three-year period.
vii.      Of the US$3.4 million proposed IDA Credit, US$3.0 million would be
on-lent by the Government to BNDE at 5% p.a. and US$0.4 million would be
passed as a grant to BNDE. BNDE would be charging at least 9% p.a. on its
sub-loans, which should not exceed a maximum period of 15 years. The foreign
exchange risk would be borne by the Government, against payment of a 1% p.a.
commission by BNDE's clients. The free limit for individual sub-projects
would be US$100,000 and the aggregate free limit US$1,000,000.



APIPRAISAL OF THE BANQUE
NATIONALE DE DEVELOPPEMENT ECONOMIQUE (BNDE)
]. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Banque Nationale de Developpement Economique was established in
1967 to assist in the economic: development of Burundi, to provide loan and
equity funds to agricultural, industrial and tourism enterprises and to
finance housing. An exploratory mission visited BNDE in October 1975 and
concluded that financial assistance to this institution for industrial
development might be warranted if the preparation of industrial projects for
BNDE financing evolved satisfactorily during the following months. As such
was the case, the appraisal oif BNDE took place during the fall of 1976. The
present report appraises BNDE for an IDA Credit of US$3.4 million.
1.02      The main objectives of the proposed credit are:
(i)  to provide financing on appropriate terms to industrial
investment projects in Burundi which are well conceived
in economic, financial and technical terms;
(ii)  to strengthen the  project appraisal capabilities and
internal organization of BNDE which is the only insti-
tution for the promotion and financing of industrial
investments in Burundi.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
The Economy
2.01      Burundi remains one of the poorest of the least developed countries,
with a per capita income estimated at US$100 in 1975. Over the past five years
GDF grew by no more than 2% arnually in real terms. Of a population of 3.7
million only 115,000 are in wage employment; the remainder depend mainly on
subsistence agriculture. The agricultural labor- force is largely untrained,
and the level of enrollment iIn formal education is one of the lowest in
Africa.
2.02      The economy is dominated by the agricultural sector, which contri-
butes about 60% of GDP. Burundi has become increasingly dependent on coffee
for foreign exchange earnings; its share in total exports rose from 79% in
1965 to 84% in 1974.
2.03      The level of investment has remained consistently low, averaging
only 8% of GDP over the last fiive years. Domestic savings have amounted to
only 5% of GDP over the same period. Close to half of total gross capital
formation was financed by external aid.



- 2 -
2.04      Burundi faces serious obstacles in its development effort, includ-
ing excessive dependence on a single export (coffee) for foreign exchange,
long and inefficient transport links for external trade, rudimentary infra-
structure, and a largely untrained labor force. In the past, civil strife
has disrupted development and diverted resources. Further, the terms of
trade have deteriorated 40% since 1970. There are, however, some encouraging
indications.  A new planning ministry has been created, improvements are
being made in the financial administration, and a number of promising indus-
trial and agricultural projects are under preparation (para. 5.03). Substan-
tial nickel deposits have also been found and may be brought into production
over the next ten years.
2.05      At present the Government lacks a coherent overall development
strategy. This is in part due to the low priority accorded planning in the
past. As a first step in addressing this problem, the Government has trans-
ferred responsibility for national planning to a new Planning Ministry to
which IDA is providing technical assistance.
2.06      The short-term prospects for the economy are favorable, as coffee
prices are expected to remain at substantially higher levels than before
1976 owing mainly to frost damage to Brazil's coffee trees. In the longer
term, if the Government focuses on development and strengthens its administra-
tion it may achieve steady, albeit slow improvement in per capita incomes.
If nickel mining proves feasible, the prospects over the next ten years would
be much better. However, although such a development appears technically
possible, the commercial viability of nickel mining has yet to be proved.
2.07      Inflation, as measured by the Bujumbura Consumer Price Index
increased from 4% in 1971 to 16% in 1974.
The Manufacturing Sector
2.08      The manufacturing sector in Burundi which is still at an infant
stage, suffered some setbacks since independence as industrial enterprises
which had been created in the country to produce goods not only for the local
market but also to serve Rwanda and the eastern part of Zaire lost these
markets. Some of these enterprises still have problems of excess capacity.
Burundi has tried unsuccessfully, in the past, to remedy this situation by
making commercial agreements with Rwanda and Zaire.  Finally it participated,
in September 1976, in the creation of the "Economic Community of the Coun-
tries of the Great Lakes" which comprises Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire, and
could open new opportunities for the development of industrial enterprises
in the area.
2.09      There are approximately 70 manufacturing enterprises above the
handicraft level in the country. Most of them are located in Bujumbura where
the infrastructure is more developed than in other parts of the country. They
employ a total of about 4,000 persons. The small size of the manufacturing
sector is indicated by the fact that only 60 enterprises in the sector employ
more than 50 persons. The principal existing manufacturing activities include:
coffee processing, beer and soft drinks, building materials, textiles, shoes
and furniture.



2.10      Data available on value added in manufacturing are as follows:

/1   Source:  1970 data:  National Accounts; 1975 data:  mission estimate.
2.11      Annual investment in manufacturing in Burundi amounted to BuF 43.5
million in 1972, 172 million in 1973, and 207 million in 1974. This low
volume of investment was mainly due to the lack of emphasis put on industrial
development, and the lack of project preparation capabilities in both the
Government and BNDE. As the result of improvements in these areas, indus-
trial investments in coming years are expected to sharply increase with the
planned undertaking of several large- and medium-scale projects.
2.12      The obstacles to the development of the manufacturing sector in
Burundi include the low purchasing power of the population, the shortage of
competent and experienced personnel at the managerial and technical levels,
the non-monetization of a large segment of the economy, the high cost of
internal transport because of the poor condition of the national road network.
Government Industrial Policies
2.13      The main objectives of the Government for industry as spelled out
in planning documents prepared for the period 1973-1977 are to develop the
processing of agricultural and mining products and to create enterprises for
the production of equipment and products to be used in agriculture. Projects
in the first category include a textile factory, a rice processing factory,
a tannery, a flour mill, tea processing factories. The second category of
projects include the production of insecticides and the manufacturing of hoes
and machetes which are the cultivation equipment mostly used in Burundi at
present. Other projects concern the production of pharmaceutical products,
bricks and ceramic tiles. Financing of industrial projects is expected to
be provided mainly by the private sector. Given the scarcity of Burundi



-4-
entrepreneurs, the Government has an open attitude regarding foreign invest-
ment and management, which are expected to contribute to the achievement of
industrial development goals.
2.14      An Investment Code was promulgated in 1967.  Investments by exist-
ing enterprises that exceed BuF 3 million (US$34,000) and investments by new
enterprises that are above BuF 5 million (US$56,000) must be submitted to the
National Investment Commission for approval. The promoter may also apply for
the advantages that can be granted under the Investment Code by the Investment
Commission. These advantages which vary according to the degree of significance
of the project for the economy include special tax treatment for periods of
five to fifteen years.  The Investment Commission headed by a representative
of the Planning Ministry includes representatives of the following ministries
and institutions: Economy and Finance, Labor, Internal Revenue and Customs,
the Central Bank and the Development Bank.
2.15      Imports are subject to authorization by the Central Bank.  Two types
of duties are levied on imports: a customs duty (0 to 10%) and a fiscal duty
(5 to 55%), both calculated on the c.i.f.value of the goods imported. Equip-
ment imported by new industrial enterprises is free from customs duties.
Exports are also subject to customs duties which are calculated either on the
f.o.b. value of the goods or on an estimated value determined by the Ministry
of Finance called, "mercurial value". Corporate taxes on net profit are
progressive as follows: 30% up to BuF 1 million of taxable profit and 40%
for such profit in excess of BuF 1 million.
2.16      Overall, the industrial policies followed by the Government appear
to be adequate. They have tended to favor the development not only of medium
but also of small-scale enterprises.
Tourism
2.17      Tourism is almost totally undeveloped in Burundi, although there is
some potential in that respect due to a few natural attractions and the coun-
try's proximity to Kenya, Tanzania and Zaire. The strategy for tourism de-
velopment is to include Burundi in tours through East Africa and to ask the
international tour companies to participate in the financing of new facilities.
At present, all tourist facilities are concentrated in Bujumbura and there is
no hotel of international class in the interior.
2.18      The main objective for tourism development is to expand hotel capac-
ity for international tourism in a few attractive locations. In particular,
a 150 room hotel, of high standard is being constructed in Bujumbura; also
it is planned to transform, modernize and equip one guest-house in Gitega
about 100 kms from the capital in the interior and one guest-house at Regha,
about 60 kms from Bujumbura on Lake Tanganyika. Improvements of recreational
facilities for tourists (nautical club, tennis courts, golf course) are also
planned. Total investments for tourist facilities improvements during the
1973-1977 period are expected to be of BuF 606.0 million (US$6.8 million).

The Financial Environment
2.19      The financial network in Burundi consists of the Central Bank
(Banque de la Republique du Burundi), three commercial banks (Banque de Credit
de Bujumbura, Banque Commerciale du Burundi and Banque Belgo-Africaine), all
largely foreign-owned, the development bank (BNDE), the Goverrment-owned
Savings Association, the Postal Checking System and the Social Security Fund.
The Central Bank (Banque de la Republique du Burundi)
2.20      The Central Bank formulates credit and monetary policies and manages
the country's international reserves. The major monetary instruments at its
disposal include individual ceilings to lending by commercial banks, discount
ceilings and agreements with the Government on public borrowing. Preservation
of balance of payments equilibrium and of domestic price stability is the
primary objective of monetary policy in Burundi. Monetary authorities have
been relatively successful in meeting these objectives: foreign reserves
have increased and prices in the past few years have risen at a slower rate
than in most countries. While these two objectives will continue to be
pursued, emphasis will be put in the future on stimulating economic growth.
2.21      The one departure from generally conservative monetary policies took
place in 1974 with a sharp acceleration of credit expansion coupled with a
major fall in net foreign assets which, during the period 1968 - 1973 had in-
stead increased in each year. Credit expansion in 1974 was largely motivated
by the need to reconstitute stocks of imported goods. In 1975 credit to the
private sector contracted sharply to offset a rapid increase in liquidity in
the economy, following a sharp rise in coffee revenues.
Commercial Banks
2.22      The Banque de Credit de Bujumbura was created in 1922 and was in
charge of issuing currency until 1952. It has one branch office in Ngozy, the
third largest city in Burundi. Its share capital which is majority Belgian-
owned amounts to BuF 75 million.  Total outstanding loans as of September
1976, amounted to BuF 1.2 billion, about 85% of which for short-term financ-
ing of imports and exports, short-term loans to other commercial banks and
working capital financing. The rest consisted of one-year treasury bonds
mainly, and medium-term financing of housing and industrial activities.
2.23      The Banque Commerciale du Burundi, created in the early fifties,
has a branch office in Gitega, the second largest town in the country. Its
share capital of BuF 75 million is 51% held by the Financial Corporation for
Overseas Countries (FCOC) 1/, a Geneva based company. The rest is held by
the Burundi Government (22%) and local investors (27%). As of September 30,
1975, outstanding loans amounted to BuF 2.2 billion, two-thirds of which for
1/   The major shareholders of FCOC are Banca d'America e d'Italia, Bank of
America, Banque Lambert, Banque Nationale de Paris, and Dresdner Bank.



- 6 -
export loans (mainly coffee) which were largely rediscounted at the Central
Bank. The rest was divided among import loans (20% of the total), working
capital financing (12%) and medium-term housing loans (1%).
2.24      The Banque Belgo-Africaine, created in 1949, has a share capital of
BuF 36 million, held by Standard Bank (30%), Banque de Bruxelles (30%), the
Zaire Governnent (30%) and foreign private investors (10%). It has no branch
office in the country. As of September 30, 1976 total assets amounted to
about BuF 0.4 billion, almost totally invested in short-term financing.
Term-Lending Institutions
2.25      Except for the very limited medium-term lending undertaken by the
commercial banks mainly in the housing sector, all term-lending operations are
undertaken by the Banque Nationale de Developpement Economique and the Savings
Association. The latter was created in 1964. It operates through two main
branch offices and nineteen post offices. Deposits as of September 30, 1976
amounted to BuF 300 million, about two-thirds of which in savings and term
deposits by civil servants and military personnel (for whom there is a com-
pulsory savings scheme) and private individuals. The resources of the Sav-
ings Association have been used to finance housing and personal loans, loans
to banking institutions and the purchase of treasury bonds.
The Interest Rate Structure
2.26      The interest rate structure in Burundi shown in Annex 1 is charac-
terized by (a) the low level of interest rates in general; (b) the limited
differentiation between the remuneration of savings instruments with different
maturities; and (c) the somewhat lower rates charged on medium- and long-term
credits than on short-term loans when they are not rediscounted.
2.27      The interest rate on savings deposits in commercial banks and the
Savings Association is 3%. One-month and one-year treasury bonds have yields
of 2% and 4% respectively. Although the latter rates are tax free, they leave
only a small margin to the commercial banks which may explain the limited role
played so far by these institutions in the mobilization of resources. On the
debit side, short-term loans by commercial banks carry an interest rate of 9%
plus commissions, except for rediscountable loans at the Central Bank for the
financing of exports which carry a maximum rate of 5.75% and other rediscount-
able loans which are made at a maximum rate of 7.5%. Medium- and long-term
loans which represent about 10% of total bank credit, are mostly extended by
BNDE and the Savings Association. Interest rates for this type of loan vary
between 5% and 9% with, in the case of BNDE, a weighted average of 8.3% for
medium-term loans and 8% for long-term loans.
2.28      In defense of this generally low interest rate structure, the
Burundi financial authorities argue that:
(a) Project opportunities in Burundi are limited and the rates
of return on most investments are low due to the small



- 7 -
size of the market, the limited endowment of the country
in natural resources, high transportation costs for raw
materials resulting from the country's landlocked position,
the very limited availability of skilled manpower and the
low purchasing power of most of the population.
(b) Not only is the number of feasible projects limited, but
the risks attached to each project are high. These
include the uncertainty of regular raw materials and
equipment supplies over long sea and land routes; wide
fluctuations in the purchasing power of the population
which depends largely on the coffee crop and world market
prices for coffee; the dependence on a few skilled laborers
in each factory whose absence could lead to a temporary
close down. Given this high risk element, potential in-
vestors require a return on their investment that compare
favorably with lower risk countries. Higher rates of
interest are likely to bring the financial rate of return
on equity below an acceptable minimum and therefore dis-
courage potential investors.
(c) There has been no need for more savings until now because
of limited project opportunities and the limited number of
people to realize them.
2.29      These arguments are not wholly convincing:
(a)  In spite of the obstacles to the fast development of the
industrial sector, a number of industrial projects total-
ling an estimated US$20 million investment are likely to
be submitted to financing sources in the next two years.
The financial rate of return on equity which has been
calculated for some of these projects is estimated to
be at least 20%. However, interviews with local indus-
trialists confirmed that the risk factor mentioned by
the financial authorities does play an important role in
investment decisions and that only projects with relatively
high rates of return are likely to be undertaken.
(b) Credit operations in the economy have been largely financed
out of deposits with the banking system. Moreover the
Central Bank has applied generally conservative monetary
policies, and its role has been limited to the financing
of the peak of the markéting of the coffee crop and some
Government expenditures. Nevertheless, inflation as
measured by the Bujumbura Consumer Price Index and the GDP
deflator increased from 4% and 2% in 1971 to 16% and 12%
in 1974, respectively. These inflationary tendencies
were fed in part by high revenues from coffee exports and
in part by the increase in the prices of imported goods.
An increase in interest rates would have helped the
financial authorities in their fight against inflation.



-8-
Also, it could have led to a larger mobilization of sav-
ings 1/ which, in turn, would have permitted a more
aggressive development policy on the part of the monetary
authorities.
2.30      From the foregoing and in view of the fact that inflation in com-
ing years is unlikely to fall below 6% - 8% p.a., there appears to be a good
case for an upward adjustment of interest rates in Burundi, to make the lend-
ing rate positive in real terms, without cutting unduly into the prospective
returns to investors.
2.31      During negotiations it was agreed that the part of the proposed IDA
Credit to be used to finance investments would be relent by BNDE to sub-
borrowers at a rate of at least 9% p.a. This represents only a marginal
increase over the average rate of 8.3% p.a. and 8% p.a. presently charged by
BNDE on medium- and long-term loans respectively, but it can be considered as
a first step in the right direction. A more rapid move would have been
energetically opposed by the Government.
III. THE COMPANY
Background
3.01      The Banque Nationale de Developpement Economique (BNDE) was created
in 1967, for the purpose of assisting in the economic development of Burundi,
to provide short, medium- and long-term financing to agricultural, industrial
and tourism enterprises and to finance housing.
Ownership
3.02      BNDE was established as a limited liability company with a share
capital of BuF 60 million subscribed by the Government and public institutions
(75%), and the three local commercial banks (25%).
3.03      In 1969, the share capital was raised to BuF 120 million with four
new shareholders subscribing as follows:  Deutsche Entwicklungsgesellschaft
(DEG) and Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE), BuF 20 million
each, Banque Belgo-Zairoise 2/ and the Breweries of Burundi, BuF 10 million
each.
3.04      In May 1975, a new share capital increase of BuF 40 million was
subscribed by the Government and the Central Bank, DEG and CCCE. The present
distribution of BNDE's capital is presented in Annex 2 and summarized below:
1/   Although they did not consider the interest rate as the most important
factor in determining the level of savings.
2/   A commercial bank which does not operate in Burundi.

Board of Directors
3.05      BNDE's Chairman and President is elected by the General Assembly
of shareholders from the Board members representing the State of Burundi.
BNDE's Board consists of twe'Lve members (Annex 3), six of whom represent the
Government and the public sector; CCCE and the three local commercial banks
have a representative each; the last two seats are allocated to the Breweries
of Burundi and the Banque Belgo-Zairoise. DEG is represented on the Board by
the Managing Director of the Banque Commerciale du Burundi. The Board which
meets five or six times each year and approves all loans made by BNDE has
been quite effective in guiding BNDE's operations.
Management
3.06      Mr. Bonus Kamwenubusa, an economics graduate from Fribourg University,
has been President of BNDE since March 1970. Before assuming this position he
was General Manager at the Ministry of Finance (1965-1970). He is assisted
since February 1973, by Mr. Langlet, Director General, who is seconded to BNDE
by CCCE. Mr. Langlet has been working for fifteen years with CCCE, most of
which time he has spent with development banks in which CCCE had equity par-
ticipations. In addition to the President and the Director General there are
three assistant managers. The management of BNDE is competent.
Organization and Staff
3.07      BNDE's organization chart is attached as Annex 4.  It comprises
three different units:
(1) personnel and administration; small equipment loans;
(2) accounting and loan recovery;
(3) loans to industry, handicraft and housing.



- 10 -
In addition, three assistants for project implementation and day-to-day opera-
tions report directly to the President and to the Director General.
3.08      BNDE's staff total thirty-eight, of which ten professionals (3
expatriates), including three economists/financial analysts, two accountants,
one construction engineer, one agronomist, one rural development specialist,
and one management analyst seconded by the UN.
3.09      The unit that deals with appraisal of loans to industry, handi-
craft and housing comprises only one professional.  BNDE is not, at present,
equipped to make comprehensive technical, economic and financial evaluations
of industrial projects. As a result, it had until now to rely for appraisal
of projects on the Industry Division in the Ministry of Economy and Finance;
such appraisals were reviewed by BNDE's management directly. To remedy this
situation and permit BNDE to play a leadership role in industrial develop-
ment and promotion in Burundi, BNDE's management agreed to create within the
institution a unit in charge of industrial project promotion, appraisal and
follow-up.  This unit, which should be in place by next fall, will be staffed
with two expatriates, an engineer and an industrial economist/financial ana-
lyst, plus counterparts. IDA is assisting BNDE's management in the recruit-
ment of the expatriates. The unit will cooperate with the Industry Division
in the Ministry of Economy and Finance to prepare feasibility studies and
pre-appraise projects; this unit will also assist promoters, both foreign
and local, in the preparation and implementation of projects. More informa-
tion on the proposed functions of the unit are presented in Annex 5. An
estimate of the costs of the two expatriates who should stay with BNDE for
three years is presented in Annex 6. To finance these costs, a technical
assistance component of $0.4 million has been included in the IDA Credit.
During negotiations it was agreed that BNDE will create the new unit and
recruit the two expatriates before the Credit becomes effective.
Policy Statement
3.10      BNDE's objectives and detailed operational policies are spelled
out in its Statutes and in its Rules of Procedures, adopted in 1967, the
year of its creation. These policies conform generally to those applied by
most DFC's. However, specific clauses dealing with the following matters
need to be adopted by BNDE: exchange risk on foreign borrowings not to be
taken by BNDE, BNDE's maximum intervention in any individual project to be
normally limited to 20% of its paid-up share capital and reserves, BNDE's
term debt not to exceed four times the amount of BNDE's unimpaired subscribed
share capital plus surplus and reserves, provisions for losses on investments
to be set up. During negotiations it was agreed that BNDE will consolidate
all its policies, including the new clauses, in a Statement of Policy (pre-
sented in Annex 7), to be approved by BNDE's Board before the IDA Credit
becomes effective.
Interest Rates
3.11      Interest rates charged by BNDE on industrial loans vary, depending
on: (i) the cost of the resources used to finance each specifie operation;



- il -
(ii) the guarantees provided by the individual borrower and (iii) the sound-
ness of the project financed. Minimum rates in each category are as follows:
(1)  medium-term loans (up to five years) rediscountable = 6%
to 8%; a commitment fee of 0.50% p.a. can be,but is usually
not charged;
(2)  medium-term loans non-rediscountable = 8% p.a.;
(3)  long-term loans = 8% p.a.
On the average medium-term loans to industry carry a 8.3% p.a. charge and
long-term loans carry a 8% p.a. charge. The rediscount rate charged by the
Central Bank on medium-term loans is 5% p.a. Long-term loans are not re-
discountable at the Central Bank. So far, BNDE has made a very limited use
of rediscounting by the Central Bank.
Procedures
3.12      (a) Appraisal.  So far, BNDE has not appraised itself industrial
and tourism projects but has relied on the appraisal reports prepared by the
Industry Division in the Ministry of Economy and Finance. This is largely
due to the fact that, as was said above, the company is not yet adequately
staffed to appraise these projects (see para. 3.09). On the basis of external
appraisal reports, short notes on each project are prepared by management for
the Board. At present, BNDE does not have detailed procedures for project
evaluation. During negotiations BNDE's management agreed to adopt such
procedures, satisfactory to IDA before disbursements on the IDA Credit start
(except on the technical assistance component of the credit). It was also
agreed that all projects submitted by BNDE to IDA for approval will include
the calculation of an Interna] Financial Rate of Return (IFRR) and that those
projects that are import-substituting will include the calculation of an
Economic Rate of Return (EROR).
3.13       (b) Follow-up.  Until now BNDE has not experienced any serious prob-
lems with loan collections. As a result follow-up of projects had not been
systematized and has been done mainly through Board membership in some of the
companies to which it has provided financial assistance. In view of the ex-
pected expansion of BNDE's activities, management recognized the need for a
comprehensive and systematic approach to project supervision and agreed to
prepare detailed procedures for follow-up of projects. During negotiations it
was agreed that these procedures, satisfactory to IDA, will be adopted before
disbursements on the IDA Credit start (except on the technical assistance
component).
3.14      (c) Procurement and disbursement.  BNDE's procurement and disburse-
ment procedures are adequate. BNDE does not usually require competitive bid-
ding but it makes sure that the promoter solicit offers from several suppliers
from which the promoter selects the most favorable. BNDE pays directly the
suppliers of goods or services, or refunds the promoter against presentation
of bills.

Legal
3.15      BNDE does not have a standard loan agreement for manufacturing
and tourism projects. During negotiations management agreed to prepare such
an agreement to be submitted to IDA's approval before disbursements on the IDA
Credit start.
Auditors
3.16      BNDE's accounts are reviewed by two accountants "Commissaires aux
Comptes". One of them is nominated by the Government and public institutions
and the other is selected by the other shareholders. One of the Commissaires
aux Comptes, a commercial banker, would probably be acceptable for the audit
of BNDE's accounts. However, he was reluctant to commit himself and asked
that other possibilities be explored.
3.17      During conversations with the staff at the Central Bank, the mission
learned that this institution has started training a core of auditors, which
is badly lacking in the country, and that the Central Bank might accept to
make the audit of BNDE as required by IDA. Such an arrangement appeared worth
trying as it would be expensive to bring auditors from outside Burundi, and
the quality of the audits would be kept under review by IDA. This idea was
tentatively explored with the Governor of the Central Bank, who agreed with
the proposal that the Central Bank perform BNDE's audits. During negotiations
it was agreed that the first audit of BNDE's accounts for the period ended
December 31, 1976 will be made by the staff of the World Bank during a supervi-
sion mission of BNDE, and by the auditors of the Central Bank thereafter.
IV. OPERATIONS AND FINANCE
Operations
4.01      Between January 1, 1971 and December 31, 1976, BNDE approved 322
long- and medium-term loans and four equity investments (Annexes 8 to 11 and
Annex 14) totalling BuF 1,168 million (US$13.0 million) in the following
sectors:

Total              280    1.119.6   98.2         27.4          1,147.0   98.2
Forty seven percent of total long- and medium-term loan approvals relate to
two projects. The first project (a loan of BuF 336 million) which was carried
out by BNDE at the request of the Government is the construction of a four-star
hotel in Bujumbura, in which BNDE has also made a BuF 23 million equity
investment representing about 9% of the hotel company share capital. Other
shareholders of the company include the Burundi Government (43%), private
local investors (32%), foreign investors (16%). The resources required to
finance the project were provided by the African Development Bank (ADB) with a
spread of 2% for BNDE. As the loan to the hotel company amounts to about
twice BNDE's share capital and reserves, which exceed considerably the limit
of 20% of paid-up share capital and reserves for commitment in a single
enterprise that BNDE will be required to apply under its revised Policy
Statement (para. 3.10), the Government has agreed to provide BNDE with
specific guarantees against payment default by the hotel company.
4.02      The second project (BuF 225 million) 1/ concerns an IDA financed
Fisheries Development Project; BNDE in this case relends IDA funds, which
it receives at 4%, to the Regional Development Society (RDS) at 8.5% for
the construction of project facilities and at 6% for credit to fishermen for
the purchase of equipment. The rest of BNDE's approvals was divided between
the financing of industrial projects (29% of total approvals), housing (22%)
and agricultural and other projects (2%). During the same period short-term
loan approvals amounted to BuF 992 million (US$11 million) mostly for crop
financing. The average loan to the industrial sector amounted to about BuF 10
million (US$112,000) which reflects both the size-structure of industrial

table above.

enterprises in Burundi and the emphasis put by BNDE on supporting small-scale
enterprises. These loans had maturities ranging mostly from 3 to 8 years.
4.03      More than 80% of the loans for industrial development were approved
in 1975 and 1976. The major industry subsectors financed by BNDE have been
chemicals (soap, insecticides, plastics, paints, drugs) which accounted for
38% of total industrial loan approvals since 1971; agro-industries such as
coffee processing, preserves and tannery (27%); metallurgical and mechanical
enterprises (14%); construction materials (12%) and mining (5%). The remain-
ing 4% concern mainly loans for the financing of transport, printing and
photographic equipment. Almost half of these loans (by amount) however were
for the financing of permanent working capital, a reflection of the landlocked
position of the country and the difficulties in obtaining regular shipments of
raw materials and intermediate products. The internal financial rates of
return on BNDE-financed projects are estimated to average 20%.
Resources
4.04      BNDE's resource position and borrowings as of December 31, 1976
are presented in Annexes 12 and 13.BNDE's local resources come mainly from a
long-term BuF 40 million Government deposit. BNDE also has access to redis-
counting by the Central Bank but has made only a very limited use of this
facility so far.  BNDE has already been successful in mobilizing foreign
exchange resources. It obtained in 1974 from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau
(KfW) a loan amounting to BuF 26 million, US$290,000 equivalent (15 years,
0.75% interest) for the financing of small-scale industrial projects. Also,
in 1975, BNDE obtained a loan from the African Development Bank (ADB) of
4 million units of accounts (US$4.8 million) for the financing of a four-star
hotel in Bujumbura (US$4 million) and industrial projects. This loan (6%, 18
years including 4 years of grace) is almost entirely committed. In 1973 and
1976 BNDE received small loans from CCCE for a total amount of about US$0.1
million to finance housing. Finally, BNDE is the intermediary selected by IDA
to channel a loan of BuF 255 million (4%, 15 years including 5 years of grace)
for financing project facilities and equipment for fishermen in the context of
a fisheries development project. As of March 31, 1977 no disbursements had
been made under this project. Except in the case of the small CCCE loans
mentioned above, the Government has taken the foreign exchange risk on all
BNDE's foreign borrowings at no cost to sub-borrowers.
Loan Portfolio
4.05      As of December 31, 1976 BNDE's total term loan portfolio amounted to
BuF 455 million, of which BuF 231 million or 51% were accounted for by the
Bujumbura hotel project. The rest included BuF 105 million (23%) for housing
loans, BuF 112 million (25%) for industrial loans and BuF 7 million (1%) for
loans in the agriculture and handicraft sectors.
4.06      Overall, the quality of BNDE's portfolio is satisfactory.  At the
end of 1976 arrears of more than three months amounted to BuF 11.1 million



- 15 -
which affected loans amounting to BuF 95.6 million, i.e. 24% of the
total outstanding portfolio, a relatively high figure. However, about three-
quarters of the affected portfo:Lio concern loans for houses where the risks
are minimal. For the rest, no specific provisions have been created so far
except for small equipment loans where provisions amount to 16% of loans
outstanding in this sector, which is considered adequate by BNDE's management
on the basis of past experience. Therefore, excluding housing loans, small
equipment loans (for which an adequate provision has been created), and the
Bujumbura Hotel loan, BNDE's portfolio affected by arrears over three months
was estimated at 13% of the total portfolio at the end of 1976. BNDE's
management has agreed to include provisions in operating expenses to cover
potential losses. The auditors will report on the adequacy of these provi-
sions.  In addition, a clause on provisions will be added to BNDE's policy
statement (see para. 3.10).
4.07      Only three loans have been rescheduled in the past three years.
In one case, payments are now up-to-date, while in the other two cases,
arrears are of less than three months and of principal only.
Equity Portfolio
4.08      As of December 31, 1976 BNDE held equity participations in four
companies for a total of BuF 26.7 million (Annex 14). These companies have
just started operations or are still under construction. The most important
(BuF 23 million) is in the four-star hotel presently being built in Bujumbura.
The three other participations, all small, are in an insecticide company, a
brick factory and a tannery.
Financial Situation
4.09      BNDE's summarized balance sheets for 1971-1976 are presented in
Arinex 15. BNDE's financial situation as of December 31, 1976 is sound, with
equity totalling about BuF 186 million and term borrowing amounting to BuF 276
million against a total term portfolio of BuF 455 million. The debt-equity
ratio is low at 1.5:1.
Financial results
4.10      BNDE's income statements for 1971-1976 are presented in Annex 16.
Between 1971 and 1976, net profits ranged between 1% and 4% of average equity.
This record of low profitability is mainly explained by the fact that first,
profitability has not been a primary consideration in setting up BNDE and
second, BNDE's asset base has remained small during this period in relation to
high fixed administrative costs. Also, BNDE's leverage has been very low
until 1976. Gross revenues averaged 9% of average total assets, while average
financial charges amounted to only about 1% of average total assets. About
70% of the difference was absorbed by administrative costs, while the rest was
accounted for by specific provisions, depreciation charges and a small profit.
Financial results measured by profit on equity will progressively increase in
the coming years as a result of: (i) the high increase in BNDE's portfolio,
while its administrative expenses will rise only moderately, (ii) BNDE's
increasing leverage, and (iii) BNDE's slightly higher average interest rate.

V. PROSPECTS
Business Outlook
5.01      The obstacles to the development of the industrial sector in Burundi
are numerous. They include the narrowness of the domestic market, high trans-
portation costs due to an inadequate road network, the lack of entrepreneurs
and trained personnel, the low level of individual incomes and the fact that
a large proportion of the population is in the subsistence sector. However,
the Government is determined to promote the development of industry and agro-
industry in order to optimize the use of local resources, create employment
and develop, as much as economically feasible, import-substitution activities.
BNDE wants to play a significant role in such development.
The Company's Strategy
5.02      The major external constraints that BNDE faces in its role as devel-
opment bank have been mentioned earlier in this report (para. 2.12). Given
the peculiarities of the Burundi economy, BNDE faces a major challenge to
play an active and efficient development role. BNDE's management is com-
mitted to changing BNDE's activities and role from a traditional financial
intermediary mainly dealing with housing and consumer loans to a truly devel-
opment-oriented institution.  In this respect, the establishment within BNDE
of an industrial investment unit is a necessary prerequisite.
Forecast Operations
5.03      BNDE's project pipeline as of December 31, 1976 is presented in Annex
17. It includes about 20 projects of medium to large size, plus an additional
10 small projects to be financed each year. Projects in the pipeline are in
the following subsectors:  flour and sugar manufacturing, vegetable and meat
processing, peat, glass, metal processing; in addition, there are projects in
tourism. Total investment costs of these projects amount to BuF 3.2 billion
of which BNDE would provide BuF 840 million. These projects are expected to
start operations within a year or two after loan approval. Their foreign cost
component is expected to vary between 25% and 70%. The sugar project for
which BNDE is expected to provide financing of BuF 170 million, of which
BuF 150 million in loans and BuF 20 million in equity investment will require
special guarantees as BNDE's exposure in this project will exceed by a wide
margin its normal limit of involvement in a single project. BNDE will continue
to finance specific housing development programs with resources to be provided
by the Government for that purpose. The IDA funds will not be used to finance
housing. Although most projects in BNDE's pipelines are at a fairly advanced
stage of preparation, there is always the danger of delays in implementation
due to the numerous constraints that affect Burundi's economy (para. 5.01).
5.04      BNDE's projected operations during the next five years are presented
in Annex 19. Approvals in the industrial sector are forecast to increase from
BuF 120 million in 1976 to more than BuF 300 million in 1980, on the basis of
BNDE's project pipeline. Other operations in BNDE's traditional field of
activities have been assumed to progress moderately at about 10% per year.

Resource Gap (US$3 million equivalent)         -            275          275
5.06      BNDE's requirements during this period are expected to amount to
BuF 931 million (US$ 10.4 million), the foreign exchange cost of which is
estimated at BuF 699 million (US$7.8 million). BNDE which, as of January 1,
1977 had BuF 69 million (about US$0.8 million) available in foreign exchange,
expects to obtain lines of credit from CCCE, KfW, EIB and the UN Capital De-
velopment Fund, amounting to about BuF 355 million (US$4 million), leaving
a foreign exchange gap of about US$3 million equivalent. An IDA Credit of
US$3 million to cover this gap would represent about 30% of BNDE's total re-
quirements during this period and about 40% of its foreign exchange require-
ments. The Central Bank has agreed to provide BNDE with the resources needed
to finance the local cost component of its investment projects at the normal
rediscount rate for industrial loans, presently 5%. This was confirmed by the
Government at negotiations.

Financial Projections
5.07      BNDE's projected income statements, balance sheets, cash flow
statements and their underlying assumptions are provided in Annexes 18 to
22. BNDE's past and projected financial ratios are presented in Annex 23.
The company's net profits are expected to progressively increase from BuF 6
million in 1976 to BuF 25 million in 1981 or from a low 3.4% to an acceptable
9.9% of average equity. This improvement in profitability is due mainly to
the expected higher return on portfolio resulting from the projected increase
in operations and the increase in average interest rates. In view of BNDE's
expected increase in operations and large technical assistance for the next
three years, administrative expenses are projected to decline from a high
3.4% of average total assets in 1976 to 1.8% in 1980, while financial charges
will increase from 2.9% of average total assets in 1976 to 4.6% in 1980, as
a result of BNDE's increased leverage. BNDE's total assets are expected to
increase from BuF 556 million in 1976 to BuF 2.0 billion in 1981, reflecting
the envisaged growth of BNDE's operations.
Term Debt/Equity
5.08       In recent years, BNDE's term debt/equity ratio was less than 1:1
and at the end of December 1976 it was only 1.5:1. With the forecast signifi-
cant development of BNDE's activities in the industrial sector and the neces-
sarily larger term borrowings that it entails, the total debt/equity ratio is
expected to increase to 4.7:1 in 1978. However, when borrowings of BuF 390
million from the African Development Bank and BuF 255 million from IDA and
Abou Dhiahi(Fisheries Development) are excluded, the ratio reaches 3.9:1 at
the end of 1980. Repayment to BNDE of loans made from these resources is
guaranteed by the Government. During negotiations it was agreed that as
soon as the debt/equity ratio reaches 3.5:1, BNDE will take appropriate
measures to increase its share capital so as to maintain the ratio within
the agreed limit of 4:1.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      The objectives of the proposed US$3.4 million IDA Credit are:
(i) to help fill a gap in the import financing requirements of this long-
term financing institution; (ii) to help BNDE establish a new department
in charge of industrial projects promotion and processing; and (iii) more
generally to strengthen the institution so as to help it play a major de-
velopment role in the Burundi economy.
6.02      The US$3 million included in the Credit for industrial investment
would be relent by the Burundi Government to BNDE, with a flexible amortiza-
tion schedule conforming to the aggregate amortization schedule of BNDE
subloans, none of which should exceed a maximum period of 15 years. The
Government would assume the exchange risk on the funds passed on to BNDE
against payment of a 1% p.a. commission by BNDE's clients. The free limit
for indiviacual subprojects would be of US$100,000 with an aggregate limit
of US$1,GOO,000.



- 19 -
6.03      The US$3 million proposed for industrial investment would finance
the c.i.f. cost of imported goods, the foreign component of goods purchased
locally and previously imported or of goods produced locally from imported
materials, and the foreign component of civil works.
6.04      This project does not present any special risk as compared to
other DFC operations. However, the environment and the peculiarities of
the Burundi economy make the task of BNDE a difficult and challenging one,
probably more than in many other countries.
6.05      To cover its administrative expenses, the risk incurred in its
operations and make a profit, BNDE needs a spread of about 4% on its borrowed
funds. As BNDE would relend the proceeds of the Cr`edit at a rate of 9% p.a.,
it is recommended that US$3 million of the Credit be relent by the Government
to BNDE at 5%. As regards the technical assistance component of US$0.4 mil-
lion (see para. 3.09) to cover the foreign cost of two expatriates for three
years, the funds would be passed on by the Government to BNDE as a grant.
6.06      During negotiations, agreement was reached and assurances were
obtained on the following main points:
(i) the creation within BNDE's organization of a unit respon-
sible for appraising industrial projects and for promot-
ing industrial investment in Burundi; the hiring of two
expatriates, an engiineer and an industrial economist/fi-
nancial analyst to staff the new unit (para. 3.09);
(ii) the adoption by BNDE"s Board of a Policy Statement con-
solidating in one document existing policies and includ-
ing four new operational policies dealing with the foreign
exchange risk, BNDE's maximum intervention in any single
enterprise as a percentage of its share capital, BNDE's
debt equity ratio and provisions for losses (para. 3.10);
(iii)  adoption by BNDE of procedures satisfactory to IDA, for
industrial project evaluation and follow-up; (paras. 3.12
and 3.13);
(iv) preparation by BNDE of a Standard Loan Agreement satis-
factory to IDA (para. 3.15);
(v)  calculation of an internal financial rate of return (IFRR)
for each project submitted by BNDE to IDA for financing
and calculation of an economic rate of return (EROR) for
those projects submitted that are import-substituting (para.
3.12);
(vi)  foreign exchange risk on borrowings to be borne by the
Government against payment of a commission by BNDE's
clients (para. 6.02).

BANQUE NATIONALE DE DEVELOPPEMENT ECONOMIQUE (BNDE)
Statement of Policy 1/
I.   OBJECTIVES AND GENERAL POLICY  (Article 3 of BNDE's Statutes)
1.        The main purpose of the Bank is to assist in the economic development
of Burundi. To that effect, it can:
(a)  Make short-term loans to cooperatives or companies in the agricultural,
handicraft or industrial sectors, within the limits authorized by its
general lending conditions;
(b) make loans with maturities of at least two years to any individual
or enterprises, public or private, provided they are to be used to
finance agricultural handicraft or agricultural equipment;
(c)  discount or accept commercial papers issued for the purpose of medium-
term credits;
(d) give guarantees;
(e) participate directly or on behalf of the State in the creation or
expansion of any enterprise;
(f) manage public funds;
(g) assist the Government and/or public institutions in the preparation and
implementation of plans and programs aiming at the economic development
of Burundi.
2.        The Bank is authorized to take all measures it will deem appropriate
to realize the above stated objectives. In particular:
(i) It can issue bonds, borrow funds, receive credits, loans or subsidies
from the Government and from institutions, public or private, national
or international;
(ii)  it will not accept deposits from private individuals or institutions;
(iii)  it can be active in the real estate and stock exchange markets, and
conduct all operations, civil or commercial, that are considered appro-
priate to further, directly or indirectly, the achievement of the Bank's
stated objectives.
1/ At present BNDE's policies are spelled out in its Statutes and its Rules of
Procedure.   These policies and those to be added (paras. 3,8,10,11,12) are
gathered in this document which will be approved by BNDE's Board as BNDE's
Statement of Policy.



ANNEX 7
page 2 of 3
June 1977
II.   INVESTMENT POLICIES
3.         The company shall extend its assistance on the basis of economic
and financial criteria only. Enterprises that submit projects to the company
shall be required to have efficient management, be technically sound, have
satisfactory market prospects for their production, be able to generate an
adequate financial return on the investment and generally to contribute to the
economic growth of the country in accordance with the objectives of the Govern-
ment's Development Plan.
4.    The loans granted by the Bank shall finance only part of specific programs
that have economic and social merits (Article 21 of the Rules of Procedure).
5.    The maximum maturities of loans granted by the Bank are as follows:
Short-Term          -  12 months;
Medium-Term         -   5 years ,
Long-Term           -  15 years ;
In practice the maturities on these various types of loans cannot exceed
the maturities of the resources obtained by BNDE to provide these loans (Article
25 of the Rules of Procedure).
6.    Loans to industrial enterprises can finance only part of the investment
prograns for which they are intended. The specific proportion on individual
projects is determined on a case by case basis.  However, it cannot exceed
twice the amount invested by the borrower from its own resources or from resources
that are either non-refundable or refundable after the loan from the Bank. The
contribution from the borrower must take place and be verified before the Bank
disburse funds. Moreover, all loans to industrial enterprises must be adequately
protected by "real" or personal guarantees. Mortgage on equipment, delegation
on fire or life insurance policies are considered only as "secondary" guaranteed
(Article 33 of the Rules of Procedure).
7.    At any moment, the cumultative amount of equity investments by the Bank
shall not exceed 15% of its share capital and reserves that are not earmarked
for any specific purposes. Each equity participation shall not exceed 10% of
the share capital of the enterprise in which the investment is made (Article 52
of the Rules of Procedure).
8.    The total amount of loans granted by the Bank together with its participations
and any other commitments of a financial nature in favor of a single enterprise
will not normally exceed 20% of the Bank's paid-up share capital and reserves.
This limit will be exceeded only in cases when and to the extent that the Govern-
ment will have guaranteed repayment to BNDE in case of default of the borrower.
(To be added).



ANNEX 7

June 1977
III. FINANCIAL POLICY
9.         The interest rate charged by the Bank shall include a margin of at
leaæt 2% above the cost of the resources used by the Bank to finance its
loans. However, for loans to public institutions the margin shall not exceed
1% above the cost of the resources (Article 53 of the Rules of Procedure).
10.        The Bank shall not incur the foreign exchange risks on its borrowings.
Such risk will be assumed by t]he Government or by the borrower. (To be added).
11.        The Bank's total debts of more than one year, including guarantees,
shall not at any time, exceed four times the amount of its unimpaired subscribed
share capital plus surplus and reserves. Debts, for the purpose of this ratio,
will not include BNDE's borrowings that are guaranteed by the Government and
which have been on-lent to enterprises for which the Goverinment guarantees repay-
ment to BNDE if they are in default. (To be added).
12.        The Bank shall set up adequate provisions against losses, the level of
which will be based on the quality of the lbans outstanding. (To be added).
