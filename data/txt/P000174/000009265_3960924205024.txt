(Credit 731-BU)
PREFACE
This report presents an evaluation of Credit 731-BU, which is
the only IDA credit to Banque Nationale de Developpement (BNDE) of
Burundi. The credit was approved in July 1977, signed in Se.ptember 1977
and declared effective in April 1978. The original terminal date for
submission of subloan applications was exterded twice. The closing date
was extended once from December 31, 1981 to December 31, 1983. The Credit
was fully disbursed except for a cancellation of US$124,000.
The Bank's Eastern and Southern Africa Regional office has
'repared this report on the basis of information contained in the Staff
Appraisal Report, a review of Bank files including supervision and progress
*     reports and information gathered during a project completion mission.   The
report prpsents a factual review of BNDE's use of the credit proceeds and
of its institutional development between 1977 and 1986, especially within
the context of the financial and industrial sector environment at the time
of project execution.
The Project Completion Report was sent in draft form to the
Borrower for their comments, but none was received.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

(Credit 731-BU)
HIGHLIGHTS
This report covers the experience under Credit 731-BU, a line of
credit for US$3.4 million, which was IDA's only operation to Banque
Nationale de Developpement (BNDE). The main objectives of the Credit were
(a) to provide financing on appropriate terms for investment projects which
were well conceived in economic, financial and technical terms; and (b) to
strengthen the project appraisal capabilities and internal organization of
BNDE, wAhich was then the only institution for the promotion and financing
of industrial investments in Burundi (para. 1.05).
BNUE's performance in achieving the institutional objectives of
Credit 731-BU was reached only marginally and especially the implementation
of procedures was weak. Ample areas for further institutional improvement
were identified during the course of project supervision and lessons to be
learned for possible future operations were brought to light (para. 3.06).
Disbursements under the line of Credit 731-BU started more slowly than
expected but, in 1979-1980, picked up momentum. They were completed with 2
years of delay as compared to appraisal estimates (para. 4.01). The
technical assistance component of US$0.4 million, which covered the foreign
cost of two expatriates for three years and which was passed on by the
Government to BNDE as a grant, was disbursed on time but had only mixed
results (para. 3.09).
A total of 24 subprojects were financed under the credit, with an
average subloan size of US$13,0'00, ranging between US$5,000 and
US$890,000. About one fifth (5) of all subloans were above the free limit
of US$100,000. The remaining 19 subloans included 2 projects slightly
below the free limit and 17 SSE projects, mostly between US$5,000 and
25,000. Out of the total of 24, eighteen subloans went to new enterprises;
the rest went to expand or improve installed capacity. Most subprojects
were launched in 1980-1981, but the majority suffered substantially during
the period of economic difficulties which followed. In the process, one
third of the SSE subprojects were abandoned by their promoters. Out of the
5 projects above the free limit, one was declared Dankrupt and another one
was inactive for 3 consecutive years (paras. 4.01-4.05).
The overall parformance of the subprojects was discouraging,
although some had positive results. Thirty percent of the projects below
the free limit are just about breaking even, another 30% are operating with
losses whereas the remainiag 40% are abandoned or in receivership. The
situation of the larger, above free-limit projects is slightly better. A
detailed ex post analysis of subproject performance was constrained by
lack of data availability. Except for 3 reasonably performing projects
above the free limit, all other IDA subloan recipients were in arrears at
the time of the completion mission (para. 4.03).



BN1L', on the other hand, made some progress in institutional
development during the 6 years ef credit implementation. The project was
an important factor in establishing some basic standards and procedures,
especially through loan requirements and IDA supervision, including
subproject reviews (paras. 3.05-3.11).
Despite some modest improvements on the inst!tutional side,
there are still several problem areas in BiNDE. First, debt recovery
procedures are still lax, and the political and legal environment continues
to hamper debt collection efforts. As a consequence, BNDE's loan arrears
have increased in the past few years to a still moderate 13% of total loan
portfolio but affected more than half of it. Second, supervision
activities are limited in scope and results becaus. of little interest and
cooperation on the client's side. Third, poor data management at the
working level (except for the accounting function, which works well)
cor.tinues to hamper BNDE's managerial decision making process (paras. 3.11(ii),
506, 5.07).
In addition, BNDE's overall performance remains constrained due
to a number of exogenous factors including: (a) the difficult economic
environment; (b) Burundi's limited investment opportunities; (c) existence
of external pressures on BNDE to finance projects of dubious viability; and
(d) lower interest rates charged by competitors with ready availability of
foreign exchange, which made it difficult for BNDE to utilize IDA funds
(final interest cate to clients was up to 3 percentage points higher than
that charged for medium-term funds by commercial banks). As a result of
the above, and in spite of the adoption of a strategy statement emphasizing
the priority of industrial activities and the need to have an active
promotion policy, BNDI could increase its activity in the industrial sector
rather than continue to be invol-ed in a number or activities such as
mortgage financing, coffee crop financing and making consumer oriented
loans, which are only marginally related to its role as a development
bank (paras. 5.04, 6.01).
During the life of the credit, BNDE's financial performance
deteriorated slightly. Net profits declined in both absolute and relativA
terms, and never exceeded 3% of average equity. While BNDE's asset base aad
the administrative costs have more than tripled between 1977 and 1983, net
profits fell below the 1976 level. The resulting low profitability is partly
to be explained by the low spreads given to BNDE by most of its external
lenders. Previous operating profits turned into operating losses during 1982
and 1983. However, between 1983 and 1986, BNDE's profitability improved
considerably (para. 5.09). Although the Government is often late in paying
up on guaranteed loans, BNDE's liquidity has not yet developed into a
problem, Also, the debt/equity ratio remained well below the contractual
limit of 4:1 as shareholders kept contributing actively to capital increases,
which automatically led to the supply of fresh resources.



- vi -
In summary, the limited success on the subproject level must be
seen in the context of the difficult environment BNDE was working in,
specifically the one of political nature. In that regard, IDA estimates
made at the time of appraisal concerning subprojecc performance, the
credit's impact and risks involved in BNDE's institutional development
proved optimistic given the economic crisis experienced by Burundi during
the period of project implementation. Also, the need for an adequate
policy framework in the financial sector was not given enough emphasis
(paras. 6.01, 6.02). The lessons of the project experience are discussed in
paras. 6.03-6.05.

BANQUE NATIONALE DE DEVELOPPEMENT (BNDE)
(Credit 731-BU)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Banque Nationale de Developpement Economique (BNDE) was
established in 1967 to assist in the economic development of Burundi, to
provide loan and equity funds to agricultural, industrial and tourism
enterprises and to finance housing. The Government currently holds 46.6%
of BNDE's capital, but used to be majority shareholder during project
execution.   The remainder is held by local private companies and foreign
institutions. There are no differences between the rights and privileges
of different categories of shareholders. BNDE started operations in 1968
and since then, has been able to attract a sizeable number of new
shareholders and foreign creditors. BNDE holds lines of credit from five
different aid donors (IDA, EIB, KFW, CCCE, ADB) and its capital is
subscribed by the public sector, by three foreign institutions and by five
private banks and enterprises in Burundi.
1.02      IDA's involvement in BNDE began in 1976 when, at the request of
the Government, a mission visited Burundi to examine with BNDE's management
the situation and prospects of the company.  The 1976 mission concluded
that in view of BNDE's important role in the financing of development in
Burundi, IDA assistance was warranted.  This led to the approval of Credit
731-BU of US$3.4 million, which included a technical assistance component
of US~0.4 million to finance two expatriates for three years.
1.03      Commitments and disbursements under the credit were slower than
anticipated at appraisal. The original terminal date for submission of
subloans applications, September 30, 1979, wes extended twice to December
31, 1980 and to December 31, 1981. The original closing date was also
extended from December 31, 1981 to December 31, 1983. The accounts
were finalized 6 months after the closing date on June 30, 1983, resulting
in the caacellation of unutilized funds of US$124,000.
1.04      The proceeds of the Credit were onlent by the Government to BNDE
at 5%. The Credit was to be repaid based on a flexible amortization
schedule conforming to the aggregate amortizations of BNDE's IDA subloans.
Other features of the Credit included: (i) an individual free limit of
subloans of US$100,000 with an aggregate limit of US$1.0 million; (ii)
minimum lending rate of 9Z to enable BNDE to have a spread of 4 percentage
points. These rates proved to be negative in real terms throughout the
commitment and disbursement period, as inflation was in the 14-15% range
during most of the time of the Credit; (iii) foreign exchange risk borne by
the Government for a 1% p.a. fee paid by BNDE's clients on the disbursed
balance and; (iv) lNDE to maintain a debt/equity ratio not exceeding 4:1.



- 2 -
1.05      The main objectives of the Credit were to (1) help fill a gap in
the import financing provided by BNDE as a term financing institution; (ii)
help BNDE establish a new department in charge of Industrial project
promotion and processing and (iMi) more generally strengthen the
institution to help it play a major developmeit role in the Burundi
economy.
II. MACROECONOMIC, INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES
2.01      Small and densely populated, Burundi is hampered in its
development by its land-locked location. Over 4.4 million people live on a
hilly territory of about 27,800 km2. The population has been growing at a
rate of 2.1% per year over the last decade. Today, Burundi is one of the
most densely populated countries in Africa (150 inhabitants per km2). GNP
per capita, estimated at between IIS$200-250 during project implementation
is among the lowest in the world. The population is 95% rural and derives
its livelihood from subsistence agriculture and coffee cultivation. The
economy thus depends on the size of the coffee crop and the price it
commands on the world markets. Despite the predominance of the rural
economy, which accounts for 60% of GDP and 90% of exports, Burundi has a
relatively developed services sector and a small but active manufacturing
sector, which the Government is eager to promote as soil deterioration and
erosion is limiting agricultural development.
2.02      Burundi's economic performance during the 1978-82 Third Plan
period, which broadly coincided with the main phase of the project
implementation, was less satisfactory than expected at appraisal. GDP at
factor cost increased at an aver&e annual rate of only 1.9% in real terms
during these 5 years. During the same period, falling coffee prices and
rising import prices caused a massive deterioration of Burundi's terms of
trade (from 100 in 1977, to 26 in 1982). The terms of trade had already
deteriorated by more than 40% in the 7 years prior to the IDA credit.
Gross domestic income fell during the 1978-82 period and with it the amount
of resources available to the economy. By mid-1983, at a time when most
subprojects financed under the credit were supposed to have reached full
operation, the modern sector was experiencing a t vere recession.
2.03      Burundi's manufacturing sector is still relatively small,
accounting for only about 7-10% of GDP during the period of project
implementation.   Although it grew faster than other sectors, (13% in real
terms in 1978-82), this growth yielded little structural change.
Production remained typical of the first generation of import substitution,
and exports are, besides coffee, limited to tea, cotton and a few other
items. During project execution, capacity utilization was low because of
two factors: (a) promoters have difficulties in finding equipment adapted
to the small size of both their companies and the domestic market, and (b)
high tariff protection in neighboring countries as well as the domestic
incentive system are not conducive to reach higher capacity utilization
through exoorts, even though several firms would have the ability to do so
and were designed to serve the Rwanda and East Zaire markets through the
Economic Community of the Countries of the Great Lakes (CEPGL).



- 3 -
2.04      Except for a few firms, the manufacturing sector had a lc-; level
of efficiency during the life of the project. Despite the natural
protection and high tariffs, many firms needed prohibition of competing
imports to operate. Their production costs were high, in many cases
exceeding the cif price of comparable imports, and the quality of the
products was generally below international standards. However the sector
is profitable, with profits before tax averaging 20% of sales. This is due
to the monopolistic situation and protection policies enjoyed by most firms
and a "cost-plus" system of price control, allowing producers a guaranteed
profit margin above their production cost.
2.05      With the exception of coffee, cotton and tea processing,
manufacturing industries are based on imported raw materials. Imports for
industry (raw materials, spare parts and equipment) accounted for an
estimated 35X of total merchandise imports in 19&1. Available data do not
permit a calculation of the net foreign exchange savings to the country
resulting from local manufacturing production, but these are probably small
and produced at a high cost of domestic resources.
2.06      In mid 1986, the Board approved a structural adjustment credit to
support a comprehensive policy reform package designed to correct
distortions and put Burundi back on the growth path. On trade and
industrial policies, the reforms included a devaluation and the
establishment of a realistic exchange rate system, elimination of
quantitative restrictions, price decontrols and the establishment of a
lower and more uniform tariff protection system.
2.07      For its early stage of financial and economic development,
Burundi has a large number of financial institutions. Apart from the
Central Bank - Banque de la R&ipublique du Burundi (BRB) - the financial
system comprises three majority foreign-owned commercial banks - Banque
Commerciale du Burundi (BanCoBu), Banque de Crgdit de Bujumbura (BCB), and
Banque Belgo - Africaine (BBA), a development bank -- Banque Nationale de
D6veloppement Economique (BNDE), two savings and loans institutions --
Caisse de Mobilisation et de Financement (CAMOFI), and Caisse d'Epargne de
Burunai (CADEBU), a holding/investment company -- Societe Hoiding Arabe
Libyen Burundais (Societe Holding), the social security system -- Societe
d'Assurances du Burundi (SOCABU), an insurance company - Institut National
de Securit6 Sociale (INSS), the Postal Office Checking System - Office des
Cheques Postaux (CCP), and a savings bank - Caisse d'Epargne de Burundi
(CADEBU). With the exception of the commercial banks, all institutions are
fully or substantialy Government-owned.  CAMOFI, SOCABU and the Societe
Holding were created in the late 1970's and CADEBU's previously modest role
was significantly expanded in 1976-77 when it was charged with implementing
the then newly introduced obligatory savings scheme.
2.08      BNDE is the financial institution most involved in term financing
for industrial projects, although CAMOFI, and Societ& Holding provide some
term loans and/or equity to industry. Since 1978, the three commercial
banks have also become active in industrial lending with the introduction
of the medium-term discount. le credit ratio, which requires them to
allocate a minimum of 8% of their resources for medium-term liscountable
credit.   The measure is designed to encourage the traditionally
conservative banks to participate in the country's development efforts.



- 4-
Irv 1981, shortly after the appraisal of a second IDA credit for BNDE, the
Government created two additional financial institutions, a developmex.t
finance company - Societ6 Burundaise de Financement (SBF) and a fund for
investing in and lending to financial institutions - Fonds de Promotion
Economique (FPE). IDA perceived these measures as unnecessary
multiplication of Government participation in the sector, and halted
further processing of the BNDE II project.
2.09      Resource mobilization in Burundi essentially consists of sight,
savings and time deposits. Total deposits quadrupled between 1975-80, with
most of this growth taking place before 1978. Thereafter, there was a
small growth of savings and term deposits by enterprises. At the same
time, individuals and households increased their share in term deposits.
The strongest growth was in deposits by the public sector, due to the
increase in deposits by a few selected entities.
2.10      Interest rates charged by commercial banks and BNDE, including
those on loans made with foreign lines o; credit, are regulated by BRB.
CADEBU's interest rates are not subject to the general BRB regulation, but
are set by CADEBU's board, which, however, is chaired by the Vice-Governor
of the BRB. Socift6 Holding, while iot formally included in the interest
rate regulations, has been formally advised to follow BRB's guidelines.
2.11      Burundi's interest rate structure  t the time of the closing date
of Credit 731-BU is shown in Annex 15. Lending rates on short-term
discountable credits eligible for rediscount at the Central Bank (less than
two years) range from 6% for export credits, 7% for capital imports to 10%
for imports of non essential goods. Equipment credits are charged 8.5%.
Medium-term (two to seven years) and long-term credits (over seven years)
to industrial enterprises also eligible for rediscount are 9% and 11%,
respectively. Credits not eligible for rediscount are more expensive,
ranging from 11% to 15%. Although the inflation rate dropped to about 10%
(compared to more than 147 over the previous 5 years), interest rates on
discountable credits, which represent the bulk of credits distributed to
the economy, remained low and generally negative in real terms.
2.12      Complex credit regulations I/ were introduced in May 1978 and
influenced the availability of finance for industry during and after
implementation of Credit 731-BU. In principle, long-term lending is the
domain of specialized institutions such as BNDE, SBF or the Societe
Holding. Commercial banks are authorized on a case-by-case basis to lend
long-term (para. 2.0$), but only that portion of the credit which does not
exceed 7 years would be eligible for discountinge
2.13      Despite the new credit regulations of 1978, credit to industry
almost quadrupled over the period 1979-82, increasing its share in total
credit outstanding to the economy from 6% in 1978 to 15% in 1982. Industry
was only second to construct4zn in the holding of term loans, accounting
for 24X of all medium- and long term credits distributed during that
period. Availability of finance has not been a constrait.t to the
development of the sector. On the contrary, the number of BNDE financed
1/ Practically all credits extended to industrial enteprises are subject to
control by the Central Bank (BRB) as the regulation requires that credit
must be submitted for prior review by BRB whenever it would cause the
cumulative amount of all credits outstanding (excluding credit
prefinancing exports of coffee and other export credits after shipment)
to a given enterprise to exceed BF 3 milion (US$ 25,340).

and other industrial operations in difficulty seems to indicate that,
during the years of high inflation and relatively low borrowing costs,
enterprises sought more credits than they needed and financed marginal
projects.
III, THE INSTITUTION
3,01      Ownership and Board.  BNDE was established as a limited liability
company in December 1966 with a share capital of FBu 60 million subscribed
by the Government and public institutions (75%), and the 3 local commercial
banks (25%). The Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) assisted
strongly in the creation and provided the general management of the Bank
until 1970.
3.02      BNDE's ownership expanded several times.  In 1969, the share
capital was raised to FBu 120 million with four new shareholders
subscribing as follows: DEG and CCCE, FBu 20 million each, Banque
Belgo-Zairoise 2/ and the Breweries of Burundi, FBu 10 million each.
Thereafter, during the implementation of Credit 731-BU, the share capital
was raised another 3 times to a total of FBu 554.3 million. The Belgian
Government entered as a new shareholder in 1981 and the EIB joined BNDE as
a shareholder in 1985. By the end of 1986, the total share capital
amounted to FBu 708 million.
3.03      BNDE's Chairman and President is elected by the General
Assembly. The Board consists of twelve members. The Government and the
public sector are represented by 7 Board members, whereas the foreign and
private shareholders have 5 seats. This diqtribution of membership changed
upon EIB's new shareholdership with the effect that the public sector
(including Government) is in the minority again.
3.04      She capacity of BNDE's Board to guide the institution effectively
was put to test with the consideration of several large
Government-spon_.ored projects of dubious viability in 1978 and 1979.  The
representatives of the local commercial banks appeared neutral at the time,
and the foreign shareholders' warnings had little effect. After up to 3
Board rejections in a row, several controversial projects were ultimately
accepted.
3.05      Management.  BNDE's management has been remarkably stable over
the past 15 years. Its President, who is also the Chief Executive Officer,
has provided for leadership continuity. The current General Manager had
been promoted from within the institution and replaced a seconded staff of
CCCE in 1979.
3.06      Organization and Staff.  BNDE underwent some organizational
changes during the implementation of the IDA Credit. First, in keeping
with an agreement reached with IDA during negotiations, it created a new
unit responsible for appraising and promoting industrial projects. This
unit was staffed with two expatriates (an engineer ar.d an industrial
economist/financial analyst) and with two motivated but inexperienced
2/ A commercial bank which does not operate in Burundi.



- 6 -
counterparts. The unit has worked satisfactorily, even though the proposed
cooperation with the Industry Division in the Ministry of Economy and
Finance (to prepare feasibility studies) did not succeed. A second
organizational change that was conducive to strengthening BNDE's
organization took place in 1979, when one Assistant Manager departed and
another was promoted to Managing Director. As a consequence, several
departments which previously reported directly to the President, were
regrouped and instead reported to the General Manager. This led to a
clearer division of responsibilities between the Presidnt and the General
Manager, with the former concentrating more on matters of general policy
and the latter on day-to-day operations, even though both still overlap
somewhat.
3.07      Staffing.  BNDE's staffing has been adequate in terms of number
of staff. Also, total staff did not increase unduly over the years as in
other DFCs. Instead, staff growth was prudently monitored. From a total
of 38 staff on board in 1977, the institution was employing 45 in 1984.
The total number of professional staff did not change at all, but some
turnover took place. A total of 20 positions correspond to auxiliary
services such as gardeners, chauffeurs, watchmen, etc. The total of 25
professionals seems adequate to the size of BNDE's portfolio and its level
of operations but the quality of the work still required additional
improvement.
3.08      Expatriate advisors continue to play an important role in running
BNDE.  In the past, four key positions were occupied by experts as follows:
the General Manager position (which later shifted to advisor to the General
Manager once the General Manager post was filled by a Burundi national) and
the Chief Financial Officer position were both provided by CCCE. The other
two positions are in the industrial development unit. The German bilateral
assistance provided an economist/financial analyst and the TA component of
Credit 731-BU provided a consultant engineer (see para. 3.09) who was
replaced in 1982 by Belgian TA. To incentivate recruitment of
counterparts, CCCE financed a declining share of the cost of its 2 experts
while BNDE's share was increasing. The 2 experts in the industrial unit
remain free of charge to the institution. The technical assistance experts
were found useful throughout the years according to BNDE and IDA
supervision reports, and were instrumental in achieving the modestly
successful work that BNDE,carried out during the period. While
counterparts would not yet be fully capable of replacing tlte experts,
strengthening of local staff, particularly in the industrial development
unit (see below) was achieved.
3.09      Utilization of Technical Assistance.  The IDA Credit provided for
the financing of 2 expatriate advisors for 3 staff-years each, to build up
the industrial developmesut unit. Shortly after credit effectiveness in
1978 the German bilateral assistance to BNDE started by means of equity
participation through DEG and by providing 1 expert for the industrial
development unit. Therefore, IDA financed only one person (engineer) for
the unit instead of two. A little more than 6 months after his arrival
(July 1979), BNDE expressed dissatisfaction with his performance and
considered replacement possibilities. Following the introduction of a more
clearly defined work program, the engineer's performance was slightly
improving. Overall, however, his services were not judged fully
satisfactory by BNDE.



-
3.10      Out of the US$400,000 total, US$372,423 were disbursed under the
TA component 3/. A study of SSE performance and prospects was financed
separately under the third technical assistance credit.
3.11      Procedures.  The adoption of detailed procedures for appraisal
and follow-up as well as a standard loan agreement for industrial and
tourism projects, all satisfactory to IDA, were a condition of disbursement
of the IDA Credit. While the procedures adopted were adequate, there were
weaknesses in their implementation which improved only marginally through
the credit. More intensive supervision by IDA to verify that such
standarde and procedures were properly implemented might have produced
different results.
(i) Project Promotion and Appraisal. Prior to the establishment
of the industrial development unit, BNDE relied primarily on appraisal
reports prepared by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry which the latter
presented to BNDE as "faits accomplis". BNDE had, at the time, taken the
attitude that, since the decision to go ahead with a project had already
been taken, further study would have been irrelevant. With the
establishment of the special industrial development unit, BNDE was able to
rely more on its own judgement and prepare more of its owr. projects. The
appraisal quality, however, remained low, and during supervision IDA
sent to BNDE examples of subproject appraisals of other DFCs for further
guidance.
(ii) Supervision. Although BNDE prepared periodic reports,
project supervision has, in most cases, been lax. In principle, BNDE
requires annual financial statements from its clients and seeks to visit
regularly at least those projects experiencing difficulties. However, the
institution has been easily deterred by uncooperative clients who failed to
prepare or share valuable informstion. This explains partly why BNDE has
not yet standarized, in practice, its supervision procedures and why
project follow-up is still pursued on an ad hoc basis,even though
satisfactory supervision procedures were agreed upon at negotiations.
BNDE's increased involvement in small scale projects would especially
have called for improved supervision.
(iii) Procurement. Prior to IDA's involvement in BNDE, the
institution had not played a role in advising its borrowers on procurement
matters, as most of the equipment was already selected at a time when BNDE
was asked either by the Government or by individual promoters to
participate in a given project. As a result of Credit 731-BU, this
approach changed gradually with BNDE beginning to participate at an early
stage of a project and ensuring for the benefit of its clients that they
seek several quotations.   At a later stage BNDE started to review on a
regular basis the offers from various suppliers and paid directly to the
supplier selected by the client or refunded the promoter against
presentation of invoices.

(iv) Audit. During negotiations it was agreed that, in view of
the absence of audit firms in Burundi, the Central Bank would carry out
BNDE's audit. This has been done in each year, except in 1980 and 1981,
when the German firm Treuarbeit audited BNDE, financed by a grant from
KFW. Although they were submitted with substantial delays and questionable
accuracy at first, the quality of the Central Bank's audits improved
substantially since 1979. The last 2 audits were found acceptable by IDA,
even though the 1982 audit was submitted only in February 1984 4/,
IV. ALLOCATION OF THE CREDIT
4.01      The proceeds of the IDA credit were utilized to finance a total
ot 24 subprojects. BNDE was granted a free limit of US$100,000.
By early 1980, when commitments were still lagging behind schedule, IDA
proposed, and the Government accepted (on June 9, 1980) to amend the Credit
Agreement to include lending to small SSE clients to which lending was not
proposed originally. This resulted in the following subproject
distribution: (i) five large and medium sized subprojects (except for one,
all between USS300,000 and 890,000 equivalent); (ii) two projects slightly
below, but close to, the free limit, of which one for Ub41OO,000 equivalent
and the other one for US$78,000 equivalent; and (iii) seventeen SSE
projects, with one exception for amounts between US$5,000 and 25,000
equivalent, absorbing a total of US$290,000 equivalent, or about 10% of the
total credit amount.
4.02      Financial and economic characteristics of the projects financed
under the IDA credit are summarized in Annexes 7 and 8 respectively. The 5
'A" projects are located in the capital of Bujumbura. Four of the five are
new projects, and one was an expansion (of metal furniture manufacturing).
The four new projects were an international transport company, which
went bankrupt after operating for only 1 1/2 years; a small tire
retreading shop which is not yet profitable but seesms to be improving; an
airport service company, managed by Sabena Airlines, which is in a
monopolistic pcsition and is the only successful project; and a processing
operation for hides and skins, which never went beyond ordering the
machinery. Tne 2 operations just below the free limit reveal only slightly
better results: the expansion and modernization of a soap factory appears
to be well managed and profitable but does not disclose its financial
statements, and a small provincial hotel is producing losses due to an
average occupancy rate of only 15%.
4/ The delay was due to (i) BNDE's late request for audit to the Central
Bank; and (ii) delays by the Central Bank in completing the work because
it had to readjust its own accounts following the devaluation of the
Burundi franc in November 1983.



- 9 -
4.03     The credit was amended (on June 9, 1980) to include SSE financing
after it had become clear that commitments were lagging far behind original
projections. BNDE adopted for its SEE component the following policies and
procedures: (i) defining SSEs as companies with assets of less than
US$150,000 equivalent; (ii) charging interest rates two percentage points
below what BNDE charged otherwise for IDA funde (8% instead of 10%); (iii)
reducing BNDE's cost of these funds by one point (BNDE paid the Government
4% instead of otherwise 5%, thus increasing its spread); (iv) financing of
90% of total project cost by IDA funds, thus reducing promoter's equity
partiepation to a mere 10%; and finally (v) Government guaranteeing 75% of
subloan amounts. Only US$290,000 of the originally foreseen US$1.0
million allocation were committed. Most of the SSE projects were for
carpenters, butcher shops, little mills and dressmaking. All but one are
in arrears, and almost half of them (8 of the 17) are either abandoned or
bankrupt. Of the remaining 9, two thirds (6) have no accounting and it can
not be established whether or not they are profitable. Two of the
remaining three seemed to be in satisfactory condition (dressmaker and
carpenter) when visited. Annex 9 gives a summary description of all "A"
and "B" and three selected "SSE" subprojects.
4.04      The total investment cost of the 5 bigger projects amounted to
US$4.8 million equivalent, ranging from US$2.1 million equivalent for the
now bankrupt transport company to US$150,000 equivalent for the tire
retreader. The average investment cost per job for the 3 still operating
projects is US$8,500 equivalent. The low investment cost per job is mainly
attributable to the Airport Service Company. Comparable figures for the 2
additional medium size, "B", subprojects are an average total investment of
US$160,000 equivalent and an average investment cost per job of US$16,000
equivalent. Total project costs of the SSE projects are listed in Annex
6. there is not enough data available to estimate the investment cost per
job of the SSE subprojects. Besides, several of them operate seasonally
and have a steadily fluctuating employment number as a result.
4.U5      A sample of economic and financial characteristics of other BNDE
projects, not financed by IDA, is given in Annexes 12 and 13. Even though
the results are somewhat better, this sample of projects was selected by
BNDE and represents only the top performing non-IDA financed projects in
the portfolio. lherefore, it is not really comparable. It shows, however,
that BNDE has a number of solid projects in its portfolio.
V. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01      Operations.  Annex 5 gives a summary analysis of BNDE's loan
approvals and equity investments between January 1, 1977 and December 31,
1983. During the project period, BNDE approved 4,157 operations for FBu
2,763.1 million, and 5 equity participations for a total of FBu 56.5
million. As a comparison, during the six years prior to the IDA credit,
BNDE approved 280 operations for FBu 1,119.6 million.



- 10 -
5.02     The malority (95.3%) of approved loans were below  FBu 1.0 million
but accounted for only 15.2% of amounts approved. In terms of value,
approvals were dominated by loans above FBu 50.0 million. The 11 loans of
that size accounted for 46.4% of the total amount approved.
5.03      BNDE's loan approvals are diversified in terms of sectoral
distribution and cover a variety of economic activities, notably
agriculture, manufacturing, mining, artisan and especially housing (30% of
total amount). In terms of number of loans, small equipment and consumer
oriented loans amounted to 88% of all 4,157 operations. About 65% of both
number and amount of loans were approved for creditors in the capital of
Bujt'mbura while the balance went to the remaining provinces. In line with
BNDE's development orientation for both the public and the private sector,
38% of loan amounts approved were for the public sector, 36% for the
private sector and 23% for mixed projects.   Loans for less than 1 year of
maturity made up 90% of the total number but only 18% of amounts, while
long term loans (above 5 years) account for 53% of amounts.
5.04      A suxumary of BIJDE's actual operations during the credit
implementation period (1977-1983) and beyond (until 1986) and comparative
data as forecasted at the time of appraisal are given in Annex 1.
Approvals and commitments during the first 5 years were on average in line
with the forecasted amounts, but disbursements lagged two thirds behind.
However, in 1982 and 1983, years which were no longer covered by the 1977
forecast, approval and commitment figures dropped sharply by 50% and 75%
respectively compared to 1981 figures. The drop in activity can be
attributed to (i) a sluggish grow-h of the economy; (ii) a sharp drop in
mortgage financing due to a virtual standstill in the construction industry
(in 1982, BNDE still approved 58 mortgages for FBu 240.0 million; in 1981
only 2 new mortgage approvals for FBu Z5.0 million were processed); and
(iii) a decline of new investment activities in view of the absence of
viable projects.
5.05      Loans.  As of December 21, 1983, BNDE's total portfolio amounted
to FBu 2,7674million, of which less than 3% were in equity investments,
By the end of 1986, it had reached FBu 3.2 billion. Manufacturing
activities accounted for 28% of the loan portfolio, mortgage financing for
25% and tourism - mainly hotels - for 12%. Another 21% consisted of short
term coffee harvest financing and had not been part of the loan portfolio
in previous years. The remaining 11% outstanding was for various other
activities, notably agriculture (7%) and small equipment and consumer loans
(3%). During implementation of Credit 731-BU, BNDE'sportfolio has more
than quadrupled. A large portion of this increase, however, was due to
BNDE's unusual financing of the coffee harvest in 1983 which led to a
portfolio increase of more than FBu 500.0 million just between 1982 and
1983.
5.06      In spite of difficult economic conditions and many uncooperative
clients, BNDE had been able to keep the level of arrears on the low side.
It amounted to 13% of the loan portfolio (for amounts above 3 months) as of
December 31, 1983. However, these arrears affected 58 projects, the
outstanding balance of which represented 56% of the value of the loan
portfolio. It must be noted that 50% of those amounts are Government
guaranteed. BNDE was not, however, in a position to provide a complete
list of reechedulings undertaken in the past. Therefore, the percentage
of actual arrears might be understated.



- 1J -
5.07      The underlying quality of BNDE's portfolio quality is
characterised by the fact that out of the loan portfolio of FBu 2,074.3
million (net of the portion for coffee harvest which is virtually risk free
as the coffee crop itself serves as a guarantee), about 50% is guaranteed
either directly or indirectly (through SSE guarantees, Agriculture Fund and
FENU) by the Government, whereas the remaining balance of 50% is at BNDE's
own risk. BNDE is fully secured on this remaining amount, through
mortgages and first charges on equipment and machinery, but, due to the
complexitiet of Burundi's legal system, it has not yet been able to execute
a single judgement against a delinquent client, even though it tried in
several cases.   Provisions for the loan portfolio were FBu 34.5 million as
of December 31, 1983, about 3.3% of the portfolio amount for which the
development bank carries the full risk. A portfolio analysis based on each
individual credit is unavailable, but the portfolio of doubtful projects
alone 'as classified by BNDE) is already reaching FBu 62 million net of the
portions which are covered by Governmenit guarantees.
5.08      Equity.  As of December 31, 1983, BNDE's equity portfolio
amounted to FBu 83.4 million in 6 companies. Thereafter, by the end of
1986, this portfolio had increased to FBu 103 million. The last equity
investments during credit implementation period included an increase, in
1982, in BNiE's participation in the local glass bottle factory (VERRUNDI)
of Fbu 13.8 million and in 1983, a participation of FBu 10.0 millioa into
the Societe Hoteliere Nouvelle du Burundi (SHNB) for the construction of a
new hotel. Except for its participation in the Agricultural Guarantee Fund
and in FADI (a small insecticide producer), all other 4 equity investments
are losing ventures. The 1982 audit proposed a provision of 76% of BNDE's
investment of FBu 23.0 million in the Meridien Hotel and of 82.5% for
BNDE's investment of FBu 8.0 million in BURTAN (see Annex 9). VERRUNDI, in
which BNDE holds FBu 35.0 million in addition to an EIB guarantee loan of
FBu 276 million, is experiencing serious financial difficulties, (Imported
bottles cost 30% of those produced by VERRUNDI). The last venture, a new
luxury hotel (Novotel) is not likely to become profitable, as its main
competitor, the Meridien Hotel, is operating at only 30% capacity already.
Financial Performance and Condition
5.09      BNDE's forecasted and actual balance sheets, income statements
and financial ratios for 1976-1986 are presented in Annexes 2,3 and 4. Due
to a lower volume of operations than anticipated at appraisal, income from
loans was lower than expected and kept declining during the execution of
Credit 731-BU. By 1983, BNDE's financial position had become critical.
Without the company's recent involvement in short term financing of the
coffee harvest, a safe and profitable operation, it would have incurred a
first time loss.   Including the results of the coffee financing, BNDE
managed to produce a profit after tax (but before provisions) of FBu 4.4
million (US$4b,500), or 0.7% of net worth for 1983. This low profitability
was mainly due to two factors: (i) a relatively low spread on both its
foreign borrowing (about 3% on average) and on the Central Bank's
rediscounting facilities (2.5%-3.5%, depending on the category of credit);
and (ii) the poor quality of the loan and equity portfolio. The



- 12 -
growing arrears affected especially the liquidity position, as the
Government has been slow in honoring its guarantees. Dividends received in
1983 from its equity portfolio amounted to less than 1% of funds invested
(US$8,000 equivalent on FBu 83.4 million, or US$927,000 equivalent).
Between 1983 and 1986, BNDE's profitability improved substantially.
5.10      Until the end of 1983, BNDE was subject to a profit Lax of
45% and its net profit was too small to constitute adequate provisions.
The auditors estimated that had taxes been levied net of provisions, BNDE
would have declared substantial losses instead of the small profits
generated during 1979-1983. 5/ On the other hand, BNDE's debt equity
position remained stable overF the time of the credit due to continuous
share capital increases. Even if the short term debt is included,
BNDE's total debt equity position remained always below the contractual 4:1
ratio.
Resource Mobilization
5.11      Despite its financial weakness, BNI1E has been able to mobilize
sufficient resources from bilateral agencies to finance its operations. As
of December 1983, when credit 731-BU came to an end, BNDE had the
equivalent of US$3.9 million available for new approvals in foreign
exchange. In addition, BPDE's paid-in capital was increased from FBu 363
million to FBu 554.3 million and reached,by 1986, FBu 708 million (para.
3.02). Finally, Caisse Centrale had indicated its willingness to grant
special advances to finance specific projects, as it has done in the past
with BNDE and other DFCs in Africa.  With these various resources, BNDE
will be able to coatinue sustaining its modest level of operations.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
b.O1      The two main objectives that IDA set out to accomplish with this
credit were to provide financing on appropriate terms to industrial
investment projects well conceived in economic, financial and technical
terms and to strengthen BNDE's project appraisal capabilities and internal
organization. The objectives were only partly met. In 1976, when Credit
731-BU was appraised, BNDE was still a young and inexperienced development
bank whose procedures and systems needed considerable strengthening.
During the seven ye-'rs of the IDA credit implementation, BNDE did improve
its internal procedires to some extent and has now a better organizational
structure. However, external circumstances such as strong political
pressure for BNDE to get involved in some uneconomie projects, weaknesses
in the legal system and a lack of sound industrial projects coupled with an
abundance of non-businesslike promoters had a tendency to disillusion the
staff of the institution who, as a result, were less enthusiastic to work
towards further Institutional progress.
5/ In late March 1984, the Government decided to grant BNDE a special tax
regime: profit tax due by BNDE will not be paid to the Treasury but
kept in an account at BNDE. The funds become Government's deposits
which can be used by BNDE for any purpose with the approval of the
Finance Minister, including payment of arrears on loans guaranteed by
the Government.

b.02      The project has not lived up to expectations regarding subproject
financing. A large number of the projects failed. One subproject, a
transport service operation which went bankrupt, received one third of the
disbursed total of Credit 731-BU. Most of the SSE projects also failed.
The SSE component was not part of the original project design and was
introduced only half way through the life of the credit because of slower
than expected commitments in the original components. Little experience
about SSE financing existed at the time the new component was introduced
and an SSE study, which was commissioned after the amendment, shuuld
probably have come first. Overall, five projects out of the total of 24
which were financed under the credit are operating in an acceptable manner.
6.03      Lessons to be learned from this first time IDA exposure in
Burundi's development Dank are numerous. First and foremost, it should be
for the Government to understand that the major development bank of the
country should be guided by policies reflecting prudent banking standards.
At the same time, the foreign owners of the DFC should take a much stronger
position to avoid BNDh's involvement in uneconomic projects.
6.04      For BNDE itself, it would be important to reconsider its
diversification into various types of activities. It remains open to
question whether it was worth processing, approving and subsequently
administering over 3,800 small equipment and consumer loans, which at the
same time represented only 15% of portfolio value and which contributed
little, if at all, to the overall profitability of the company in recent
years. These loans might have been more adequately made by the commercial
banks and not by BNDE, which has neither the structure nor the comparative
advantage to handle this type of activity. Instead, BNDE should have
concentrated much more on its more substantial loans which do not exceed 60
altogether. If the overall focus, including more aggressive supervision
efforts, would have been concentrated on these 60 loans, overall results
would probably have been substantially better. A higher profitability
could have provided larger amounts for provisions, the need for which would
not have been as high in the first place.
6.05      For 1DA, finally, it would have been desirable to supervise this
first time project more often, probably with shorter, more frequent
missions instead of just one mission a year, especially for a project
embedded in a difficult environment such as the one in Burundi. Relying
only on adequate policies and procedures as agreed during project
preparation does not guarantee a smooth performance unless there is careful
monitoring to ensure that policies and procedure are actively implemented
as well. In this respect, IDA made little effort to rectify the anomalies
of the complex interest-rate regime and credit regulations as well as the
legal system which severely impeded judgement against defaulting
borrowers. In addition, subloans above the free limit were not scrutinized
enough prior to their approval. Also efforts, to improve the arrear
situation during project execution were made and spelled out less clearly
than would have been desirable.



- 14 -
6.06      Interest rates became negative in real terms during project
execution and the annual review clause to allow for an adequate interest
rate to the final borrower was not used appropriately by IDA. Finally, and
probably most importantly, the project did not lead to a dialogue on
financial sector policies, even though both a financial sector and an
industrial sector report were prepared in 1982 and in 1984 respectively.
6.07      Future credit line operations in Burundi should gain from past
experience and focus inter alia on the following issues: (i) the review
of the interest rate structure to achieve positive rates in real terms;
(ii) assess the impact of the recently started term financing by commercial
banks and the SBF; (iii) review the extent to which industrial sector
issues, such as tariff protection and licensing system have been dealt with
in recent years; and (iv) assess the reforms needed in the legal system to
better protect the creditor. Also, as far as BNDE is concerned, it would
be necessary to carry out a detailed portfolio analyais and ensure that all
the Government guarantees which fell due are properly honored. Finally, a
careful assessment of the pipeline of projects would be required.

BANQUE NATIONALE DE DEVELOPPEMENT ECONOMIQUE (BNDE)
Summary Description and Present Status of Subprojects Refinanced
Under Credit 731-BU
Below is a summary of all "A" and "B" subprojects financed under
Credit 731-BU as well as a short description of 3 SSE projects which were
selected  and visited  at  random  (BURTAN,  BANDAG and  SOBUGEA were  also
visited).
INTRACO - "A" Subloan US$888,889; total amount disbursed US$888,889
The INTRACO subproject (International Transport Company, SARL)
consisted of financing the purchase of twenty prime movers and 20
containers to trAnsport fuel and other merchandise in and out of Burundi
through Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda.  Promoted, advanced and guaranteed by the
Government, which approved the project in 1978 and imposed it upon BNDE,
the project had a total cost of US$2.4 million equivalent.   Prior to
approval, IDA raised numerous issues, partly because this was BNDE's first
subproject submission and its appraisal unit, which was to receive
technical assistance under the IDA credit, had at the time not yet been
manned.
In the early months of 1978, Burundi's supplies of key inputs
(especially fuel) were cut off, because of political turmoil in some of the
neighboring countries which surround landlocked Burundi.   The purpose of
establishing INTRACO was therefore to minimize disruptions of that nature
by reducing Burundi's dependence on the Tanzanian railroad.   One issue
raised by IDA was whether the causes of the supply problems had really
thoroughly been identified to establish whether they were of temporary or
chronic nature and with what frequency they were likely to reoccur, as once
committed to hauling goods and fuel by trucks through Nairobi would have
increased the prices thereof by 50%, resulting in lasting effects on the
economy.  Also, the viability of the truck company was seen as overrated
based on elevated freight charges (15.3 F Bu/ton as ageinst 5 F Bu/ton for
the Tanzania route).  An additional issue was the absence of evaluating
risks, likely to be encountered on the Nairobi route, including general
cross-border problems, obtaining entry visas, and cooperation among
three separate Governments. Also, a gross vehicle weight limit of 35 tons
had been introduced in Uganda, while that for the trucks proposed for use
in  the  TPTRACO  project  amounted  to  50  tons.    Finally,  the  company
responsible for maintenance had not been evaluated at all, general safety
levels for the truck drivers to be hired were not assured and the economic
rate of return  calculation was  incorrect.    An  altogether  alternative
solution, which would have been stockpiling of fuel, was overtaken by
events as the project was already operational when BNDE submitted it, and
therefore not considered at all.

After 5 months of correspondence back and forth, IDA had received
several, not specifically substantiated replies, but in the end concluded
not to have "a reasonable case to refuse the project".
Project  execution  was  suspended  for  4  consecutive  months
immediately after IDA approval, due to guerilla warfare in Uganda, while
INTRACO kept paying its personnel.   Six months later, in November 1979,
Uganda closed its borders for several weeks.  Both factors resulted in an
estimated turnover loss of US$1.0 million equivalent.
The main reasons that led to an impass and to the subsequent
liquidation of the company were: market (less trips per truck due to (i)
insufficient load and (ii) competition from Kenyan truck companies);
inexperience of chauffeurs; bcrder formalities and visa issuing (en route
paper processing took up to 4 days per capital city); poor road conditions;
and investments exceeding necessary amounts (INTRACO had received - without
BNDE's knowledge - in addition to the BNDE loan of F Bu 178.0 million
another credit for further truck purchases of F Bu 71.6 million, and had
used its working capital as downpayment for yet another, this time supplier
credit of F Bu 127.0 million).  Except for a one time interest payment to
BNDE, no further repayments were made.
BURTAN - 'A" Subloan - US$389,000; total amount disbursed: US$377,200
BURTAN (Tannerie du Burundi) was originally formed in 1976 as a
partnership between the State of Burundi, BNDE and Excelsior, Hide and
Skins Limited of London as principal shareholders. Mauagement was provided
by  Excelsior.      In  July  1977,  Excelsior  withdrew  as  manager  and,
shareholder. However, the Board of BURTAN is withholding reimbursement of
Excelsior's participation pending the outcome of legal action initiated
against Excelsior for mismanagement and other irregularities.   Despite
a recent Court judgement, the situation still remains unclear. In 1979, at
the time of subproject appraisal to revitalize the company, BURTAN's share
capital was F Bu 40 million, the major shareholder then being the State of
Burundi (51%), BNDE (20%) and the Institut National de SEcurit6 Sociale
(13%).   Day-to-day management was provided by an experienced Yougoslav
specialist in the leather-tanning business.
As originally perceived, the Company was expected to process both
cattle hides and small animal skins. Subsequent to Excelsior's withdrawal,
the new management in collaboration with the Ministry of Industry
reassessed the company's objectives and arrived at the conclusion that the
original project design was not viable.  The IDA subproject thus became a
rehabilitation of the earlier project and was oriented only towards
processing of small animal skins, while an effort was to be made to upgrade
the quality of cattle hides during a subsequent phase of operation.  The
subproject appraisal lacked specific information such as market analysis, a



Annex 9
-26-                Page 3 of 6
supply analysis of skins, a breakdown of working capital needs, procurement
lustification and thorough financial analysis.   After corresponding for
over a year, IDA did approve the project, although it was stated that
uncertainties did remain.  In the end, this US$600,000 project did not go
beyond the status of ordering and receiving the proposed machinery, which
was not installed until 5 years after delivery. As a result, the project
never got off the ground, and its equity has already been used up by the
accumulated losses l/.  It will take a long time until the debt can be
serviced, if ever. The services of a French expert who had recently been
hired might possibly bear some fruits revitalizing the operation once
again.
SAVONOR - "B" Subloan - US$100,000; total disbursed: US$87,290
SAVONOR was the first of two projects below the free limit which
were  submitted  for IDA approval.   As all legal aspects were fulfilled
(90-day rule, procurement, interest rate and eligibility) the project was
approved  without  further  review.    Therefore,  no  issues  were  raised.
SAVONOR was established in 1970 by a German chemical engineer, who holds a
75% majority of the equity of currently F Bu 13.0 million. The main line
of production is soap, margarine, cosmetics, etc. which have a high local
raw material content (70%), using mainly palm oil. The IDA refinanced BNDE
loan, which was BNDE's fourth to the company, was used to purchase 5 mills
for palm oil processing.   No additional jobs were created, as it was an
expansion project.   Debt-service is punctual and the financial status of
the company is a healthy one.  1983 net profits were at F Bu 43.9 million,
based on total sales of F Bu 406.6 million, exceeding 6 times BNDE's
original projections.
SITRACO - "A" Subloan - US$312,000; total amount disbursed: US$280,000
IDA approval of SITRACO (SociEte Industrielle et Commerciale),
and formerly named "La Maison Scolaire" was not based on an otherwise
standard review memo.   As the project was neither one of those visited
during the completion mission nor was any information on status and
performance of subprojects ever included in a supervision report on Credit
731-BU, the assessment of results has to be sketchy as the promoter does
not disclose data to BNDE. While the metal furniture product is good both
technically and in terms of price, the market is not absorbing it even
though BNDE's appraisal projected sufficient sales to the university,
schools, the military, hospitals, etc.   The company sales were affected
strongly by the severe reduction of activities in the construction sector
(which had a negative impact also on the IDA financed Local Construction
Industry Project, Credit 1230-BU).   As a result, the company faces high
inventory of both raw materials and finished goods.   A reversal of the
situation is not in sight.
17 According to the latest available financial statements which date back
to December 31, 1981.

BANDAG - "A" Subloan - US$134,340; total amount disbu sed: US$133,400
BANDAG (Societ4 Burundaise de Pneumatiquer) was established as a
new plant for retreading car and truck tires in a rented factory near
Bujumbura in 1981. A license had been granted by the BANDAG company of the
U.S.    BANDAG is  also  supplying  the  retreads  and  adhesives.   Rubber
materials are also imported from 2 overseas plants. Total project cost was
US$250,000 equivalent including US$54,000 of working capital.
The project was sponsored by 4 Italians who had established a
similar operation in neighboring Rwanda in 1976, where it is operating
successfully.    In  Burundi,  eighteen  people  are  employed,  including  1
expatriate, resulting in an average cost per job of US$14,000.  The project
uses locally produced electricity which is subsidized.   However, it does
save considerable foreign exchange, as the average cost of a new tire
is CIF F Bu 14,100 whereas all retreading material amounts to CIF F Bu
5,000 per tire. A problem raised at the time of subproject review was the
narrowness of the local Burundi market. Compared to the BANDAG operatio in
neighboring Rwanda, BNDE's assumptions on the estimated number of tires to
be retreaded seemed somewhat optimistic.   After a downscale adjustment,
the project appeared slightly less attractive, given a previous high break
even  point  of 89%.   However,  the  economic  rate of  return of 49%,  a
financial rate of return of 17.4% and a debt service cover ratio above 1.5
still made the project attractive enough.  Start up of the operation was
delayed until late 1983 which caused the firm to operate at loss at early
production stages.  It is however expected to turn profitable in the near
future,
Hotel de Ngozi - "B" Subloan - US$78,168; total amount disbursed: US$78;168
The hotel is located 130 km north of Bujumbura, in the coffee
growing district of Burundi. The hotel was already under construction when
the subloan was granted.    Total cost of an estimated F Bu 16.0 million
were surpassed by F Bu 3.0 million, and included construction of a
restaurant along with the 23-room hotel. Occupancy never reached expected
levels and is currently at 3-4 rooms per night (15%), mainly due to the
improved road between Ngozi and Bujumbura (financed by another IDA credit),
which now allows coffee purchasers to return to Bujumbura the same day,
making it unnecessary to stay overnight at Ngozi,  The restaurant has few
clients.   According to BNDE, the situation is precarious and improvement
very unlikely. Arrears amount to one third of the BNDE's loan (F Bu 3.34
million) and the balance of F Bu 10.4 million (as of 3/30/84) will most
likely not be repaid either.

SOBUGEA - "A" Subloan - US$777,778; total amount disbursed: US$782,586
SOBUGEA (Soci6tS Burundaise de Gestion Aeroportuaire) was
established in April 1981 to manage the airport of Bujumbura and provide
warehousing, restaurant and duty free shopping facilities. The subloan was
to help financing the purchase of transporting and loading equipment to
service jumbo jets which started serving Bujumbura airport in 1982.  The
IDA refinanced subloan represented 73% of the project's foreign exchange
cost.  The company has a de facto monopoly for its services.  Its capital
of F Bu 46 million is held by Air Burundi (45%), SOCABU, the Burundian
Insurance Company (20%), and SABENA (35%).  The latter provides technical
assistance to SOBUGEA by seconding 3 of its technicians, one of which
serves as general manager.   SOBUGEA's  income is derived  from aircraft
landing fees and fees for warehousing goods. Air France and SABENA are the
largest clients.
In reviewing BNDE's submission, Bank Group staff found that the
project was well prepared but raised 3 major issues: (i) landing fees, the
main source of income, were unclearly calculated and it was unertain
whether SOBUGEA had a firm contract with the above mentioned 2 carriers as
competitive fees were charged by airports with similar services in
neighboring countries; (ii) the project's profitability was based on an
irrational assumption of income increases of 20% per annum while costs rose
by 15%, which reflected current prices instead of constant prices; and
(iii) the underlying interest rate charged by BNDE was 6% instead of 10% as
per the IDA Credit Agreement. BNDE was able to provide acceptble answers
to the above issues and SOBUGEA is today the only actual project success,
having tripled the expected returns (FBu 11.8 million instead of a
projected F Bu 4.3 million as of 1983) and having actually prepaid BNDE's
loan.  The company works 2 shifts and being service oriented, its capital
intensity is very low resulting in an investment cost per job of only
US$1,400.
Atelier de Couture (SSE) Subloan US$13,300; total amunt disbursed:
US$12,800
The project was one of the first submitted to IDA after the
Credit Agreement of Credit 731-BU was amended to the effect that US$1.0
million was made available for SSE financing. The Atelier de Couture is
owned by a local seamstress and situated in the "Asian Quarter' of
Bujumbura.   BNDE's loan of US$14,500 equivalent (to cover 90% of project
cost) financed the purchase of 2 electric and 3 manual sewing machines to
enable the operation to grow modestly. At times, up to 16 employees find
work  in the business which  operates  very  seasonally.    Despite BNDE's
elaborate financial projections at subproject appraisal stage, Atelier de
Couture is not nearly reaching what was to be expected a 4.1 debt/service
coverage (project is in arrears) or an internal rate of return of above
100%.  However, it represents one of the few SSE projects which is not a

Page 6 of 6
failure but instead survives marginally. The main project's problem is the
non-availability   of   short   term   financing  as   the  company   lacks
creditworthiness vis-a-vis the local commercial banks.   Therefore, many
orders cannot be taken in because of insufficient working capital, which
restrains the growth potential of the operation.
Bakery Bwiza (SSE) - Subloan US$24,400; total amount disbursed US$24,400
The promoter of this bakery project did not avail himself to the
completion mission.   (In general, commun cation between BNDE and its SSE
clients seem to be difficult, as the majority of them has no telephone and
hardly responds to the already slow and unreliable mail service). However,
the oven which was constructed from subloan proceeds, produces enough bread
to allow for operating a small, separate retail outlet in the center of
Bujumbura. Nonetheless, 40% of the outstanding loan balance is in arrears
and again it must be noted that BNDE's appraisal projections of a financial
rate of return of 76% and a debt service coverage of 3.0 are far from being
achieved.
Carpentry Bwize (SSE) - Subloan dS$$4,600; total amount disbursed: US$4,600
Along with 2 others, this is one of the smallest subloans
financed under the SSE line. The promoter of this carpentry, who inberited
the buisiness from his father, received professional training as a carpenter
in the School for Artisan Formation. According to BNDE, his product is of
good quality but has a limited market as it does not meet the standards of
the expatriate community. At the same time, the products are too expensive
for the vast majority of the average inhabitant of Bujumbura.  The total
project cost of US$10,000 equivalent created 5 new permanent jobs, and was
- unlike all other SSE projects under the credit - financed 50% with equity
funds.   About 40% of the loan balance is in arrears and again, BNDE's
original projections were overly optimistic (financial rate of return 28%;
debt service coverage 4.0) and have not been reached).
