Moreover, countries at risk by\n            the El Nino type phenomena, should undertake contingency\n            planning, and preventive measures, including routine\n            maintenance, measures which should be incorporated into\n            sectoral regular investment programs, to mitigate adversity,\n            and thus reduce social, and economic losses. The varied\n            impacts of natural disasters, require an individualized\n            approach to project design, hence, decentralized government\n            structures, such as in Bolivia, call for a balance between\n            local governments' responsibilities, and a centralized\n            disaster forecasting, financing, and coordination.\n            Specialized nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) do play a\n            role in the implementation of small-scale projects at the\n            local level, provided implementation, and procurement\n            training for NGOs is granted under emergency donor financed projects."}, "docdt": "2001-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
