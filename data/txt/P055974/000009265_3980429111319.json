There are five components. The first\n            consists of flood prevention works, drought mitigation\n            works, and essential equipment such as bailey bridges,\n            temporary power plants, and other equipment needed for\n            managing an emergency response. The second flexibly\n            allocates resources to 1) rehabilitate and rebuild\n            flood-damaged public infrastructure facilities; and 2)\n            regenerate productive capacity in the drought areas by\n            drilling wells, rebuilding small irrigation systems,\n            building earthen dams, and procuring and distributing seeds.\n            The third component provides technical assistance to\n            strengthen the technical operations unit, for sub-project\n            identification and implementation, and for a medium term\n            monitoring and prevention strategy.  The fourth and fifth\n            components consist of a project preparation advance and\n            unallocated funding."}, "docdt": "1998-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
