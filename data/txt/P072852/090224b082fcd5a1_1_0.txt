      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through fieldwork. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
     To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is sent for comment by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the
Borrower for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and Borrower comments as appropriate, and the Borrowers'
comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an
assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
      IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sector approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at
their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sector assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, and Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to
which the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s
objectives were achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is
the extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of
capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to
adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory,
Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, or Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, or Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, or Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the Borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agencies’ performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, or Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for two Indonesian projects:
   1. The Second Urban Poverty Project (credit 3658 and loans 4664 and 7752): A
      World Bank IBRD loan 4664 in the amount of US$29.5 million and an IDA credit
      of US$70.5 million, were approved on June 13, 2002. In April 2007 additional
      finance was also approved comprising a credit of US$135.5 million to
      accommodate a large geographic extension of the project to new areas. On July
      22, 2009 the loan was converted into loan 7752 because of a change in the loan
      terms from variable to fixed interest rates. The project closed on December 31,
      2010, two and a half years later than planned, and US$3.2 million was cancelled.

   2. The Third Urban Poverty Project (credit 4063 and loans 4779 and 7759): A
      World Bank IBRD loan of US$67.3 million and an IDA credit of US$71.4
      million, were approved in May 2005. In July 2009 the loan was converted into
      loan 7759 because of a change in the loan terms from variable to fixed interest
      rates. The loan closed as planned on March 31, 2011, with US$66.6 million
      disbursed, and US$0.6 million was cancelled. For the credit, which also closed on
      March 31, 2011, US$71.4 million was disbursed, and an amount of US$0.02
      million cancelled. The cancellations were primarily due to the exchange rate
      fluctuation between the US dollar and the Indonesian Rupiah.
The PPAR is set in the context of the evolution of the Urban Poverty Program (UPP),
which transitioned to become the Indonesian National Community Empowerment
Program (PNPM). UPP1 was not included in this PPAR because it was designed as a
crisis intervention to respond to the 1997 Asian economic crisis; in retrospect, however,
there would have been some value in including it in the evaluation, but lessons from its
implementation are recorded in this report. The Urban Poverty projects aimed to provide
improved services for the urban poor and strengthen community and government
institutions for responsive service delivery.

IEG selected the above projects for a field assessment to verify their results and assess
their sustainability in the context of the ongoing national program. The experiences and
learning from this mission would contribute to the IEG strategic engagement area of
“Sustainable service for the poor.” and to further comparative work on community driven
development (CDD). This report is informed by a review of project documents, including
Implementation Completion and Results Reports (ICRs), Project Appraisal Documents
(PADs), legal documents, and project files and reports as well as discussions held with
Bank staff involved in the projects. A further source of information was studies on PNPM
commissioned by the Government of Indonesia.

An Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) mission visited Indonesia in January 2015 to
review the projects’ results and met with a range of people including national officials
and experts, local officials and project staff. The IEG mission made field visits to project
sites in Pekalongan and Yogyakarta in Central Java. These visits gave the mission
opportunities to engage directly with final beneficiaries of the projects under review. IEG
gratefully acknowledges the courtesies and attention freely given by these interlocutors
                                          xii


and the excellent planning and logistical support received from the Government of
Indonesia Ministries of Finance, Home Affairs and Public Works, as well as local
authorities, community organizations, National and Provincial Planning Agencies and the
Bank’s country office in Jakarta.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR was sent to government
officials and agencies for their review and comments, and no comments were received.

Summary
This is a Project Performance Assessment Report for two Bank supported urban poverty
projects in the Republic of Indonesia. These community-driven development (CDD)
projects formed part of a rapidly evolving Urban Poverty Program (UPP), which
transitioned with Bank support to become the urban component of the Indonesian
National Community Empowerment Program (PNPM) covering the entire country.
Indonesia’s poverty alleviation model covers small infrastructure provision as well as
various forms of social and economic assistance.

Second Urban Poverty Project
The Second Urban Poverty Project (UPP2) was an expansion of the Bank supported first
Urban Poverty Project (UPP1), focused on alleviating urban poverty and fostering greater
involvement of the urban poor in decision-making. UPP2 extended this concept and
became the primary vehicle to help mainstream the Government of Indonesia’s urban
poverty reduction program. Both the Bank and the Borrower realized that greater dialog
with the targeted communities would achieve better consensus on the way forward
through participatory processes. The Government’s decision to scale up the project to
become its national program demonstrated its singular commitment to transform the
project into a vehicle for delivering support to poor communities throughout Indonesia.

Additional financing requested by the Government, enabled coverage to be expanded
from 2,227 to 7,273 kelurahans (urban wards). UPP2 had three development objectives.
The first, was to establish (or further support) representative and accountable community
organizations to provide services for the urban poor and increase their voice in public
decision-making. Second, the project was intended to make local government more
responsive to the needs of the poor through increased cooperation with community
organizations, and third, to improve financial and social services, especially
infrastructure, for the urban poor. Co-financing from the local governments’ own budgets
enabled considerable leverage of the Bank’s contribution.

Third Urban Poverty Project
UPP3 was implemented in parallel to UPP2 and was a further geographical expansion to
the remainder of the country with similar objectives. The project was to cover additional
urban neighborhoods in 15 provinces and, in addition, provided institutional assistance
and grants to further strengthen community organizations supported in the UPP1 and
UPP2 areas. Together, the three UPP operations, using combined IBRD/IDA financing of
US$473 million and government financing of US$ 345 million, resulted in a significant
investment in Indonesia’s urban community development. Since the project closed, IBRD
has committed another US$708 million to further strengthen the program, and this work-
in-progress will bring the Bank’s cumulative investment to over one billion US$ making
the program one of the largest poverty reduction initiatives in the world.

Project Ratings
Virtually all the kelurahans completed community development plans with projects
prioritized by the communities. Boards of Trustees were elected democratically and over
a fifth of members elected were women. Links between communities and local
government were strengthened resulting in additional and sustainable funding at local
level. A strong and transparent management information system (MIS) was established.
Some shortcomings, however, were insufficient evidence of project efficiency,
inadequate maintenance arrangements, and sketchy evidence of improvements to the
“voice of the poor”. Some areas where improvements can still be made are in enhancing
the role of women in civic affairs and in identifying and implementing better ways to
create employment, improve micro lending and small business opportunities.
Performance of revolving credit facilities was also below expectations. The overall
development outcome of both projects was rated moderately satisfactory. Risk to
development outcome, however, was rated negligible to low. Bank and Borrower
performance were rated moderately satisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
The M&E system of necessity had to be extensive to cover the widespread geographical
locations of the beneficiaries and the large volume of data to be collected. Because of this
complexity, the system only became functional in mid-2005, and did not start to generate
values for most performance indicators until 2006, over three years after project
effectiveness. Nevertheless by closure the MIS website was fully operational and
provided ready access to information on the program. Despite early implementation
problems, once the MIS became operational it became invaluable. It helped identify and
remedy issues of service quality, it incorporated better controls, it fine-tuned and targeted
resources where they were most needed, and it improved transparency and strengthened
public confidence in the program.

Lessons
The main lessons are as follows:

    Fundamental to the flourishing of Indonesia’s urban CDD program has been
     the communities’ strong ownership. The program’s popularity is demonstrated
     by the peoples’ willingness to participate in the allocation of small grants for
     community development priorities, provide voluntary labor for the projects, and
     in some instances to freely give up parcels of land for the communal good.

    Facilitators play a crucial role in the success of CDD and more attention should
     be paid to the timely renewal and updating of their contracts and salary payments

    Developing trust and confidence between public officials at the local

  to strengthen the technical capacity of communities to enable them to operate and
  maintain the facilities established and to harmonize planned new investments with
  appropriate maintenance programs and budgets. The facilitators can play a
  stronger role in stressing the importance of maintenance when Community
  Development Plans are drawn up.

1. Background
The Context of Urban Development in Indonesia

1.1     The Republic of Indonesia is a sovereign state in Southeast Asia. It is a vast
archipelago that includes the five large main islands of Java, Kalimantan, New Guinea,
Sulawesi and Sumatera. With a population exceeding 250 million, Indonesia is the
world’s fourth most populous country. Since the mid-sixties, the country has made
progress in reducing its poverty rate. However, the Asian financial crisis of 1997 was a
serious, if temporary, setback to the overall positive trend. During this time, the country
experienced severe economic contraction, depreciation, inflation and political turmoil.
This presaged the end of authoritarian rule and the democratic elections of 1999.
Addressing the discontent and secessionist pressures (East Timor seceded in 1999), the
Government of Indonesia (GoI) inter alia passed new decentralization laws in 2001 that
gave district government greater autonomy and authority over the design and
implementation of local development programs (Ministry of Public Works, 2010). These
laws shifted many responsibilities for government affairs from the central government to
provincial, district and municipal governments and also provided these regional
governments with the financing needed to implement their new mandate.

1.2     Against this background, the GoI created a National Development Plan (known as
Program Pembangunan Nasional or PROPENAS) for the 2000-2004 period aimed at
increased public participation, improved governance, and economic recovery. With
respect to urban development, the plan emphasized the need to establish partnerships
between Government, local communities and the private sector, and to increase efforts to
overcome poverty and social instability. Indonesia’s GNI per capita rose steadily from
US$2,200 in 2000 to US$3,853 in 2013 (World Bank, 2014) and during this period the
country was reclassified as a lower middle-income country.

1.3      However, despite progress in reducing the poverty rates for both the urban and
rural poor, nearly 12 per cent of the country’s population (thirty million people) continues
to live in poverty, while the incomes of about 40 per cent of households are not far above
the poverty line and thus highly vulnerable to economic shocks. In the cities, 18 per cent
of the population is poor or near poor, representing some 20 million people. This is 40
per cent of the poor in Indonesia, but because of rapid urbanization the number of urban
poor is expected to surpass the rural poor by 2020 (Urban Poverty and Program Review,
2013).

1.4     The GoI has a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy and its community
driven development (CDD) program, covering both rural villages and urban wards, is the
largest program of its kind in the world. PNPM Mandiri is the National Program for
Community Empowerment, an umbrella program that brings together all CDD initiatives,
both urban (PNPM urban) and rural (PNPM rural). Unemployment has steadily fallen
from 10.4 per cent of the workforce in 2006 to 5.9 percent in 2014. Social assistance
programs include rice subsidies, health insurance, a conditional cash transfer program
(for the extremely poor), as well as a cash-for-poor-students program. For the urban poor
the CDD program with Bank assistance has delivered block grants for small-scale
                                            2


infrastructure, and, to a lesser extent, small projects for social and economic
development. The urban poor in Indonesia share common characteristics with those in
other countries. They tend to have low education levels, work in the informal sector, live
in low quality housing, lack security of tenure, and have relatively inadequate access to
basic services. Two thirds of the urban poor in Indonesia live on the island of Java.

Bank involvement in Urban Poverty in Indonesia
1.5     Participatory development programs in Indonesia can be traced back to the 1970s,
when Central Government managed these early programs. The first initiative supported
by the Bank was in 1998, the Kecamatan Development Program (KDP), which centered
on rural villages, and in 1999 the first Urban Poverty Project (UPP1) focused on urban
wards or districts known as kelurahans. These programs were intended to help GoI
alleviate the Asian crisis and transition from a top-down to a decentralized development
strategy. KDP’s growth was impressive – from 25 pilot villages in 1997 to over 28,000
villages by 2003 (Guggenheim, S, 2004). UPP1 aimed to improve basic infrastructure in
2,600 low-income kelurahans and strengthen the capability of local agencies at a cost of
US$103 million by project closure. At that time there was political uncertainty and little
trust between the communities and government agencies.

1.6     To better help implement its new strategy, GoI requested the Bank to develop a
Second Urban Poverty Project (UPP2) with Bank financing (initially) of US$127 million.
This project was in effect a scaling-up of UPP1, which, although a crisis intervention, had
already demonstrated that alleviating urban poverty meant securing greater participation
of the urban poor in decision-making. UPP1 had relatively modest objectives and covered
only selected urban areas in Java. UPP2, on the other hand, was intended to expand the
program significantly and became an important mechanism to assist the mainstreaming of
GoI’s urban poverty reduction program. The project covered urban areas in the outer
islands of Sulawesi, Kalimantan and West Nusa Tenggara (as well as some urban areas in
the southern parts of Java that were not covered by UPP1). Importantly, UPP2 set out to
establish or support representative and accountable community organizations able to
provide services to the urban poor and increase their voice in public decision-making. In
April 2007 the Bank approved a request for additional financing in the amount of a
further US$135.5 million to expand the project in support of the Government’s National
Community Empowerment Program (PNPM), extending the program to the rest of the
country in conjunction with UPP3. Thus the coverage was escalated significantly under
UPP2 from 2,227 to 7,273 kelurahans (urban wards). The GOI also contributed a further
US$141 million and the communities US$110 million.

1.7      The Third Urban Poverty Project (UPP3) was a parallel geographical expansion
of the program, but with slightly different components. UPP3 covered 1,736 kelurahans
in 15 provinces in Sumatera, Kalimantan, Maluku, North Maluku, Papua, Bali, and East
Nusa Tenggara. In addition, the project also provided institutional support and grants to
further strengthen approximately 660 community organizations selected in the UPP1 and
UPP2 areas. The emphasis of UPP3 was to strengthen community and government
institutions for more responsive service delivery. UPP3 operated in parallel to UPP2 from
2005 and closed three months later than UPP2 in 2011.

1.8     A recent beneficiary study indicated that the program is an effective approach for
community participation and for addressing basic infrastructure at the community level
(GoI/World Bank, Policy Note, 2013). Risks were identified, however. These centered on
the continuity of program funding, the adequacy of maintenance of community
infrastructure, sound financial management and procurement practices, and the
continuing availability of skilled facilitators. These areas are explored further in this
PPAR, which examines likely sustainability from the progress of three follow-on Bank-
financed projects, the last of which closes in December 2015. The entire urban program,
showing Bank commitments exceeding US$1.2 billion is shown in Table 1.

1.9     In the above table UPP1, 2 and 3 projects have been completed and ICRs have
been prepared and reviewed by IEG. The first two PNPM projects are complete, but no
ICR is yet available; PNPM Urban 2012-2015 is still active. The follow-on projects are
important because they point to the likely sustainability of the whole program. The PPAR
methodology in this regard is to assess evidence in the document files, supervision
reports and from the IEG mission’s discussions and site visits. The UPP/PNPM program
has evolved incrementally over a 16-year period. UPP2 and UPP3 took cognizance of
learning from UPP1 and this process has continued in subsequent projects. The GoI has
also given uninterrupted support to the program, which has now existed (with name
changes) through the tenure of four consecutive Indonesian Presidencies. Indonesia’s
PNPM (urban wards and rural villages) has become the largest CDD program in the
world and as such its outcomes are watched with great interest by other countries and
development partners.

1.10 The PPAR focuses on what lessons have been learned in the urban program as
well as what pitfalls should be avoided as, along the way, a few missteps were apparent
that had to be corrected either in the project concerned or in follow-on projects. There is
considerable overlap between UPP2 and UPP3, and they shared similar development
                                                        4


objectives. The operational approach was similar, except that UPP3 targeted new
kelurahans in several provinces in which the Bank had not previously been involved. The
Bank had the same TTL and several team members common to both projects, while the
GoI created a unified management structure for all UPPs, which provided a solid
foundation for PNPM. In the ICRs for UPP2 and UPP3, some sections are duplicated
word-for-word, because of the identical approach. This PPAR has deliberately avoided
duplicating text, but has cross-referenced some sections in UPP3 with the relevant text
found in UPP2. This has shortened the review of UPP3, while concentrating on aspects
that were indeed different from UPP2.

1.11 An interesting question is the extent to which the UPP covered the targeted urban
communities and the identified poor population prior to becoming a national program.
The data for UPP2 (prior to additional financing) and UPP3 are shown in Table 2 above.
Some 31.9 per cent of the kelurahans were covered, which included 11.6 per cent of the
urban population and 26.6 percent of the urban poor. The earlier UPP1 project covered a
further 23.7 per cent of the kelurahans, meaning 55.6 per cent of all urban wards were
covered in the three projects.

1.12 In 2014, the GoI defined the absolute poor as those with a monthly per capita
income of IDR312, 328 - or about US$26 (www.indonesia-investments.com, 2015). This
is below the World Bank yardstick of US$1.25/day. Some 11.8 per cent of the population
(29 million people) is currently below this threshold, and a similar number live in relative
poverty just above it (World Bank data). At least 54 per cent of Indonesia’s population
resides in cities and this number is projected to rise to 67 per cent by 2025. While in
2014, some 8.2 per cent of urban dwellers were living below the poverty line, this
percentage has steadily declined since 2006, when it was 13.5 per cent. On the other
hand, there is evidence that income inequality has increased because the Gini coefficient
rose from 31.7 in 1999 to 38.1 in 2011 (World Bank data) and this disparity is said to be
worse in urban areas (PAD, National Community Empowerment Program, 2012-2015).
The UPP projects, however, are pro-poor and aim to reduce the degree of inequality.

1.13 Having assisted GoI to scale-up the PNPM to nationwide coverage in almost
11,000 kelurahans, the Bank approved three further projects with a combined further
investment amount of US$708 million between 2008 and 2012. During this time the
focus was on adding value to the program, which included the concept of neighborhood
                                            5


development, and a sustainable livelihoods pilot program described in more detail in
Chapter 4. Funding was also mobilized for disaster risk management under PNPM with
grants of US$2.4 million from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery
(GFDRR), and US$23.5 million for a gender pilot program in Aceh, Sumatera, provided
by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).



2. Second Urban Poverty Project
Objectives, Design, and Relevance
OBJECTIVES

2.1   The objectives of the Project laid out in the development credit agreement (DCA),
3658-IND, schedule 2, are to assist the Borrower:

   i.   To establish or support representative, responsive and accountable community
        organizations that are able to provide services to the urban poor and increase the
        voice of the poor in local decision making;

  ii.   To make local government more responsive to the needs of the poor through
        increased cooperation with community organizations; and

 iii.   To improve services for the urban poor (financial services, social services and
        infrastructure). The loan agreement also refers to schedule 2 of the credit
        agreement in its preamble. When additional finance was approved in April 2007
        the project development objectives were unchanged.

RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

2.2      The objectives of UPP2 were more specifically focused on institutional aspects
than was the case in the preceding project (UPP1). UPP2’s first objective was to assist
communities to establish representative community bodies that would plan and
implement projects that were prioritized by the local people. The Bank and GoI realized
that in scaling-up it would be necessary in UPP2 to improve effectiveness by giving more
attention to ensure the community organizations involved were representative, responsive
and accountable. Moreover, the need to improve the links between local government and
the community organizations was also identified (objective two), while the last objective
was to seek improvement of the services delivered. Over time the program assumed such
importance that GoI requested and was granted additional financing by the Bank in 2007
to enable a major expansion to nationwide coverage. The continued relevance of the
project objectives is emphasized by the request for further Bank support for follow-on
operations and assurances that the program would be implemented until at least the end
of 2015, but most likely beyond.

2.3   At appraisal, the project addressed two of the three pillars of the then current
Bank Country Assistance Strategy FY01-03, namely, sustaining economic recovery and
                                                   6


promoting broad-based growth, and delivering better public services to the poor. In the
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Indonesia FY09-12, current at closure,
“community development and social protection” was one of the five thematic areas that
formed the core of the Bank’s engagement. The CPS for FY09-12 states (pages 26 and
27) that the Bank will “continue to support Government in the design and effective
expansion of programs that promote more inclusive growth and social protection, and
also enhance the accountability of elected officials and service providers.” In 2012 a
short-term CPS was agreed covering the period until 2015, after which a newly elected
Presidential administration would review the priorities with the Bank. The 2013-15 CPS
continued to follow Indonesia’s Master Plan for economic development (Government of
Indonesia, 2011), which included pro-poor support to better reach the poor and
vulnerable households. Thus the objectives continued to be highly relevant. Government
officials in planning and finance with whom the IEG mission discussed this matter did
not anticipate a major change in direction since poverty alleviation would continue as a
priority, but it was expected that there would be more emphasis on slum upgrading.
Relevance of objectives is rated high.

DESIGN

2.4    The project as originally devised was to be implemented in approximately 2,227
kelurahans in thirteen provinces throughout Indonesia. Finance at approval was split
between the Bank (US$100 million), GoI (US$13.28 million) and the communities
(US$13.72 million) for a total of US$127 million. It consisted of four components:

Component A: Community Development and Local Government Capacity Building.
(Project cost: appraisal estimate US$17.08 million; actual at completion US$29.24
million).1

2.5      This component comprised the provision of technical advisory services to carry
out community development and local government capacity building activities, including
(i) the formation (or confirmation) of elected bodies of representatives known as BKMs
(Badan Keswadayaan Masyarakat or Board of Community Trustees), (ii) the formulation
of a community development plan (CDP) for each project kelurahan, using a transparent
and participatory process, and (iii) assistance to BKMs on how to form associations,
known as BKM Forums, as well as to local governments to build capacity for working
with both BKMs and BKM Forums. This component involved a process whereby
facilitators were trained to work directly with communities in project kelurahans and
with local government officials at both provincial and district/city (kabupaten/kota)
levels.

Component B: Kelurahan Grants. (Project cost: appraisal estimate US$58.82 million;
actual at completion US$325.93 million).


1
 All project component costs shown are total costs (IBRD, IDA, GoI and communities). Annex 1 of the
ICR does not give a breakdown of costs from each financing source by component at completion. Strictly
speaking, the community contributions were parallel contributions and not counterpart funds as usually
defined.
                                              7


2.6     This component provided block grants to participating kelurahans to finance
activities identified in the CDP, including: (i) specific high-priority infrastructure
investments, (ii) competitive proposals from community groups consistent with the
priorities in the CDP, (iii) microcredit loans for community groups, and (iv) social safety
programs for the benefit of the poorest and most vulnerable groups or individuals.
Kelurahan grants would not finance activities on the project’s “negative list” (such as
religious buildings or government offices). Each participating kelurahan was eligible to
receive a one-time block grant of IDR 150-500 million to finance investments in one of
more of the above categories, in accordance with their CDPs.

Component C: Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grant. Project cost: Appraisal
estimate US$35.23 million; actual at completion US$88.35 million.

2.7     The purpose of this component was to encourage partnerships between local
government and communities and institutionalize a consultative process between the two
partners for future activities undertaken by local governments. It provided local
governments with access to matching grants (the Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grant
or PAPG) to finance poverty alleviation sub-projects that were: (i) too big to be financed
by the kelurahan grants (in the range of IDR 30-200 million) or that required local
government involvement, (ii) or were located in more than one kelurahan, (iii) that were
not on the negative list for kelurahan grants, and (iv) that were jointly prepared, proposed
and implemented by BKMs in collaboration with the relevant local government
departments. Both local governments and eligible subprojects were to be selected on a
competitive basis.

Component D: Implementation Support. (Project cost: appraisal estimate US$9.73
million; actual at completion US$58.49 million).

2.8    The project was to be managed by a Project Management Unit (PMU) in the
Ministry of Public Works. The PMU hired consultants and facilitators to assist in project
implementation. Technical assistance was provided through National Management
Consultants (NMC) at the central level, and the Oversight Consultant (OC) teams at the
provincial level, with OC offices in the participating district governments, and facilitators
and community cadres at the kelurahan level. NMC and OCs also assisted the Borrower
with monitoring. Evaluation was to be carried out separately by Evaluation Consultants
independent from the NMC.

2.9     Five main lessons were taken from UPP1: Time to build awareness: It became
clear that the building of community awareness took longer than originally thought
necessary and, therefore, more than twice the time was allowed for this process to run its
course in UPP2 and UPP3. Accountability and transparency: Community representatives
were not paid and thus had no vested interests in the elective process. Voters could vote
for any member of the community based on their own previous interactions. Facilitators:
In UPP2, a slightly smaller number of facilitators was planned to create a space to be
filled by volunteer facilitators. According to country office, Bank staff interviewed by the
IEG mission and as discussed in the ICR for UPP1, the practice of paying a two per cent
commission to facilitators for helping to prepare proposals was discontinued since this in
some cases had led to their being called “Mr. two-per-cents.” The poor had perceived the
                                             8


facilitators to be mainly motivated by the commission and some BKM members
expressed doubts about their true commitment.. Accordingly, in UPP2 and 3 they
received a modest salary and no incentive bonus. Need to involve local government more
strongly: The PAPG component was added to UPP2 and UPP3 to try and actively involve
local governments more with community plans. Issues with the micro-credit component:
It was realized in UPP1 that the administrative skills to run a revolving credit program
were not widely available at kelurahan level. While this was found through audit checks
not lead to corruption, there was, nonetheless, a lack of accountability. This led to a more
focused approach involving a stronger awareness process and a requirement for each
BKM to follow standardized rules and principles to operate such funds.

2.10 The components were not revised, but the scope, costs, and Bank financing were
substantially increased as a result of additional financing in 2007 in the amount of
US$135.5 million to expand the project, in support of the Government’s new National
Community Empowerment Program (PNPM). The project was extended to new areas and
coverage was greatly expanded to 7,273 kelurahans. This also provided an opportunity to
strengthen the indicators, and improve the overall quality of monitoring and evaluation
(M&E). The Borrower contribution (GOI and communities) was originally estimated at
US$27 million, but after the project was expanded, it increased significantly to US$250
million. International Development Association (IDA) credits were for US$70.47 million
at appraisal and US$228.19 million at completion. International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (IBRD) loans were US$29.53 million at appraisal and US$29.50
million at completion.

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

2.11 The PAD did not include a complete results framework, as is current practice
today and initially there were no targets for the outcome indicators, (although this was
corrected in the Project Paper for additional financing). Some kelurahans may also have
been selected that were not truly urban. Nevertheless, the development objectives were
clearly stated and there was a logical causal chain for the project design to attain the
project outcomes including components, activities and implementation arrangements. It
was obviously intended that progress towards the first objective (representative,
responsive and accountable) would evolve and not be absolute since indicators specified
the degree of these qualities. The components were developed from the proven approach
used in UPP1 (see par 2.9 above) and accepted by the GoI as a cornerstone of its long-
term poverty alleviation program.

2.12 Component A made provision for local consultants, facilitators and capacity
building to increase the voice of the poor in decision-making as intended by the first
objective. This capacity building was financed through component C (poverty alleviation
grants) and managed together with the rest of the program through component D
(implementation support). Component B (kelurahan grants) was designed to finance
activities in the CDPs including small-scale infrastructure improvements and micro
financed activities. These grants were to enable the achievement of the second objective
to increase cooperation between local government and the needs of the poor, as well as
the third objective to improve services for the urban poor. Overall, the components were
                                                   9


well designed, realistic and not overly ambitious. The relevance of design is accordingly
rated substantial.

IMPLEMENTATION

Institutional Framework

2.13 The implementing agency was the Ministry of Public Works (MPW), which
established a project management unit (PMU). The communities elected voluntary
members to represent them on the community groups (BKMs) for a three-year cycle and
prepared community development plans. The block grants to the BKMs were disbursed
directly from a special account through a commercial bank to bank accounts held by the
BKMs. The Poverty Alleviation Grant (PAPG) allocation to the local government could
only be made through the normal budgeting process and could only be accessed from the
special account if the BKMs and the local government had jointly prepared proposals and
a poverty alleviation strategy was in place. Matching funds were available for local
authorities prepared to contribute grants to the program. The idea was to evolve a fiscal
relationship between the local government and the BKMs and encourage local
government to take more responsibility for such contributions in the future. Each
participating city had to establish an independent selection committee, representative of
the BKMs, local government and NGOs, for dissemination of PAPGs and the evaluation
of proposals.

Implementation Experience

2.14 The original project was approved by the Board on June 13, 2002 and became
effective on November 18, 2002, but startup was eight months later than anticipated
because of delays in consultant recruitment by MPW.

2.15 Since there were some issues in UPP1 with the micro-credit component, UPP2
benefitted from this experience and focused on building more awareness of the rules and
ensuring a standardized set of criteria and principles were first agreed. However, this did
not solve the problem and implementation of this aspect continued to be a concern. A
further change was to ensure local governments were not by-passed by involving them in
the planning and financing of PAPGs. Both the Bank and the implementing agency
adopted a flexible attitude to changes that might become necessary because of specific
local circumstances, so the communities were able to deploy the funds where it mattered
most to them. In 2005 UPP3 was approved for US$138.7 million extending the program
to 14 additional provinces and providing additional institutional support in parallel with
UPP2. Also in 2005, UPP2 was restructured to enable it to provide for emergency
assistance and reconstruction grants to the urban poor following the 2004 earthquake and
tsunami.2



2
  This was to be augmented by a grant of US$1.26 million from the Japanese Social Development Fund.
However, because of the successful establishment of a Multi Donor Trust Fund for this emergency, which
was already deploying substantial resources, it was decided not to implement this aspect of the UPP2
restructuring and the project essentially continued uninterrupted.

Additional Finance

2.16 In 2007, there was a substantial expansion of UPP2 with additional finance
approved in the amount of US$135.5 million. The development objectives were not
changed, but the scope was expanded considerably. Though UPP3 was also active by this
time it made more sense to add finance to UPP2, because the main gap in kelurahan
coverage was the areas expected to be covered by UPP2 and because the project
management staffs in UPP2 were more experienced than those in UPP3 and could more
easily handle the greatly increased volume. The Poverty Alleviation Grants intended to
finance larger projects were not included in the additional financing because the PNPM
program was focused on smaller infrastructure. The financing plan for the original project
and the additional finance are shown in Tables 3 and 4:

Fiduciary Management

2.17 Attention to financial management was necessary throughout implementation, but
the situation did improve after 2007 when a financial management assessment was
undertaken in preparation for the additional finance. IEG examined the Implementation
Status Reports (ISR) ratings for fiduciary management and found they were moderately
satisfactory or better, but noted that the revolving funds, about 10 per cent of total costs,
were sometimes unable to comply with the Bank’s financial management guidelines,
especially those related to safekeeping and the dissemination of financial reports.
Compliance with repayment schedules was also lower than anticipated due to a
misperception by a few beneficiaries that the loans were grants and did not have to be
repaid. The IEG mission ascertained that the strengthening measures introduced in 2007
included enhancements to control measures including improved audit sampling, hiring
additional facilitators, extensive training of facilitators and BKM staff in financial matters
and prior reviews of formal agreements with commercial banks that were to handle local
funds. Revolving fund loans henceforth were to be limited to those kelurahans that had
already benefitted under the component and had demonstrated repayment rates of at least
80 per cent. It was identified, however, that further analysis was necessary on the
weaknesses of revolving funds. Despite these improvements, the financial management
risk was still considered high and continuous attention had to be given to mitigate these
risks to the extent possible.

2.18 Procurement followed Bank guidelines as laid out in the UPP2 operational
manual. This document greatly increased the transparency of the procurement process
and after tightening the rules under the review that accompanied the additional finance
the adherence to the procedures was said by both Government officials and Bank staff to
have improved. The IEG mission noted that audit reports were generally furnished on
time and only one audit report (for fiscal 2005) had a qualified opinion. This case was
due to significant differences between aggregate financial expenditures reported and
those actually spent. On investigation, however, the financial management team
established that there was a misunderstanding because the reported figures excluded
expenditures pre-financed by the GoI. Minor internal control weaknesses (mentioned
above) at the PMU level were followed up and procedures strengthened. BKMs were also
audited on a sample basis (minimum 20 per cent). An anti-corruption plan was
implemented, and improved in 2007 with civil society oversight as well as a complaints
handling mechanism. No known misuse of funds occurred due to financial management
weaknesses.

Safeguards

2.19 Reporting on compliance with safeguard policies was superficial in the ICRs for
both UPP2 and UPP3 and did not include a compliance rating. The ISRs indicated these
ratings to have been moderately satisfactory or better. There had been no individual sub-
projects expected to exceed the ceiling of US$3,000 for individual sub-projects or micro-
loans and US$20,000 for PAPGs; none of the projects were expected to have any large-
scale, significant or irreversible impacts and so the overall project was classified as
category B (correctly, in IEG’s view since the sub-projects were of the size anticipated).
While it is always possible that the cumulative effect of many sub-projects in close
                                             12


proximity could have a more substantial effect (OED, 2005) there was no evidence of this
in the Indonesian case since the sub-projects were not clustered too closely together.
Safeguard policies triggered were environmental assessment (OP 4.01), natural habitats
(OP 4.04), cultural property (OP 4.11), indigenous peoples (OP 4.10) and involuntary
resettlement (OP 4.12). Negative environmental impacts recorded were mainly due to
poor site management; other safeguard policies, though flagged, were not contravened.

2.20 The IEG mission inter alia visited three riverside improvement projects and found
no evidence of site mismanagement. There was also no involuntary resettlement,
although in some cases residents had given up land for the purpose of allowing walkways
to be built adjacent to the rivers. In these cases the land was either voluntarily donated to
the community or compensation was negotiated in the form of home improvements for
the affected households. The mission also observed that many of the sub-projects actually
generated substantial social and environmental benefits, especially through investments
in drainage, water supply and sanitation. Road improvements giving better access to
schools also improved safety in their vicinity. In a few cases waste was sorted and
recycled; these eco-activities produced compost used to nurture plantings of shrubs and
trees. Local students also decorated some concrete walls with artwork.

2.21 The IEG mission met with safeguard specialists in the Bank office in Jakarta.
They indicated that, although part of the team, they were not always adequately consulted
when documents like ICRs were prepared. They clarified, however, that Bank procedures
were generally followed in the implementation of UPP2 and 3 and the minor adverse
impacts that came to their attention were because of inadequate guidance, monitoring and
supervision by facilitators and oversight consultants. This aspect was corrected by
additional training and through illustrated manuals produced in Bahasa and English
showing correct and incorrect construction practices. Sub-projects were not accepted if
they used items on a negative list (such as illegal timber) or if they could cause adverse
impacts on cultural property. However, records of potential social and environmental
impacts, given that there were literally thousands of sub-projects, remained patchy and
could still be improved.

ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

Efficacy

Objective One: To establish or support representative, responsive and accountable
community organizations that are able to provide services to the urban poor and
increase the voice of the poor in local decision making. Substantially achieved

Representativeness and Responsiveness:

Outputs:

    All participating kelurahans to complete and ratify community development plans
     (CDPs) for the provision of services to the urban poor, 99 per cent achieved
     (target 100 per cent);
                                            13


       Beneficiary communities, local authorities and other targeted areas to receive
        technical support from national management consultants, oversight consultant
        teams and other facilitators, 99 per cent achieved (target 90 per cent);
       Participation in community discussions by the kelurahan members during project
        implementation, 19 per cent achieved (target 30 per cent);
       Voting in the final stage of Board of Trustee (BKM) elections, two per cent
        achieved (target three per cent).
       Percentage of women elected to BKMs, 22 percent achieved (target 20 per cent).
       Percentage of the adult population voting in BKM elections at neighborhood
        level, 35 per cent achieved (target 30 per cent);
       Community volunteers recruited per kelurahan, 44 achieved (target 25);
       Participation by women and vulnerable groups, 42 per cent achieved (target 30
        per cent).

Outcome:
       At least 5,092 (70 per cent) of the BKMs to be operating in a representative,
        effective and participatory manner (<70 per cent achieved; based on the above
        output indicators and the judgment of evaluation consultants who assess the
        information provided by the kelurahans).

2.22 The project established over 5,000 democratically elected BKMs. All community
members had the opportunity to propose BKM members and to vote in a secret ballot.
The program became a pillar of the National Poverty Alleviation Strategy and it was
rolled out to all 11,000 kelurahans.

2.23 The facilitators together with trained volunteers helped socialize the communities
to increase awareness of the purpose and the process of the elections. Nearly all the
participating kelurahans completed and ratified CDPs and of these more than two thirds
of the plans were implemented against a target of 25 per cent. The CDPs were presented
for comment at open community meetings. The main targets of capacity building under
the project have been the facilitators. They play a crucial role in the success or otherwise
of the program as they are the frontline at community level. Their responsibilities include
assisting both BKMs and KSMs in proposal writing, budgeting and cost control, technical
project guidance, making provision for maintenance, prioritization, socialization3,
community mapping, monitoring construction works and ensuring compliance with
guidelines. They also are instrumental in the setting up the BKMs, helping the
communities to understand the principles and practice of elections and ensuring that the
participation of women and the really poor meet the targets set. Mansuri and Rao (2013)
report that positive feedback on facilitators from communities is linked to the frequency
of their visits.

2.24 While the quantitative targets for voter turnout and female representation were
met and two thirds of the communities were aware of the proposals, IEG notes that the
average participation level in discussions about the projects was lower than expected (19
per cent against 30 per cent). According to the facilitators and others interviewed by IEG,

3
    Community awareness and understanding
                                           14


the whole process was new to the communities, but participation gradually improved
over time and continued to improve after the project closed. However, it was also clear
that since many people had competing commitments, not everyone wanted to become
involved in detailed discussions.

2.25 Female participation was higher than expected, but the quality of women’s inputs
was apparently very variable depending on the cultural norms of the communities
concerned. Whereas the IEG mission observed women freely participating in Central
Java, studies show that in more conservative areas of Indonesia their participation was
largely confined to providing refreshments and men made nearly all the important
decisions.

2.26 Further evidence comes from a study of UPP2 by Pradhan, M et al of the World
Bank Development Economics Group in 2010. This study carried out three impact
evaluation surveys using questionnaires and interviews between 2004 and 2007, (i.e.
prior to additional financing). The surveys covered 15,000 people in 73 treatment and 38
control kelurahans randomly selected in four provinces. The study used a logistic model
that found that BKM members were predominantly from the upper end of the educational
spectrum. They were in general better off and often had official connections. However,
this was not necessarily elite capture, but a recognition by the community that such
persons were more likely to provide appropriate management and leadership skills. IEG
notes that some experts argue that there is a greater risk of elite capture in urban
development when the gap between poor and non-poor is large (see Darmawan, R and
Klasen, S, 2013). Most people living in UPP areas expressed satisfaction with the
program, but IEG notes the limitation of beneficiary surveys in that they tend to be prone
to biased responses, including hoping that positive responses will lead to receiving
further unspecified potential benefits. All studies after 2007 focused on the PNPM as a
whole and not just the UPP-financed part of it.

Increased Voice of the Poor:

    Participation by women and vulnerable groups, 42 per cent achieved (target 30
     per cent).

2.27 Although information is given for women and vulnerable groups, there is no
target indicator specifically for the number of poor people participating (some women are
not poor). In terms of the targeting of UPP2 at appraisal, however, information from the
MIS shows that 3.4 million poor people and 0.9 million poor households were eligible
participants. With the additional financing in 2007 all kelurahans became eligible for the
program regardless of income level.

2.28 In the project design in the PAD the richest communities were excluded and those
with the higher incidence of poverty were included in consultation with local
government. Some 42 per cent of women and vulnerable groups (such as disabled,
elderly and infirm) participated, as opposed to a target of 30 per cent. Through
socialization and poverty mapping by the BKMs and volunteers, the poorer community
members were given the opportunity to become involved, but frequently they had other
pressing demands on their time, since making a living was a constant challenge. Since
                                            15


they were free to nominate whoever they wished in the community to represent them,
they would usually nominate articulate, educated people such as teachers or public
servants, who were likely of course to be more affluent.

2.29 The CDPs were developed following a community self-survey process using pro-
poor planning methods. The CDPs identified individuals for special grant assistance (e.g.
medicines, health care, food supplements etc.) and up to 10 per cent of the BKM
allocation could be used for such purposes. A “complaints handling system” was
developed and was accessible to all.

2.30 There was no shortage of volunteers to assist with the project work (44 per
kelurahans against a target of 25). Many of the volunteers worked on a pro bono basis
and prior to the additional finance some 25,537 members were actively assisting the poor.

Accountability: (refers to transparency and awareness as well as financial
accountability)

Outputs:

    Kelurahan population aware of CDPs, 25 per cent target (no actual figure
     available in ICR);
    Kelurahan population awareness of the project and of its objectives, 66 per cent
     achieved (target 25 per cent);
    Oversight consultant teams to provide accurate and timely data on the operations
     of kelurahans and cooperation with local government through the MIS, 87 per
     cent achieved (target 90 per cent);
    Ninety nine per cent of BKMs completed annual financial audits (target 40 per
     cent);
    Repayment rates of revolving credit better than 90 per cent were achieved in 49
     per cent of cases (target was 70 per cent).

2.31 With regard to transparency, the public received information from newsletters,
advertisement boards and was free to attend all meetings. The MIS system was open to
the public and contained information on indicators, bids and awards, as well as all
complaints and responses to such complaints.

2.32 Attention to financial management was necessary throughout implementation due
to inadequate capacity and skills at BKM level, but the situation improved after 2007
when a financial management assessment was undertaken in preparation for the
Additional Finance. An analysis of the implementation supervision reports and interim
financial reports showed, however, that although there were problems the performance
was not worse than moderately satisfactory. The IEG mission ascertained that the
strengthening measures introduced in 2007 included enhancements to control measures
including improved audit sampling, hiring additional facilitators, simplifying financial
reporting complexity, extensive training of facilitators and BKM staff in financial matters
and prior reviews of formal agreements with commercial banks that were to handle local
funds.
                                            16


2.33 Revolving funds, accounting for about a quarter of kelurahan grant amounts, did
not always comply with the Bank’s financial management guidelines due to a lack of
skills, especially those related to safekeeping and the dissemination of financial reports.
Compliance with repayment schedules was also lower than anticipated due to a
misperception by a few beneficiaries that the loans were grants and did not have to be
repaid. Revolving fund loans after 2007 were limited to those kelurahans that had already
benefitted under the component and had demonstrated repayment rates of at least 80 per
cent. It was identified, however, that further analysis was necessary on the weaknesses of
such funds. The financial management risk was still considered high and continuous
attention had to be given to mitigate these risks to the extent possible.

2.34 Procurement followed Bank guidelines as detailed in the UPP2 operational
manual. This document greatly increased the transparency of the procurement process
and after tightening the rules under the review that accompanied the additional finance
the adherence to the procedures was said by both Government officials and Bank staff to
have improved. An Anti-Corruption Plan was put in place, but few actual instances of
corruption were evident since the communities themselves were self-policing. At the end
of 2010 it was reported that only 13 corruption cases were substantiated, accounting for a
misuse of US$183,000, most of which was recovered.

2.35 The IEG mission noted that audit reports were generally furnished on time and
only one audit report (fiscal 2005) had a qualified opinion. This case was due to
significant differences between aggregate financial expenditures reported and those
actually spent. On investigation, however, the financial management team established
that there was a misunderstanding because the reported figures excluded expenditures
pre-financed by the GoI. Minor internal control weaknesses at the PMU level were
followed up and procedures strengthened. BKMs were also audited on a sample basis
(minimum 20 per cent).

2.36 Overall, taking into account the setting up of BKM’s that were representative,
responsive and accountable, the objective made significant progress, although there is
limited evidence on the extent of strengthening the voice of the poor. The objective was,
notwithstanding, substantially achieved.

Objective Two: To make local government more responsive to the needs of the poor
through increased cooperation with community organizations. Substantially
achieved, but with some shortcomings with respect to the needs of the poor.

The phrase “more responsive to the needs of the poor” is somewhat vague, but the idea
was to encourage local government to understand what they could do in terms of
supporting poverty alleviation and be more proactive in partnering with local
communities to achieve this goal. The incentive was access to additional funding in
return for a willingness to form joint proposals and to treat each other as equal partners.
Since this involved creating an understanding of what was required, including an
understanding of the government’s poverty alleviation strategy, a series of workshops and
focus group discussions were held for local government. Communities could have been
surveyed to ascertain whether they believed local government had become more
responsive as a result.
                                             17


Outputs:

    Forty poverty alleviation partnership grant (PAPG) cities (and their selection
     committees) participated in the project (target 30)
    The number of partnership grant sub-projects per city was 81, (target of 40).
    A policy paper on long-term poverty alleviation was published by central
     government.
    Fifty seven per cent of participating local governments formed Trustee Forums
     (target 40 per cent).

Outcomes:
    The contribution of local governments co-financing in poverty alleviation grant
      supported initiatives was 43 per cent against a target of 25 per cent.
    Regarding finance, 117 local governments provided their own resources for
      project monitoring, participation in partnerships with kelurahans, channeling of
      resources to support CPDs and implementation. The target was 78. On average
      communities contributed over 30 per cent of total investment costs.

2.37 PAPG grants financed sub-projects (mostly infrastructure) that were too big to be
financed through kelurahan grants or involved more than one kelurahan. Co-financing
funded from the local governments’ own budgets enabled considerable leverage of the
Bank’s contribution. This increased over time due to legislated changes in the financial
arrangements. From 2008, provincial, district and municipal level governments selected
to participate in the project were required to finance kelurahan grants from their own
budgetary resources. From 2009 they also had to finance at least 50 per cent of PAPGs
from their own resources. The introduction of the Trustee Forums (comprising
representatives of local government and clusters of BKMs) enabled the sharing of ideas
and experiences. This proved beneficial according to IEG interviews and in many
instances such gatherings led to more joint activities. The practice has been continued in
subsequent projects and supports the GoI’s policy of decentralization.

2.38 This PAPG pilot was introduced in 2009 to strengthen linkages between
communities and local governments. The intention was to encourage constructive
partnerships between local governments and communities. In UPP2 some 30 cities were
expected to participate and in the end 40 took part, there were 81 sub-projects per city as
opposed to the target of 40, and the contribution from local governments to such projects
was 43 per cent against a target of 25 per cent. Upon completion of the PAPGs the
partnership arrangement usually continued, though the mechanism was often adapted to
suit local circumstances such as available budget and the orientation of city planning.
According to the MIS some 75 per cent of local governments in Indonesia now provide
counterpart funds. The ones that contributed to PAPG contributed more than 40 per cent
of the funds for sub-projects. The outcome was a greater level of interaction according to
the RAND study (2011). While a primary driver for local government was to leverage
additional funds there was also an imperative to enhance local government planning.
Because the local government had to consent to the communities’ plans, the review
process brought the parties together at least once a year usually with positive results. The
second objective, which was to make local government more responsive to the needs of
                                                 18


the poor through increased cooperation with community organizations, was substantially
achieved.

Objective Three: To improve services for the urban poor (financial services, social
services and infrastructure). Substantially achieved.

Infrastructure:

Outputs:
    Fifty six per cent of all poor households in kelurahans covered by the project
       benefitted from infrastructure grants (target 35 per cent),
    About 58 per cent of kelurahan grants were invested in physical infrastructure,
       primarily housing rehabilitation, village roads, bridges, irrigation canals, drainage,
       sanitation facilities including public toilets, and water supply as shown in Table 5.

A breakdown of costs by sub-sector is not provided, but is available for UPP3, which
would be fairly similar.

Social Services:
    Fifty three per cent of poor families received financial social grant assistance
       (target 10 per cent).
    Sixteen percent of the kelurahan grants financed social infrastructure and
       services.

Regarding social services, 59 per cent of poor households received social assistance
against a target of 15 per cent. These amounts were generally small and were for such
things as scholarships, skills training, child and reproductive health matters, and support
for the elderly.

Financial Services:
    About 27 per cent of kelurahan grants were on lent as micro-credit loans.
                                            19


    Grants for micro-credit loans and social services were channeled to the poorest
     residents.
    Sixty one per cent of grant recipients were women (target 30 per cent)
    The project provided 19 percent of all poor households in its coverage area with
     access to microcredit through revolving funds (target 15 per cent).

2.39 Overall, two thirds of the funds were spent on physical infrastructure including
9,780 km of village roads, 261 small bridges, 358 km of irrigation canals, 983 km of
drainage facilities, nearly 50,000 clean water supply units, over 52,000 sanitation units,
and over 60,000 house improvements. The remaining third of the funding provided
revolving credit as well as social assistance grants. According to the Pradham Study,
(pre-2007) access to adequate sanitation increased by three percent for the general
population and ten per cent for the poorest quintile. The same study found that many of
the persons that received project-funded credit were able to secure lower interest rates
than from alternative sources. However, the survey was unable to identify a statistically
significant impact on the welfare of the population living in the UPP2 project areas.
Nevertheless, based on the findings of several surveys, despite their limitations described
in paragraph 2.26, a 2013 policy evaluation study concludes that most community
respondents perceived the urban poverty programs as well received and beneficial
(GoI/World Bank, 2013).

2.40 Micro credit facilities via revolving funds had some success, but the loan
repayment rate was lower than expected. While some 19 per cent of poor people had
access to the revolving funds the percentage of revolving funds with repayment rates in
excess of 90 per cent was 49 per cent against a target of 70 per cent. Some beneficiaries
claimed they thought they were being given grants, while others used the loans for
consumption purposes. Only between 17 and 26 per cent of beneficiaries, according to
the RAND Corporation Study, were likely to experience income increases due to the UPP
loan. The RAND Corporation in association with SurveyMETER (2011) carried out a
process evaluation in 16 kelurahans from 16 provinces of which 13 were randomly
chosen and three purposely selected. Data gathering involved focus groups and in depth
interviews as well as data drawn from the MIS. A study by the Micro Finance Innovation
Center in Jakarta noted that training in basic business management was needed (MICRA,
2008). It is also evident that the poorest people were not usually considered creditworthy,
so despite good intentions loans tended to be allocated to those who appeared more likely
to be economically productive. Because of the relatively inadequate performance of
micro-credit loans, such funds were restricted from 2007 onwards to a 10 per cent ceiling
of kelurahan grants. As a result the share of kelurahan grants allocating such loans fell to
11.7 per cent after the additional financing.

2.41 In summary, it is clear that the population received many outputs (sub-projects)
and that they would rather continue doing this than not. However, outcome evidence is
thin. There was little evidence of health improvements or improved income from sales or
reduced travel time for example. While these benefits likely existed, they were not
measured and included in the results framework. Based on the available evidence, the
objective of service provision was modestly achieved.

Efficiency
                                             20


2.42 Given the low cost and large number of the individual sub-projects financed, the
Bank project teams contended that it would not serve a useful purpose to estimate
economic rates of return, since the sub-projects were not pre-defined, but were demand
driven by the communities. In addition they claimed the standard economic feasibility
analysis was not supported because of capacity constraints at local level, and the
relatively high cost of undertaking such analysis. Instead efficiency was gauged by unit
rate norms, which were considered by the teams to be a useful measure for community
executed infrastructure projects. This approach commenced with UPP1 and has been
continued through all six projects in the UPP program.

2.43 IEG does not concur with this view, however, as a sample of expected returns
from typical projects could have been made as recommended in its 2005 study on CDD
(OED, 2005). Comparing other Indonesian CDD projects, the findings of an early study
commissioned by the National Planning Board Agency (BAPPENAS) showed that for a
random sample of 32 projects, the average return was 52 per cent. Only three projects
were under 12 per cent, nine projects were between 12 and 24 per cent and 20 projects
were over 50 per cent. This did not include a general income multiplier factor of 1.16.
Similar rates of return were also evident from village infrastructure projects and KDP
projects (National Planning Board, 2005). While it is probable that similar high economic
returns could be expected in UPP sub-projects, which constitute a fairly similar mix of
infrastructure types, this is still conjecture and lacks evidence.

2.44 In terms of cost efficiency, the 2005 BAPPENAS study found that the average
construction cost of CDD projects was 49 per cent lower than those undertaken by
contractors of local governments. This was primarily due to the high level of voluntary
labor contributed by residents in CDD projects. A 2009 study of PNPM sub-projects (that
were also part of UPP2) in 12 kelurahans in six diverse urban areas on three major
islands concluded that community-driven infrastructure activities were on average 21 per
cent cheaper while projects undertaken by contract, and that local materials could be up
to 70 per cent cheaper, while community work was also exempt from taxation (LPPM,
2010). Similarly, small-scale infrastructure constructed by communities in a parallel
Bank-financed project in Aceh/Nias was 23 per cent less than projects undertaken by
local government.

2.45 Overall, the preparation and supervision costs of UPP2 were unusually low,
accounting for less than 0.4 per cent of the loan size and there were no major cost
overruns. Additional financing extended the reach of the program to new areas and was
not to finance higher than expected costs. With regard to the quality of the infrastructure
built in the communities, the RAND Corporation study found that most respondents
(including government officials) believed that the project quality was acceptable and
often better than similar government constructed projects. Objective assessments by
professional engineers were also largely positive (Burger, N et al 2011).

2.46 The revolving credit funds, on the other hand, were less efficient than expected
because of insufficient training and weak management of micro-loans. Consequently,
such funds were cut back and assigned only to beneficiaries with a proven track record.
                                            21


2.47 Overall, although an indirect case has been made for the likely extent of
efficiency, in the absence of direct evidence, efficiency is rated modest.

Ratings
OUTCOME

2.48 The project outcome rating is defined as “the extent to which the project’s major
relevant objectives were achieved, or expected to be achieved, efficiently.” UPP2 is
notable in that the GoI decided to adopt the program and expand it to make it the national
model for CDD in Indonesia, an expansion accomplished in just three years. Taking into
account the high relevance of the project objectives, substantial relevance of project
design, and that two of the three project objectives were substantially achieved (though
not without minor shortcomings), together with modest efficiency (due to a lack of
evidence), the overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

2.49 The risk to development outcome is the risk that the anticipated development
outcomes of the project will not be maintained or realized. UPP2 is part of a program that
began in 1999 and is to continue with Bank support until at least the end of 2015 and
likely beyond in a modified form. In 2007 the design supported by the Bank was accepted
as the model for rolling out a national CDD program. The Government has shown solid
commitment to this program as a major pillar of its poverty alleviation strategy.
Moreover, during the program’s 16-year life the Bank has developed a close long-term
partnership with the GoI, and officials advised the IEG mission that the advice and
assistance from the Bank has proved invaluable. The project has contributed to
establishing reasonably effective, participatory and representative community committees
that can mobilize funds through the preparation of CDPs. Both central and local
governments have indicated a strong and long-term commitment to the financing of such
plans. A large number of local governments elected to co-finance implementation of
CDPs from their own financial resources after the project’s kelurahan grants were
disbursed in full, using the planning and financing principles developed under
Component C of the project.

2.50 The communities take responsibility for the maintenance of their projects. This
takes several forms including repairs by community members living in the project
vicinity, repairs by persons paid by the community, and funds collected or contributed for
the purpose of maintenance by the residents. The IEG mission took particular note of the
state of maintenance in the projects observed in eight communities. In two cases there
were minor problems such as weeds growing between paving blocks and trash that had
not been cleaned up, but on the whole there were no serious problems, and in fact levies
at public toilets normally exceeded cleaning costs and made a small profit for the
community. Residents living adjacent to public washroom facilities often did not have
such facilities in their own homes and established a roster system to keep them clean. In
just one case IEG found a facility that fell short of the required standards. The
communities have a strong sense of ownership and for that reason wish to keep the
projects in good condition. Admittedly, however, because of the relatively short period
                                             22


that most projects have been in service few major repairs have yet been necessary. The
maintenance aspect is therefore considered to be a moderate risk.

2.51 Most importantly the Government at both central and local level is committed to
the continuance of the program and funding has continued to be made available from
allocations transferred to the regions. Such transfers increased by 9.3 per cent from 2014
to 2015 - this was a real increase of 2.8 per cent taking account of inflation (Indonesia
Investments, 2015). The new administration in Indonesia will discuss a new partnership
agreement with the Bank during 2015. Early indications are that the emphasis will be on
slum upgrading using the same model developed for PNPM, and on eliminating
infrastructure bottlenecks.

2.52 Finally, the GoI and the Bank have worked together over the past 16 years to
improve the program with various innovations and pilots. These improvements are
discussed in chapter 4 on sustainability. Taking all these factors into account, the risk to
development outcome is rated as negligible to low.

BANK PERFORMANCE

Quality at Entry

2.53 The model developed and refined by the Bank and the Government has been
accepted as the national modus operandi for CDD in Indonesia. Since the legal
documents stipulated general principles rather than implementation details, this allowed
the project to be based on a project manual prepared by the GoI. This gave the Bank and
the Borrower the flexibility to modify implementation arrangements in response to
changing circumstances and reduced the cost of supervision and preparation. Flexibility
was also built into the design of the block grant component insofar as communities were
able to allocate available funds to the priorities that mattered most to them. On the other
hand the results framework lacked targets and baseline figures at appraisal and there was
also no attempt to estimate efficiency other than by reference to cost savings and
inferences of results from other projects.

2.54 Three key lessons were included in the project based on the experiences in UPP1,
namely: i) the need for additional time to build solid consensus in communities on the
best way forward – in UPP2 four to six months was allowed for improving awareness and
socialization as opposed to less than two months under UPP1; ii) the need to establish
clear standardized criteria, rules and principles for the operation of the revolving funds
(arguably these are still insufficient); and iii) the need to mainstream community
development plans into local government policies and activities to encourage productive
and sustainable relationships with the communities. This led to the introduction of the
PAPG component aimed at a stronger degree of local government support and
participation. In order to address governance issues and strengthen anti corruption
policies, the Bank worked closely with the MPW, the implementing agency, to design
and improve a “complaints mechanism” also based on a model conceived under UPP1.

2.55 On the other hand, not all risks were adequately mitigated. For example, despite a
history of avoidable delays due to late budget approvals and consultant appointments, this
                                                         23


aspect did not feature as a risk in the project preparation. The PAD proposed cancellation
of the PAPGs where communities and local governments were unable to work together,
but this appears at odds with the notion that these grants were intended to bring the
parties together.4To ensure the availability of proposed counterpart funding, the PAD also
advocated the principle of requiring the counterpart funds to be used first, but this proved
difficult to apply in practice. Despite the fact that historically in Indonesia problems with
financial management and inadequate management of infrastructure facilities were
commonplace in Bank projects, the risks of weaknesses in the monitoring of funds by
kelurahans and inadequate maintenance of infrastructure were rated, somewhat
surprisingly, as negligible to low. Fortunately, the documents in respect of additional
financing contained a more thorough risk analysis with specific mitigation measures.

2.56 More significantly, the establishment of stronger criteria and rules for the
operation of revolving funds, though a move in the right direction, was insufficient. There
were serious issues with non-payment and the financial management proved inadequate.
In addition, there were a few weaknesses in M&E design, which were also addressed to
the extent possible retrospectively during the preparation of additional financing.

2.57 Although the method of selecting participating kelurahans included criteria such
as excluding the 30 per cent richest sub-districts in a participating district, as well as
those with a high poverty incidence of at least 20 per cent, in practice the selection
procedure proved more complicated and was not always consistent. This led to the
selection of some neighborhoods that were more peri-urban and less populated in nature
than intended. This could largely have been avoided if information on population
densities had been obtained during preparation. Thus there were moderate shortcomings
in preparation and appraisal and the quality at entry rating is moderately satisfactory.

Quality of Supervision

2.58 The Bank deployed a largely local multi-disciplinary team with expertise in
project management, financial management, procurement, and safeguard policy
compliance. On average there were four supervision missions a year involving coverage
of at least150 kelurahans, and this enabled the Bank to try to proactively tackle issues as
they arose. Although not mentioned in the ICR, the IEG mission established from
discussions with and records from safeguards specialists, that appropriate due diligence
was undertaken with regard to ensuring that any safeguard related infringements were
rectified as soon as possible. Other matters tackled by the supervision team included
helping resolve problems concerning delays in the establishment of the MIS, budget
execution and revision, consultant mobilization, and facilitator recruitment.

2.59 Despite these intensive efforts, the project “continued to be plagued by less than
fully satisfactory performance of the MIS and financial management of the revolving
funds, especially in the early part of the implementation period.”5 The National
Management Consultant’s mid-term review noted that there had been delays and these

4
    In the event, this proved to be a non-issue as the parties worked well together in virtually all cases
5
    ICR page 14
                                            24


were primarily due to a higher turnover of facilitators than expected because of delays in
salary payments, and delays in the disbursement of kelurahan funds due to a change in
the regulations for channeling them.

2.60 However, such delays were eventually compensated in part by the fact that the
project team, together with the Borrower, was able to achieve a fourfold expansion in
project coverage and activities following the approval of additional financing. The Bank
team ensured that sufficient capacity was added on the Borrower side to meet the
expanded project needs, improvements were made in disbursement capacity, while
additional training programs were added for facilitators and other consultants. The team
also modified funding rules to mobilize additional PAPG contributions from local
government budgets, while the anti corruption measures and the complaints handling
system were progressively improved in close cooperation with the implementing agency.
Although the team proactively assisted the Borrower in changing the composition of the
kelurahan grant allocations away from the poorly performing micro credits in favor of
social infrastructure targeting the very poor, this was a de facto admission that the system
to provide small loans as devised was not working. Greater attention could also have
been directed to the future maintenance aspects of the sub-projects. Quality of
supervision is rated moderately satisfactory and, overall Bank performance is rated
moderately satisfactory.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

Government Performance

2.61 Because the project was fully in line with Government policy it secured strong
commitment from the GoI and was prepared in just twelve months, which is above
average for Bank-financed projects in Indonesia especially considering the size and
complexity of the initiative. The Government’s decision to scale-up the project to nearly
four times its original size demonstrated its singular commitment to transform the project
into a vehicle for delivering support to poor communities throughout Indonesia.

2.62 Despite this signal achievement, however, the GoI could have been much more
proactive in preventing delays in budget execution, since revisions were amongst the
principal causes of the extended implementation period. This situation was also
exacerbated by a further slow-down in the months following the 2004 national election.
The best performing kelurahans were rewarded with additional grants, but some of the
most impoverished districts were excluded, because of non-performance or lack of
interest. The Government recognized, however, that progress would be incremental and
that the program would have to be improved over time. This also applied to the adequacy
of capacity with the massive scale-up of the project; GoI was aware that there was a
history of delays and errors in procurement due to the PMU’s limited capacity. Moreover,
facilitators’ contracts were renewed annually, which did not provide certainty or
reliability and together with late salary payments partly accounted for the shortage of
facilitators, who played such a key role. Government performance overall was
moderately satisfactory.

Implementation Agency Performance
                                             25


2.63 The implementing agency, the MPW, with the collaboration of the Bank
accomplished the fourfold expansion of the complex project within a year. It also fully
supported the bottom-up community driven approach adopted in the project. Though not
without roll-out problems the M&E system in time made the outcomes of the project
reasonably transparent to communities and indeed all stakeholders. In due course, MPW
adapted the MIS to cover PNPM as a whole. The implementing agency was also willing
to be flexible when implementation arrangements needed to be modified, and responsive
to complaints – or even suspicions that funds had been misused.

2.64 This said there were several avoidable problems that could have been corrected
with stronger implementing agency management. These included poor compliance with
established financial management procedures in respect of revolving funds, and late
payments to facilitators. There were also delays in the MPW recruitment of consultants to
act as facilitators at both national and local levels. Delays in consultant recruitment meant
too that the government’s survey of project results, based on key performance indicators,
had not been delivered at the time that ICR was being prepared, though ultimately the
project outcomes were delivered satisfactorily. Implementing agency performance was
rated moderately satisfactory and overall borrower performance moderately
satisfactory.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

2.65 The M&E system of necessity had to be extensive to cover the widespread
geographical locations of the beneficiaries and the large volume of data to be collected.
Responsibility was given to the MPW to establish and operate the MIS. The initial
concept was that the MIS should encompass UPP1, 2 and 3 and the intention was for the
information to be regularly updated and publicly accessible through the web. It was also
envisaged that it would include a system for posting and dealing with complaints. The
MIS was over-ambitious in terms of complexity and data demands in the time planned for
its implementation and it also took longer than expected to design. Six out of eight
outcome indicators and five of the 31 outcome indicators required a survey. Many of the
indicators proposed in the PAD also lacked baseline data and time-bound targets, while
more attention should have been given to measuring the participation and voice of the
poor, as well as the responsiveness of local government.

2.66 Because of this complexity, the system only became functional in mid-2005, and
did not start to generate values for most performance indicators until 2006, over three
years after project effectiveness. To address the lack of progress the implementing
agency appointed a team of consultants to undertake this activity and delayed payment
until the data were brought up to the required standard. Together with spot check
monitoring, these measures improved the quality of information, although some data
collection problems, according to the ICR, remained throughout implementation.
Nevertheless by closure the MIS website was fully operational and provided ready access
to information on the program.

2.67 Despite early implementation problems, once the MIS became operational it
became invaluable. It helped identify and remedy issues of service quality, it incorporated
better controls, it fine-tuned and targeted resources where they were most needed, and it
                                            26


improved transparency and strengthened public confidence in the program. The public
was able to see the fairness of the resource allocation process and the tangible benefits to
poor households were visible. The outputs of the system became publicly available on the
National Community Empowerment Program website www.p2kp.org in the form of
downloadable Microsoft Excel and PDF files most of which are updated on a monthly
basis.

2.68 From 2007 onwards, the system also published information on contracts financed
by the project and payments to contractors. Complaints could be registered on the site
and the responses available to all, which ensured high transparency. Between 2004 and
2009 there were 27,155 complaints, virtually all of which were resolved. The content of
the site was in Bahasa, but for most of the content an English translation was also
available. The IEG mission was briefed on how to use the system and made extensive use
of it in the preparation of this PPAR. The data has become the website for the entire
PNPM program and continues to be improved. The GoI is now using the MIS on an
intensive basis to monitor its nationwide community development program and this
strongly supports the system’s likely sustainability. Accordingly, in spite of the long and
difficult establishment process M&E quality is rated substantial, but greater attention
should have been focused on measuring the voice of the poor and responsiveness of local
government.



3. Third Urban Poverty Project
Objectives, Design, and Relevance
OBJECTIVES

3.1     The project development objective stated in both the development credit
agreement 4063-IND (page 21) and the PAD (page 6) is to provide improved services for
the urban poor and strengthen community and government institutions for responsive
service delivery.

3.2     As indicated in paragraph 1.10, there was considerable overlap between UPP2
and UPP3 for nearly five years. The latter commenced in parallel with UPP2 and was
completed one year later. Although the development objectives of UPP3 were more
concisely stated, the meaning was essentially the same. The operational approach was
also similar, except that UPP3 targeted new kelurahans in several provinces in which the
Bank had not previously been involved. For this reason some sections that follow cross-
reference to the findings of UPP2, either where no new evidence is available or where the
activities are identical.

RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

3.3     UPP3 was approved in parallel to UPP2 in May 2005. It was a further
geographical expansion of UPP2 to other areas of the country, leading to the
establishment of a national program as part of the government’s poverty reduction
                                                      27


strategy. UPP3 was in line with core engagement three, (the community development and
social protection pillar) of the FY2009-2012 CPS. The Bank aimed to improve the
socioeconomic and local level governance conditions of the urban and rural poor through
wider implementation of poverty reduction and community empowerment programs. This
reflected Government strategy; GoI launched a major two-pronged poverty reduction
program in 2006 through community empowerment and conditional cash transfers. These
measures were aimed at cutting the poverty and unemployment rates in conjunction with
national community-driven development and labor-intensive activities. The relevance of
objectives is rated high.

DESIGN

3.4        The project comprised four components as follows:

Component 1: Community Development and Local Government Capacity Building
(appraisal estimate US$11.4 million; actual at completion US$12.5 million). This
component was to provide technical advisory services to carry out community
development and local government capacity building activities, including:

      i.   The formation (or confirmation) of an elected body of representatives in each
           kelurahan known as BKMs (Board of Community Trustees);
     ii.   The formulation of a Community Development Plan (CDP) for each project
           kelurahan, using a transparent and participatory process;
    iii.   Organizing and assisting community groups Kelompok Swadaya Masyarakat
           (KSM), which would submit proposals to the Trustees to utilize project resources
           and implement programs identified in the CDPs; and
    iv.    Assistance to Trustees on how to form associations with local governments to
           build capacity for working with the Trustees and their associations, as well as the
           preparation of city level plans for implementation of regional poverty alleviation
           strategy programs. Facilitators were to be trained to work directly with
           communities in project kelurahans and with local government officials at the
           provincial and kabupaten/kota levels in a “guided socialization process.”6

Component 2: Kelurahan Grants (appraisal estimate US$93.8 million; actual at
completion US$96.0 million). Block grants to participating kelurahan to finance
activities identified in the CDP, including:

      i.   Specific high-priority infrastructure investments;
     ii.   Competitive proposals from community groups consistent with the priorities in
           the community development plans;
    iii.   Revolving fund loans for community groups, and
    iv.    Social safety programs for the benefit of the poorest and most vulnerable groups
           of individuals.

Kelurahan grants would not finance potentially sensitive activities on the project’s
negative list (such as religious buildings or government offices). Each participating

    Whereby facilitators were trained to work with communities to increase their awareness and offer advice.
                                           28


kelurahan was to receive a one-time block grant of IDR 200-500 million (US$24,000 to
US$59,000) to finance investments in one or more of the above categories, in accordance
with their CDPs. Kelurahan grants would be disbursed in three tranches to ensure proper
management and fund use, and to encourage better outcomes.

Component 3: Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grants (appraisal estimate US$64.9
million; actual at completion US$83.5 million). The purpose of this component was to
encourage partnerships between local government and communities and to
institutionalize a consultative process between the two partners for future activities
undertaken by local governments. It would provide 30 participating districts with access
to matching grants, known as Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grants (PAPGs) to finance
poverty alleviation sub-projects that were:

   a) Too big to be financed by the kelurahan grants (i.e. in the range of IDR 30-200
      million or U$3,500 to US$24,000) or that required local government involvement,
   b) Located in more than one kelurahan,
   c) Not on the negative list for kelurahan grants, and
   d) Jointly prepared, proposed and implemented by the Trustees in collaboration with
      local government departments. Both local governments and eligible sub-projects
      were to be selected on an agreed and competitive basis.

Component 4: Implementation Support (appraisal estimate US$13.0 million; actual at
completion US$14.3 million). The project was to be managed by a project management
unit (PMU) in the MPW. The PMU was to hire consultants and facilitators to assist in
project implementation. Technical assistance was to be provided through national
management consultants at the central level, and oversight consultant (OC) teams at the
provincial level, with oversight consultants’ offices in the participating district
governments, and facilitators and community cadres at the kelurahan level.

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

3.5     The statement of objectives was clear and there was a logical causal chain
between the activities to be supported and the intended outcomes. The design was
adapted and improved from that used in UPP1 and UPP2. For example, the objective to
provide improved services to the urban poor and strengthen government institutions was
to be achieved through the kelurahan block grants and the PAPGs, while capacity
building at community level was to be achieved through technical advisory services
based on CDPs and implemented through elected bodies of representatives known as
BKMs. It was expected that project activities would strengthen the link between the local
governments and the communities, which in turn would lead to more responsive service
delivery. The implementation arrangements were realistically designed and not overly
complex.

3.6     A minor weakness, as in UPP2, was that while the project design supported the
strengthening of the capacity of communities to organize, plan and prioritize their
development projects, it made limited provision for the operation and maintenance of the
newly created infrastructure. Although community members received some technical
                                             29


training in this area, it was fairly superficial. On balance, however, relevance of design is
rated substantial.

IMPLEMENTATION

3.7     The project was approved by the Board on May 17, 2005 and became effective on
October 28, 2005. It was completed on schedule on March 31, 2011, three months after
UPP2 closed. Project activities were sometimes interrupted or postponed because of
avoidable delays in execution, budget revisions or consultant recruitment, but in the end
this did not affect the completion date.

3.8    Financial management of revolving funds was on balance less than satisfactory
during implementation, although this did not lead to any known misuse of funds. In 2006
the Ministry of Finance changed a regulation to permit GoI to channel kelurahan grants
through a commercial bank. Although this initially caused some delays in fund
disbursements, ultimately it had positive effects on the project’s financial management
and the transparency in the flow of funds.

3.9     It was intended in the PAD that the project would provide grants to 660
kelurahans supported in the two previous Urban Poverty Projects where the Boards of
Community Trustees had been functioning well. During implementation, after
consultation between the Bank and the Borrower, this number was reduced to 273, of
which ten were located in areas not previously covered by either of the two prior urban
poverty projects. However, each of the 273 kelurahans was to receive a higher additional
grant (up to one billion IDR), to be disbursed in three tranches for a combination of
improvements. These grants were called Neighborhood Development (ND) schemes and
were to be used as a comparator to regular PAPG grants to see whether larger grants were
more effective.

3.10 GoI created a unified management structure for all UPPs during the
implementation of UPP3. Although this reorganization slowed project operations in the
short-term, it also provided a solid foundation for placing UPPs within the framework of
the new National Community Empowerment Program in Urban Areas. Furthermore, it
made provision for a separate national management consultant for the PAPGs and gave
special attention to the ND Program.

Fiduciary management

3.11 During the project there was a gradual improvement of the financial reporting
capability of the PMU in the MIS and this was confirmed by independent financial
audits. At the district, provincial and central levels, project implementation units used the
Government’s computerized accounting system. At the village level, community Boards
of Trustees used manual accounting systems. Nevertheless, the project still encountered
problems with financial management, despite some improvement after 2007 (see
paragraph 2.17 and 2.18), primarily because the revolving funds sub-component was
often unable to comply with financial management guidelines, especially those related to
safekeeping and the dissemination of financial reports. These problems were exacerbated
by difficulties in finding qualified facilitators. The performance ratings given in the ISRs
                                            30


reviewed in total by IEG for financial management were moderately satisfactory or
better.

3.12 The overall project was audited by Badan Pengawasan Keuangan dan
Pembangunan (BPKP), a Government auditing agency. The auditor's opinions of the
project’s financial reports were unqualified. In addition all kelurahans were required to
have an independent public accountant to audit the accounts of their Boards of Trustees.
According to the Final Quantitative Evaluation Report, based on a sample of 80, the
percentage of BKMs with Audited Financial Reports increased from 30 per cent in 2007
to 80 percent in 2010, but a few were qualified due to the poor compliance with financial
management procedures relating the use of revolving funds as well as late payments.
According to the operational staff, the financial management shortcomings did not,
however, lead to any known misuse of funds or unresolved complaints about the use of
funds.

3.13 The ICR was silent regarding issues involving governance of procurement. Yet,
project activities were postponed because of lengthy delays in consultant mobilization
and facilitator recruitment (even though this was the third project using similar
implementing arrangements, and the Bank had already provided the implementing
agency with a short list during loan negotiations). According to financial staff
interviewed by IEG, to minimize procurement risks with community-procured works and
goods, a series of mutually reinforcing measures were put in place. These included: (i) an
extensive complaints handling system, (ii) publication of the consultants’ invoices in the
project's public website, (iii) regular spot checks, (iv) independent audits, (v) intensive
Bank supervision, (vi) disbursements of funds to communities only after verification of
financial management performance of the community board of trustees, and compliance
with community development plans by facilitators and a community board of trustee
cosignatory, as well as (vii) oversight by consultant teams at both district and national
levels.

Safeguards.

3.14 The project was classified as category B as there could be some sub-projects with
potentially adverse consequences. Four safeguards policies were triggered: OP4.01
(Environmental Assessment), OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement), OP 4.20 (Indigenous
People), and OP 4.11 (Cultural Property). The same environmental and social specialists
involved in UPP2 also covered UPP3 since the two projects significantly overlapped.
Consequently, the comments in paragraphs 2.19 to 2.21 above apply to both projects. ISR
ratings of safeguard compliance were all in the satisfactory range.

ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

Efficacy

3.15 Although all three Urban Poverty Projects had broadly the same aim, attributing
the results to individual projects was facilitated by the fact that geographical coverage
was different in each case. The intended beneficiaries of this project consisted of two
groups: some 8.4 million persons (of which an estimated 3.55 million were classified as
                                            31


poor) living in about 1,736 kelurahans in 78 districts (kabupaten and kota) in 15
provinces throughout Indonesia that were previously not covered by either UPP1 or
UPP2:

Objective 1: To provide improved services for the urban poor: Substantially
Achieved

Outputs

     About 49 per cent of kelurahan grants were invested in physical infrastructure,
      followed by revolving loan funds (27 per cent) and grants for social infrastructure
      and services (24 per cent). Most of the grants for physical infrastructure was
      invested in roads (1,516 km of village roads, 44 per cent of total cost), followed
      by: drainage (753 km, 20 per cent of total cost), and water supply (19,900 clean
      water units, 11 per cent of total cost). The remaining infrastructure comprised
      small bridges, sanitation and housing rehabilitation, irrigation canals, markets,
      shops, and electricity connections. (See Table 6).

     Some 273 participating kelurahans were funded by PAPGs against a target of
      660, because of the decision to make the grants larger.

     Local Government, the private sector, and others provided about 58 per cent of
      sub-project financing, which was higher than the target of 50 per cent.
      Communities contributed 14 per cent of the financing. Most of the PAPG
      investments were used for physical infrastructure, particularly roads, drainage,
      housing rehabilitation, education facilities, water supply, and irrigation.

     Social programs covering aid for the elderly, scholarships for students and skills
      training, accounted for about 550,000 beneficiaries of whom 59 per cent were
      reportedly poor urban households.
                                            32


    The project provided revolving funds to 32,881 community groups of which about
     46 per cent were women. However, only 45 per cent of the community groups
     with revolving funds had repayment rates over 90 per cent.

Outcomes

    53 per cent of poor households benefited from PAPGs against a target of 60 per
     cent.
    50 per cent of poor households in the targeted kelurahans received benefits and
     improved services.
    74 per cent of poor households used project infrastructure against a target of 75
     per cent
    48 per cent of poor households had access to micro credit against a target of 40
     per cent
    59 per cent of poor urban households received grant assistance against a target of
     15 per cent.

3.16 The ICR for UPP3 does not provide outcome indicators because the quantitative
and qualitative study to measure the outcome and results of the project was still ongoing
when the ICR was completed. However, information from the final report (provided by
the project team to IEG) show that nearly all indicator targets were met or exceeded.

    About 90 per cent of the poor households in the targeted kelurahans received
     benefits and improved services from the project compared to the year five 2010
     target of 50 per cent. Improved services from road access were cited most
     frequently as the major benefit from the project - about 95 per cent of the
     respondents noted improved access to markets.

    The second most frequently cited service was improved loan access. More than 80
     per cent of households that had applied for a revolving fund loan stated that the
     loan procedure was simple and the loan-processing time was short. About 38 per
     cent of the revolving fund recipients indicated increases in their income level. The
     report also found that 88 per cent of the BKMs formed were representative,
     effective, and operated in a participatory manner compared to the year five 2010
     target of 70 per cent.

3.16 The PAPGs were designed to increase partnership between the communities and
local governments and this is demonstrated by the frequency of meetings and the
commitment of funds by local governments (119 in both UPP2 and UPP3). The ND pilot
program based on larger grants was introduced to encourage community involvement in
wider urban spatial planning. It is still under assessment (see chapter 4), but preliminary
findings suggest that community participation is less than envisaged due to the
complexity of bigger projects and the relatively small number of residents who perceived
a direct impact from them (World Bank Policy Note, 2013).

Objective 2: To strengthen community and government institutions for responsive
service delivery: Substantially achieved
                                            33


Outputs

    The capacity building activities conducted under the project comprising training,
     focus group discussions, workshops, etc. have enabled the local governments to
     prepare a Regional Poverty Alleviation Strategy for each city - 70 Regional
     Poverty Alleviation Strategy papers were completed against a target of 40.

    The project supported the establishment kelurahan organizations, 100 per cent of
     the participating local governments formed the Community Board of Trustees
     (BKMs) against a target of 80 per cent per cent to provide services to the urban
     poor and increase the voice of the poor in public decision-making. The vast
     majority of the BKMs were established through democratic election processes
     that involved about 35 per cent adult voters, which is higher than the targeted
     value of 30 per cent. About 86 per cent of the BKMs completed financial audits
     against a target of 80 per cent.

    The community organizations established under the project included 22 per cent
     of women as elected members. Over 35 per cent of female and vulnerable groups
     (compared to the target of 30 per cent) participated in discussions about the
     project. The vast majority (99 per cent) of all participating kelurahans completed
     and ratified CDPs for the provision of services to the urban poor.

Outcomes

3.17 The project was successful in encouraging partnership between local governments
and community organizations participating in the PAPGs to plan and invest in
community infrastructure and social programs as evidenced by: (a) the number of local
governments participating in PAPG was much higher than expected (70 instead of a
target of 40), (b) 30 local governments financed more than 40 per cent of the cost of sub-
projects from their own budgets, thereby leveraging the use of Bank financing by a
considerable margin, (c) about 35 local governments replicated the PAPG approach in
their Kota/Kabupatens, and (d) the PAPG mechanism was pursued by local governments
for implementing their neighborhood upgrading program for the poorest and will likely
be used in the upcoming slum upgrading program. The IEG mission confirmed
considerable enthusiasm for joint participation by communities and local government
alike. Though not intended by the project, emergency reconstruction projects to replace
housing and small-scale infrastructure destroyed in natural disasters also adopted the UPP
model of community involvement.

Efficiency
3.18 As in UPP2 the sub-projects were not pre-identified, and no cost-benefit analysis
or cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out at appraisal. The ICR also did not calculate
an ex-post economic rate of return. However, studies from comparative CDD projects in
Indonesia showed that returns could be expected to be very substantial and the average
construction cost of CDD projects was also 49.4 per cent lower than those undertaken by
contractors of local governments. See also paragraphs 2.32 and 2.33 above.
                                             34


3.19 However, the ICR for UPP3 notes (p. 12) that these cost savings are sometimes
partly offset by other factors, including: lower technical quality (especially for relatively
complex infrastructure, such as housing units and water supply systems), limited
capabilities for operations and maintenance, and a heavy reliance on facilitators, which
resulted in higher project implementation costs. To counter this, illustrated operational
manuals were developed in Bahasa and English that showed the right and wrong way to
build and maintain infrastructure. In the view of the operational staff and confirmed by
the IEG mission, these manuals were highly appreciated and widely used. Overall, given
the lack of evidence, efficiency is rated modest.

Ratings
OUTCOME

3.20 The relevance of objectives is rated high, while the relevance of design is rated
substantial. The efficacy of the first objective - to provide improved services for the
urban poor - is rated substantial, while the second objective - to strengthen community
and government institutions for responsive service delivery - is also rated substantial,
since the urban poor were successfully targeted and the capacity of beneficiaries, local
and urban governments to plan together was enhanced. Efficiency is rated modest,
however, so the overall outcome is assessed as moderately satisfactory.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

3.21 The risk to development outcome needs to be assessed in the context of the
overall program, which is still continuing and has been incrementally improved over
time. GoI has shown solid commitment and the program has become a pillar of the
national CDD program. This and other arguments are fully described in paragraphs 2.35
to 2.38 and recent developments including arrangements for maintenance are discussed in
chapter 4.

3.22 Risks associated with financial management and the ability of the communities to
monitor the use of the funds provided in the future is fairly limited at BKM level, as most
have proved their ability to manage and audit the block grants successfully. The ICR for
UPP3 did though note though that the management of the revolving fund loans was less
than satisfactory as beneficiaries were not always able to comply with the financial
management guidelines. The project team pointed out that the grants for revolving funds,
however, were substantially lower than grants for infrastructure or social services (i.e.
only eight per cent of the project cost) and given the intention of Bank and Borrower to
limit micro loans to beneficiaries with a proven track record, the risk is diminishing
further. Overall, the risk to development outcome rating is rated as negligible to low.

BANK PERFORMANCE

Quality at Entry

3.23 The project was a geographical expansion of UPP2, which was in implementation
at the time of appraisal. While formal lessons learned from UPP2 could not be
incorporated in UPP3 since the findings from the impact evaluations were at that time not
                                             35


yet available, the Bank team was still able to incorporate learning from two previous
projects. Mitigation measures were appropriately identified. These were provisions for
stronger support to local governments; allocation of more grants per kelurahan to well-
performing BKMs in UPP1 and UPP2 locations; and inclusion of easily measurable
targets. Risk identification was also adequate. The PAD rated the overall risk for the
project as modest with the only risk element rated above either negligible or modest as
the “willingness of local governments and kelurahan structures to work together” - rated
as "substantial". However, as with UPP2, this was found in practice to be a non-issue.
Other risks included the potential for political interference in either the establishment of
the ward level community organizations (BKMs) or the risk of the BKM’s being co-
opted by the local elite. Concerns were also justifiably raised regarding the financial
management in the light of previous experience and should have been flagged as
substantial. The mitigation measures were generally simple and focused on capacity
building.

3.24 Since this was the third project in this series, the overall risk rating of modest
appears not unreasonable, although financial management difficulties were clearly
underestimated. However, there were also weaknesses in M&E design since the
performance indicators were largely output based and there were no baseline estimates.
The qualitative aspects of monitoring the responsiveness of local governments should
have been stronger. As in UPP2, there was also no attempt to estimate efficiency other
than by reference to cost savings and inferences of results from other projects.
Accordingly, performance at entry is rated moderately satisfactory.

Quality at Supervision

3.25 The Bank mobilized a mostly locally-based multi-disciplinary supervision team
with expertise in project management, financial management, procurement, monitoring,
and safeguards. The project team typically fielded two full supervision missions per year
in addition to many shorter site visits between missions. It made sense to combine
missions for UPP2 and UPP3 since the team composition was nearly identical. Virtually
all team members were based in the country office, which allowed for much closer and
more continuous interim supervision. All core members of the Bank’s task team
remained unchanged over the course of eight years, allowing for continuous learning and
long-term relationships with Government counterparts.

3.26 Intensive supervision enabled the Bank to identify and proactively address key
issues adversely affecting the achievement of the project development objectives at an
early stage, notably delays in budget execution and revision, consultant mobilization,
facilitator recruitment, implementation of the PAPGs, and limited compliance with
financial management procedures for the revolving funds. The Bank team systematically
visited over 100 villages per year. In addition, the team developed various innovations in
supervision including a website, a complaint handling mechanism and a teleconference
system between project operators and the communities. Performance is rated satisfactory
and overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

Government Performance

3.27 The GoI displayed a strong commitment to the project as shown in its 2000-2004
National Development Plan to guide the project, and in support for its long-term strategy
for poverty alleviation. As further strong evidence of its ownership of the project, the
Government established an Inter-Departmental Team consisting of the Coordinating
Ministry of Social Welfare, the National Planning Agency, the MPW, the Ministry of
Finance, and the Ministry of Home Affairs, to improve coordination at the central level.
The Government created a unified management structure for the three urban poverty
projects that enabled the projects to be placed within the new National Community
Empowerment Program in Urban Areas. It made adequate funding available for local
governments and encouraged them to participate. Moreover, it established a separate
National Management Consultant for Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grants and the
Neighborhood Development Program in view of the special attention that these
components required.

3.28 In 2006, the Ministry of Finance changed a regulation on fund channeling that
allowed the Government to route kelurahan grants through a commercial bank. Initially,
the implementation of this regulation led to delays in fund disbursement, but ultimately it
had positive impacts on the project's financial management and transparency in the flow
of funds. The Government contribution to the project increased significantly from
US$23.8 million to US$42.0 million during implementation, a 76 per cent increase.
Performance was satisfactory.

Implementing Agency Performance

3.29 The implementing agency was the MPW and the PMU was housed in this
Ministry. MPW took steps to modify implementation arrangements where needed and
responded appropriately and quickly to complaints about the misuse of funds. The
implementing agency also created a detailed master schedule, which helped the
Government reduce avoidable delays during project start up and implementation. The
design of the block grant component and flexibility in its implementation allowed the
communities to put the available funding where it mattered most to them. Anti-corruption
measures such as the complaints handling unit were introduced to report incidences of
suspected corruption. As of December 31, 2010, the project had resolved 7,384 of 7,394
reported complaints.7 A total of 121 cases of corruption were identified, accounting for
an estimated misuse of funds of approximately US$ 310,342 equivalent. The ICR does
not mention how many of these reported cases were substantiated but notes (p. 19) that
the PMU successfully recovered all of these funds.

3.30 There were, however, several shortcomings that stronger management might have
been able to correct, such as poor compliance with financial management procedures
regarding the revolving funds, late payments, the high turnover of facilitators, late arrival

7
 In reality many of the “complaints” were actually requests for information. Most genuine
complaints were resolved at community level without the need for formal investigation.
                                             37


of socialization materials, and lengthy delays in consultant recruitment (even though the
Bank already provided the implementing agency with a short list of consultant
requirements during loan negotiations). Implementing agency performance was
moderately satisfactory and overall Borrower performance was moderately
satisfactory.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

3.31 This is fully described in paragraphs 2.52 to 2.55 above. At the end of project
implementation, the project’s website not only provided access to data on all three of the
urban poverty projects, but also on all follow-up projects (see Annex C for KPIs). The
system was also adopted for other projects in MPW. M&E was rated substantial.



4. Enhancing: Recent Developments in PNPM Urban
4.1     In this chapter developments after UPP3 closed in 2011 are discussed, since they
have a direct bearing on the risk to development outcome of the program. The discussion
incorporates some of the main findings of various studies completed since that date,
details of some pilot projects under implementation and ideas on possible future changes
to the program.

Social Assistance and Revolving Funds

4.2     While basic infrastructure is clearly important, findings of the qualitative
assessment of the needs of the urban poor suggest that social assistance programs to help
poor household out of destitution or that help avoid vulnerable households from falling
into poverty are more highly valued by the beneficiaries (Burger N et al, 2012).
Frequently mentioned challenges in urban focus groups are inadequate incomes, as well
as difficulty in finding jobs, and school expenses. In part this reflects the classic public
goods problem in that individuals tend to undervalue projects that provide collective
benefits in favor of those that provide direct assistance. On the other hand more than 80
per cent of the kelurahan grants were allocated to infrastructure in terms of the CDPs.
Both the Bank and the Borrower nevertheless realized there could be merit in
encouraging a larger share is allocated for funding of social and economic programs.

4.3     To date, around 15 per cent has been aimed at the poorest of the poor in terms of
social benefits, while a further ten per cent has been allocated to revolving funds, which
have not had a stellar performance. Although the Bank strongly considered phasing out
these funds, this was contrary to the wishes of the communities. A better option, pursued
since 2011, has been to redesign the program to better meet the economic and social
needs of the poor. “An increased focus on social activities could help the poor to access
existing social protection programs for which they may be eligible” (GoI/World Bank
Policy Note, 2013). Assistance could also be given to realistically identify and market
new products that the poor can sell. Inevitably some not-so-poor people would also
benefit from these programs, so the challenge is to maximize the benefits to the really
poor. Findings in one recent work suggest that community-based development efforts
                                             38


may provide only partial relief on income poverty. Projects with significant microfinance
components do show positive impacts on savings and assets, but these effects have often
been confined to the life cycle of the project. There is also some evidence that
community-based development projects improve nutrition and diet quality, especially
among children, although some studies find that larger benefits tend to accrue to better-
off households (Mansuri G, and Rao, V, 2013). Capacity building in connection with the
management of revolving funds according to the facilitators interviewed needs to be more
focused on the beneficiaries who should take a compulsory training course before being
granted the micro-loan.

4.4    Given the history of problems with revolving credit funds, the Bank is piloting a
new approach in Aceh Province under a USAID trust fund grant. The “Livelihoods”
approach, as it is known, differs from existing revolving loan fund activities in four
respects:

            It targets the poorest in the urban communities with a view to their
             empowerment through developing opportunities such as introducing
             products, expanding market networks and creating jobs;
            It focuses on institution building and group capacity development;
            It provides training in basic financial management, and
            It creates a system to provide participants with demand-based technical
             assistance.

4.5    The pilot in 56 selected kelurahans is based on strengthening the group through
non-negotiable requirements (or principles) that include weekly meetings, savings
contributions, and training in bookkeeping, internal lending and repayments. Results are
expected in December 2015.

Feedback from Facilitators

4.6     Facilitators are relatively poorly paid to avoid allegations of perceptions that they
are benefitting strongly from their duties. They also often experience uncertainty
concerning the renewal of their contracts. A typical facilitator profile is a relatively young
educated person seeking vocational fulfillment. Moreover, as the IEG mission found in
two focus group meetings, the effectiveness of the facilitators depends to a large extent
on their workload and IEG’s discussions revealed they sometimes have to work with a
greater number of communities and groups than they can effectively manage.

4.7     They also indicated that while they appreciated the training they had received,
more capacity building was needed. One improvement suggested was to recruit and train
new facilitators twice a year instead of once, as is currently the case. Because of this lack
of training frequency, vacancies can sometimes remain unfilled for many months.
Training materials are good and on several occasions facilitators spoke commendably
about the construction guidelines that showed pictorially the right and the wrong way to
construct infrastructure projects. One change during the evolution of the program has
been to fully involve the local headman (lurah) in the capacity building, since this leads
to greater commitment. In the early stages of UPP, involvement of the lurah had actually
been discouraged because of the need to encourage more direct community participation.
                                            39


Between 2007 and 2015, however, over 10,000 lurah have been trained using the same
training modules as for BKM members. Community volunteers also play an important
role, including in the planning, administration, implementation and maintenance of
projects. However, volunteers were not always available when needed due to other calls
on their time, including paid employment, but on the whole this was manageable.

4.8     The auditing capacity of the communities has also been enhanced. Under PNPM
the external audit now goes further than merely providing an opinion on the accounts. An
opinion is also expected on the strength of the internal control framework and compliance
with the project manual. The BPKP audit manual for CDD has been improved as well so
as to be risk based and focused on internal controls. The auditor now has to assess and
report on the achievement towards the KPIs that relate to selected areas of governance
and financial management. Under PNPM Urban III the Bank requested BPKP to further
increase the number of audit samples in 2010 and provided funds to train local inspectors.

Gender Issues

4.9     It is now a requirement of the World Bank East Asia Region that all projects are
reviewed for the potential to improve the gender content. Country office management in
Jakarta uses a “dashboard” monitoring system to track gender activities in Bank projects
in Indonesia. In the Bank-funded Urban Poverty Program and the subsequent National
Program for Community Empowerment (UPP/PNPM), the participation rate by women
and vulnerable groups in community discussions was 35 per cent against a target of 30
per cent in 2011. The latest PNPM Management Information System data for 2014 (three
years after UPP3 closed) show that the momentum has been maintained and for all
10,922 kelurahans in 33 provinces the average participation rate for women is now 47
per cent. The highest participation rate is West Sulawesi (61 per cent) and the lowest
Central Kalimantan (37 per cent). Some 35 per cent of community facilitators are now
women.

4.10 However, the quality of women’s participation overall and especially in the
remoter locations remains problematical. Participation by women is influenced by local
traditions and culture. Male members largely manage most relationships with facilitators
and local government, and often dominate BKMs. The situation is better in areas such as
Central Java, where there is evidence that the women participate in real decision-making.
In the more conservative areas, however, the women may attend the meetings, but their
role is primarily providing refreshments and sometimes performing secretarial duties.
Participation of the poorest women is said to be particularly weak, although no figures for
this aspect are available.

4.11 In Java and a few other areas some success has been achieved by holding separate
preparatory meetings for the women only, in which they are encouraged through
facilitation to express their views. However, these views are only likely to be aired at the
main meeting if there are strong female committee members to put them forward. The
general guidelines for facilitators are gender neutral, but the contracts for individual
facilitators stress that gender issues must be given attention. A 2012 report on enhancing
women’s participation in PNPM Urban found diverse views and perceptions about the
roles of women and men in community development across the seven kelurahans studied,
                                            40


and this diversity had a significant impact on the level of women’s participation in the
kelurahans visited (Dewayanti, R, 2012).

4.12 Nonetheless, a $24.8 million grant that includes a pilot initiative on improving
women’s empowerment is now active in 13 districts in Aceh Province.8 This involves the
formulation of KPIs, the development of a technical manual and implementation of an
empowerment program. There are guidelines available, but at this stage they are only
available in Bahasa.

4.13 In the locations visited by the IEG mission in Central Java (Pekalongan and
Yogyokarta) women’s participation shown in the MIS was between 41 and 43 per cent,
and the quality of the participation was good. Usually the regular monthly BKM meetings
were primarily attended by elected members, although any community member could be
present if they wanted to. However, the annual meeting reviewing progress and finances
was nearly always well attended. The mission went to one such meeting (Kelurahan
Duwet in Pekalongan) and some 260 people were present. This meeting continued until
late at night. In meetings attended by the mission many women held back initially, but
gained confidence during the proceedings and in several cases became quite animated.
Women who had been elected as BKM members participated without any such restraint.

4.14 Women interviewed said they participated in poverty mapping, helped in project
selection, preparing proposals and project reports, and even assisted with complaints
handling. In general, the women tended to prefer projects that would increase household
income or were family orientated such as health clinics, kindergartens and playground
areas. They also supported infrastructure projects that improved access to schools and
improved road safety or that enhanced health such as drainage and public toilet facilities.
Voluntary work, however, often took the form of providing food and drink for the male
workers.

4.15 Some women took advantage of the revolving fund micro loans to start small
businesses either individually or in groups. These included selling local foods and
delicacies for tourists. They also made and sold souvenirs such as ceramics, handicrafts,
clothing and novelties. One woman interviewed operated a successful business producing
food on an improved riverside walk. Her latest loan was for Rp one million ($80).
Repayments on her loan were Rp100, 000/month ($8) and Rp15, 000 ($1.2) covered the
interest, (the rate was determined by the community), but her earnings were Rp200,
000/day ($16). This was her third loan. The first two loans were smaller, but because she
successfully repaid the capital amounts she established a track record and so was allowed
a larger amount with each successive loan.

PAPGs and Neighborhood Development

4.16 “Indonesia’s institutions have evolved considerably over the past decade with its
sub-national governments now playing a major role in service delivery. As local
governments take on a greater role in service delivery, it is increasingly important to
ensure that the PNPM Urban operates effectively in the context of this decentralization,

8
    TF012192 using USAID funds
                                            41


particularly in ensuring good collaboration between the PNPM Urban and local
governments” (Government of Indonesia/World Bank, Policy Note, 2013). The PAPG
concept was introduced to strengthen linkages between communities and local
governments. The intention was to encourage constructive partnerships between local
governments and communities and this was achieved. Upon completion of the PAPGs the
partnership arrangement has usually continued, though the mechanism was often adapted
to suit local circumstances such as available budget and the orientation of city planning.
Some 75 per cent of local governments in Indonesia now provide counterpart funds. The
ones that contributed to PAPG contributed more than 40 per cent of the funds for sub-
projects. The outcome was indeed greater interaction, but the results do appear to reflect
more community participation in local government activities than local government
support of CDD driven initiatives. The primary driver for local government was clearly to
leverage additional funds.

4.17 In later Bank supported projects such as the National Community Empowerment
Program in Urban Areas, 2012-2015, the concept of Neighborhood Development grants
(ND) was introduced. The idea was to introduce more systematic urban upgrading by
significantly increasing the size of the grant and ensuring that spatial planning would be
included as a core activity. The pilots have thus far have had mixed results. These larger
projects require stronger financial management and the complexity has taxed the ability
of non-trained volunteers. It is also evident that since only the best-performing
kelurahans were selected for ND pilots, many of the weaker communities would just not
have the capacity to effectively plan and implement such projects. It was also observed
that project requests at PAPG level were seen in most cases to be adequate, perhaps
suggesting, though, that project requests were already scaled to meet expectations about
available resources (Government of Indonesia/World Bank, Policy Note, 2013).

Disaster Management

4.18 Indonesia is a country with a high risk of natural disasters including earthquakes,
tsunamis, typhoons and volcanic eruptions. In UPP2 the potential to reallocate funds for
the 2004 tsunami and earthquake in Aceh and other provinces was identified, but the
provision was not utilized because of ample availability of funds through the multi donor
trust fund facility set up separately. However, the project design using the BKM concept
was replicated in that facility for prioritizing emergency reconstruction assistance with
local communities. The 2009 earthquake in West Sumatera enabled some urban
neighborhoods to benefit from project funds. Similarly under UPP3 the GoI benefitted by
being to mobilize an immediate response through the community structures to the 2006
Jogyakarta and Central Java earthquake. The facilitators were used to help assess the
damage and to assist in assessing re-prioritized community needs. After this it was
decided from PNPM Urban III onwards that a special category of disbursement could be
used in the loan agreement to speed up reallocations when needed to finance disaster
response. Using the PNPM platform has thus become pivotal for GoI’s post disaster
recovery strategy.

Concluding Remarks

4.19 Since 1999 when the first UPP started, the Bank has committed over US$1.2
billion in financing for urban CDD programs in Indonesia. The program has financed
inter alia 5,042 km of access roads, 1,667 km of drainage systems and the rehabilitation
of 29,480 houses. About 85 per cent of the project beneficiaries surveyed indicated that
they were satisfied or very satisfied with the outcomes of the projects; infrastructure built
through the PNPM Urban programs is at least 20 per cent less expensive than that built
by non-community-based approaches in 80 per cent of the participating kelurahans and
reported to be of good quality in 94 per cent of the cases sampled (Arnold, M et al, 2014).
According to a recent study by the World Bank Development Economics Research
Group, only a few studies worldwide compare community-managed infrastructure
projects with similar projects delivered by governmental line departments using the more
“top-down” delivery mechanism. These studies, however, find that community
engagement seems to improve both the quality of construction and the management of
local infrastructure—possibly implying lower levels of corruption relative to government
provision (Mansuri G, and Rao, V, 2013).

4.20 A legitimate concern, however, is that infrastructure maintenance needs could be
neglected in some sub-projects affecting the flow of benefits over their expected life. The
supposition is that the communities will take ownership of the projects and on a voluntary
basis attend to any short-term maintenance needs. The program has not been running long
enough for any major problems to occur, but IEG believes that both local government
and the facilitators could play a stronger role in ensuring that maintenance needs are
prioritized in CDPs alongside new project proposals.

4.21 The MIS developed with the Government is proving invaluable. IEG
acknowledges the considerable efforts made to set up the MIS system, maintain it and
ensure that it is adequately utilized. Since UPP3 closed, the system has been further
refined and has become a major tool at all levels of government. It is updated frequently
and shows kelurahan performance across the nation. There is a “dashboard” for a quick
strategic overview, but it is also possible to drill down to the actual contracts let for
individual kelurahans. Training in this area appears to have reaped major dividends as
most elected representatives interviewed were aware of the system and used it regularly.

4.22 Actual complaints and the actions taken regarding them are now included on the
MIS website. This was extended in PNPM Urban 2012-2015 to include the use of mobile
phones for SMS complaints since it was found that such phones reach most urban areas.
Increased transparency was also achieved by posting summaries of audit results and
details of contract bids and awards. Less transparent is the local government spending
reports, which should be publicly available by national law. According to an Asia
Foundation survey, in 2010 around 60 per cent of such reports were not easily accessible
by the public (MacLauren L, 2010). This may have improved, but no recent figures are
available.

4.23 Clearly the democratic environment is still evolving, but the PNPM approach has
become central to Government policy. Government is looking to leverage PNPM Urban
for larger scale upgrading in urban slum areas. The PNPM program is aligned with the
                                              43


National Urban Policy and Strategy and the National Medium Term Development Plan,
2015-2019, signed by the new President, Joko Widodo (Jokawi), in Presidential Decree
No 2 of 2015. This is expected to feature strongly in the forthcoming CPS to be prepared
by the Bank and the GoI during 2015.



5. Finding and Lessons from UPP2 and UPP3
5.1     Overall, the Indonesia UPP program became a solid foundation for the PNPM
National Urban Program and subsequent related projects. The effectiveness of the
approach for enhanced community participation for addressing basic infrastructure
requirements and, to a lesser extent, social and economic activities, has been
demonstrated. The program has continuously evolved over a period of 16 years; new
ideas have been tried and many have succeeded in improving the reach and effectiveness
of the program. Sustainability is not in doubt provided the Government continues to
support the concept, which is politically highly likely. Some areas where improvements
can still be made are in enhancing the role of women in civic affairs and in identifying
and implementing better ways to create employment, improve micro lending and small
business opportunities.

5.2      The main lessons are as follows:

       Fundamental to the flourishing of Indonesia’s urban CDD program has been
        the communities’ strong ownership. The program’s popularity is demonstrated
        by the peoples’ willingness to participate in the allocation of small grants for
        community development priorities, provide voluntary labor for the projects, and
        in some instances to freely give up parcels of land for the communal good.

       Facilitators play a crucial role in the success of CDD and more attention should
        be paid to the timely renewal and updating of their contracts and salary payments
        to avoid periodic shortages of these key individuals.

       Developing trust and confidence between public officials at the local
        government level and communities is essential in promoting effective civic
        participation. Transparency in the disclosure of all activities through a highly
        effective management information system has helped to develop greater
        cooperation between all parties.

       Community participation is a necessary, but in itself an insufficient measure
        to ensure sustainability of improved infrastructure. Greater attention is needed
        to strengthen the technical capacity of communities to enable them to operate and
        maintain the facilities established and to harmonize planned new investments with
        appropriate maintenance programs and budgets. The facilitators can play a
        stronger role in stressing the importance of maintenance when Community
        Development Plans are drawn up.
