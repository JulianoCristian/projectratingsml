This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide additional 
financing of US$135.5 million to the Indonesia Second Urban Poverty Project (UPP 2) through 
the use of the additional financing instrument under OP 13.20.  The Government of Indonesia 
(GOI) has requested this additional financing to scale-up UPP 2
 to support the government’s 
newly created national poverty reduction program. Changes to the existing project include: (a) 
geographic expansion to new areas; (b) adoption of a more rigorous anti-corruption action 
plan; (c) strengthened financial management, procurement, and disbursement arrangements; 
and, (d) improved training program for consultants and facilitators, including modules on 
community-based disaster management. These revisions are consistent with the project’s 
objectives, which will not change, and will improve the effectiveness of project 
implementation.

Project background.
 UPP 2 was approved by the Board for an amount of US$100 
million on June 11, 2002 and became effective on November 18, 2002. The development 
objective of UPP 2 is to benefit the urban poor by improving services and infrastructure 
identified and delivered in a more effective and participatory manner. It is one of the largest 
urban poverty reduction projects in the world, with an established record of community 
engagement, participation, and service delivery. The design of UPP incorporates several 
innovative measures, including: (a) matching the needs and demands of communities with 
services provided by local governments; (b) building local government capacity to work with 
and support community organizations; and (c) ensuring continued community ownership of the 
facilities or programs.  
 
3. 
UPP 2 is part of a series of urban poverty interventions supported by the Bank, 
beginning with UPP 1, which was approved in 1999, followed by UPP 2 in 2002, and UPP 3 in 
2005. Total IBRD/IDA financing that has been provided to the three UPP operations is about 
US$338.7 million (Table 1). The Bank is also supporting rural poverty reduction through a 
series of Kecamatan Development Projects (KDP).

More than 6,400 of the poorest urban Indonesian wards, or kelurahans, have 
participated in and benefited from the UPP program. The majority of funds have supported 
small-scale infrastructure construction and maintenance and revolving fund schemes. 
Technical quality of infrastructure of the roads, bridges and water and sanitation schemes 
constructed under UPP 1 has been assessed by the task team during supervision missions and 
by the government and found to be satisfactory in over 85 percent of sub-projects. GOI also 
estimates that infrastructure financed through UPP 1 using a participatory approach produced 
savings of more than 35 percent of the total cost of using contractors. Surveyed communities 
also indicated their overall quality of life had improved by over 80 percent due to the 
implementation of sub-projects. 
 
5. 
Lessons learned from UPP 1 have been incorporated into project design. Bypassing 
local governments does little to foster a productive or sustainable relationship with 
communities.
 
The addition of the Poverty Alleviation Participation Grants (PAPG) 
component to UPP 2 encourages local government ownership of the project. Another 
important lesson is the building of trust and accountability between the community members 
and Community Board of Trustees or BKMs. A longer awareness raising process and 
structured involvement of communities ensures both the communities and the BKMs are 
aware of their rights and responsibilities. And, project monitoring has been separated from 
the project evaluation function to maintain independence and objectivity of the consultants.
 
6. 
UPP 2 project components include:  
 
(a) Community Planning and Local Government Capacity Building:
 This 
component funds the cost of facilitators to carry out social intermediation activities, 
training, workshops, meetings and focus group discussions, and production of 
socialization materials and publications. Outputs under this component include 
community development plans (CDP), formation of community boards of trustees 
(BKMs), and local government capacity building.  
 
(b) Kelurahan Grants
:
Sub-projects included in the CDPs are supported by block 
grants for kelurahans. These sub-projects cover an open menu of poverty alleviation 
activities with a short negative list. Typical activities are: specific investments pre-
identified by communities (bridges, roads, school repair, health facility repair, etc); 
microcredit loans for community groups, which form the basis of a revolving fund; and 
grant assistance to the poorest or most vulnerable individuals (e.g., scholarships, home 
improvements, health care, etc). 
 
(c) Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grant:
 
This component encourages partnerships 
between local government and communities. Local governments may access matching 
grants for city level poverty reduction activities and finance poverty alleviation sub-
Page  3
3
projects that are too big to be financed by the block grants, or that require local 
government involvement (e.g., networked infrastructure or operations and maintenance) 
and that cover more than one ward.  
 
(d) Implementation Technical Assistance:
 The Project Management Unit (PMU) has 
hired consultants and facilitators to assist in project implementation. Technical 
assistance is being provided through national management consultants (NMC) at the 
central level, and oversight consultant (OC) teams at the provincial level, with offices 
in the participating districts.  
 
7. 
Project performance to date.
 
UPP 2 is achieving its development objectives in an 
acceptable manner and implementation progress is currently satisfactory in spite of initial start 
up delays. At the end of 2006, US$84 million out of US$100 million has been disbursed; 
remaining UPP 2 funds are fully committed. As previously noted, the project has had such a 
positive development impact on the poor in urban communities that the government is scaling 
it up as a main pillar of its new national poverty reduction program. Transparency in decision-
making at the community and local government levels has increased substantially. Audit 
reports have been received in a timely manner and are satisfactory; minor procedural issues 
identified have been satisfactorily addressed. Compliance with social and environmental 
safeguards policies has been acceptable. The anti-corruption action plan (ACAP) is being 
implemented in a satisfactory manner. The project website and management information 
system (MIS) have been effective mechanisms for maintaining the transparency of the project 
and tracking complaints. Weaknesses in the project ACAP were addressed in UPP 3; this 
strengthened ACAP will be applied under the project.  
 
8. 
The project's monitoring and evaluation system is functional and is tracking progress on 
the key project performance indicators and milestones, many of which have been met (see 
Table 2). As of December 2006, close to 100 percent of target areas had completed all cycles 
of UPP community preparation. A total of 2,059 BKMs, or Community Boards of Trustees, 
have been established (about 3.1 million people participated in the election of the BKMs, of 
which 49 percent of the voters were women). These BKMs consist of 25,537 members who 
work for the poor on a pro bono basis. About 2,000 community poverty plans have been 
completed. A total of 86,524 sub-project proposals have been funded.  
 
9. 
A comprehensive, panel-based quantitative and qualitative impact evaluation of the 
project is currently underway, covering over 15,000 respondents from 156 treatment and 108 
control wards. The original results monitoring framework has been revised to reflect changes 
to the project, as elaborated in paragraph 32 below. Additional information on project results 
monitoring is available in Annex 3.

Rationale for Additional Financing.
 In August 2006 GOI launched the first 
nationwide poverty reduction program comprising two components: (a) National Program for 
Community Empowerment (PNPM); and (b) Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) Program 
targeting poor communities and households. The PNPM will be implemented in three phases 
from 2007-2009 and will require about US$1.5 billion per year. During the first phase in 2007, 
while designing and enhancing the PNPM framework, the Government will scale up two 
existing poverty reduction models - community empowerment in rural and in urban areas, 
through the Kecamatan Development Project (KDP) and UPP programs. Details of the PNPM 
are outlined in Annex 2.  
 
11. 
The national budget for 2007 does not include sufficient funding to cover the launch of 
the PNPM program, leaving a gap of US$930 million. GOI has requested the Bank to provide 
US$258.5 million in bridge funding to support the implementation of the PNPM: (a) US$135.5 
million as additional financing for UPP 2; and, (b) US$123 million as additional financing for 
the Third Kecamatan Development Project, second phase. The proposed additional financing 
for UPP 2 will support ongoing poverty reduction activities in most of the UPP and UPP 2 
wards and will scale up the program to include about 2,900 new urban wards not covered 
previously by any of the UPP operations. It will not support the CCT Program. 
 
12. 
UPP 2 was chosen for additional financing, because: (a) the funding gap is in 
kelurahans covered by UPP 1 and UPP 2; and, (b) the project management staff is well 
experienced and has significantly lighter workload than that of UPP 3. A new investment 
operation, such as a Specific Investment Loan (SIL), is not being utilized in this case as it 
would have increased borrower transaction costs without bringing substantive benefits to the 
project design. The streamlined appraisal and approval process of the additional financing 
mechanism provides the most flexibility for assisting the GOI in meeting the immediate 
funding gap in this transition period from UPP to the institutionalization of the PNPM 
program, of which the UPP model is a cornerstone.

13. 
The UPP 2 additional financing will follow the current project design, while 
incorporating improvements made in the design of UPP 3, such as the revised ACAP and 
simplified disbursement arrangements. The additional financing will only be applied to the 
following project components: Community Development and Local Government Capacity 
Building; Kelurahan Grants; and, Implementation Support. The Poverty Alleviation 
Partnership Grant (PAPG) component is not included as part of the PNPM because it focuses 
on larger infrastructure. 
 
14. 
The additional financing to UPP 2 will: 
·
Provide block grants to 2,636 kelurahans supported by UPP 1 and UPP 2;  
·
Add 2,911 new kelurahans not covered previously by UPP 1, UPP 2, or UPP 3; 
·
Decentralize budget documents for block grants, the hiring of the 
facilitators/individual consultants, and payment of salaries to the provincial level; 
·
Improve protocols for disbursement of block grants to the BKM
s’ bank accounts; 
Page  6

·
Build the capacity of the Project Management Unit (PMU); 
·
Improve the training program for consultants and facilitators, including modules 
on community-based disaster management; 
·
Implement the revised anti-corruption action plan (i.e., the UPP 3 ACAP);  
·
Strengthen the UPP website (
www.p2kp.org
)
for complaint handling, disclosure 
of contract information, and for progress reports on payment information; 
·
Improve the Project Management Information System (MIS); 
·
Strengthen the independent ex post review of community grants of at least 2 
percent by value of procurement under community grants and village facilitator 
contracts, according to the audit terms of reference (TOR); and, 
·
Undertake an in-depth analysis on the status of UPP revolving funds. 
 
15. 
The additional financing will cover about 7,300 kelurahans in all 33 provinces in 
Indonesia (see Table 3 below). The 2,911 new kelurahans will carry out the full, basic cycle of 
UPP through June 2008; however, they will only be eligible to receive 20 percent of the total 
grant amount to undertake socialization activities because they may not have adequate capacity 
to manage the full block grant. Existing UPP 1 and UPP 2 areas are already well-versed in UPP 
procedures and will receive the full block grant amount. Remaining ex-UPP kelurahans not 
covered by this additional financing will either be addressed by KDP as part of the PNPM or 
have been designated as non-performing kelurahans ineligible for funding.

TRATEGY
 
20. 
The Bank’s latest Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) dated October 2003 identifies 
two primary constraints to reducing poverty in Indonesia: (a) inadequate productive 
employment opportunities resulting from a weak investment climate; and, (b) lack of quality 
service delivery to poor people. Progress in these two areas has been compromised by the 
underlying problem of weak governance. The CAS aims to address these constraints through 
four delivery platforms, including a community-driven development (CDD) platform. 
Approximately 25 percent of Bank lending during the CAS period is expected to be directed 
through the CDD platform, primarily through the UPP and KDP programs. 
 
21. 
The 2006 CAS Progress Report states that the Bank’s program in Indonesia will be 
expanded through: (a) stronger support for governance reform via civil service reform and 
transparent, nationwide poverty programs; (b) focus on disaster risk management; (c) increase 
in program financing for the remainder of this CAS period; and (d) stronger partnerships. The 
proposed additional financing will primarily support areas (a) and (b).

PPRAISAL 
R
ESULTS
 
22. 
In December 2006, a Bank team appraised GOI’s request for US$140 million as 
additional financing for UPP 2, using the same procedures as for the original project. The 
appraisal concluded additional financing for the project would benefit the urban poor on a 
larger scale and would have a positive impact on the development and implementation of the 
PNPM. Key results of appraisal are outlined below. 
 
23. 
Management capacity of the PMU.
 The issue of capacity to address the increased 
scale of the project has been addressed by: (a) hiring additional contract managers (PPK) under 
the PMU; (b) establishment of a budgeting unit (satker) in each province; (c) placement of 
additional government staff within the PMU; and (d) increasing the number of project 
management consultants. The PMU will also decentralize disbursement authority at the 
provincial level, except for the key consultants. This decentralization has been tested under 
UPP 3 and has proven to enhance significantly the capacity of the PMU. 
 
24. 
Mobilization and training of facilitators. 
A
second possible scale-up issue is whether 
sufficient technical and social facilitators can be rapidly mobilized, trained and deployed. 
Currently UPP 2 consultants are operating in all areas covered by this additional financing; 
however, at the local level, about 3,700 new facilitators must be mobilized and trained. To 
address these issues, GOI has developed consultant mobilization and training strategies, which 
include plans for phased recruitment and improvements to the content and delivery of training 
modules. Because of continuity requirements and previous program effectiveness, the existing 
Page  8
8
UPP consultants’ contracts (both the National Management Consultant and the Oversight 
Consultants) will be extended to cover the 2007 PNPM work. Facilitators will be mobilized 
and trained in stages, beginning with the strengthening of the existing UPP areas that will 
receive kelurahan block grants through the additional financing. 
 
25. 
Financial management.
 The Bank reviewed the financial management assessment for 
UPP 2 in the context of the additional financing. A risk assessment carried out by financial 
management specialists confirms that the project risk rating is substantial after mitigation 
measures are put in place. The financial management arrangements and modifications to the 
disbursement mechanism outlined in Annex 4 will satisfy the Bank’s minimum requirements 
under OP/BP10.02 and 13.20.  
 
26.
 
Targeting of kelurahans.
 In 2007 the project will target 7,273 kelurahans located in 
834 kecamatans.  These kelurahans, which contain approximately 3 million people, were 
selected based on:  (a) their location in urban kecamatans; and (b) their having a poverty rate 
equal to or exceeding 10 percent of the population. GOI’s UPP and KDP teams have worked 
closely to ensure there is no geographic overlap between the two projects under the PNPM. 
 
27. 
Revolving funds.
 Revolving funds will be limited to those kelurahans which have 
already benefited under the component and which have demonstrated repayment rates of at 
least 80 percent. This decision was taken to avoid expansion of the program, which has not yet 
undergone a thorough evaluation of its efficacy and impact. Complementary to the revolving 
fund assessment mentioned in paragraph 14, the Bank will undertake a rapid assessment of the 
UPP 2 revolving fund program will be carried out jointly with KDP in May 2007. The result of 
these assessments will inform the development of future revolving fund operations under the 
PNPM. 
 
28.
 Procurement.
 Procurement will consist of hiring a number of management 
consultants (large value contracts), monitoring consultants, and individual facilitators, in 
addition to allocation of some 70 percent of the project funds for community grants following 
the existing community participation procedures. Procurement under the community grants 
will follow community participation, using forms and procedures as defined in the existing 
Project Operational Manual of UPP 2, with minor revisions to include the additional villages. 
Based on previous implementation of UPP, it is apparent that these procedures greatly 
increase the transparency of the procurement process; adherence to these procedures has 
significantly improved. There were no significant findings during recent missions or audits, 
except the lack of availability of documentation at the community level. This will be part of 
enforcement under this additional financing. The overall project risk for procurement is 
high
,
considering the large size of contracts/loan amount as well as the short implementation 
period. The revised procurement arrangements are attached as Annex 5. 
 
29.
 Community-based 
disaster 
management. 
The additional financing will support the 
execution of a training module for UPP facilitators to (a) raise awareness of existing risks; and 
(b) engage communities in risk reduction and preparedness activities. The consultants and 
facilitators may provide technical support to communities that request assistance to incorporate 
Page  9
9
disaster management into their community development plans.
 
Under the multi-donor Java 
Reconstruction Fund, a grant has been provided to develop these modules.
 
30. 
Anti-corruption action plan.
 GOI will adopt the comprehensive UPP 3 anti-
corruption action plan (ACAP), which is an enhancement of the existing UPP 2 ACAP. The 
project will build upon the many good governance features already being implemented, 
including the UPP website, which is often cited as a best practice example of information 
disclosure as well as a quick, low-cost way of gathering feedback from the field. 
Enhancements to the original UPP 2 ACAP include: improved transparency and disclosure 
provisions; civil society oversight; mitigation of fraud, collusion and nepotism; an efficient 
complaint handling mechanism; and, sanctions and remedies. The revised ACAP is attached 
as Annex 6. 
 
31.
 Results 
monitoring.
 The UPP 2 results monitoring framework has been revised to 
track the changes that have been incorporated in the project. Additional outcome indicators 
(such as the level of beneficiaries’ satisfaction of services, the cost-effectiveness of services 
provided, and level of community participation in the project) and output indicators (such as 
the quality of infrastructure services, percentage of CDPs implemented) have been 
introduced for the three components receiving additional financing. The UPP 2 monitoring 
system will be utilized, with improvements to data collection and verification methods, spot 
checks, and the complaints handling mechanism. The revised results monitoring framework 
is attached as Annex 3.

Economic and financial analyses. 
The economic analysis is consistent with the 
analysis presented in the UPP 2 PAD. The additional financing will cover 7,273 kelurahans. 
The proposed expansion of UPP 2 to existing and new kelurahans will cost about US$172.2 
million, including the cost of the block grants, training, and facilitation. About 1,726 
kelurahans out of the total will be included through the ongoing UPP 3 project, costing about 
US$67 million. In total, scaling up UPP to the level proposed by government for 2007 
requires additional financing of about US$239.2 million. After taking into account the US$67 
million allocated from UPP 3, a financing gap of about US$144.2 million exists, of which the 
government has already allocated US$28 million from the national budget. Communities are 
also expected to contribute financial and human resources estimated at US$8.6 million.

Safeguard policies and arrangements.
 
The project will retain the safeguards 
classification of Category B. The Social and Environmental Safeguards Guidelines and 
Frameworks outlined in the UPP 3 Project Operational Manual will be applicable to this 
project.

Expected outcomes of the additional financing include: (a) targeted poor urban 
households receive improved services through the project; (b) infrastructure is of high quality 
and is less costly than non-community based construction; (c) beneficiaries are satisfied with 
the improved services and infrastructure; (d) the BKMs are representative, effective, and 
operate in a participatory manner; and, (e) local governments provide support to the program.

The Government is also expected to establish a long term financial framework for its poverty 
reduction program.  
 
35. 
Sustainability. 
 Sustainability of the UPP program has been broadly demonstrated:  
strong community participation ensures buy-in and demand; local government participation 
ensures additional support and institutionalization of the process as well as increasing scale; 
and investments have been proven to be of high quality and more economical under the UPP 
methodology vis-
à-vis traditional contracting. In addition, the program has been scaled-up 
through successive operations that have built upon the successes and expanded the 
geographic scope of the previous operations. The model has been adopted by at least 51 
municipalities that operate independent, complementary programs using the UPP framework. 
The model has also been successful in leveraging support from NGOs and social 
organizations, which use UPP as a vehicle for channeling financial support to poor urban 
communities. The success of UPP has led to the adoption of the program throughout the 
country and is the basis, as indicated, for the PNPM, with an annual allocation of US$1.5 
billion from 2008-15.

The project will have a positive impact on the development and execution of the 
PNPM. Specifically, the project will benefit poor urban communities in Indonesia through 
geographic expansion of UPP to new areas and the provision of supplemental kelurahan grants.  
 
37. 
Risks.
 There are three main risks related to the scale up of UPP 2. The first risk is the 
management capacity of MPW, which is still operating both UPP 2 and UPP 3. This additional 
financing may stretch the capacity of the agency. This risk will be mitigated through the 
implementation of the Government’s capacity building strategy for the UPP Project 
Management Unit (PMU), as discussed above in section E. The second risk is the recruitment 
and training of about 3,700 facilitators and other consultants. This risk will be mitigated 
through the adoption of the government’s strategy for rapid recruitment and training of new 
facilitators and consultants through extension of existing consultants’ contracts, phased 
recruitment, and enhanced training programs, an approach that has already been successfully 
implemented in Aceh and Yogyakarta. The third risk is the possible delay in the authorization 
of the budget and slow processing of payments through the regional treasury office. To 
minimize this risk, a more efficient disbursement mechanism has been agreed with the 
Government that follows the arrangement currently utilized in UPP 3.
