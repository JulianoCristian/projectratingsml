 1. Introduction. Management briefed the Executive Directors on February 1,2005 on
 the role o f the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA in responding to the aftermath of the
December 26, 2004 Tsunami'. As the Board i s aware, World Bank staff in affected
countries including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Maldives, moved quickly to (a) provide
 assistance on the ground for expedited recovery planning; (b) mobilize financial support;
and (c) help coordinate rehabilitation and recovery support. In Indonesia, as in other
tsunami-affected countries, the progress on all three fronts has been satisfactory. In
particular, the flow o f emergency relief assistance, coordinated by the Government o f
Indonesia (GOI) and the United Nations has since stabilized and i s reaching the affected
areas and the population efficiently.

2.    Reconstruction of tsunami-affected areas.       The GO1 and development partners
including the Bank have since completed a damage and loss assessment; discussed its
main conclusions and recommendations with development partners at the Consultative
Group on Indonesia meetings held in Jakarta in January 2005; and secured initial
commitments from development partners for longer term assistance. A comprehensive
blueprint or strategic master plan for the reconstruction and rehabilitation o f the tsunami-
affected areas i s nearing finalization. It i s being developed by GO1 with support from
donors and the participation of the Acehnese.            The World Bank's support for
rehabilitation and reconstruction o f Tsunami-affected areas i s aimed at the restoration of
core services, followed by support for rebuilding and reconstructing the region.

 3.   Operationalizing Financial Sup~ort.With regard to operationalizing its financial
 support, the Bank and GO1 have discussed and agreed to proceed with the following
 approaches: (a) Reallocate savings from existing IDA projects; (b) Process New Projects
 to include reconstruction of Tsunami-affected areas, funded by IDA credit and co-
 financing with grant funds from other donors; (c) Establish a Multi-Donor Trust Fund
 (MDTF) that will mobilize grant funding from key donors and (d) process several grant
 proposals funded by Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) and other grant sources,
 including Country Trust Funds (CTF). While parallel initiatives are underway under (b),
 (c) and (d), this project restructuring paper seeks the approval o f the Executive Directors
 to restructure three relevant ongoing projects by adding new components to facilitate the
 timely delivery o f financial assistance to tsunami-affected areas. This i s to be achieved
 through transferring the savings (IDA Credits) achieved under existing components to the
 4.   new components, o f the following three projects:         (1) Second Urban Poverty
 Project; (2) Second Kecamatan Development Project; and (3) Third Kecamatan
 Development Project. Specific details on the restructuring o f each project are provided
 below.

 Second UrbanPoverty Project (Cr. No. 3658-IND)

 5.   Background and Rationale for Restructuring: The project was approved on June 11,
 2002 and became effective on November 18, 2002; the credit closing date i s June 30,
 2008. The objectives o f this project were: (i)  to establish or support representative and
 accountable community organizations that are able to provide services to the urban poor
 and increase the voice of the poor in public decision making; (ii)to make local
 governments more responsive to the needs o f the poor through increased cooperation
 with community organizations; and (iii) improve services for the urban poor (financial
                                           to
services, social services and infrastructure).     These objectives were to be achieved
through: (i)  building community capacity for the formation and institutionalization of
elected representative organizations that were accountable to communities; (ii)    provision
o f grants to communities directly and transparently through these community based
organizations to finance poverty alleviation activities; and (iii)enhancing the capacity of
local governments to partner with community organizations in services provision through
the establishment of a Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grant.

6.    The geographical coverage of this project included the provinces o f Banten, Jawa
Barat, Jawa Tengah, Jawa Timur, Nusa Tenggara Barat, Kalimantan Barat, Kalimantan
Tengah, Kalimantan Selatan, Sulawesi Utara, Gorontalo, Sulawesi Tengah, Sulawesi
Selatan, and Sulawesi Tenggara.

7.   There was some delay in initiating project implementation due to delays in the
selections o f consultants and community facilitators. N o w that the consultants have been
mobilized and more than 800 facilitators have been working in over 2400 kelurahans
(urban sub-districts), most o f the target communities are engaged in the preparation of
community development plans. It i s expected that the project grants to the various
community projects will be disbursed in 2005. Overall the project performance i s rated
as satisfactory.   However, GO1 expects some savings in completing the originally
contemplated program and seeks to allocate a sum o f $5 million equivalent o f IDA Credit
to a new component to support reconstruction/ rehabilitation o f Tsunami-affected areas.

                                                3

  8.   Proposed Changes: Specifically, the proposed changes in the project include (i)
 addition of a component that will cover the preparation and implementation of a
 reconstruction program in the devastated areas, including carrying out of infrastructure
 investment, social services and welfare sub-projects through the provision of Special
 Kelurahan Reconstruction Grants; and (ii)      expansion of the geographical scope of the
 project to include the tsunami-affected Aceh and North Sumatra provinces. There will be
 no changes in the institutional arrangements, financial management, procurement, and
 implementation schedules, or to the original closing date of this project, other than an
 addendum to the existing UPP 2 project manual to cover the specific requirements for
 this work. The adoption of an addendum to the existing project manual to cover the
 specific requirements of emergency assistance in the devastated area will be a condition
 for disbursement for the new component.

 9.    Financial and Economic Analysis and Compliance with Safeguards: The proposed
 changes do not affect substantially the original economic, financial, technical,
 institutional, or social aspects of project, nor do they change the environmental category
 of the project. Furthermore, no exception to Bank poIicies are involved.

 10. Benefits and Risks: The proposed restructuring of the project will not affect the
 attainment of expected outcomes and related outcome indicators. Instead the restructured
 project will make an additional contribution in terms of providing means of employment
 and livelihood, and improving the lives of the people in the affected areas. Additional
 indicators for monitoring progress under this component include the number of
participating kelurahan, and the number of proposals funded under the tsunami-affected
 areas rehabilitation and reconstruction component.

 11. The risks under the existing project are being managed effectively. One risk that
could affect the achievement of results under the new component, arises from possible
inadequate availability of qualified facilitators in the devastated area. This risk will be
mitigated by relocating some of the experienced project facilitators from other areas
where project activities are well advanced, to the tsunami-affected areas. Additional
remuneration and benefits, as well as appropriate facilitator training will be provided, as
warranted.

Second KecamatanDevelopment Project (KDP2; Cr. No. 3535-IND)

12. Background and Rationale for Restructuring: The project was approved on June 26,
2001 and became effective on January 17, 2002. The credit closing date i s December 31,
2006. The project objectives were to (i)support participatory planning and development
management in villages; (ii)support a broad construction program of social and
economic infrastructure in poor villages; and (iii)    strengthen local formal and informal
institutions by making them more inclusive, accountable, and effective at meeting
villagers' self-identified development needs. The project was a continuation of a longer-
term participatory program for poverty reduction that includes the two Village
InfrastructureProjects and the first Kecamatan Development Project.

13. At the time the earthquake and Tsunami struck Aceh (December 2004), KDP2 was
operational in almost 40% of the subdistricts in Aceh, with a large facilitators network in

                                                4


  place. The addition of a new component to the existing project will further the provision
  of financial assistance to tsunami-affected Kecamatans (sub-districts) and participating
  households.

  14. Proposed Changes: KDP 2's extensive field presence means that it i s often able to
 provide a rapid response to natural disasters.        In late 2004, Indonesia faced three
  significant natural disasters: the earthquake and tidal wave that devastated Aceh and
 North Sumatra; an earthquake in Alor that fully or partially destroyed 35 villages; and
  another earthquake inWest Papua that badly damaged the district of Nabire.

  15. The proposed change to the original project will add a component ($5 million
 equivalent) to support the preparation and implementation of a reconstructionprogram in
 the devastated areas noted above, through the provision of Grants to Desas (villages),
 including: carrying out of infrastructure investment projects in Kecamatans; carrying out
 of small construction and rehabilitation projects in villages; carrying out of social
 services projects in villages; carrying out of poverty reduction pilot projects in villages.
 Additionally, it will include the carrying out o f economic activities in villages, through
 the provision of Grants to selected poor women; and income-generating investment
 projects in villages, through the provision of Sub-loans to Sub-borrowers.

 16. Other than an addendum to the KDP existing project manual to cover specific
 requirements for the provision of financial assistance to disaster-affected areas and
 households, there will be no changes in the institutional arrangements, financial
 management, procurement, implementationschedules and closing date

 17. Financial and Economic Analysis and Compliance with Safeguards: The proposed
 changes do not affect substantially the original economic, financial, technical,
 institutional, or social aspects of project, nor do they change the environmental category
 of the project. Furthermore, no exception to Bank policies are involved.

 18. Benefits and Risks: The risks that could jeopardize the achievement of the
restructuredproject's development objectives would be the facilitators' lack of familiarity
of an emergency cycle for provision of funds to communities. This risk i s mitigated by
offering special training on the emergency reconstruction program to the relevant
facilitators.   An addendum to the existing KDP operational manual that was tailor-
designed for these emergency reconstruction contexts has been reviewed by the Bank.
The adoption of such addendum to the manual is set as a condition for disbursement. As
reconstruction proceeds, affected provinces can return to normal KDP programming and
procedures.

Third KecamatanDevelopmentProject(KDP-3;Cr. No. 3806-IND).

19. Background and Rationale for Restructuring.           The project was approved in June
26, 2003 and becomes effective on January 20,2005. The credit closing date i s December
31, 2008.     The overall project development objectives were reducing poverty and
improving local-level governance in rural Indonesia. KDP i s part of a long-term village
level governance program that began with the first Kecamatan Project in 1998. Specific
development objectives for KDP-3 include: (i)      institutionalizing participatory processes

                                                5

in local government; (ii)the cost effective provision of basic social and economic
infrastructure; (iii) strengthening the capacity of the micro-finance institutions developed
under KDP-1 and KDP-2 to manage and monitor funds sustainably.

20. At the time the earthquake and Tsunami struck Aceh, KDP was operational in
almost 40% o f the subdistricts in Aceh, with a large facilitators' network in place. This
Emergency Reconstruction assistance will allow KDP to provide an emergency cycle of
funds

21. Proposed Changes:         The proposed change to the original project will add a
component ($10 million equivalent) to support the preparation and implementation o f a
reconstruction program in the devastated areas specified under para. 12 above, through
financing o f activities similar to those discussed for KDP2 above.

22. As for the other two projects, other than an addendum to the existing project manual
to cover specific requirements for the provision o f financial assistance to disaster-affected
areas and households, there will be no changes in the institutional arrangements, financial
management, procurement, implementation schedules and closing date.

23. Financial and Economic Analysis and Compliance with Safeguards: The proposed
changes do not affect substantially the original economic, financial, technical,
institutional, or social aspects o f project, nor do they change the environmental category
of the project. Furthermore, no exceptions to Bank policies are involved.

24. Benefits and Risks: These as well as the mitigating measures are also similar to the
benefits, risks and measures discussed under KDP 2 above.
