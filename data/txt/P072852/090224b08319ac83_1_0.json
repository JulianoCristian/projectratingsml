For tens of thousands of\n            Indonesia\u2019s urban poor, the situation went from bad to worse\n            following the Asian financial crisis of 1997. High inflation\n            was compounded by lower or lost income, triggering a spike\n            in urban poverty numbers. The Second Urban Poverty Program,\n            funded by World Bank, took a successful project in urban\n            poverty reduction and provided it with the resources to take\n            its approach nationwide. Communities under the program were\n            getting treatment in new health clinics, sending their\n            children to renovated schools, driving on smoother roads,\n            using cleaner water, and buying their goods from various new\n            small businesses. The broader phase of the program has also\n            helped better connect the communities and their local\n            governments, making local development a collaborative and\n            transparent effort."}, "docdt": "2011-04-05T08:06:05Z"}
