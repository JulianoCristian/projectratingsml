The objective of\n            the project was to prepare an integrated plan for flood\n            control and development in the Plain of Antananarivo.\n            Specifically: (a) technically coherent and financially\n            feasible pre-investment studies were to be conducted at a\n            pre-feasibility stage for flood control and expansion of\n            economic activities; (b) the network of research stations\n            for erosion and soil protection, hydrological measurements\n            and flood alerts, was to be improved; and (c) the capability\n            of the Directorate General of Planning was to be\n            strengthened to supervise the project. This was a successful\n            Technical Assistance project. The final master plan for the\n            rehabilitation and long-term development was revised to\n            minimize investment needs and maximize economic benefits, to\n            improve the flood-warning system for the lower town of\n            Antananarivo, and for institutional coordination of major\n            structures in the plain. The master plan was used as the\n            basis for the Antananarivo Plain Development Project which\n            was approved on March 29, 1990. It also led to significant\n            donor support for other projects on the plain."}, "docdt": "1992-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
