erosion and soil protection on the upper catchment
areas of the Plain of Antananarivo; improvement of
the hydrological and flood alarm network in the
Plain.
(c) Strengthening the capability of the Directorate
General of Planning of the Ministry of Finance and
Planning to supervise the program of studies and
action for the Plain.
(iii)  Benefits:  The Project would enable the Government
to address the critical and long-standing issue
of flood control in the Plain of Antananarivo area,
and to establish an appropriate long-term development
program for the region.

(iv)  Risks.  Risks relate to the complexity of the technical
problems involved, the intricacy of the coordination
and decision-making process and the uncertainty over
the feasibility of a flood control scheme. Steps have
been taken to reduce these risks; although they
cannot be totally eliminated, they are acceptable.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR THE STUDY OF THE PLAIN OF ANTANANARIVO
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Republic of Madagascar for the equivalent
of SDR 1.8 million (US$2.3 million) on standard IDA terms to help finance a
Technical Assistance Project to study the Plain of Antananarivo to be imple-
mented under the direction of the Directorate General of Planning of the
Ministry of Finance and Planning.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Madagascar - Recent Economic Developments and
Future Prospects" was distributed to the Executive Directors on October 24,
1979. Country data sheets are provided in Annex 1 to this report. An economic
mission visited Madagascar in August 1980 and is currently preparing its
report. A summary of recent economic developments is set out below.
3.        With a population of 8.3 million and a per capita GNP about US$250
in 1978, Madagascar is amongst the poorest countries in the world. It is
estimated that about 50 percent of the population subsists below the absolute
poverty level. Less than 20 percent of the population lives in urban areas
and about 85 percent of the national labor force is engaged in agricultural
activity. Although the country is sparsely populated (about 14 persons per
sq. km) and generally well endowed with natural resources and a variety of
soils, there are considerable regional variations in ecology and climate. The
highlands are more advanced economically than the coastal regions; the south
is the poorest region with an arid climate and infertile soils while in the
east coast, although rich agriculturally, crops are frequently devastated by
cyclones. Poor road communications are a major impediment to development
both in terms of domestic commerce and the transport of export and import
goods to and from the major seaports.
4.        Up to 1978 Madagascar suffered from a trend of sluggish and erratic
growth which was below the pace of population expansion (about 2.5 percent per
annum). Due largely to prolonged drought conditions real GDP declined by
about 3.5 percent in 1976, increased by about 2 percent in 1977 and declined
again by about 2.5 percent in 1978. In 1978 real per capita GDP was about 16
percent below its 1972 level. With improved weather conditions and stimulated
by a sharp increase in investment, real GDP in 1979 grew by more than 10 per-
cent. The rapid growth in 1979 reflected a significant shift in the thrust



of offical policy to a more vigorous public investment effort and to a much
greater dependence on external sources for its financing. The share of
investment in GDP which has been around 14 percent since the early 1970's
rose sharply to about 22 percent in 1979. The increased investment thrust
and its attendant import needs coincided with sluggish exports and with
worsening terms of trade, Madagascar's balance of payments position deter-
iorated significantly in 1979.
5.        Agricultural output which had generally shown little growth in
recent years increased in 1979 with an overall volume growth of around 7
percent. Production of the main cash and export crops (coffee, cloves and
vanilla) all increased in 1979. Coffee production which had declined sharply
in 1976 and 1977, mainly due to weather, increased by about 14 percent in 1978
and by about 5 percent in 1979 to just below its pre 1976 level. Production
of cloves increased sharply in 1979 but with a falling world price export
receipts declined. Vanilla production which has been seriously affected by
competition from synthetic substitutes increased by about 75 percent in 1979
but was only about a third of the production level of the mid 1970's. Rice,
Madagascar's main food crop, showed a 6 percent production increase in 1979
to just over 2,000,000 tons but was still below its 1977 level of 2,154,000
tons. Rice production has fallen below domestic demand over recent years and
this together with serious transport problems impeding the domestic shipment
of rice has resulted in a growing volume of rice imports. The volume of rice
imports is estimated to have increased by about 30 percent in 1979 reaching
a level of 210,000 tons compared to an import of some 64,000 tons in 1975.
In 1979, rice imports accounted for about 9 percent of the value of total
merchandise imports.
6.        Industrial growth has been slow and erratic.  Within the manufac-
turing sector itself performance has, however, varied. The output of processed
foods and textiles which account for about 70 percent of manufacturing output
followed a stagnant or a declining trend. Among other minor industries such
as chemicals, tobacco manufactures, rubber and paper products, a fairly steady
growth has been maintained. Development of the sector has been encouraged by
promotional measures such as fiscal incentives, protection against competition
from imports and growing involvement of the state in ownership and control of
manufacturing. Industrial production now accounts for about 17 percent of
GDP.
7.        Madagascar's fiscal situation has deteriorated since 1975, due
to sharply rising current expenditure and increased Government spending on
capital investment. The current budget surplus, which used to be substantial,
turned to a deficit as revenues failed to keep pace with the growth of
expenditures. Furthermore, as Government intensified its efforts to raise
investment levels and stimulate the economy, public investment expenditure
rose from 13.1 billion FMG in 1975 to 60 billion FMG (US$282 million) in 1979.
Outlays on the consumer rice subsidy have increased from about 4 billion FMG
in 1975 to nearly 10 billion FMG (US$47 million) in 1979. The overall
Treasury deficit increased dramatically in 1979 to about 12 percent of GDP.



8.        Monetary and credit developments over recent years largely reflect
the government's deficit financing needs. Domestic credit increased from
about 102 billion FMG (US$427 million) at end 1976 to about 220 billion FMG
(US$1,034 million) at end 1979. Most of this expansion was accounted for by
Government borrowing from the Central Bank and its share of domestic credit
rose from about 20 percent in 1976 to about 45 percent in 1979. Despite a
significant reduction in net foreign assets, money supply grew by over 20
percent per annum during the 1976-1979 period i.e. almost twice the rate of
growth of nominal GDP over the same period. Available price information for
Madagascar is fragmentary. There is a wide-ranging system of controlled
prices which appears to have become inoperative with most goods selling at
prices well above control levels. A price index for low income families shows
an acceleration to about 14 percent in 1979 compared to an annual increase of
around 7 percent for the two or three preceeding years.
9.        Madagascar-s balance of payments position which has been funda-
mentally weak over recent years showed a significant deterioration in 1979.
Trade surpluses in 1976 and 1977 were due to a low level of imports and to
higher world export prices, particularly coffee, since the volume of exports
remained stagnant throughout the period. Falling export prices and a rising
import volume eliminated the trade surplus in 1978 and the current deficit
reached about US$140 million compared to about US$70 million in 1976. The
volume of total merchandise imports increased rapidly in 1979 and with rising
import prices (9 percent increase in 1979) the import bill increased by about
55 percent. The volume of exports declined in 1979 and with sluggish world
prices export receipts declined by about 4 percent. The current deficit
reached about US$500 million in 1979 and the overall deficit over US$200
million.
10.       The development of the Malagasy economy has been constrained over
many years by a number of basic weaknesses, e.g. low productivity in agricul-
ture, slow growth in major primary exports and inadequate domestic savings.
The sharp deterioration in Madagascar's economic and financial situation in
1979 reflects these continuing problems. The significant shift in government
policy firstly in a greater openness to external finance and, also, in pushing
vigorously for a higher level of investment has been accompanied by continued
sluggish export performance and deterioration in the terms of trade. The
import bill has been swollen not only by imports of capital goods but also by
a growing import of consumer goods, especially rice for which domestic produc-
tion and distribution weaknesses are a serious problem. The country is well
endowed with natural resources and has a relatively efficient administrative
structure. A more effective use of these resources depends, however, on a
lasting correction to the serious imbalances which exist on both balance of
payments and government budget accounts. Negotiations are in process to agree
on a program of action with the International Monetary Fund and preparatory
work has begun on a Medium Term Plan for the years 1981-84.
11.       The draft Plan for 1981-1984 envisages a much more vigorous effort
of export expansion and an action program for greater self sufficiency in food
production. It also envisages a much greater decentralization in economic
management and decision-making. Administrative steps have already been taken
to strengthen regional economic planning. Priority is to be attached to



- 4 -
productive investment and a greatly increased share of investment in agricul-
ture and transport is contemplated. These efforts will require a careful
appraisal, selection and monitoring of investment projects since domestic
savings and external resource availability are likely to be important
constraints.
12.        With the shift in government policy to a greater reliance on foreign
financing, Madagascar's external debt has increased substantially over recent
years. According to the Central Bank's estimates, total external debt at end
1979 amounted to about US$636 million compared to about US$360 million at end
1978. There has been a greater diversification in sources of external financing
but average terms have hardened significantly. Consequently, the debt service
ratio has risen from arounA 3 percent in 1976 to about 9 percent in 1979.
With increased borrowing on short-term (less than 1 year maturity) and
exceptional financing arrangements for the large balance of payments deficit
in 1979, Madagascar's external payments and debt service capacity has come
under increasing strain.
13.       The World Bank group has provided about 45 percent of the conces-
sionary assistance which Madagascar received between 1975 and 1979, but over
the same period around 40 percent of external public borrowing has been from
non-concessionary sources. Increased external financing including some
local cost financing on a concessionary basis will be required to support the
governments economic restructuring and development efforts. The Government
should limit its reliance on conventional borrowing to ensure continued
capacity to service external debt.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MADAGASCAR
L4.       Outstanding IDA credits to Madagascar amount to US$264.19 million
and Bank loans total US$31.80 million. About 54 percent of Bank Group lending
has been for transport, 14 percent for electric power, 24 percent for agricul-
ture and 8 percent for education. IFC's first investment was made in March
1977 with an equity investment of US$290,000 and a loan of US$11.0 million
for the expansion of a textile mill. In May 1980, IFC made a US$1.25 million
loan for the Bata Shoe Manufacturing company in Antananarivo, and other
projects in leather and ferrochrome are under consideration. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits, and IFC investments
as of October 31, 1980, as well as notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
15.       Bank Group assistance to Madagascar has been concentrated on the
following key areas: infrastructure (including urban and social infrastruc-
ture), agriculture, energy and industry. In infrastructure, four projects
have been for the construction of all-weather highway links between the
island's different regions; a fifth highway project for road maintenance was



signed in July 1979. There has been a project for improving Madagascar's
main port of Toamasina (Tamatave) and one for modernizing the railway line
between Toamasina and Antananarivo; a second project supporting the railway's
modernization efforts was signed in June 1979. Urban infrastructure develop-
ment includes a first water supply and sanitation project for the capital
city of Antananarivo for which a US$20.5 million credit was approved in April
1980. In the social sector, education has been the major recipient of Bank
assistance with two projects totaling US$18.8 million. In addition, studies
for urban development financed by the UNDP with the Bank as Executing Agency
have started.
16.       Bank Group lending for agriculture consists of two livestock develop-
ment projects, two irrigation projects and a forestry project. A credit for
an agricultural development project in the Mangoky delta was signed in May
1979.  The first IDA-assisted agricultural credit of US$11.5 million (BTM)
was approved by the Executive Directors in September 1980. In the future
we expect agriculture to continue to absorb a larger share of Bank Group
lending, in line with Government strategy to expand agricultural production.
IDA is currently assisting the Government in preparing a third livestock project,
agricultural services, rural development and small-scale irrigation projects. A
second forestry project has been appraised.
17.       Energy projects have also been receiving Bank Group attention:
IDA has provided financing for part of the cost of the large Andekaleka
Hydroelectric project for a total of US$43 million. Substantial bilateral
assistance was also secured by the Government to meet the total cost of the
project estimated at about US$150 million. Furthermore, a petroleum explora-
tion promotion project signed in May 1980 provided US$12.5 million credit to
the Government to support its efforts to develop a domestic supply of hydro-
carbons and improve planning of the energy sector. A second project is under
preparation to finance a feasibility study for heavy oil. Support for general
industrial promotion would be generated through a first credit of US$5.0 mil-
lion for an industrial bank project (BNI) approved by the Board in January
1980.
18.       In the past, problems have arisen in the course of execution of
several projects. There were delays in execution, cost overruns and defi-
ciencies in management and institution building, especially in agriculture.
The Morondava irrigation project signed in 1973 had to be substantially
reduced, and the Government has prepared a plan of action to deal with the
remaining problems. The main aspects of this plan include a redefinition of
the implementing agency's (SODEMO) responsibilities and financial structure,
completion and audit of overdue accounts, and preparation of an investment
program and budget for the development of the Morondava area. Implementation
of the plan of action has started and is being closely monitored by the
Government and the Association. The Village Livestock project signed in 1974
has improved substantially, although the disbursements remain slow. On the
other hand, the Mangoro Forestry project is ahead of schedule, and cost
estimates are in line with forecasts. The first three highway projects have
been completed. The fourth project is still being implemented; the road
construction component is nearly completed and the maintenance studies have



been completed. However, there has been a delay in the start of the recom-
mended highway maintenance training program for the Ministry of Public Works
personnel. Since training of local staff is essential, Government has agreed
that training consultants be employed and that construction of training
facilities would begin in the first half of 1981. Preparations for the start
of the fifth highway project are underway.
19.       Since the start of our program in Madagascar four projects all of
which included technical assistance have been completed and audited by the
Operations Evaluation Department. The audit report No. 1622 of December 17,
1976 on the Lac Alaotra project concluded that the project was generally quite
successful. However, the performance of Somalac, the project implementation
agency, has deteriorated considerably since the completion of the project.
The audit report No. 1559 of April 11, 1977 on the Beef Cattle Development
Project concluded that the Project had contributed little to Madagascar. The
audit report No. 2143 of July 27, 1978 concluded that the Madagascar Third
Highway Project was well justified and had a good rate of return despite the
substantial cost overrun experienced by the project. The audit confirmed
that training of local staff and adequate provision of Government funds were
essential factors for a successful road maintenance program. Report No. 2299
of December 22, 1978 concluded that the physical objectives of the Tamatave
Port Project were satisfactorily achieved, but pointed out that the insti-
tutional objective was not accomplished during project implementation because
of inadequacies in the staffing of the port authority. With the exception of
the Port Project, the technical assistance components of all four projects were
executed satisfactorily, and made a significant contribution to institution-
building.
PART III - THE PLAIN OF ANTANANARIVO AREA
Background
20.       The Plain of Antananarivo occupies a central position in Madagascar;
it covers an area estimated at 18,000 ha and lies at an altitude of about
1,250 m. Rains occur in the period November to March and are often heavy,
particularly during cyclones; sometimes up to 400 mm of rain falls in a single
month.  The average temperature is 180C, but during the cold season the daily
minima are 90to 100C. The principal rivers draining the Plain are the Ikopa,
which is a tributary of the Betsiboka, and its three major tributaries: the
Mamba, the Sisaony and the Andromba. The catchment basin of the Ikopa, when
it leaves the Plain at Bevomanga, covers about 4,200 km (Maps IBRD 14964 and
14965).
21.       The city of Antananarivo and the neighboring villages were originally
built on the hills located on the edge of the flat region formed by the alluvial
deposits of the Ikopa and its tributaries, mostly on the right bank of the
Ikopa. With the growth of the Antananarivo city and suburbs, and despite
regulations to the contrary, low-lying areas have been increasingly developed,
most of the time with low-standard dwellings lacking modern infrastructure.



- 7 -
22.       While historically based on the agricultural resources of the
region, the development of Antananarivo is principally supported at present by
a concentration of industrial and commercial activities. The city has light
industry (machine assembly and repair, food processing industries, etc.),
together with a substantial tertiary sector. The official census of July 1,
1975, which probably underestimated the real population figures, showed a
figure of 440,000 for the population of urban Antananarivo, and of 240,000
for the rural parts of Antananarivo, Ambohidratrimo and Arivonimamo combined.
23.       For 1980 the population of the Antananarivo area is estimated at
800,000 or 10 percent of the national population, and is expected to surpass
one million by 1990. The distinction between urban and rural populations is
purely administrative and virtually meaningless. Urban and rural settlements
are interconnected, most farmers have close ties with urban life, and in most
"rural" households, the principal source of income is from employment in the
city.
24.       Although most of the Plain is low-lying and subject to frequent
flooding, it is one of the oldest rice producing areas in Madagascar. Very
early in Malagasy history, it benefitted from reclamation of marshes, con-
struction of dykes and of drainage and irrigation canals. Paddy is by far
the dominant crop, with only one crop per year produced in most areas; paddy
yields vary from an estimated 1.9 to 3.3 tons per hectare. Production in
flat areas is irrigated, and higher lying areas on the Plain are also inten-
sively cultivated, mainly with foodcrops and vegetables. Substantial parts
of the lower slopes of the catchment areas are under cultivation, with
vegetables as the dominant crop.
25.       Considerable applied research and experimentation have been under-
taken on optimal farming systems for the Plain, but these have largely been
uncoordinated efforts. Results are not conclusive, mainly because no general
synthesis exists. It appears that double cropping of rice is uncertain,
mainly for climatic reasons, but that double cropping of rice with vegetables
or cereals such as wheat or maize may offer good potential. Some improved
varieties of rice have been tried in the Plain, but, as extension efforts
have been weak, application of research results has been very slow. Available
evidence suggests that an agricultural intensification program in the area
offers good potential for increasing production, for the following reasons:
(a) Major flood control and drainage works would offer some
potential for increasing agricultural production by
improving water control in existing rice areas (about
13,000 ha) and bringing new land (about 5,000 ha) under
cultivation;
(b) The extension services in the region could certainly
be improved; research on new varieties and new farming
systems offer good prospects. The population of the
Plain area appears to be relatively sophisticated and
receptive to extension advice and to improvements in
supply of inputs and credit; and



(c) A limited amount of inputs such as fertilizers are
presently used by farmers. The use of fertilizers,
made more attractive by the decrease in risks from
floods, would increase rice production.
The Flood Problem
26.       The Plain is subject to serious, periodic flooding from the Ikopa
river and its tributaries. These floods are intensified due to the following
conditions:
(i) The evacuation of water from the Plain is hampered by
the existence in the bed of the Ikopa of a rocky area
from Antambolo to Farahantsana, and especially by the
presence of a quartzite threshold at Bevomanga;
(ii) Most of the existing river beds and drainage system are
choked with islets or sand banks at least partly caused
by erosion in the catchment areas. The problem is
compounded by the uncontrolled development of water
hyacinth and the presence of additional man-made
obstacles such as narrow bridges or houses erected on
the islets;
(iii) The dredging of the existing drainage system is inade-
quate; the building of dykes has been accompanied by
the progressive raising of water levels, thus aggravat-
ing the risks in case of very large floods or leaks or
breaches in the dykes. The latter are frequent since
the maintenance of the dyke system is generally poor.
Moreover, gravity drainage becomes impossible in large
parts of the Plain which are below the water level
during most of the rainy season;
(iv) In the city of Antananarivo itself, existing drainage
and sewerage facilities are inadequate and are poorly
maintained. In addition to adverse consequences on
sanitary conditions, this situation creates serious
flooding inside the city, and water spills over to
developed low-lying areas where gravity drainage is
virtually impossible.
27.       Major floods occurred in 1954, 1959 and 1977.  In 1959, following
several breaches in the dyke on the right bank of the Ikopa, 20 percent of
the dwellings in the area were flooded and the Plain was under more than two
meters of water, parts of it for several months. The 1977 flood, although its
volume was not exceptional, caused major damage to the dykes because of their
generally poor state of maintenance. A dozen breaches were opened on the
Sisaony dykes and the Mamba dyke broke down at Laniera. About 16,000 persons
were affected, large areas of the city were flooded and an important part of
the rice crop was lost.

28.       Attempts to control flooding through dykes and drainage canals date
from as early as the period of unification of the island. Many comprehensive
flood protection plans, some going as far back as 100 years, have been proposed;
among these one can mention the Carle report (1914), the Coursin project (1931),
the Fontainp Plan (1957), the SOGREAH scheme (1968), and a WHO study (1974).
However, the complexity of the problem, together with the lack of technical
facilities and the absence of consensus among various decision-makers to
embark on costly long-term programs, has hampered progress up to now. Of all
the major suggestions made since 1914 to protect Antananarivo against floods,
only the construction of the dyke on the right bank of the Ikopa, the dams at
Tsiazompaniry and Mantasoa, and the lowering of the rock bottom at Bevomanga
and Tendro have been carried out. Although these works have helped to improve
the situation somewhat, they have fallen short of solving the problem. The
works to be executed in the Antananarivo Water Supply and Sanitation project
signed in May 1980 (mainly the rebuilding of the Andriantany canal) will
alleviate the flood problem within the boundaries of the city, but will not
address the broader issue of protecting the Plain area.
29.       The Government has at present no coherent multisectoral plan for the
protection of the city and the Plain against floods and the general development
of the area. The proposed project would fill this gap and assist the Govern-
ment in defining an integrated flood control and development program for the
Antananarivo area.
Institutions
30.        The Ministry of Finance and Planning through its Directorate
General of Planning has overall responsibility for planning in Madagascar and
is entrusted with a coordinating role in the design and implementation of all
investment programs. However, responsibility for the development of the Plain
of Antananarivo area is shared with a large number of agencies, among which
are the following:
(a) Ministry of Rural Development and Agrarian Reform, through
the Directorate of Waters and Forestry for the protection of
catchment areas; through the Directorate of Rural Engineering
for irrigation, agricultural drainage and river protection;
through the Agriculture and Livestock Departments, for agri-
cultural production and extension, and through the Directorate
of Studies and Planning, for general planning;
(b) The Ministry of Public Works, through its Directorate of
Urbanism and Housing, responsible in urban areas for urban
planning and control of construction, elaborating master plans
for drainage and sanitation, and implementing the construction
of new facilities. The Directorate of Public Works has a
basic responsibility for flood control, including maintenance
of dykes;



- 10 -
(c)  The Ministry of Economy and Commerce, involved in the economic
aspects of development programs through the Energy Department
of its Directorate of Industry and Mines; it is also responsible
for assessing water resources and, at least in principle, for
providing general guidance to water management undertakings;
(d)  The Ministry of Transport, Supply and Tourism, through its
Directorate of Meteorology is in charge of the hydrological
and meteorological networks;
(e)  The Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research,
through its Directorate of Research is in charge of research
in agriculture and forestry;
(f)  The Ministry of Public Health, responsible for overseeing
health aspects; and
(g)  JIRAMA, a Government-owned enterprise in charge of water
and electricity supply in Madagascar.
31.    En future, the Fokonolona system, a village level local government
institution and a fundamental aspect of Government decentralization policy,
may also become involved. However, the decentralization process is still in
its first stages, and the exact role that the Fokonolona institutions would
play in the definition and implementation of a development program for the
Plain of Antananarivo area is not yet defined.
Urban Planning
32.      Responsibility for urban planning for the city of Antananarivo
rests with the Ministry of Public Works, the Fokonolona institutions and the
Ministry of Finance and Planning. No significant progress has been made for
the updating of the 1974 urban master plan for Antananarivo and the existing
zoning regulations are haphazardly enforced. Preparation of an urban develop-
ment project is about to begin, with the Bank as Executing Agency for the
UNDP-funded preliminary studies. This project will provide an opportunity
to clarify the role of the institutions involved and strengthen planning
mechanisms.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.      The proposed project would be IDA's first multisectoral operation
in Madagascar. It was appraised in February 1980. No project Appraisal
Report was prepared. Negotiations were held in Washington from October 3 to
7, 1980. The Malagasy delegation was headed by Mr. Rajoana Andriamananjara,
Director General of Planning. A credit and project summary appears at the
beginning of this report, and a supplementary project data sheet is given in
Annex III. Two maps IBRD 14964 and 14965 are attached, showing in detail the
Plain of Antananarivo area.

Background
34-      During a February 1977 mission to identify agricultural projects,
the Government expressed an interest in a project for flood control and the
development of the Plain of Antananarivo area. At that time, the Ministry
of Finance and Planning indicated that such a project should be accorded the
highest priority among project possibilities under discussion between Madagascar
and IDA. The Government requested that the Bank Group finance a series of
studies related to these problems, and submitted draft terms of reference for
the proposed studies. The Government's objectives for the studies themselves
were at that time not yet clearly defined, and a Task Force on the problems of
the Plain of Antananarivo area was set up in the Bank in August 1978 in order
to coordinate Bank action and dialogue with the Government. By late 1979,
broad agreement had been reached with the Government on the objectives and the
scope of studies, and the project was subsequently appraised in February 1980.
Project Objectives and Description
35.      The objectives of the project would be to support the Government s
effort to institute a multisectoral approach to an integrated flood control
and development program for the Plain of Antananarivo area. The involvement
in project implementation of the General Directorate of Planning of the
Ministry of Finance and Planning would contribute to strengthening the coor-
dination, supervision and decision-making capabilities within that Ministry
and would pave the way for adequate institution building to implement the
flood control and development program envisaged.
36.       Specifically, the project would consist of the following components:
(i) Pre-investment studies to be conducted at a pre-feasibility
stage with the objective of defining a technically coherent,
economically justified and financially feasible investment
program. The studies would include:
(a) Review and critical analysis of existing documenta-
tion and experience with (i) available technical
options to protect the Plain area against floods
and improve drainage; and (ii) agronomic packages
to intensify agriculture in the region;
(b) Definition of possible flood control and development
schemes, taking into account their implications for the
future growth pattern of the Antananarivo urban area;
(c) Assessment of costs and benefits of possible schemes,
with an analysis of their consequences in all economic
sectors involved; and finally
(d) Definition of not more than five feasible programs
and a proposal for a choice among them; these programs
would also define self-contained and justified steps
for phased implementation.



- 12 -
The above studies would rely mainly on the available technical data which
is considered generally adequate for a pre-feasibility study. However,
a limited number of additional surveys are needed in aerial photography,
topography, geotechnics and pedology. In addition to the studies, the
project would:
(ii) Improve the network of research stations for erosion
and soil protection on the upper catchment areas of the
Plain, and improve hydrological and flood alarm
network in the Plain; and
(iii) strengthen the capability of the Directorate General of
Planning of the Ministry of Finance and Planning to supervise
the program of studies and action for the Plain.
Project Implementation
37.       A Technical Committee for the Plain of Antananarivo area was estab-
lished in 1977 under the Director General of Planning of the Ministry of
Finance and Planning, in order to prepare the proposed project and to provide
a forum of discussion among various agencies involved (see paragraph 30).
This Committee, which was instrumental in the preparation and discussion of
the terms of reference for the proposed studies, is composed of technical
officers of various Ministries concerned with the problems of the Plain.
By a ministerial decree No. 3807/80 of September 20, 1980 the Government has
redefined the status, powers and future role of the Technical Committee in
the execution of the project. With technical support from the Committee, the
Directorate General of Planning would have primary responsibility for the
implementation of the proposed project (Section 3.01, draft Development Credit
Agreement). The Directorate General of Planning plans to employ local consul-
tants to assist with the supervision of the studies. This assistance is required
because the Directorate General of Planning, which is not normally responsible for
project preparation and consultant supervision, does not have the staff required
to assure appropriate technical supervision.
38.       The implementation of the proposed project and the definition of
an integrated flood control and development program raise complex socio-
political issues which go well beyond the technical realm. The selection
of technical schemes for flood control and development of the plain has far-
reaching implications for the sensitive problem of urban planning and human
settlements in the Antananarivo area and involves inter alia an assessment of
the acceptable level of risks for flood control and fundamental choices for
future land use. The definition of phased investments for a program of
considerable magnitude would also raise difficult issues related to the
Government's overall investment program and financial capabilities. Numerous
agencies and ministries are involved, and a systematic effort will be required
to organize and expedite decisions which are essentially of a political
nature, after the preparatory work has been completed. These steps would
include clarification and speeding up of procedures for cabinet-level
decision-making on the initiative of the Minister of Finance and Planning.
The Government has agreed to appoint, as part of the project, consultants



- 13 -
to advise on appropriate arrangements for carrying out the study's recommen-
dations (see Part A (ii) of Schedule 2 to the draft Development Credit
Agreement). The consultants would be expected to review this aspect of
the problem and make concrete recommendations on ways to assure a speedy
implamentation of the study's findings.
39.       The Association worked closely with the Technical Committee in
preparing the terms of reference for the pre-investment engineering and
financial studies. At an interim stage of the studies, a preliminary tech-
nical review of available options would be undertaken and in consultation
with the Association a proposal would be made for the selection of not
more than five coherent technical schemes which would be subject to further
economic analysis to be included in the final report (Section 3.04, draft
Development Credit Agreement). The consultants- interim reports and drafts
of the final reports would be submitted to the Association for review and
comment (Section 3.03, draft Development Credit Agreement). Barring unexpected
developments, the project studies would be completed by June 30, 1983.
Project Costs and Financing
40.       Total project costs are estimated at about US$2.9 million including
a foreign exchange component of US$2.0 million or about 70 percent of total
costs. The proposed IDA credit of US$2.3 million would finance the estimated
foreign exchange component and US$300,000 in local costs. The balance of
about US$0.6 million, representing 20 percent of total costs, would be provided
by the Government. The credit would be made to the Government on standard
IDA terms. The studies would require about 196 manmonths of consultants'
services, out of which it is expected that about 80 manmonths would be
provided by local consultants. The total cost of consultants' services,
including salaries, fees, international travel and subsistence, but excluding
physical and price contingencies, is estimated at US$1.635 million. The
average manmonth cost for local consultants would be US$5,500. For expatri-
ates, it would be about US$10,600, including US$2,000 for local subsistence.
These figures are consistent with actual costs for consultants currently
employed in Madagascar for similar projects and are reasonable given the
level of expertise required.
41.       The contract cost for the studies under paragraph 36 (i) would
also include the cost of additional surveys (aerial photography, topography,
geotechnics and pedology) estimated at US$525,000 excluding physical and
price contingencies. Local transportation and some minor operating items are
estimated to cost US$355,000. The base costs of the equipment for the erosion
research station and the hydrological and flood alarm network are estimated
at US$35,000 and US$30,000, respectively; the base cost of the vehicles to be
allocated to the Directorate General of Planning is estimated at US$25,000.
42.       The base costs have been increased by 10 percent for physical
contingencies. The unit prices, which mostly include salaries, are expected
to increase annually by 12 percent in CY1980 and CY1981, and 10 percent
thereafter. The corresponding price contingencies would represent about 17
percent of the base costs plus physical contingencies.
Procurement and Disbursements
43.       The Directorate General of Planning would employ engineering,
management and financial consultants, whose qualifications, experience and



- 14 -
terms of employment would be satisfactory to IDA (Section 3.02(b), draft
Development Credit Agreement). The studies would most likely be carried out
by a foreign consulting firm or a consortium of consulting firms. Local
consulting capabilities are limited in scope, but within this limitation,
their quality is generally satisfactory; local consulting firms are routinely
associated with foreign firms. The surveys necessary for the studies would
be executed by local firms under the supervision and the responsibility of
the general contractor for the studies; their cost is included in the total
contract amount. Contracts for vehicles and scientific equipment, estimated
to cost less than US$100,000 in total, would be awarded on the basis of com-
petitive bidding advertised locally in accordance with Government's normal
procurement procedures which are satisfactory to the Association (Section
2.03(a), draft Development Credit Agreement). Disbursements for the project
will be fully documented. The credit would be disbursed against 80 percent of
total expenditures for the studies, including surveys; disbursement for the
equipment and vehicles mentioned under paragraph 41 would be made against 100
percent of foreign expenditures and 95 percent of local costs (exclusive of
taxes and duties). Retroactive financing of project expenditures for up to
about US$65,000 for expenditures made prior to signing but after November 1,
1980 is recommended to enable a quick start of the project studies (paragraph
4 of Schedule 1 to the draft Development Credit Agreement). The estimated
schedule of disbursements is given in the credit and project summary. The
closing date of the credit would be December 31, 1983.
Accounting and Reporting
44.       Given the relatively simple nature of the operation and the small
size of the credit, it is proposed that existing Government accounting proce-
dures be accepted for the purpose of this project and that such information
as the Association may reasonably request be furnished (Section 4.02 of the
draft Development Credit Agreement). The project would be monitored through
quarterly progress reports prepared by consultants and furnished to the
Association by the Government (Section 3.06(b), draft Development Credit
Agreement). The Directorate General of Planning would prepare a report on
the execution of the project and submit it to the Association no later than
six months after the completion of the project (draft Development Credit
Agreement, Section 3.06(c).
Benefits
45.       The Association's support for the project would enable the Govern-
ment to take the first steps necessary to address the critical flood problem
in the Antananarivo region. The objective is to reduce flood damage and set
up an appropriate long-term development program for the area. An essential
objective of this program would be to increase the region's agricultural
production, especially rice and vegetables. The development program envisaged,
and the proposed studies, would involve coordination between a large number
of institutions. Through its coordinating role in project preparation and
implementation, the Directorate General of Planning of the Ministry of Finance
and Planning would strengthen its functions and improve its technical cap-
ability by working with outside consultants. It is expected that the proposed
studies would result in the formulation of an appropriate integrated program
for flood control and development of the Antananarivo area. This is a large
and long-term undertaking and would include several self-contained and econo-
mically justified phases.



- 15 -
Risks
46.       There are three types of risks associated with the implementation
of this project. The first concerns the technical and socio-economic problems
involved, which are complex so that the design of a suitable development
program would require a high level of expertise. This risk would be offset
by the selection of an experienced consulting firm satisfactory to the Asso-
ciation, and by close monitoring of project progress. Second, the financial
feasibility and the economic benefit of a flood control program are still
uncertain. Even if a feasible program can be designed, socio-political and
institutional and financial constraints may lead to substantial delays in its
implementation. Third, the protection of the Antananarivo area against floods
is a sensitive issue in Madagascar, involving different and even conflicting
interests among various groups and decision-making bodies. There is a risk
that the Directorate General of Planning may fail in coordinating the institu-
tions involved, providing adequate guidance to the consultants and initiating
decisions on project-related issues. This risk has been offset by establish-
ing a Technical Committee and ensuring that the Directorate General of
Planning retains effective management of the project (para 37).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Democratic
Republic of Madagascar and the Association, and the Recommendation of the
Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement
of the Association are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
48.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms to the usual pattern
of agreements on technical assistance projects. Special conditions of the
credit are listed in Section III of Annex III of this report.
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
50.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 322-MAG:      Morondava Irrigation and Rural Development Project;
US$15.3 million credit of June 30. 1972; Date of
Effectiveness: April 30, 1973: Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
Initially, the project was to rehabilitate and extend, in the
Morondava area, existing irrigation systems, and develop 9,300 ha (4,700 ha
for smallholder rice, 2,700 ha for a tobacco state farm and 1,900 ha for a
cotton state farm); village development, roads, schools and health facilities
were included. The project as revised and substantially reduced in February
1976 will complete major civil works envisaged at appraisal, implement on-
farm development works on 2,500 ha of rice areas, establish an applied
research station, and provide agricultural support services, roads and health
facilities.
Major civil works (including construction of a diversion weir at
Dabara, rehabilitation of the Dabara Canal and the North Canal, construction
of secondary irrigation and drainage canals, and construction of the 8.1 km
road between Mahabo and Ankilivalo) are completed satisfactorily. However,
SODEMO, the agency responsible for on-farm development and agricultural
services, faces serious management and financial problems and as a result,
on-farm development and construction works have lagged behind schedule,
agricultural production is poorly organized, and yields are very low. The
Government and IDA have agreed on a plan of action to clarify SODEMO's respon-
sibilities and financial plan and to improve overall management, but this will
require careful monitoring in the coming months. The closing date was recently
extended to allow SODEMO time to carry out the project as revised and to
permit land development, of which less than 50 percent has been completed.
Credit No. 506-MAG:      Village Livestock and Rural Development Project:
US$9.6 million credit of August 21, 1974: Date of
Effectiveness: June 17, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
The project encountered serious problems in the initial years
and, principally because of legal and organizational difficulties, little
progress was made. Following significant changes in institutional and
management arrangements, the credit agreement was extensively amended; the
Amended Agreement became effective September 1, 1977.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors about
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

The project-s situation is much improved. FAFIFAMA, the principal
project implementing agency, is now well-established, fully staffed and
operational. Implementation of the project's most important component - the
development of veterinary and livestock services for village producers - is
proceeding well. Pasture improvement experiments are being undertaken.
Schools and health centers are being constructed, and the Ministry of Health
is preparing a utilization plan for the health centers. The development of
water points and road improvement continue satisfactorily. Cooperation with
fokonolona institutions in all aspects of FAFIFAMiA's work is good. In the
middle west, OMBY continues to provide services to villages surrounding
the ranches established under the IBRD-financed Beef Cattle Development
Project. The pilot pig program and cattle share fattening programs have
begun, but action is limited to construction of some buildings. Financing
and administration arrangements have been worked out. The pig program have
been launched with cooperatives and on the basis of imported breeding pigs.
The study of cattle marketing and meat prices has been completed and is being
reviewed. A post-evaluation of the current project and the preparation of
the second phase project are underway.
Loan No. 1065-MAG:       Mangoro Forestry Project; US$6.75 million loan and
Credit No. 525-MAG       US$6.75 million credit both of December 23, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: July 8, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The project assists in the planting of 35,000 ha of pine plantations
as part of an overall planting program of 96,000 ha, which will eventually
supply a future pulp mill for export. The planting program is ahead of
schedule and cost estimates are in line with forecasts, despite a reorganiza-
tion of the project which entails more building and infrastructure than
originally estimated, and the need for more intensive soil preparation than
foreseen at appraisal. Technical difficulties which occurred in the early
stages of the project have been or are being resolved. A second forestry
plantation project was appraised in June 1980.
Credit No. 641-MAG:      Fourth Highway Project; US$22.0 million credit of
June 23, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: August 19,
1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1980
The project assists the Government in the construction of two major
roads with a view to reducing transport costs and providing access to areas
with a high agricultural potential. It also includes training and strengthen-
ing of the country's road maintenance administration. Project implementation
is satisfactory. However, start of the training program for personnel in the
Ministry of Public Works on highway maintenance has been delayed due to lack
of training facilities. Preparation for the construction of these facilities
is underway.

Credit No. 663-MAG:      Second Education Project; US$14.0 million credit of
December 10, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: August 15,
1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is designed to assist the Government in decentralizing
the educational system and to improve the quality of basic education. It
includes five Regional Education Centres and vehicles for school inspectorate,
one Teaching Materials Production Centre and funds for textbook development,
technical assistance and fellowships. Norway took a 50 percent participation
in the project under an agreement signed on December 16, 1977.
Architectural design work on all project institutions is now com-
plete. Detailed operational planning for the Teaching Materials Production
Centre is being carried out. The two key technical advisors for this Centre,
provided by the Organization for Rehabilitation through Training arrived in
Madagascar during September 1977. Architectural work has generally been well
executed although this has taken much longer than expected. Work on the major
project components, the Regional Education Centres, was completed about 14
months behind the appraisal schedule, although with ORT assistance, the plan-
ning schedule for the Teaching Materials Production Centre has been maintained.
The project is presently about one year behind schedule due to cum-
bersome Government approval/decision procedures, and the Government's recent
proposals for the "socialisation" of the construction industry has introduced
a further element of uncertainty which may adversely affect project imple-
mentation.  Serious delays have also been encountered on the preparation
of an educational sector survey, the establishment of task forces for educa-
tion evaluation, proposals for decentralization of education and textbook
production.
Credit No. 817-MAG:      Andekaleka Hydroelectric Project; US$43.0 million
credit of June 19, 1978 (including a Supplementary
Credit of US$10 million of May 8, 1980); Date of
Effectiveness: May 30, 1979; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983.
The project would meet the growth in electricity demand until
1992 in the Antananarivo area and provide for the strengthening of JIRAMA,
Madagascar-s national electricity and water corporation. It includes a
concrete diversion dam and an intake structure; a 4-km tunnel, underground
power house, tailrace and access tunnels; two turbines and two generators;
electrical and mechanical equipment; a transmission line to Antananarivo;
engineering services; preliminary investigation and design for a storage
reservoir; and technical assistance and training for JIRAMA staff.
Contracts have been awarded for the civil works and all major
equipment and supplies. Total project costs are about 20 percent higher
than estimated at appraisal. However, even at the higher cost, the project
is still the least-cost solution for the supply of power in Madagascar.

Credit No. 081-MAG:       Mangoky Agricultural Development Project;
US$12.0 million credit of May 17, 19793;
Date of Effectiveness: March 11, 1980;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
The project will support the development of about 3,700 ha for
production of rice and cotton, to be farmed by about 3,200 families. It will
complete an irrigation system serving about 10,000 ha in the Lower Mangoky
Valley which has been under development since the early 1960s. These invest-
ments are based on a long-term master plan for the region which aims ultimately
to bring about 100,000 ha of land into production. The project will be imple-
mented over a five-year period and will comprise: development of irrigation
and drainage networks, and road infrastructure for 3,300 ha including produc-
tion of concrete canal segments; improvement of water supply for about 400 ha
of traditional rice fields; consultant services for design and supervision;
applied agricultural research; social infrastructure; training and project
preparation for agriculture and rural development projects. IFAD is financing
about 25 percent of the total project cost. Civil works which were scheduled
to start in early 1980, are delayed because of lack of cement.
Credit No. 938-MAG:       Fifth Highway Project; US$24.0 million credit of
July 30. 1979; Date of Effectiveness: March 17,
1980; Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
The project would help prevent further deterioration of the paved
highway network, thus reducing transport cost and avoiding early and costly
reconstruction works. It would also increase the maintenance capacity of
the Ministry of Public Works and provide for an all-weather road connection
between the regional district of Antomboka and the capital, Antananarivo.
Co-financing will be provided by a European Economic Community Special Action
Account credit of US$10 million.
Credit No. 903-MAG:       Second Railway Project; US$13.0 million credit
of June 25. 1979; Date of Effectiveness:
April 30, 1980; Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
The objectives of the project are to help the Malagasy railway
company renew and modernize its facilities, improve the reliability and
efficiency of its operations and improve its financial management and
accounting methods. The French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique
provided US$20.5 million in co-financing.

Credit No. 977-MAG:        Bankin'ny Indostria (BNI) Project;
US$5.0 million Credit of May 8, 1980; Terminal
Date of Effectiveness: December 31, 1980;
Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
The project will support Madagascar's growing industrial sector
and BNI's crucial development role by providing BNI with part of its foreign
exchange requirements to finance projects in the artisanal/small-scale and
medium-scale enterprise sectors and by strengthening BNI itself through
technical assistance.
Credit No. 1002-MAG:       Antananarivo Water and Sanitation Project;
US$20.5 million Credit of May 8, 1980; Terminal
Date of Effectiveness: November 30, 1980;
Closing Date: December 31, 1985.
The project will increase access to treated water for the Antananarivo
urban population and improve sanitation conditions. Detailed design of the
water supply works has been completed and tender documents have been issued.
Detailed design of the sanitation component is expected to be completed by the
end of the year.
Credit No. 1016-MAG:       Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project;
US$12.5 million Credit of May 8, 1980;
Date of Effectiveness: August 8, 1980;
Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
The project will support the Government's efforts to develop a
domestic supply of hydrocarbons and improve planning of the energy sector.
Implementation of the project is progressing satisfactorily. Geological and
legal consultants were employed to assist the Government in preparing
data with a view to promoting exploration by interested oil companies. Bids
from oil companies to undertake exploration have now been received and are
being evaluated. Other studies and technical assistance provided in the
project are proceeding satisfactorily, including preparation of a second
project to study the feasibility of exploiting the Tsimiroro heavy oil
deposits.
Credit No.----MAG:         National Bank for Rural Development (BTM) Project;
US$11.5 million Credit approved on September 9, 1980.
The project would support the Government's policy to extend credit
for smallholder agricultural development, with BTM as the principal interme-
diary. Signing of credit documents is awaiting designation by Government
and BTM of persons to sign the agreements on their behalf.
