recovery efforts through (a)\n            providing safety net support grants to poor and vulnerable\n            households affected by the militancy crisis in the target\n            areas; (b) providing conditional cash transfers (CCTs) for\n            human development to poor and vulnerable households in the\n            target areas; and (c) strengthening necessary capacities and\n            systems for post-disaster safety nets. This project has 3\n            components. Component 1 comprises of creating safety net\n            support grants to poor and vulnerable households affected by\n            militancy crisis. This component will help mitigate the\n            adverse poverty impact of conflict by providing targeted\n            safety net support grants through monthly cash transfers\n            provided for the duration of six months to each eligible\n            household. Component 2 uses conditional cash transfers\n            (CCTs) for human development. These cash grants will\n            encourage behaviors that promote human development and also\n            fund CCTs specific implementation support. Component 3 is\n            capacity building and implementation support. This component\n            will finance necessary capacity building and implementation\n            support to the project implementation agency including\n            financing of technical assistance, training, equipment, and\n            software, as well as incremental operating costs."}, "docdt": "2010-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
