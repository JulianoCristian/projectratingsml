road\n            maintenance in Bolivia by: (a) carrying out required road\n            maintenance, including deferred maintenance, in the\n            districts of La Paz, Cochabama and Santa Cruz; (b) providing\n            the necessary equipment, vehicles, tools and spare parts;\n            (c) strengthening the National Highway Service; and (d)\n            preparing a country-wide highway maintenance, rehabilitation\n            and upgrading program. It includes the acquisition of\n            equipment, spare parts, workshop tools and equipment, hand\n            tools for labor intensive maintenance, and the provision of\n            consulting services for technical assistance and engineering\n            and economic studies. Project benefits consist of 12%\n            average reduction of vehicle operating costs; not quantified\n            benefits are reduced passenger time and accidents, and\n            prevented economic loss by avoidance of road closures. The\n            project faces no special risks, although realization of all\n            the benefits will depend on the progressive raising of the\n            beneficiary's efficiency."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
