INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMET ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to
$7 million to the Republic of Korea for a dairy and beef development
project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        Agricultural output in Korea has grown reasonably rapidly at
an annual average of 4.4% during the past decade.   But it has not kept
pace with the dynamic expansion of other sectors, notably manufacturing.
This discrepancy has resulted in a widening gap in income and standards
of living between the urban and rural populations, a trend which was
further accelerated by recent severe droughts which particularly
affected rice production, the major source of agricultural income. To
reduce the dependence of agricultural production on adequate rainfall
and to expedite agricultural growth, in recent years the Government has
substantially increased investments in irrigation facilities. The Bank
in 1969 supported these efforts through a $45 million loan for the
Pyongtaek-Kumgang Irrigation Project (600 KO). Furthermore, the Govern-
ment actively pursues a policy of diversifying agricultural production.
The development of the country's livestock industry is an essential
element of this nolicy and will help meet the rising domestic demand
for dairy products and meat.
3.        The proposed project was prepared in part by Japanese
consultants engaged by the Overseas Technical Cooperation Agency of
Japan under a program of technical and financial cooperation between
the two countries, and was appraised in April/May of last year.   The
proposed project, to be implemented by the Korea Dairy Beef Company (KDBC),
is the first Bank Group project for livestock in Korea.
4.        Negotiations were held in Washington between November 27 and
December 2. The Government was represented by MIr. Sung Yong Wei of the
Economic Planning Board and Mr. Yong Joo Ha of the Ministry of Agriculture
and Forestry.  Mr. Yong Koo Hwang represented the KDBC and its parent
organization, the Agricultural and Fisheries Development Corporation
(AFDC).
5.        The following is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA
credits as of Novenbe 30, 1970:

6.        Disbursements of the irrigation loan and the education credit
are behind schedule. Their effectiveness was delayed for several months
because it took longer than expected for the borrowers to employ
consultants, and in the case of the irrigation loan the original
borrower was succeeded by a new organization about whose competence the
Bank had to satisfy itself. The design of school buildings under the
education project is now well under way and disbursements for construc-
tion and equipment should start in the near future and proceed without
any further delay. With regard to the irrigation project, now that the
consultant problems have been solved it is expected that disbursements
to cover civil works and equipment will proceed satisf&a-torily. Disbursements
under the railway, highway studies and development bank projects are
progressing satisfactorily.
7.        IFC made an equity investment in KDFC of $0.7 million at the
time of the 1968 Bank loan. In June 1969, IFC made an equity invest-
ment of $0.3 million in, and a loan of $1.4 million to, a silk company;
and in May 1970 the Atlas Paper Company received a loan of $4.5 million
and an equity investment of $o.5 million from the IFC. Prospects for
further IFC investments in Korea are being investigated.

8.        Before the end of this fiscal year I expect to recommend Bank
financing for a third loan to the Korea Development Finance Corporation
and for highway construction.

PART III - THE PROJECT
10.       An appraisal report entitled "Integrated Dairy Beef Development
Project - Korea" (PA-63a) on the proposed project is attached.



11.       Agricultural development is a matter of high priority to the
Korean Government. Within the framework of a ten-year rural moderniza-
tion program, the Government is supporting land consolidation, farm
mechanization, slopeland development and diversification of agricultural
production. The development of the country's livestock industry on a
systematic basis is a crucial element of this strategy, and is being
undertaken under the Four-Year Livestock Industry Development Program,
which encourages comercial production of the major animal species,
with emphasis on beef and dairy cattle.
12.       The demand for dairy products and meat has grown rapidly in
recent years, reflecting the rising standard of living. As the economy
is expected to continue to grow at a fast pace, dietary patterns should
continue to change, causing further demand for milk products and beef.
At the present time beef and dairy production are in their infancy.
The cattle population consists of slightly more than one million head,
mostly native Korean cattle, and beef production is about 40,000 tons
per year, based mostly on the slaughter of draft animals. Dairy cattle
have increased considerably in the past few years, but still number only
about 15,COO. i4iilk processing started only within the past decade, and
considerable amounts are imported to meet the demand. The proposed
project would establish a pattern for the development of a beef and
dairy industry using the presently existing farm structure, and there-
fore could be applied to other parts of the country.
13.       There are essentially two parts to the project:   the develop-
ment of about 700 small and mediurm dairy farms; and the construction
and operation of two dairy products processing plants. There will also
be management and technical services related to these activities.   The
project would be carried out by the Korea Dairy Beef Company, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Agriculture and Fishery Development Corporation.
The latter was established in 1967 by the Government to foster agro-
industry through equity investments and loans subscribed by the Govern-
inent. The AFDC presently has twenty-two subsidiaries and has a majority
interest in eighteen of them. Some of the subsidiaries are in the
process of being consolidated to streamnline the operations of the AFDC.
The AFDC tries to sell its holdings in a subsidiary to private interests
once the subsidiary is well established. The management of the AFDC is
sound, and it provides managerial and limited technical services for its
subsidiary companies.
14.       KDBC was founaded by AFDC in February 1969 to engage in dairy
production, milk processing, and marketing. The Company, which has no
earning power at the moment, is expected to begin making a profit tlhree
years after the start of the project. Its issued share capital, entirely
held by AFDC, amounts to 150 million won ($500,000).   Under the terms of
the proposed credit, AFDC is to increase its equity subscription to the
KDBC to $1 million as a condition of effectiveness, and by the end of
1973 to increase its equity contribution to $2 million.



15.       Being only a little more than a year old, KDBC does not have
sufficiently experienced staff to carry out the project on its own. It
has undertaken to expand its organizational structure and employ manage-
ment and technical experts during the implementation period of the
project. A key element in the project is preparing the selected farms
to receive and care for the heifers, and as a condition of
effectiveness, KDBC will employ a Dairy Husbandry Specialist who will
advise the management of the Company on major policy matters concerning
dairy farm development, supervise its implementation, scrutinize and be
responsible for approving the farm development plans, and in general
have overall control over this part of the project. The KDBC is also
to employ a Dairy Processing Specialist, an Agronomy Specialist and an
Animal Nutrition Specialist. The Dairy Processing Specialist will
have overall supervisory control of the milk processing plants
including their design, tendering and construction. The Agronomy and
Nutrition Specialists would provide specialized guidance to partici-
pating farmers, and would assist the Government in developing a
coordinated program of applied research in cattle production to provide
the basis for the long-range development of Korea's potential cattle
resources. With the assistance of these four experts the KDBC is
expected to carry out the project effectively. The KDBC is presently
looking for these specialists, with IDA assistance, and it is expected
that suitable candidates will be found without undue difficulty.
16.       The total estimated cost of the project is the equivalent of
$12.6 million. The proposed development credit of $7 million would
cover 55% of total costs; the equivalent of $2 million would be
provided by participating farmers in cash or kind; $2.1 million would
come from KDBC's increased equity and its own resources; and $1.5
million would come from the Government as its contribution to the costs
of dairy farm development.
17.       Of the proposed $7 million IDA credit, $4.4 million would be
for dairy farm development and $2.0 million for the two dairy processing
plants. The balance of the funds would go for managerial and technical
specialists, research equipment, training fellowships and a few vehicles.
The amount of $4.4 million from the proposed credit for farm develop-
ment would be re-lent by the Government to KDBC at 3% for 15 years, for
on-lending to participating farmers at 9%. These rates are similar to
those currently applicable to dairy farm development in Korea. KDBC
would thus be getting a spread of six percentage points on these funds,
which would cover the administrative expenses of handling the sub-loans
and provide a cushion for KDBC to bear the foreign exchange risk.
These sub-loans to farmers would have a repayment period of eight to
ten years, which is reasonable considering the projected cash flows.
At full development, after about the seventh year, the annual net cash
balance after debt service of the average small (10 cow) farm would be
the equivalent of about $2,600, and about $10,000 for the larger
(30 cow) farms.



- 6 -
18.       KDBC would itself own and operate the two milk processing
plants to be financed by $2.0 million from the proposed credit. These
funds would be re-lent by the Government to KDBC at 9% for 15 years.
It is expected that KDBC will be able to earn a financial rate of return of
about 35% on milk plants, which wrould strengthen its ability to bear
the foreig-n exchange risk on the IDA funds.
19.       Procurement of equipment for the milk plants will be on the
basis of international competitive bidding, and procurement of cattle
and semen will be based on quotations from at least three countries
qualified to provide the required stock and meeting Korean health
standards. Items to be procured by farmers for the development of their
dairy farms will be through local commercial channels, as the cost
of the goods to be purchased is too small to warrant inter-
national bidding. Contracts for civil works for the milk plants, and
for the few jeeps and motorcycles to be used by the management and
technical specialists, will be awarded after local competitive bidding.
Disbursements from the credit will cover 56% of farm development loans,
44% of the construction cost of the milk plants, and 100% of the other
items.
20.       The foreign exchange component of the project is estimated at
$6 million, or 48% of the total project cost, on the assumption that in
addition to the cattle and semen all equipment required for the milk
processing plants would be imported. Local manufacturers are expected
to participate in the bidding for stainless steel tanks, small electric
motors and other minor items for the milk plants, valued at about
$200,000. They would be given a preference of 15% or the level of
existing customs duties, whichever is less. On this basis, Korean
manufacturers are likely to win some contracts. The proposed credit
would cover the foreign exchange cost of the project and between
$1 million and $1.2 million in local currency expenditures, depending
on the outcome of bidding for the items mentioned above.
21.       The Korean economy has shown a remarkable capacity to grow
rapidly. In spite of a satisfactory growth of domestic savings and a
relatively high savings rate, the resource gap to be covered from
external sources continues to be substantial, so much so that the
Government is now trying to slow down the rate of investment and
economic growth. Even though requirements for external financing will
remain large, the number of high priority projects in the public sector
having a substantial foreign exchange element is relatively limited.
Many projects with a large foreign exchange component are in the private
industrial sector and are financed from private sources and export
credit agencies. Infrastructure, education and agriculture projects,
with often low foreign exchange components but still of very high
priority, are increasingly dependent for their financing on the Bank,
IDA and the Asian Development Bank. In these circumstances, and in view
of the importance of the proposed project as the first of its kind in
Korea, I consider that the financing by the Association of some local
expenditures is appropriate.



- 7 -
22.       The economic return on the project as a whole is 12%, with
direct benefits accruing not only to KDBC and the farmers participating
in the project, but also to a large segment of the population through
an increased supply of milk, milk products and beef.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
23.       The Draft Credit Agreement between the Republic of Korea and
the Association, the Draft Project Agreement between the Association
and Korea Dairy Beef Company Limited and Agriculture and Fishery Develop-
ment Corporation, the Recommendations of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a
Resolution approving the proposed Credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
24.       The Draft Agreements contain covenants normally included in
agreements for agricultural credit projects. The relending of the
proceeds of the Development Credit will be governed by the terms of a
First Subsidiary Loan Agreement satisfactory to the Association to be
concluded between the Republic of Korea and KDBC. Funds to be provided
by the Government will be lent to KDBC pursuant to a Second Subsidiary
Loan Agreement satisfactory to the Association to be concluded between
AFDC and KDBC.
PART V - THE ECONOM1Y
25.       A report entitled "Economic Position and Prospects of the
Republic of Korea" (EAP-12a, dated March 16, 1970) was circulated to
the Executive Directors on March 27, 1970. An economic mission visited
Korea in September/October, 1970, and is now finishing its report. An
updated data sheet is attached.
26.       Korea's economic progress in recent years has been outstanding,
and continued so during the past year. Since 1965, GNP in real terms
has grown at an average rate of 11.7% a year; a record rate of 15.9%
was achieved in 1969, due in part to a bumper rice crop following a poor
harvest in the previous year. In the first nine months of 1970, real
GNP increased by about 11% over the corresponding period of 1969. With
the assistance of an active family planning program, the population
growth rate was reduced substantially in the last decade. The latest
census taken on October 1, 1970, shows that the population growth was
reduced from 2.6% a year during 1960-65 to 1.9% a year during 1966-70.
Per capita real GNP has increased by over 9% annually during 1965-69,
reaching $195 equivalent in 1969.



27.       The major aspect of the rapid econonic growth has been the
sharp increase in capital formation from about 15% of GDP in 1965 to
30% of GDP in 1969.  With rising incomes, domestic savings have also
increased substantially, from 8% of GDP to 19% of GDP in 1969.   The
increase of public savings is particularly impressive, reaching 6% of
GDP in 1969, as a result of new taxes, generally higher tax rates, and
intensified tax collection. However, domestic savings are still
obviously not enough to meet the large rise in investment.
28.       Industrialization has played a leading role in Koreats economic
growth, supported by the development of the economic infrastructure.
During 1965-69, the manufacturing sector grew at 22.5% a year in terms
of value added. At the same time, agricultural output grew at an average
rate of about 4-5)% a year. Parallel with the rapid expansion of manu-
facturing and its associated service sectors, there has been a shift of
employment and population from rural to urban areas. To some extent,
the economic transformation through rapid industrialization has left the
rural population behind. In recent years there seems to have been
hardly any improvement in the real income level of the average rural
household, because prices paid by the farmer have risen as fast as his
money income. On the other hand, the real income of the average urban
labor household, which was in 1963 at more or less the same level as
that of the average rural household, increased by about 60% by 1969.
The Government is now making great efforts to increase rural income by
supporting prices of food crops and raising agricultural production.
IMore important in the long run will be the increase of agricultural
productivity and diversification of agricultural activities into areas
with high value products and rapidly rising demand, such as meat, dairy
products, fruits and vegetables.
29.       Industrial output has been an important factor in export
expansion, and this in turn has contributed significantly to rapid
economic growth. Mierchandise exports increased from $175 million in
l965 to $658 million in 1969, and are likely to exceed $900 million in
1970. Exports of goods and services grew at 40% annually during 1965-69.
However, imports have grown equally fast, and there was little improve-
ment in the ratio of exports to imports (about 60%) up to 1969.
30.       The gains of recent years have somewhat eased Korea's economic
difficulties, but they nevertheless remain formidable. Dependence on
external resources continues to be heavy. The deficit in the external
account, and the corresponding gap betwJeen savings and investment, was
about 11% of GDP in 1969. In that year, over two-fifths of gross invest-
ment was financed with foreign resources, increasingly in the form of
commercial loans. As a result, the debt service ratio rose from less
than 3% in 1966 to about 11% in 1969 and is estimated to reach a level
of 20% in 1970.  The ratio is expected to stay at a level of around 25%
for the seventies, and could be higher if unfavorable export markets
prevail or inflation develops. This ratio, although high, does not
give cause for as much concern as it would in a less dynamic economy.



- 9 -
31.       Realizing the importance of keeping the external debt burden
within manageable limits and of containing inflation, the Government in
late 1969 adopted a set of monetary and fiscal stabilization measures.
In accordance with its Standby Agreement with the IMF, the Government
has observed both the ceilings for domestic credit and short and medium
foreign debt commitments. In particular, Government and private invest-
ment in building construction in the cities has been curbed.  The total
amount of foreign commercial debt with maturity of over 3 years
contracted during January-August, 1970, was $163 million compared with
$623 million for the whole of 1969. The outstanding amount of short-
term credit with 1-3 year maturity was reduced by >'37 million during
the first eight months of 1970.
32.       As a result of these stabilization measures, imports in the
first nine months of 1970 increased only by 6% over the corresponding
period of 1969, as compared with a 26% increase in 1969 over 1968.
Merchandise exports, being exempted from the restrictive measures,
continued to increase at a rapid rate of 37% in the first nine months
of 1970. Thus, in spite of a reduction in receipts from U.N. forces'
expenditure in Korea and from Vietnam, the deficit on goods and services
account showed a decline for the first time since 1965, from $593 million
in the first nine months of 1969 to $531 million in the first nine months
of 1970. The index of consumer prices rose more slowly in the first nine
months of 1970 (7.7%) than in the corresponding period of 1970 (12.56%).
33.       The Government is making determined efforts to achieve a more
orderly and stable growth of the economy, and has recently agreed that
limitations on new external debt and domestic credit expansion be
included in the IMF Standby Agreement for 1971 at levels comparable to
those for 1970. For 1971 the Government has set a target increase of
10% for real GNP and less than 3% increase in gross investment; but at
27% of GNP, the level of investment will not be unduly depressed. The
Central Government's expenditure for 1971 is budgeted to increase
modestly by about 18%, with more funds allocated to defense (24% of
total expenditure) in view of the partial reduction of U.S. forces, but
smaller increases in salaries and wages for Government employees.
Receipts from counterpart funds will decline drastically because of the
reduction of U.S. aid, but domestic tax revenue is expected to increase
by over 24%. No deficit financing is visualized. Because of the
uncertainties in the world market and developments in Vietnam, the rate
of increase in exports of goods and services is expected to slow down,
bu.t imports will also not increase much. The Government envisages
further improvement in the current account of the balance of payments
in 1971. Considering the dynamic performance of the Korean economy
and the willingness of the Government to strive for economic stability,
Korea can be regarded as creditworthy for Bank loans.
34.       However, Korea will depend on substantial amounts of foreign
capital for some time to come even if economic growth is below the
levels achieved over the past decade. Some of this assistance should



- 10 -
be on concessional terms considering Korea's low level of per capita
income and heavy debt burden.
