Adjustment Loan\n            Project (SAL II) is part of a series of World Bank\n            adjustment loans supporting the major structural reform\n            program that the government of Korea has launched in\n            response to the economic crisis. It builds on the work\n            initiated under an Economic Reconstruction Loan approved on\n            December 23, 1997, and continued under a Structural\n            Adjustment Loan (SAL I) approved on March 26, 1998. SAL II\n            will help Korea restore financial stability while mitigating\n            the social costs of adjustment, and implement deep\n            structural reforms in the financial and corporate sectors to\n            pave the way for Korea's return to strong and sustained\n            growth. SAL II calls for macroeconomic policies designed to\n            mitigate the severity of the recession while consolidating\n            progress made in strengthening the external financial\n            position. The structural reform program it supports spans\n            three key areas: financial sector reform including the\n            resolution of weak financial institutions, strengthening of\n            prudential regulation and supervision, and capital market\n            development; corporate sector reform including corporate\n            debt restructuring, reform of corporate governance and\n            competition polices, and reform and privatization of\n            state-owned enterprises; labor market reform; and\n            strengthening of social safety nets. The loan will be\n            disbursed in two equal tranches, the first upon\n            effectiveness, and the second upon satisfaction of second\n            tranche release conditions."}, "docdt": "1998-10-02T00:00:00Z"}
