satisfactory, and\n            sustainability is likely. The lessons suggest that the\n            strong ability developed by the Government of Korea, to\n            design, and implement reforms, as well as the substantial\n            analytical, and advisory input from the Bank on policy\n            issues, helped in developing the conviction of ownership,\n            essential for a sustainable reform program. The recognition\n            that recovery from the financial crisis had to be\n            private-sector led, enhanced the chances for reform, and\n            helped involve different think tanks in the country. While\n            the reform program covered a broad spectrum of reforms,\n            individual reform components were subjected to the\n            discipline of a well-integrated, and coherent overall reform\n            framework, that took account of linkages, and priorities,\n            and ensured consistency. The approach Korea pursued to\n            differentiate itself positively, in the midst of the\n            financial crisis, demonstrated its seriousness about\n            fundamental structural reforms, and in so doing, was well\n            respected by the international financial community, and\n            could easily finance comprehensive safety nets, due to its\n            prudent macroeconomic management. Technical assistance can\n            be critical to implementing components of the reform\n            program, and helps broaden the base of the dialogue, to\n            include the technocrats implementing the program."}, "docdt": "2000-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
