India faces an acute deficit\n            of electric power. Almost half of all Indian households do\n            not have access to electricity. As India\u2019s energy resources\n            are spread unevenly across the country, the efficient\n            transmission of power from surplus to deficient regions is\n            critical. There was therefore, a pressing need to strengthen\n            and expand the all-India national transmission network, the\n            national grid. International Bank for Reconstruction and\n            Development has been involved with India\u2019s energy program\n            for more than a decade, using innovative financing and\n            technical advice to help the Indian government and POWERGRID\n            address the country\u2019s energy shortages. Between 1993 and\n            2003, the Bank concentrated its efforts on helping develop\n            the national transmission network by strengthening regional\n            grids, facilitating the transfer of power across the regions\n            through POWERGRID. In 2007, the Rampur hydropower project\n            marked the first Bank-financed hydropower development in\n            India since 1989. India\u2019s electricity transmission system\n            operator has been consistently maintaining transmission\n            system availability at over 99 percent, which is at par with\n            international utilities. POWERGRID has tripled its\n            transmission network and is one of the world's largest\n            electricity transmission system operators"}, "docdt": "2010-03-03T09:07:01Z"}
