 Synopsis

   The national power transmission utility, Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID), has
   tapped IBRD funding and technical assistance over years in its efforts to address India’s significant
   energy shortages. This partnership has helped direct more power to local regions in need from those
   with an energy surplus, and laid many thousands of kilometers of new transmission lines.
