The project achieved most of\n            its objectives, its impact on institutional development was\n            modest, sustainability is likely, and both the Bank and\n            Borrower acted satisfactorily. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, where local staffing is\n            likely to be a serious constraint, care must be taken in\n            project design to closely identify current and future staff\n            availability and needs. Second, project design needs to\n            guard against placing too heavy a burden on project\n            management. Third, it is important to involve the intended\n            beneficiaries from the initial stages of scheme\n            identification and to ensure that social aspects are\n            incorporated in scheme design. Fourth, where projects are\n            co-financed, their implementation will be helped by\n            harmonizing all aspects. Fifth, consultant engineers should\n            be required to open offices reasonably close to project\n            headquarters. Sixth, GOBAL needs to control tubewell\n            development more effectively. Seventh, GOBAL and\n            international donors need to lessen the responsibilities of\n            DI and increase farmer cost participation. Lastly, greater\n            attention should be given to collection of hydraulic data in\n            all schemes."}, "docdt": "1994-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
