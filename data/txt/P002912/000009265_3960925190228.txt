MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:          Project Completion Report on Uganda
Third Eiahwa_ Proiect (Credit 1445-UG)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Uganda -- Third Highway
Project (Credit 1445-UG)" prepared by the Eastern Africa Department in the Africa
Regional Office. Part II is based on Borrower comments.
The US$58.0 million Credit (SDR 56.1 million) was approved in March
1984 to support a project planned to be completed by end-1987.  Considering
Uganda's condition in the aftermath of the 1979 civil war, project objectives
were ambitious: maintain classified roads, re-est-ablish Ministry of Works
capability for road maintenance, develop the local construction industry, improve
transport sector management, and help enforce vehicle weight and traffic safety
regulations.
Project implementation was difficult. Widespread lawlessness, slow
contracting, poor site management, procurement difficulties, problems with
technical assistance, shortage of local funds and staffing shortages combined to
account for a four year delay in Credit closing and funds amounting to SDR 6.5
million were canceled.
Institution-building for good road maintenance was the fundamental
objective and the PCR concedes that the project did not succeed in establishing
a sustainable organization.   The PCR also concedes that project-financed
equipment was diverted from road maintenance to road rehabilitation/
reconstruction, that Borrower performance was "less than satisfactory", that
staff productivity was "generally low", and that the Government showed "a clear
lack of commitment to road maintenance".
Overall, the Project is rated as unsatisfactory, its sustainability
as unlikely, and its institutional impact as negligible.
No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Third Highway Project in
Uganda, for which Credit 1445-UG in the amount of US$58 million (SDR 56.1 million) was
approved on March 13, 1984. The Credit was closed on January 31, 1992, about three and a half
years behind schedule, and an amount of SDR 6,520,979.18 csicelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of the Eastern
Africa Department in the Africa Region (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), and the
Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started in August 1992 and is based, inter alia, on
the Staff A1praisal Report, the Development Credit Agreement, supervision reports,
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.

EVALUATlON SUMMARY
Objectives
The objectives of the project were to (i) improve the maintenance of the
country's rapidly deteriorating classified road network; (ii) help train Ministry of Works'
(MOW) road maintenance personnel and to reestablish MOW's capability for road
maintenance; (iii) help develop the local construction industry; (iv) improve the country's
transport sector management; and (v) help enforce vehicle weight and traffic safety regulations
(Para. 3.01).
Project Implementation Experience
The project aimed at improving routine maintenance of the classified road
network (7,540 km), resealing of about 600 km of bitumen-surfaced road and regravelling of
about 1,000 km of gravel road. The project was scheduled to begin in mid-1984 and be
completed by end-1987. Due to Government/consultants delay in finalizing bidding
documents, in prequalifying contractors for civil works and in awarding contracts for road
maintenance and workshop equipment, an initial delay of about 2 years was catused in project
implementation. The implementation of the road resealing/regravelling component of the
project was delayed due to poor site management, lack of proper organization and
unfamiliarity of the contractor with the working conditions in Uganda. Besides, the
contractor faced difficulties in securing access to work sites and in relocating amps because
of rebel activity in the country at the time. The contractor completed the works at end-
August 1990, about 19 months behind the contract completion date. Road maintenance and
workshop equipment, and tools included in the Project to help improve MOW's capability for
routine road maintenance were delivered mid-1987 to mid-1988. Spare parts for rehabilitation
of the existing equipment were delivered in part (70%) in May 1991 and the supplier declared
his inability to supply the balance due to their having become obsolete. A major 'Second
Tranche' of equipment procurement (not included in the Project) planned by MOW in mid-
1990 was disapproved of by the Association, since the Ministry did not have the resources of
funds, trained personnel and facilities to operate and maintain even the existing equipment.
The implementation of improvement to the Road Training Center (RTC), Central Workshop
(CWS) and upcountry workshops component of the project was badly delayed. After a series
of calls for bids, Government awarded the work of in'provement to RTC, CWS and 7
upcountry workshops (divided into 4 lots) to local contractors and the works were completed
in end-January 1992 (over 7 years after Credit effectiveness). Nine domestic contractors
received classroom and on-the-job training under the Pilot Program for Development of the
Local Construction Industry. The Program was completed vith some success at the end of
December 1989 (Paras. 4.01; 5.02 - 5.06).
The technical assistance services provided by a consulting firm did not prove
to be fully effective. Not only did the firm take long, almost 2 years after contract signature,
to mobilize its staff, the consultants first acting team leader lacked management experience
and none of the team members including the instructors had serious experience in staff
training. An assessment of the effectiveness of the TA team carried out by a joint
Government/Bank team in October/November 1989 showed that the TA team had not been
fully effective due to various reasons such as, late arrival and frequent changes of TA staff,



- iii -
difficult operating conditions in 1986/87, understaffing in MOW and lack of counterpart staff,
unsatisfactory supervision of TA staff by MOW and consultants head office, insufficient
funding of road maintenance, etc. It was not until the consultants' new team leader/senior
highway engineer arrived in September 1989 (over 3 years after contract signature) that things
changed for the better. The expiry date of July 31, 1989 of the technical assistance contract
was extended first to end-January 1990 and then to end-January 1991. Later, Government
extended the services of 3 TA staff for MOW and 2 TA staff for MOT within the limit of the
existing contract funds; ,nost of the staff left the country by May/June 1991, except for 2 staff
(team leader/senior highway engineer and senior transport planner) who continued till
September 30, 1991 (Paras. 5.07 - 5.08).
Rather than using equipment purchased under the project to help reestablish
MOW's road maintenance capacity, it was diverted from its nornml road maintenance use to
road rehabilitation/reconstruction. Consequently, roads which should have been maintained
were neglected and allowed to deteriorate to the point where major rehabilitation became
necessary. The funds allocated/released b- Government for road maintenance were
inadequate. Due to the insufficient local funding and/or bureaucratic delays, MOW was
unable to procure fuel, lubricants, spare parts and/or tires for day to day operation of
equipment. Nevertheless, it did not utilize Credit funds for the purchase of fuel and bitumen,
except for the procurement of a small quantity of bitumen in FY88 (Para. 5.09).
The final total cost of the project is within the appraisal estimate (Part m,
Table 5); however, large excesses occurred over the cost of civil works and consultant
services which were offset by savings on other items. The disbursements under the Credit
(Part III, Table 3) remained slow, partly due to the initial delay caused in project start up and
partly due to the delay in the implementation of the civil work components. The Credit
finally closed on January 31, 1992, about three and a half years behind schedule but within
the standard disbursement profile for Uganda (Paras. 5.12 - 5.13).
Results
The project was partially successful in meeting its targeted maintenance
objectives for the country's rapidly deteriorating road network, but did not succeed in
establishing a sustainable road maintenance organization; however, the project helped in
setting up a maintenance management system in MOWTC1/. Some 366 km of paved road
was resealed and 723 km of gravel road regravelled; MOWTC's road training school, central
workshop and 7 upcountry workshops were rehabilitated/improved. The recalculated ERR for
road resealing and road regravelling based on two representative sets of roads is 54% and
27%, compared to an overall ERR of 59% and 45-', respectively, estimated at appraisal
(Paras. 6.01 - 6.02).
l/    MOW and MOT were merged into a single Ministry of Works, Transport and
Communications (MOWTC) in mid-1991.



- iv -
Project Sustainability
The maintenance management system developed under the project sets the
stage for future improvement in road maintenance planning and operations. The training of
domestic contractors should over time help in developing the local construction industry,
provided contractors are assured of work continuity and prompt payments by Government.
The National Transport Data Base set up under the project would help in drawing up
comprehensive transport programs and in improving transport sector management in the
country (Para. 7.01).
Borrower Performance
The overall performance of the Borrower was less than satisfactory, despite
heavy reliance on foreign consultants. Due to the poor remunerations and working
conditions, staff productivity was generally low. And, there was a clear lack of commitment
on the part of Government to road maintenance; the project equipment was diverted from its
normal road maintenance use and deployed extensively to rehabilitate/reconstruct roads (Para.
9.01).
Lesons Learned
In a country whose civil service has been undermined by years of insecurity
and civil strife and poor remunerations and working conditions, the principal lessons learned
include the need to (a) allocate Credit funds to project incentive schemes to help attract and
retain staff of the right calibre or better yet to civil service reform or autonomy for Road
Department; and (b) execute road maintenance by contract rather than force account. Also, it
is necessary to establish a funding mechanism, based on user charges, that would assure the
availability of sufficient funds for i -ad maintenance in a timely manner. In addition, as now
generally practiced, the terms of reiarence for technical assistance services should include a
detailed work program with veriflole inputs and outputs for each TA staff. A mid-term
review of project implementation should also be provided (Paras. 13.01 - 13.05).

2.           Backgrnd
2.01         At independence in 1962, Uganda inherited a very good transport system. The
system was further improved during the decade 1962 - 1972 to become one of the best in sub-
saharan Africa. However, after a decade of neglect and ultimate destruction during the liberation
war in 1979, the transport system was left in complete disarray. The Government reacted quickly
to the situation and with the assistance of a Commonwealth team of experts, prepared a recovery
program which concentrated on the rehabilitation of the economy and identified priorities for the
various sectors. In the transport sector, the highest priority areas identified were the rehabilitation
of Uganda railways and rehabilitation and maintenance of the national road network.
2.02         Due to the lack of proper maintenance for more than a decade, the county's road
network had fallen into a state of disrepair; paved roads had developed deep potholes and surface
cracks; most gravel roads had completely lost their gravel and had reverted to earth roads, and in
the worst cases they required major rehabilitation. MOW's workshops suffered extensive damage
during the war; the damages ranged from minor to major repairs, and in some cases complete
reconstruction of the structure was needed; the workshops did not have facilities to adequately
repair and maintain equipment.
2.03         In 1982, the Association financed an updating of the 1972 highway investment,
maintenance and organization study carried out under the Second Highway Project (Cr. 164-UG);
the updated study, highway maintenance and organization study (HMOS), formed the basis for the
road maintenance program included in the project.



2.04         Also, the Association carried out, in 1982 - 83, a transport sector review which
identified the following needs in the transport sector.
(i)   the need for an extensive transport sector manpower development;
(ii)   the need to improve the data base in the transport sector to permit policy
formulation and decision making;
(iii)  the need to improve transport administration and policy making; and
(iv)   the need to improve transport sector cooperation between Uganda and
Kenya, particularly as it applied to rail movements.
3.           Project Objectives and Description
3.01        _Prjc Objectives: The objectives of the project were to:
(i)   improve the maintenance of the country's rapidly deteriorating classified
road network;
(ii)   help train Ministry of Works' (MOW) road maintenance personnel and to
re-establish MOW's capability for road maintenance;
(iii)   help develop the local construction industry;
(iv)   improve the country's transport sector management; and
(v)    help enforce vehicle weight and traffic safety regulations.
3.02         Prjec Descripion: The project provided for:
(i)    a program to improve maintenance of the country's classified road
network;
(ii)   technical assistance to MOW and Ministry of Transport (MOT)
(iii)   a pilot program for the development of the local construction industry; and
(iv)   preparation of a future road maintenance program.
4.           Project Design and Organization
4.01         In 1983, the country's classified road network consisted of 1,940 km of bitumen-
surfaced road and 5,600 km of gravA road. The 4-year (1984 - 87) road maintenance program
Included in the project was to help improve routine maintenance of the classified road network
(7,540 km), as well as periodic maintenance of about 600 km of bitumen-surfaced road and about
1,000 km of gravel road that were in urgent need of resealing/regravelling; the roads were
selected on the basis of the results of the HMOS. Since MOW's ability to maintain roads was



severely constrained by lack of equipment, trained manpower and funds, the project provided for
the engagement of contractors for road resealing/regravelling, leaving routine road maintenance to
be done by force account with the assistance of technical assistance staff.
4.02         To help re-establish MOW's capability for road maintenance, the project provided
for the procurement of road maintenance and workshop equipment, and tools, spare parts for
existing equipment and training equipment, supply of fuel and bitumen, and improvement to Road
Training Center (RTC), MOW's Central Workshop (CWS) and up-country workshops.
4.03         The technical assistance (7 staff for MOW and 2 staff for MOT) included in the
project was intended:
(i)   to help alleviate staffing shortage, to improve MOW's road maintenance
planning, organization and operations, ard to draw up and implement a
staff training program; and
(ii)   to assist MOT in establishing its transport data base.
4.04         The Pilot Program for Development of the Local Construction Industry was
intended to improve the efficiency and capability of domestic contractors in order to reduce the
country's reliance on foreign contractors, and the road maintenance study was intended to draw
up a road maintenance program which could form the basis for future assistance to the country.
4.05         Given the rapidly deteriorating state of the country's road network, the lack of
adequate staff and physical resources in MOW and the urgent need to improve the data base in
the transport sector, the project concept and design were appropriate and timely. In retrospect,
the scope of routine road maintenance included in the project was rather too large for MOW to
implement, in view of the staffing shortage ar.d inaccessibility of certain areas due to poor
security situation in the country at the time.
4.06         Project implementation was the responsibility of MOW and MOT. The road
resealing/regravelling works were carried out by contract under the supervision of consultants.
Consultants were engaged for preparation of bidding documents for civil works and goods. A
road construction firm assisted Government in implementing the Pilot Program for Development
of the Local Construction Industry.
5.           Project Implementation
5.01         Credit Effectiveness and Project Start-up: The Credit became effective on
December 27, 1984, about 5 months behind the original effectiveness date. The Credit
effectiveness was delayed because of Government delay in employing consultants for the
preparation of bidding documents for road resealing/regravelling, and road maintenance and
workshop equipment which was a condition of Credit effectiveness. At the start, the project
experienced country-wide civil strife and the resulting changes in Government in 1985/86 which
delayed project commencement.
5.02         Implementation Schedule: The project was scheduled to begih in mid-1984 and be
completed by end-1987. Due to Government/consultants delay in finalizing bidding documents,



- 4 -
in prequalifying contractors for civil works ano in awarding contracts for road maintenance and
workshop equipment, an ini;l delay of about 2 years was caused in project implementation.
5.03         Government awarded the road resealing/regravelling works, divided into 4
contracts, to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder, a Chinese contractor; a contract between
Government and the contractor was signed in April 1987 with completion scheduled by early
February 1989, after a contract period of 640 days. The mobilization work of the contractor
proceeded slowly; actual works on the roads started at end-August 1987. Due to poor site
management, lack of proper organization and unfamiliarity with the working conditions in
Uganda, the contractor accumulated excessive delays in the execution of the works. The same
were further compounded by difficulties faced by him in securing access to work sites and in
relocating camps, because of rebel activity in the country at the time - for security reasons, the
contractor had to withdraw from certain sites and move his camp elsewhere. The contractor
finally completed the works at end-August 1990, about 19 months behind the contract completion
date. Meanwhile, Government rehabilitated some of the roads included in the project from its
own resources or with assistance from other donors.
5.04         Government invited bids for the supply of road maintenance and workshop
equipment, and tools (divided into 5 lots) in January 1986, and awarded contracts for the same in
February 1987; the goods were delivered mid-1987 through mid-1988. After long persuasion by
the Association, MOW with the assistance of technical assistance staff drew up an order for spare
parts for rehabilitation of the existing equipment in February 1988, and awarded a contract for the
same to a UK firm in January 1989 (4 years after Credit effectiveness). Only one consignment
consisting of 70% of the spare parts was delivered in May 1991 and the supplier declared that he
was unable to supply the balance due to their having become obsolete. No training equipment
was procured under the project. A major 'Second Tranche' of equipment procurement (not
included in the project) planned by MOW in mnid-1990 was disapproved of by the Association,
since the Miristry did not have the funds, trained personnel and facilities to operate and maintain
even the existitr, equipment. In July 1991, the Association authorized MOWTCI/ to purchase
certain critically needed items of equipment, but the same could not be procured before the Credit
closing date of September 30, 1991. The Association granted further extension of the Credit
closing date by 4 months to January 31, 1992 only in respect of improvement to RTC, CWS and
upcountry workshops.
5.05         The implementation of improvement to RTC, CWS and upcountry workshops
component of the project was badly delayed. Designs and bidding documents for improvement to
RTC and CWS were prepared by local consultants in 1985 and 1987 respectively; the
corresponding tasks for improvement to upcountry workshops was undertaken in-house in 1987.
Bids for RTC and CWS were invited from local contractors in November 1987 (almost 3 years
after Credit effectiveness) and the sole bid received was allowed to lapse; the subsequent bids
received in August 1989 were found to be higher than the appraisal estimate. Similarly, the bids
for improvement to upcountry workshops received in December 1988 were found to be high. In
November 1990, Government submitted a proposal to award the work of improvement to the
upcountry workshops to the same contractor who was engaged on road resealing/regravelling
contracts (Para. 5.03). The Association disagreed with the Government proposal and called on
MOW to invite bids on the basis of local competitive bidding. Following receipt and evaluation
1/    MOW and MOT were merged into a single Ministry of Works, Transport and
Communications (MOWTC) in mid-1991.



. 5 -
of bids, Government awarded, with the Association's approval, the work of improvement to RTC,
CWS and 7 upcountry workshops (divided into 4 lots) to local contractors in end-June 1991 and
the works were completed in end-January 1992 (over 7 years after Credit effectiveness).
5.06         A Danish road construction firm assisted Government in implementing the Pilot
Program for JI,welopment of the Local Construction Industry. A contract between Government
and the firm was signed in July 1986. Nine domestic contractors received classroom and on-the-
job training under the Program. Some of the trainees selected lacked adequate resources of
funds/equipment which coupled with Government delay in the release of advance payments to
contractors retarded their progress. The Program was completed with some success at the end of
December 1989.
5.07         Government engaged a US firm of consultants to provide technical assistance to
MOW and MOT; a contract between Government and the firm was signed in July 1986 with
contract completion by July 31, 1989. Of the 9 TA staff that were to be provided by the firm, 2
(a training instructor (civil)/acting team leader and an equipment maintenance engineer) mobilized
in October/November 1986. The team leader/senior highway engineer and 4 other staff (a road
maintenance engineer, a training instructor (mech), a mechanical superintendent and a senior
transport planner) arrived between July 1987 and September 1987; a transport statistician arrived
in March 1988. The vital post of road maintenance superintendent was not filled until May 1988,
almost 2 years after contract signature. Over the first 3 years, the technical assistance team had
shown very little progress in improving road maintenance planning and/or training of MOW staff.
While the training instructor (mech) conducted some training of mechanics between April 1988
and January 1990, very little training had been conducted for the civil staff. In fact, the position
of training instructor (civil) was never properly filled, with 3 separate candidates occupying the
post for short periods of time. On Association's insistence, the consultants prepared and
submitted a formal training program for MOW staff in December 1988, but the same was never
implemented. The TA team apparently had not integrated into the Ministry and there had been
lack of communication between the consultants and MOW staff.
5.08         An assessment of the effectiveness of the TA team carried out by a joint
Government/Bank team in October/November 1989 showed that the TA team had not been fully
effective due to various reasons such as, late arrival and frequent changes of TA staff, difficult
operating conditions in 1986/87, understaffing in MOW and lack of counterpart staff,
unsatisfactory supervision of TA staff by MOW and consultants head office, insufficient funding
of road maintenance, etc. The same also showed that the first acting team leader (October 1986
to September 1987) did not have the level of management experience required for the post and
that none of the team members including the instructors had any serious experience in staff
training. Further, the team was not given any clear lead and it operated independently from the
MOW. It was not until the new team leader/senior highway engineer arrived in September 1989
(over 3 years after contract signature) that the team was adequately led or managed; the TA team
embarked on activities such as, road inventory and condition survey, traffic counts, equipment
inventory and condition survey, etc., and helped develop a maintenance management system in
MOWTC. A contract amendment in October 1989 extended the TA contract by six months to
January 31, 1990 and a subsequent amendment in April 1990, following assessment of the
effectiveness of the TA team, extended the MOW and MOT technical assistance to July 31, 1990
and to January 31, 1991 respectively. The April 1990 amendment to the contract included, inter
alia, a detailed work program and verifiable inputs and outputs for each TA staff. Of the 7
technical assistance staff for MOW, 4 (road maintenance superintendent, mechanical
superintendent, training instructor (civil) and training instructor (mech)) left the



-6-
country between January 1990 and July 1990. Later, Government extended the services of 3 TA
staff (senior highway engineer/team leader, road maintenance engineer and equipment
maintenance engineer) for MOW and 2 TA staff (senior transport planner and transport
statistician) for MOT within the limit of the existing contract funds; most of the staff left the
country by May/June 1991, except for 2 staff (team leader/senior highway engineer and senior
transport planner) who continued till September 30, 1991.
5.09         MOW carried out very little routine road maintenance, and diverted project
equipment from its normal road maintenance use to road rehabilitation/reconstruction. During
FY89, FY90 and FY91 the total road maintained, including heavy grading and regravelling, was
12%, 25.3% and 26.3% of the classified road network respectively; for FY91 only 4% of the
paved network received patchwork. Manual road maintenance barely existed, with the near total
withdrawal of labor due to dissatisfaction with Government pay scales and the lack of hand tools.
Consequently, roads which should have been maintained were neglected and allowed to
deteriorate to the point where major rehabilitation became necessary. This included the roads that
had been newly upgraded/rehabilitated, while priority was afforded to rehabilitation of other
roads. On Association's insistence, MOW with the assistance of TA staff made an attempt to
prepare an annual road maintenance program and the first such program drawn was for the
second half of FY91. MOW's focus on road rehabilitation/reconstruction rather than routine road
maintenance caused disproportionate demand on the scarce resources of funds, equipment and
trained manpower. A large number of equipment units remained idle for want of consumables or
fast moving parts and/or tires; the availability rate of equipment was very low (30%), as a result.
The funds allocated/released by Government for road maintenance during the project were
inadequate, US$2.16 million equivalent in FY87 rising to US$6.51 million equivalent in FY89,
and then dropping to US$2.99 million equivalent in FY90 and US$3.63 million equivalent in
FY91. The Development Credit Agreement for the project required the Borrower to provide
annually a minimum of USh. 1.5 billion (US$6.0 million equivalent.I/), in 1983 prices, for
routine maintenance of the classified road network. Due to the insufficient local funding and/or
bureaucratic delays, MOW was unable to procure fuel, lubricants, spare parts and/or tires for day
to day operation of equipment. Nevertheless, it did not utilize Credit funds for the purchase of
fuel and bitumen, except for the procurement of a small quantity (1500 ton) of bitumen in FY88.
5. 1o        The road maintenance study component of the project was not implemented. A
road maintenance study is, however, being carried out as part of the project preparation work for
a follow-on project.
5.11         Procurement: The procurement action followed the Bank guidelines, except for
the improvement to the upcountry workshops where MOW invited quotations from individual
contractor(s), instead of calling competitive bids. A period of about 2 years was lost by the time
contracts were awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding specified in the DCA. The
procurement action was generally slow; Government/consultants spent a great deal of time in
finalizing bidding documents for civil works and goods.
5.12         Project Costs: The final total cost of the project is within the appraisal estimate
(Part IIl, Table 5); however, large excesses occurred over the cost of civil works and consultant
services which were offset by savings on other items such as, road maintenance and workshop
equipment, fuel and bitumen, etc.
I/    US$1.0 = USh. 250



5.13         Disbursements: The disbursements under the Credit (Part m, Table 3) remained
slow, partly due to the initial delay caused in project start up and partly due to the delay in the
implementation of the civil work components. The Credit finally closed on January 31, 1992,
about three and a half years behind schedule but within the standard disbursement profile for
Uganda.
6.           Project Results
6.01         Project Qbjectives: The project was partially successful in meeting its targeted
maintenance objectives for the country's rapidly deteriorating road network but, did not succeed
in establishing a sustainable road maintenance organization; however, the project helped in setting
up a maintenance management system in MOWTC. The project also assisted in establishing a
National Transport Data Base for transport sector management. Besides, new regulations
governing vehicle size, weight, dimensions and road safety were established under the project.
The Pilot Program for Development of the Local Construction Industry included in the project
was completed with some success.
6.02         Physical Results: Some 366 km of paved road was resealed and 723 km of gravel
road regravelled; MOWTC's road training school, central workshop and 7 up-country workshops
were rehabilitated/improved. The implementation results are shown in Table 4 in Part ImI. The
recalculated ERR for road resealing and road regravelling based on two representative sets of
roads is 54% and 27%, compared to an overall ERR of 59% and 45% respectively, estimated at
appraisal. ERR for routine maintenance could not be recalculated due to the paucity of data on
the roads maintained and/or costs incurred.
7.           Project Sustainability
7.01         The maintenance management system developed under the project sets the stage
for future improvement in road maintenance planning and operations; however, for achieving any
meaningful results in this regard, it is imperative that Government establish a suitable mechanism
for prompt funding of road maintenance. The training of domestic contractors should over time
help in developing the local construction industry, provided contractors are assured of work
continuity and prompt payments by Government. The National Transport Data Base set up under
the project would help in drawing up comprehensive transport programs and in improving
transport sector management in the country.
8.           Bank Performance
8.01         The Bank's performance during the project cycle was generally satisfactory. The
project was prepared and appraised at a time when the country was recovering from the aftermath
of the liberation war in 1979. The Bank's supervision effort was more than adequate, with fifteen
missions fielded over 7 years; however, there was lack of continuity in project supervision due to
changes in task management responsibility during implementation. In FY90, the supervision input
was unusually heavy in terms of staff time (46.3 staff/weeks). The Bank made sporadic attempts
to push Government to provide adequate funds and organization for routine road maintenance.
Because of Government focus on road rehabilitation/reconstruction rather than routine road
maintenance, the Bank granted further extension of the Credit closing date beyond September 30,



- 8 -
1991 only in respect of improvement to RTC, CWS and upcountry workshops. Tne Bank made a
positive coniribution to the cause of the project in mounting a joint Bank/Government team in
October 1989 to assess effectiveness of the consultants technical assistance services which helped
improve consultant performance over the remaining project life. A Bank supervision mission
encouraged MOW into procurement planning of a 'Second Tranche' equipment (not included in
the project) when the Ministry did not have the resources of funds, trained personnel and facilities
to maintain even the existing equipment; up until September 1990, overall status of the project
was inaccurately rated 2 (moderate problems) despite serious management, financial and technical
problems.
9.           Borrower Performance
9.01         The overall performance of the Borrower was less than satisfactory, despite heavy
reliance on foreign consultants. Project coordination in MOW was weak until a new Deputy
Engineer-in-Chief (Development), currently Engineer-in-Chief/Secretary for Works, took charge
in November 1990. Besides general staffing shortage in MOW, there were many staff changes
including 4 Permanent Secretaries. Due to the poor remunerations and working conditions, staff
productivity was generally low. And, there was a clear lack of commitment on the part of
Government to road maintenance; the project equipment was diverted from its normal road
maintenance use and deployed extensively to rehabilitate/reconstruct roads. ITe funds
allocated/released for road maintenance were far below the requirement specified in the
Development Credit Agreement. While MOW was unable to procure fuel, lubricants, etc. for
day to day operation of equipment, it did not utilize Credit funds for the procurement of fuel and
bitumen.
10.          Proiect Relationship
10.01        The Bank's relationship with the Borrower and the various participating agencies
was good throughout the project period.
11.          Consulting Services
11.01        Consultants' performance under the project was less than satisfactory. The
consultants engaged on construction supervision of periodic road maintenance works did not
perform well. A Bank supervision mission found serious defects in the completed works which
had to be rectified later; the consultants took as long as 17 months to complete bidding documents
for the works. The same is true of the consultants engaged for preparing bidding documents for
road maintenance and workshop equipment. The TA team did not prove to be fully effective.
Not only did the consulting firm take very long to mobilize its staff, the first acting team leader
lacked management experience required for the post and none of the team members including the
instructors had serious experience in staff training. And, it was not until the consultants' new
team leader arrived in September 1989 that things changed for the better.



-9-
12.          Project Documentation and Data
12.01        The documentation for the project was adequate, providing a useful framework for
the Association and the Borrower for review of project implementation. The staff appraisal report
provided full details of the project components, implementation schedule and procurement
procedures.
13.          Findings and Lessons Learned
13.01        Project coordination remained weak over most of the project life and there were
many staff changes in MOW. Due to the undermining of civil service by years of insecurity and
civil strife and poor remunerations and working conditions, staff productivity was generally low.
This underlines the need for allocating Credit funds to project incentive schemes to help attract
and retain staff of the right calibre, or better yet to civil service reform or autonomy for Road
Department.
13.02        MOW diverted project equipmient from its normal road maintenance use to road
rehabilitation/reconstruction. This could be avoided by executing road maintenance by contract
rather than force account.
13.03        The funds allocated/released by Government for road maintenance were far below
the requirement specified in the DCA. Experiences such as this indicate the importance of
establishing a funding mechanism, based on user charges, that would assure the availability of
sufficient funds for road maintenance in a timely manner, an essential basis for the success of
such a scheme, however, is the solution to the problem of adequate staffing, so that a strong and
efficient road department is established.
13.04        The technical assistance staff did not prove to be fully effective. To overcome
this, the terms of reference for technical assistance services should include a detailed work
program with verifiable inputs and outputs for each TA staff.
13.05        Long delays were caused in implementing certain components of the project.  A
mid-term review of project implementation would bring to light any inaction on the part of
Government/consultants for taking necessary corrective action.

UGANDA
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT (CREDIT 1445-UG)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART 11 - PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
(Extracts from Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications'
letter No. GC/H/27 dated September 24, 1992)
1.           Borrower's Assessment of Project Definition
1.01         The project conceived as a Road Maintenance project, was quite comprehensive
containing the major road maintenance aspects as clearly evidenced in project break-down by
categories.
1.02         However, for the sake of further improvement, it is Government's view that
projects of such a nature should have the need for "Project Termination' in focus, at the time of
identification or appraisal.
1.03         It is quite essential that termination provisions should be made for some projects
such as this one to be terminated to enable it get re-lodged in the National Recurrent Programme.
This would ensure the "project's" continued sustainability and further realisation of the initial
project objectives. Abrupt termination should be avoided as this often undermines the already
achieved objectives of this class of projects.
2.           Assessment of Borrower's Performance
2.01         The first two years of the project experienced civil turmoil country wide resulting
in two government changes in mid 1985 and early 1986. From early 1987 to 1990 the Northern
and North Eastern parts of the country were under civil strive which caused an insecure
environment for the project. As a result the project commencement [was] delayed.
2.02         Despite the above, the project was executed as designed with 3 years (equivalent
to one effective year) of extension and below budget. Approximately SDR 5.0 million remained
unutilised on Credit.
2.03         The project had a requirement of Government's undertaking in respect of
allocation of sufficient funds from the government's annual recurrent budget for routine road
maintenance in order to support the equipment units that had been procured for road maintenance.
However, on account of the fact that by beginning of 1986 only 5% of the road net-work was
maintainable (i.e 95% of the net-work required prior rehabilitation), government deemed it
necessary that its primary efforts be centred on the reopening of roads in order to stimulate
economic activity. Therefore most of the road maintenance equipment and road maintenance
funds from government budget were allocated for road rehabilitation reopening other than for
routine road maintenance.



- It -
2.04         In the final analysis however, expenditure incurred for road maintenance and
rehabilitation was higher than what had been recommended.
2.05         Funds under Category 3 for road maintenance inputs were not sufficiently utilised
on account of the strategy that had been established soon after signing the road resealing and
regravelling contracts. At that moment it had been noted that there would be an over expenditure
of over US $ 10 million on account of the fact that whereas US $ 20 million had been estimated
in the project Staff Appraisal Report (Cat la) for the resealing and regravelling contracts, the
contracts were awarded at the cost of US $ 32 million. Therefore, as a management strategy, it
was decided by the government to go slow on Category 3 funds such that it could probably act as
buffer to avoid credit over commitment. At that time 1.0 SDR was equivalent to US $ 1.10.
However, as time past by the dollar fell as against SDR and it was only noticed in November,
1989 that if the credit would not be in any danger of over commitment the Category 3 funds were
utilised. At that time 1.0 SDR was equivalent to about US $ 1.35. However all the efforts to
effect additional procurement failed up to closure in September, 1991.
3.           Assessment of Bank Performance
3.01         All in all there was very good coordination with Bank staff right from appraisal to
completion. There was however misguided procurement information during the period May 1989
to September 1990 due to change of Bank's task Manager. This contributed to delays in
procurement under categories lb and 3.
