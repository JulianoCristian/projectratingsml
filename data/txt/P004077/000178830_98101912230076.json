Annual net foreign exchange savings\n            would amount to about $8 million as a result of the\n            increases of about 75% and 240% in rice and barley\n            production, respectively. About 40% of the 23,400 farm\n            families (approximately 130,000 people) who will benefit\n            directly from the project would be those whose present\n            incomes fall below the poverty line.
