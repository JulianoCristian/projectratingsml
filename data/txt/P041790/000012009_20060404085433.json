supported by satisfactory performances\n            by both the Bank and Borrower. Among the lessons learned, it\n            is outlined that Project conditionalities are often a\n            \"double-edged sword,\" - consensus shows that, had\n            there been no condition on the communal titling law, this\n            law would have never materialized; eventually, the project\n            waived the Disbursement Condition for approval of the law,\n            because there was a Bank-financed Land Administration\n            Project better suited to take on the land-related\n            activities. In retrospect, the communal titling law\n            condition was a positive long-term contribution to\n            consolidating indigenous land rights in the Atlantic Coast\n            region. However, political realities should be assessed\n            before setting conditions: the other unmet Disbursement\n            Conditionality was the approval and implementation of the\n            National Environmental Fund (NEF), which was waived toward\n            the end of the project, due to underestimated political\n            difficulties in implementing the NEF, a concept that would\n            manage resources for subprojects. Further lessons reinforce\n            the need for decentralizing technical and administrative\n            functions; for a systematic training; to foster local\n            ownership, and participatory approaches; and, for\n            strengthening local organizations."}, "docdt": "2006-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
