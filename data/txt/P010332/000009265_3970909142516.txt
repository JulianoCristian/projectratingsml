IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
SRILANKA
FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Credit 2043-CE'
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Forest Sector
Development Project (FSDP) in Sri Lanka for which Credit 2043-CE in the amount of SDR
15.5 million (US$19.9 million) was approved on June 15, 1989, and made effective on June 1,
1990.
The Credit closed on December 31, 1996, compared with the original closing date
of December 31, 1995. A sum of SDR 5.07 million (about US$7 million) was cancelled on
September 15, 1994 to take account of bilateral grants received and reduced scope of
operations in certain areas due to security problems. Final disbursement took place on June 5,
1997 at which time a balance of SDR 2.44 million (about US$3.4 million) was cancelled .
.2
Cofinancing of the project was provided by the Finnish International Development Agency
(FINNIDA), the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) and the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP).
This ICR was prepared by an FAO/CP3 mission which visited Sri Lanka in
November 1996 and revised by the staff of the Agriculture and Natural Resources Operations
Division of Country Department 1, South Asia Region.
Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's final supervision mission for
FSDP along with the completion mission in November 1996. It is based, among other
documents, on a review of the Staff Appraisal Report and legal documents, supervision reports,
mid-term review report and project files as well as field investigations and discussions with the
Bank staff and GOSL officials associated with the project.  The implementing agencies
contributed to the preparation of the ICR by commenting on the mission's Aide-memoire,
arranging field visits and discussions with project staff, providing available data on project
performance, and providing comments on this ICR (Appendix C). Two cofinancing agencies
(ODA and UNDP) provided comments that were taken into account in the preparation of the
final version of the ICR.
An additional amount of US$65,000 of unused funds in the special account will be returned to the
credit account and cancelled.
2 This was not a strict co-financing arrangement, but a form of "parallel financing" that was arrived at
during project implementation.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
SRILANI(A
FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (Credit 2043-CE)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
The Bank initiated its involvement in Sri Lanka's forestry sector with a sector
review in 1979. This was followed by the Forest Resources Development Project in 1983,
which financed a modest plantation program and analysis of the sector. At the time of its
completion, there was sufficient evidence of the need for further investment to justify a follow-
up project - Forest Sector Development Project (FSDP)1.
Project Objectives
The objective of the Forest Sector Development Project was to assist the
Government to improve the performance of the forestry sector in line with the economic, social
and environmental requirements of Sri Lanka. This was to be achieved through: (a) the
intensive management of plantations and natural forests; (b) establishment of an environmental
management system; (c) expansion of resource base by establishing new plantations; (d)
expanding and augmenting professional and technical education and training;  and (e)
strengthening of the institutional base.
Evaluation of project objectives. The objectives, which were clearly stated, were
consistent with the forest sector development strategy. Project design, however, was ambitious
on new planting and management targets which were set at appraisal without properly analysing
the risks associated with the limited absorptive capacity of the Forest Department, the main
implementing agency.
Implementation Experience and Results
The project was started after an 18 month delay, largely due to late finalization of
cofinancing arrangements. Despite shortfalls in planting targets, the project has substantially
achieved its environmental objective and has made significant progress towards its institutional
development objective. A significant benefit was the introduction of indigenous forest policy
Following the signing of the project's legal documents, and in line with this agreement, the
Government entered into separate bilateral agreements (including with UNDP, FINNIDA, ODA) for the
support of activities in the overall scope of FSDP but with inputs that were in many cases above the
levels defined at appraisal (especially with respect to technical assistance, institutional support, and
training). In keeping with all stakeholder's perceptions during project implementation and the
Government's system of monitoring and evaluation, this ICR considers that all these additional bilateral
funds were costs to this umbrella project, recognizing that, in many cases, these costs included items
that were not necessarily appraised by the Bank.

analysis capability - through the strengthening of the Forest Sector Development Division
(FSDD) under the project.  On the other hand, the studies under the project preparing
proposals for reform of the State Timber Corporation (STC) have not yet led to significant
progress. However, discussions are still underway and the reforms envisaged may yet take
place. In economic analysis, benefits were solely derived from the forest management and
plantation activities. In the SAR and this ICR, other benefits arising from environmental
management, institutional strengthening, education and training, although acknowledged, were
not quantified due to lack of reliable data. Nevertheless, investment costs for these components
were included in the economic analysis. Re-estimated economic rates of return were lower
than appraisal estimates, largely due to production volumes much smaller than expected at
appraisal and to additional bilateral inputs not envisaged at appraisal, which were concentrated
in the area of non-quantifyable benefits. The overall estimated economic rate of return of 13 %
is still acceptable.
Project Sustainability
The project's achievements appear sustainable, although a major challenge is to
integrate the work of the consultants and the counterpart staff to ensure the correct transfer of
technology.  The factors influencing project sustainability, namely availability of trained
national staff in place with a low turnover rate, ability to meet the recurrent costs of the project
fully, and pursuit of active local support for project activities, have been met under the project
to varying degrees. Direct investments by the Bank on forest activities ended with the closure
of the project in December 1996. The prospects for continuation of investments that would
build on and implement the policy recommendations of this project appear bright with the
expressed interest of other donors in considering financing of the third phase of forestry
development.
Actual Cost and Financing
The total final cost of the project at completion is estimated at US$46.4 million,
representing about 47% increase over the appraisal cost of the project, due largely to the
additional bilateral financing received by GOSL after project signing (see footnote 1 on p. ii).
Actual cost is strictly not comparable with appraisal estimates because new cofinancing
arrangements with UNDP and ODA have been concluded since the signing of the Development
Credit Agreement and included components not covered by the SAR. The project was financed
by IDA (25%), ODA (38%), FINNIDA (6%), UNDP (5%) and GOSL (26%). IDA
disbursements of about US$11.5 million equivalent were about 58% of the US$19.9 appraisal
estimate, due in part to increases in funding from other donors and reduced scope of operations
in certain areas due to security problems.
Key Factors Relating to Achievement of Project Objectives
The main contributory factors for the implementation delays/shortfalls were:
-    Factors not generally subject to Government control.  These included:
late finalization of cofinancing arrangements, undependable weather
conditions in the dry zone and security problems in parts of the project area.
iii



-    Factors generally subject to Government control. These included under-
staffing, outdated financial regulations and centralization of decision-making
powers in the Forest Department, delays in release of counterpart funds by
the Treasury, and delays in forest land assessment and allocation in the dry
zone. These have slowed the pace of project implementation.
-    Factors generally subject to implementing agencies' control.  These
included damage to plantations by fire and animals, slow progress in
preparation of forest inventories and management plans of the dry zone
natural forest and plantations and parts of the wet zone forests, delays in
establishing efficient working relationships between the Forestry Planning
Unit (FPU) and the Forest Department (FD), delays in procurement of
vehicles and equipment, and poor quality of planting stock in the dry zone.
The combined effect of these have adversely affected the achievement of
project targets.
Performance by the Bank and Borrower.
The performance of both the Bank and the Borrower has been generally
satisfactory. Both have satisfactorily carried out project identification and preparation.
Appraisal and supervision of the project by the Bank have received adequate attention but the
appraisal included some over-optimistic targets, especially concerning dry zone operations and
the speed of institutional reform. Notwithstanding the many obstacles which impeded smooth
implementation, the Borrower has generally complied with the covenants and responded to
recommendations made by the Bank, which was firm while being friendly and constructive
during its supervision of the project.
Project Outcome.
The project's outcome is rated satisfactory on the basis that the key elements for
the future course of forestry development - environmental management, education and training,
and institutional support - were successfully implemented, although the implementation of the
other two components - Forest management and Plantation establishment and maintenance -
were below appraisal expectations, the latter mainly due to overly optimistic targets. It should
be noted that the agreement with respect to STC to carry out studies to prepare reform
proposals has been met and that it is too early to judge whether the studies will lead to the
anticipated reforms.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
As in the case of its predecessor, FSDP was, by and large, implemented
successfully. Initially, the project was delayed by about 18 months mainly due to processing
cofinancing arrangements and to a lesser extent because of funding issues. The most common
of the other constraints were the understaffing and centralized decision -making powers at the
FD head office, delays in allocation of land for plantations in the dry zone, and slow progress
in the preparation of management plans.
The Government has planned to start the third phase of the forest sector
development program as the first stage of implementing the revised Forestry Sector Master
iv



Plan in line with the new forest policy. A National Task Force consisting of senior officials
from the relevant ministries and NGO representatives is currently engaged in formulating
guidelines to implement policy and reform-related legislation and procedures. The preparation
of the proposed Forestry III project has therefore been postponed to a later date when the
recommendations of the National Task Force will be officially known. The Ministry has
discussed with the EU, ODA and NORAD the possibility for further financing of forestry
development and has requested the EU to provide two consultants to assist the local preparation
mission for the Forestry III project.
The main lessons learned from the implementation of the project are:
a) Plantation sites should be clearly identified at appraisal in order to ensure
availability of land for plantations.
b) Over-extended state institutions like the Forest Department (FD) have
performed poorly, in part due to the lack of incentives to perform efficiently.
A realistic set of interventions should be envisaged (including strong private
sector participation) as a result of institutional capacity analysis. This is true at
the level of FD whose operations were hampered by understaffing, outdated
financial regulations and over-centralized decision-making.
c) The work of the consultants and counterpart staff must be integrated in project
activities and evaluated systematically to ensure correct transfer of technology.
d) Although not obvious at the time, in retrospect it might have been advisable to
delay appraisal of the project until the outcome of the cofinancing was known
so that more information on other donor programs and project priorities would
have been available.
e) The project made a positive contribution to improvements in the country's
forest policy and long-term sectoral development strategy. While any reform
effort will have to overcome vested interests, the on-going work of the National
Task Force, including NGO representatives, is a hopeful indication of the
Government's recognition of the need for reform.
f) The Bank's concern in this project for addressing important basic policy issues
such  as  stumpage  charges,  self-financing  of  production  plantations,
restructuring of the State Timber Corporation (STC), must be continued by
future donors as an integral part of any future investment in the forestry sector
to allow the technical and other developments from the sector program to yield
positive results.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
SRI LANKA
FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Credit 2043-CE)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
Statement of Objectives
1.        The Bank's association with Sri Lanka's forestry sector dates back to 1979 when a
Forestry Sector Review was undertaken to assist GOSL in formulating a strategy for the
development of its forestry sector. The Bank initiated the first phase of development by
providing support through the Forest Resources Development Project (Cr. 1317-CE) in 1983.
This project laid the groundwork for long-term sectoral development through the preparation of
the Forestry Master Plan. This was followed by the Forest Sector Development Project
(FSDP) which thus became the logical next step in implementing the first Five-year Investment
Program, developed on the basis of the Forestry Master Plan.
2.         The main objective of the project was to assist the Government to improve the
performance of the forestry sector in line with the economic, social and environmental
requirements of Sri Lanka by implementing part of a five-year timeslice (1990-94) of the
Forestry Master Plan. This was to be achieved through: (a) the intensive management of
plantations and natural forests; (b) establishment of an environmental management system; (c)
expansion of resource base by establishing new plantations; (d) expanding and augmenting
professional and technical education and training; and (e) strengthening of the institutional
base. The project included five components: (i) Forest Management; (ii) Environmental
Management; (iii) Plantation Establishment and Maintenance; (iv) Education and Training;
and (v) Institutional Support.
3.        Project cost. The project was planned to be implemented over five years from
November 1989 to December 1994, and the total project cost including the physical and price
contingencies was estimated at US$31.4 million (SLRs1,035 million). The IDA Credit of
US$19.9 million was to finance about 63% of the total project cost. The remainder was to be
met by FINNIDA (US$2.8 million as a grant) and GOSL (US$8.7 million or 20% of total
project cost). If the potential donors (ODA, UNDP/FAO) were to finance part of the project
cost, IDA was to consider cancellation and/or adjusting disbursement percentages accordingly.
However, GOSL's contribution was to be maintained around 20% of the total project cost.
1



Evaluation of Project Objectives
4.         The project was well conceived and it established concise objectives consistent
with sectoral strategy. Moreover, the project design took into consideration other forestry
programs funded by external agencies such as the Asian Development Bank for the Community
Forestry Project and the Overseas Development Administration-supported Forestry Project for
1988 to 1994.  Project design, however, was overly ambitious on new  planting and
management targets which were set at appraisal without properly analysing the risks associated
with the limited institutional capacity of the main implementing agency - the Forest Department
(FD). Implementation experience of FSDP shows that, despite belated improvement in the
staffing situation, the Forest Department still lacks capacity to provide additional staff and land
for plantations, a factor beyond FD's control.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Overall Achievement
5.         The project has substantially achieved its environmental objective, but partially
achieved its physical, institutional development, sector policy, financial and private sector
development objectives. Macro policy, poverty reduction and gender objectives were not
applicable to this project.
6.        Institutional development. The project had an overall aim of improving the
capability of the Ministry of Agriculture, Lands and Forestry (MALF) in policy-making,
planning and monitoring its forestry development programs and enhancing the Forest
Department's capacity  for project implementation.  The Forestry Planning Unit (FPU)
established under the previous project has been strengthened and upgraded to the Forest Sector
Development Division (FSDD) to provide a link between the MALF and the executing agencies
in terms of planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation. The Forest Department (FD), a
key implementing agency, has also been strengthened through provision of some additional
staff, vehicles, equipment, education and training, and technical assistance. Three additional
Divisions have been formed by the FD increasing the total Divisions to 18. The Department
has restructured its headquarters on functional lines and appointed qualified staff to head its
Divisions and additional professional and technical staff (though less than required) to
implement its programs. The restructuring exercise has had some impact but the principles of
functional organization have not been fully applied. Another institution that was targeted under
the project was the State Timber Corporation (STC). The studies under the project preparing
proposals for reform of STC have not yet led to significant changes. However, discussions are
still underway and the reforms envisaged may still take place. With respect to training, an
exceptionally high intake of 27 students for the forestry M.Sc. course was recorded in 1996,
almost twice the appraisal estimate of 15 students and three times the average intake of 9 during
1990-1995. According to the course coordinator, some 20 students were initially selected on
the assumption that about five would drop out (only one dropped out due to medical reasons) as
had been the experience in the previous years. This number was boosted by the intake of five
sponsored students. The continuation of the M.Sc. course is in doubt due to lack of funds
(after the closure of the project) although the University of Sri Jayawardenepura is in the
process of integrating the Forestry program in its regular academic offering. The backlog of
training at the Sri Lanka Forestry Institute is being cleared and the FD expects to complete
2



training of the remaining backlog in about two years. Low attendance, ascribed to trainees
having to attend court cases, continues to be a problem. The frequent turnover of trainers was
sought to be minimized with the recruitment of five permanent lecturers.  However, the
Ministry of Public Administration has asked the Forest Department to obtain its clearance
before holding examinations for recruitment.
7.         Environmental management.  The main objective of this component was to
strengthen the institutional capacity within the FD and Forestry and Environmental Division of
MALF to enable them to deal effectively with forest environmental management opportunities
and constraints. This was, to a large extent, achieved. The Environmental Management
Division has been successfully established within FD. A thorough National Conservation
Review was completed satisfactorily.  It included field surveys in collaboration with the
International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and FD. Out of this work, a total of 30
areas have been identified in the wet zone for potential protected area management. Seven
conservation management plans (three in detail) have been prepared and implementation is
reported to have started. Research needs in environmental management have been highlighted
and some have already been undertaken. Environmental impact guidelines have also been
prepared and several workshops have been conducted.  Other studies on site assessment,
species selection and tree improvement have been completed and guidelines circulated. Despite
these substantial achievements, there is still a wide gap between diagnosis and implementation.
Bridging this gap is of critical importance for the sustainability of the environment management
component. The shortcomings have been identified and for the most part are being corrected.
8.         Forest management. The objective of this component was to prepare management
plans for all plantations and for selected natural forests as a vehicle for improved management.
For various reasons, there were serious delays in the preparation of these plans. Mid-term
review stressed the need for an early start-up of this activity and indicated that these plans need
to be revised every five years on the basis of updated data collected by FSDD. Management
plans for eucalyptus are already operational, while those for teak and pine have not been
completed. An interim management plan for mahogany has been completed and a forest
management plan outline had already been circulated among the field staff. There is some
reservation among the field staff regarding some prescriptions which need to be clarified.
Management plans have so far been prepared mostly by international consultants. This process
needs to be internalized and the local staff involved in the framing of prescriptions.
9.         Plantation establishment and maintenance. The objective of this component was
to establish plantations in the different climatic zones of the country for production of timber
and meet the prevailing and projected shortage in the country. Against a project target of
23,0001 ha, about 15,859 ha were reportedly planted by the end of 1995 and an additional
planting of 3,120 ha by the end of 1996. The target was reduced to 22,220 ha at mid-term
review. The planting program has deviated in the choice of species and also areas. Security
has been one of the main reasons for the shortfalls in some areas. Another contributory factor
is the shortage of staff in FD, which is attributed to a recruitment freeze imposed by GOSL
throughout the public sector in response to a continuously growing budget deficit, although
Originally, 17,900 ha of new plantation were targeted at appraisal. The target was raised to 23,000 ha
with the finalization of cofinancing arrangements, and later, brought down to 22,220 ha at mid-term
review.
3



some relief was provided to the Department in filling critical vacancies in later years of the
project. Sites selected in the dry zone are very harsh and are scattered over small areas.
Overall survival in the dry and wet zones is reported between 65-90%; however it appears to
be overestimated. The quality of seedling production continues to need attention. There are no
certified seed sources or seed production areas. Nursery techniques remain unchanged. There
is no provision for soil testing and fertilizers are used both in the nurseries and plantations
based on past practice rather than defined needs. Water harvesting techniques especially in the
dry zone, have not been adopted and this must have had a considerable effect on plant survival.
Good success has been reported where communities' cooperation has been sought for plantation
establishment and maintenance.
10.       Financial and sector policy. The project's financial and sector policy objectives
were to have been achieved through proper pricing of logs and collection of realistic stumpage
fees from the State Timber Corporation (STC). These have only been partially achieved.
Although no royalty is collected on poles and sleepers, the increased royalty (from 10% to
between 26% and 40% of logs' sales value) represents a positive improvement. The present
collection (SLRs5O million) is 333% of previous payment (SLRs15 million) by STC. However,
in the absence of reconciliation of logs extracted by the STC with the estimated extractable
timber by the FD, it is difficult to assess the extent to which the increased royalty has improved
the effectiveness of royalty collection. The recommended management accounting tool of
profit-centre accounting has not been fully applied in STC's operations like logging, sawmilling
and furniture manufacture. Instead, logs are transferred to other operating units within STC at
cost price, not market price, resulting in undervaluation of forests and loss of accountability on
the part of STC.
11.       Private sector development.  A legal covenant was included in the project
requiring a study on the privatization of STC-owned sawmills. This study was carried out and,
based on its recommendations, six sawmills were closed down (their equipment sold to private
parties); the remaining five are operated by the Corporation. Of these five, three are reported
to be making losses. In December 1994, it was agreed that the MALF would take a decision
on the status of STC after two years, if the STC had not performed well in the meantime. As
of June 1997, MALF had not reached a decision on overall STC status. It is accepted that
ending STC's monopoly and providing a favorable investment climate for private sector
involvement would have signficantly improved the management of plantations.
12.       Project inpact. The project has had a significant impact on the country's forest
sector, but the potential for further progress is still substantial.  A significant, though
unquantifiable, benefit was the introduction of some form of indigenous forest policy analysis
capability through the strengthening of FSDD under the project. This has instilled some life
into a process (that was somewhat moribund) by promoting market-friendly policy reforms and
institutional coordination.  Other benefits included increased capability of the FD through
education and training of its staff at both the technical and post-graduate level; improved
ecological management of forests with the establishment of the Environmental Management
Division with the necessary equipment and training; and increased timber production (though
less than expected). For the purpose of economic analysis, total benefits for the project were
assumed to be solely derived from the forest management and plantation activities.  Other
benefits - environment management, institutional strengthening, education and training - were
4



not quantified due to lack of data and difficulty in measurement. Nevertheless, investment
costs for these components were included in the economic analysis.
13.       An economic re-evaluation has been undertaken for the project as a whole and for
two of its components - new plantations and forest management. Re-estimated economic rates
of return (ERR) are 13% (project as a whole); 6% (new plantations); and 30% (forest
management), compared to 28%, 13% and 45 % respectively at appraisal. The lower ERRs at
completion are due essentially to production volumes being much smaller than expected at
appraisal and to the additional bilateral inputs (in technical assistance, training etc.) that were
not included at appraisal (see footnote 1, p. ii) and which were concentrated in the areas of
non-quantifyable benefits. The overall estimated economic rate of return of 13% is still
acceptable.
14.        The sensitivity analysis indicates that a reduction in benefits by 20% would lower
the ERR for the project as a whole to 10%; a reduction by 50% would lower the ERR to 6%;
while an increase in cost by 20% and by 50% would reduce ERRs to 11% and 8%
respectively. The tests indicate that the project would remain modestly sensitive to reductions in
benefits.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
15.       Implementation record. As in the case of its predecessor, FSDP was, by and
large, implemented successfully. Initially, the project was delayed by about 18 months mainly
due to processing cofinancing arrangements and to a lesser extent because of funding issues.
The most common of the other constraints were the understaffing and centralized decision-
making powers at the FD head office, delays in allocation of land for plantations in the dry
zone, and slow progress in the preparation of management plans. Despite these delays, the
project has resulted in noticeable achievements, particularly in environmental management and
institutional development. The updating of the Forestry Master Plan and the formulation of the
new forest policy are also significant contributions under the project.
16.       The main contributory factors for the implementation delays/shortfall were:
-    Factors not generally subject to  Goverrnent control. These included:
delay in finalizing cofinancing arrangements, undependable weather
conditions in the dry zone and security problems in parts of the project area.
-    Factors generally subject to Government control. These included under-
staffing, outdated financial regulations and centralization of decision-making
powers in the Forest Department, delays in release of counterpart funds by
the Treasury, and delays in forest land assessment and allocation in the dry
zone. These have slowed the pace of project implementation.
-    Factors generally subject to implementing agencies' control.  These
included damage to plantations by fire and animals, slow progress in
preparation of forest inventories and management plans of the dry zone
5



natural forest and plantations, and parts of the wet zone forests, delays in
establishing efficient working relationships between the Forestry Planning
Unit (FPU) and FD, delays in procurement of vehicles and equipment, and
poor quality of planting stock in the dry zone. The combined effect of these
has adversely affected the achievement of project targets.
17.       Actual project costs. The project was completed by the extended Credit Closing
Date of December 31, 1996 (one year later than the original Closing Date). The total final cost
of the project at completion is estimated at US$46.4 million, representing about 47% increase
over the appraisal cost of the project, due largely to the additional bilateral financing received
by GOSL after project signing (see footnote 1 on p. ii). Actual cost is strictly not comparable
with appraisal estimates because new cofinancing arrangements with UNDP and ODA have
been concluded since the signing of the Development Credit Agreement and included
components not covered by the SAR.
18.       Project fmancing.  The total actual expenditure was met by IDA, ODA,
FINNIDA, UNDP and GOSL. IDA provided 25%, ODA 38%, FINNIDA 6%, UNDP 5%
and the remaining 26% was met by GOSL. IDA disbursements of about US$11.5 million
equivalent were about 58% of the US$19.9 appraisal estimate. An amount of US$7 million
from the IDA Credit was cancelled in 1994 to take account of the use of bilateral grants and
reduced scope for project operations in certain areas due to security problems. An additional
SDR 2.44 million (about US$3.4 million equivalent) was cancelled at the time of final
disbursement in June 1996.1
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
19.       Project sustainability would involve continuation of project activities after the
ending of donor support. It depends on four main factors: availability of trained national staff
in place with a low turnover rate; ability to meet the recurrent costs of the project fully;
pursuit of not only local acceptance but active local support for project activities, to minimize
the risk of degradation, illicit felling or sabotage; and conservation of forests because of their
distinctive biological diversity, watershed qualities, cultural value and degree of threat to their
integrity. These factors have been fulfilled under the project to varying degrees as illustrated
hereafter. The strengthening of the FSSD to provide support for the development of the
forestry sector over the long term is a major accomplishment under the project. The education
and training component has assured availability of trained national staff. In this respect, the on-
going process of integrating the project's Forestry program as an integral BSc program at the
University of Sri Jayawardenepura is a concrete step towards sustainability of this project
component. Adequate budgetary resources to meet recurrent costs have been a problem not
only for the FD but other state institutions as well. The freeze on recruitment is a manifestation
of this problem. Direct investments by the Bank in forestry activities ended with the closure of
the project in December 1996. Whether the specific objectives of the project and benefits will
be sustained will have to await investment decisions by other donors. There are indications that
other donor agencies like the European Union and the Norwegian Agency for Development
Cooperation are interested in considering financing of the third phase of forestry development.
An additional amount of US$65,000 of unused funds in the special account will be returned to the
credit account and cancelled.
6



20.       In a small way, the FD is experimenting with participatory forest management with
local people in order to maintain the natural forests so that they continue to contribute to
sustainable rural development and remain as part of the natural heritage of Sri Lanka. The FD
has scheduled 30 wet zone forests for conservation management, following recommendations
made in the Accelerated Conservation Review and the National Conservation Review carried
out under the project. In view of the progress mentioned above, the project's achievements
appear sustainable, although a major challenge is to integrate the work of the consultants and
the counterpart staff to ensure correct transfer of technology.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
21.       Project concept and design.  Overall, appraisal established clear project
objectives consistent with sectoral strategy and learning experience from the previous project.
Two appraisal missions with the participation of seven and three professional specialists
respectively had carried out a thorough review of the project concept and components. The
missions were fairly well-balanced and well-represented in relevant disciplines. However, the
institutional analysis of the FD should have analyzed in greater detail the range of possible
interventions to overcome the risks associated with FD's limited implementation capacity. This
would have led to less ambitious physical targets and the identification of more realistic design
options (including public/private partnerships to complement public sector involvement in
plantations). With the benefit of hindsight, the Bank might have been well-advised to delay
appraisal of the project until the outcome of cofinancing was known so that more information
on other donor programs would have been available.
22.       Supervision. The Bank's supervision performance was satisfactory. As shown in
Table 11 of Part II, the project enjoyed intensive supervision by the Bank - 12 supervision
missions with five consisting of the Task Manager only over five years (April 90 - Nov. 95) for
an average duration of 11 days in the field. The skill mix reflects the presence of a forester
(Task Manager) in each mission. The missions reviewed the project performance highlighting
the main problems and recommending corrective measures which were carefully followed up
on subsequent visits. The Bank was firm while being friendly and constructive during its
supervision of the project. Apart from periodic supervision missions, a Mid-term review was
also undertaken with the participation of cofinancing agencies. The review recommended and
the FD accepted the downward revision of the planting targets. Other recommendations made
by the Mid-term review mission were also seriously considered and for the most part
implemented. The Bank also correctly identified the problems of the STC and persistently
sought remedial action by the Government, without significant success in reforming STC.
However, the agreed studies to prepare reform proposals were carried out and dialogue on
these proposals is underway (including consideration by a National Task Force and discussions
with the prospective donors for Forestry III).
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
23.       Implementation.  The project was prepared adequately by the Borrower with
assistance from FAO/CP and the Bank. The performance of GOSL and the implementing
agencies was mixed in the actual implementation of the project for reasons both within and
beyond their control (see para 16). Notwithstanding the many obstacles which hindered smooth
7



implementation, the implementing agencies have generally responded positively to suggestions
made by the Bank both during supervision and the Mid-term review.
24.        Legal covenants. As Table 10 in Part 11 shows, the Borrower met almost all of
the legal covenants (some partially and some with delays) except the one on establishment of
new plantations on lands allocated to forestry, which was not complied with. The covenant
dealing with establishment of separate profit centres for the STC was partially complied with
since the transfer price on logs to other units was based on cost and not on market price.
G. OUTCOME
25.        The project's outcome is rated satisfactory on the basis that the key elements for
the future course of forestry development - environmental management, education and training,
and institutional support - were successfully implemented, although the implementation of the
other two components - Forest management and Plantation establishment and maintenance -
were below appraisal expectations, the latter mainly due to optimistic targets. The overall
ERR, while lower than the appraisal estimate, is still satisfactory, particularly since it includes
substantial costs for inputs leading to non-quantifyable benefits. It should be noted that the
agreement with respect to STC to carry out studies to prepare reform proposals has been met
and that it is too early to judge whether the studies will lead to the anticipated reforms.
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
26.        The Government has planned to start the third phase of the forest sector
development program as the first stage of implementing the revised Forestry Sector Master
Plan in line with the new forest policy. A National Task Force consisting of senior officials
from the relevant ministries and NGO representatives is currently engaged in formulating
guidelines to implement policy and reform related legislation and procedures. The preparation
of the proposed Forestry III project will start when recommendations of the National Task
Force are officially known. The Ministry has discussed with the EU, ODA and NORAD the
possibility for further financing of forestry development and has requested the EU to provide
two consultants to assist the local preparation mission for the Forestry III project.
1. LESSONS LEARNED
27.        The main lessons learned from the implementation of the project are:
a) Plantation sites should be clearly identified at appraisal in order to ensure
availability of land for plantations.
b) Over-extended state institutions like the Forest Department (FD) have
performed poorly, in part due to the lack of incentives to perform efficiently.
A realistic set of interventions should be envisaged (including strong private
sector participation) as a result of institutional capacity analysis. This is true at
the level of FD whose operations were hampered by understaffing, outdated
financial regulations and over-centralized decision-making.
8



c) The work of the consultants and counterpart staff must be integrated in project
activities and evaluated systematically to ensure correct transfer of technology.
d) Although not obvious at the time, in retrospect it might have been advisable to
delay appraisal of the project until the outcome of the cofinancing was known
so that more information on other donor programs and project priorities would
have been available.
e) The project made a positive contribution to improvements in the country's
forest policy and long-term sectoral development strategy. While any reform
effort will have to overcome vested interests, the on-going work of the National
Task Force, including NGO representatives, is a hopeful indication of the
Government's recognition of the need for reform.
f) The Bank's concern in this project for addressing important basic policy issues
such  as  stumpage  charges,  self-financing  of  production  plantations,
restructuring of the State Timber Corporation (STC), must be continued by
future donors as an integral part of any future investment in the forestry sector
to allow the technical and other developments from the sector program to yield
positive results.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
SRI LANKA
FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (Cr.2043-CE)
Appendix A
Aide Memoire
A. Introduction
1.    A joint mission comprising the final supervision team from the World Bank, and an
FAO/CP mission for the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) visited Sri
Lanka from November 10-22, 1996. After initial meetings with the project staff from the
concerned implementing agencies, field visits were made to selected project sites in the
intermediate zone (Kuliyapitiya), the dry zone (Puttalam and A'pura), the up-country (N'Eliya
and Bandarawela), and the wet zone (Matara) areas. The mission had discussions with officials
of the Ministry of Agriculture, Lands and Forestry (MALF), the Forest Department (FD), the
State Timber Corporation (STC), the Forestry Unit of the University of Sri Jayawardenepura
(USJP) and other donor agencies including ODA, UNDP and FAO. This aide memoire
summarizes the main findings and conclusions of the ICR mission and is subject to
modifications following detailed analysis in Rome. The final aide memoire will be transmitted
to the Government later by the Bank in Washington.
2.     The mission wishes to thank all concerned staff for the assistance and hospitality
extended to the mission during its stay in the country.
B. The Project Objectives
3.     The main objective of the project was to assist the Government to improve the
performance of the forestry sector in line with the economic, social and environmental
requirements of Sri Lanka by implementing part of a five-year time slice (1990-94) of the
Forestry Master Plan. This was to be achieved through: (a) the intensive management of
plantations and natural forest; (b) establishment of an Environmental management system; (c)
expansion of resource base by establishing new plantations; (d) expanding and augmenting
professional and technical education and training; and (e) strengthening of the institutional base.
The project included five components: (i) Forest Management; (ii) Environmental Management;
(iii) Plantation establishment and maintenance; (iv) Education and training; and (v) Institutional
support.
4.     The Forest Sector Development Project (FSDP) was a follow-up to the Forest Resources
Development Project which was the first free-standing forestry project financed y the Bank in Sri
Lanka. The first project laid the groundwork for long term sectoral development through the
preparation of the Forestry Master Plan. The FSDP thus became the logical next step in
I



implementing the first Five-Year Investment Program, developed on the basis of the Forestry
Master Plan and further updating this Plan. The project was well conceived and it established
concise objectives consistent with sectoral strategy. Moreover, the project design took into
consideration other forestry programs funded by external agencies such as the Asian
Development Bank for the Community Forestry Project and the Overseas Development
Administration-supported Forestry Project for 1988 to 1994. Project design, however, was
overly ambitious on new planting and management targets which were set at appraisal without
properly analyzing the institutional capacity of the main implementing agency-FD.
Implementation experience of FSDP shows that, despite belated improvement in the staffing
situation, the Forest Department still lacks capacity to provide additional staff and land for
plantations, a factor beyond FD's control.
C. Implementation Experience
5.    The project was delayed by about 18 months mainly due to processing cofinancing
arrangements and to a lesser extent because of funding issues. Disbursements gathered
momentum from FY1992 and by FY1996, over 70% of the revised Credit amount (original sum
of $19.9 million less canceled amount of about $7 million) had been utilized. Since June/July
1994, supervision ;missions have reported that the implementation status and development
objectives were satisfactory. However, outcomes under the five components have been mixed as
explained in para 10. The shortcomings have been identified and for the most part are being
corrected.
6.    Actual Project Costs: The project, as envisaged at appraisal, is expected to be
completed by the extended Credit closing date, i.e. December 31, 1996. When allowance is
made for costs to complete, the total final cost would amount to SLRs2258 million. (Or $43
million), representing a 118% cost overrun in nominal rupee terms and 37% in US dollar terms.
Actual expenditure is strictly not comparable with the appraisal cost, as the former includes
expenditures due to widening the scope of the project by other donors like ODA.
7.    Project Financing: The project financed about 79% of the total actual expenditure
compared to 63% of the project cost at appraisal. IDA provided 31 %, ODA 38%, FINNIDA 5%,
UNDP/FAO 6% and the remaining 20% was met by GOSL. IDA Credit of $7 million was
canceled in 1994 to take account of the use of bilateral grants and reduced scope for project
operations in certain areas due to security problems.
D. Major Factors Affecting the Project
8.    The main contributory factors for the implementation delays/shortfalls were:
Factors not generally subject to Government control: These included undependable
weather conditions in the dry zone and security problems in parts of the project area.
Factors generally subject to Government control: These included understaffing,
outdated financial regulations and centralization of decision-making powers in the Forest
2



Department, delays in release of counterpart funds by the Treasury, delays in forest land
assessment and allocation in the dry zone. These have slowed the pace of project
implementation.
Factors generally subject to implementing agencies' control: These included damage
to plantations by fire and animals, optimistic physical targets, slow progress in preparation of
forest inventories and management plans of the dry zone natural forest and plantations, and parts
of the wet zone forests, delays in procurement of vehicles and equipment, and poor quality of
planting stock in the dry zone. The combined effect of these have adversely affected
achievement of project targets.
E. Performance of the Bank and the Borrower
9.     The performance of both the Bank and the Borrower is generally satisfactory. Both have
satisfactorily carried out project identification and preparation. Appraisal and supervision of the
project by the Bank have received adequate attention. Notwithstanding the many obstacles
which impeded smooth implementation, the Borrower has generally complied with the covenants
and responded to recommendations made by the Bank which was firm while being friendly and
constructive during its supervision of the project.
F. Assessment of Outcome
10.    The overall project outcome is rated as satisfactory and the outcomes of the individual
components are briefly summarized in following paragraph.
G. Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
11.    Findings: As in the case of its predecessor, FSDP was, by and large, implemented
successfully, but it too experienced implementation difficulties. The most common of these
were the under-staffing and centralized decision-making powers at the FD head office, delays in
allocation of land for plantation in the dry zone, and slow progress in the preparation of
management plans. Despite these delays, the project has made noticeable achievements
particularly in environmental management and institutional development. The updating of the
Forestry Master Plan and the formulation of the new forest policy are also significant
contributions under the project. The sustainability of the departmental forests will depend on the
level of staffing of the FD, complemented by improved and clear working methods, concentrated
institutional support ;and adequate budgetary resources. This in turn will require a strong
political will from the Government to support institutional changes including the restructuring of
the STC and the involvement of rural communities in resource planning and use, as well as
promotion of private investment in resource expansion and management. The performance of
the five components are briefly discussed below.
3



Forest Management: The main objective of this component was to prepare management plans
for all plantations and for selected natural forests as a vehicle for improved management. For
various reasons, there were serious delays in the preparation of management plans. Mid-term
review stressed the need for early start up of this activity and indicated that these plans need to
be revised every five years on the basis of updated data collected by FSDD. An interim
management plan for mahogany has been completed and a forest management plan outline had
already been circulated among the field staff. There is some reservation among the field staff
regarding some prescriptions which need to be clarified. Management plans for eucalyptus
plantations are already operational, while those for teak and pine have not yet been prepared.
Management plans have so far been prepared mostly by international consultants. This process
needs to be internalized and the local staff involved in the framing of prescriptions.
Environmental Management: The progress under this component, albeit delays, is the best
among project activities. The Environmental Management Division has been successfully
established within the FD. The Environmental Management Division set up within the MALF
has been upgraded as Natural Resources Management and Environmental Division. National
Conservation Review field surveys have been completed. A total of 30 areas have been
identified in the wet zone. Seven conservation management plans (3 in detail) have been
prepared and implementation is reported to have started. Research needs in environmental
management have been highlighted and some have already been undertaken. Environmental
impact assessment guidelines have also been prepared and several workshops have been
conducted. Other studies on site assessment, species selection and tree improvement have been
completed and guidelines circulated. Despite these substantial achievements under this
component, there is still a wide gap between diagnosis and implementation. This needs to be
bridged.
Plantation Establishment and Maintenance: Against a target of 23000 ha, about 15858 ha
were reportedly planted by the end of 1995 and an additional planting of 3120 ha is expected by
the end of 1996. The original targets were reduced at mid-term review to a total of 22220 ha.
The planting program has deviated in the choice of species and also areas. Security has been one
of the main reasons for shortfalls in some areas. Sites selected in the dry zone areas are very
harsh and are scattered over small areas. Overall survival in both the dry and wet zones is
reported between 65-90%; however it appears to be overestimated. The quality of seedling
production continues to need attention. There are no certified seed sources or seed production
areas. Nursery techniques remain unchanged. There is no provision of soil testing and fertilizers
are used both in the nurseries and plantations on account of past practice and no defined need.
Water harvesting techniques especially in the dry zones have not been adopted and this must
have had considerable effect on plant survival. Good success has been reported where
communities' cooperation has been sought for plantation establishment and maintenance.
Education and Training: At appraisal, it was envisaged that the education of professional
foresters, training of FD and STC staff would be supported under the project. Compared to the
target of 1 5 students for the forestry MSc course, actual intake has not exceeded 10 until 1996
when some 27 students were registered. The main reason for this high intake, as stated by the
course coordinator, was that 20 students were selected on the assumption that about five would
drop out as had been the experience in the previous years. However, only one dropped out due
to medical reasons, while another five sponsored students joined the course. The closure of the
project and the consequent funding problem in financing projects (Rs25000 per project) by
students is likely to affect the continuation of the MSc course. The backlog of training is being
4



cleared and is not likely to be completed by the end of the project. Low attendance is also a
problem and it is ascribed to trainees having to attend disciplinary proceeding and cases. The
frequent turnover of the teaching staff will be minimized with the recruitment of five permanent
lecturers soon.
Institutional Support: Institutional development was planned to be achieved through
strengthening FSDD, FD and the STC. The Forestry Planning Unit established under the
previous project has been upgraded to Divisional status within the MALF. It provides a
satisfactory link between the Ministry and the executing agencies in terms of planning,
budgeting and programming. The sector has been redefined through the Forestry Master Plan
and a new and progressive forest policy has been adopted, which promotes increased
involvement of the private sector and communities in resource management, use and investment
for resource expansion and improvement. The FD has also been strengthened through provision
of vehicles, equipment, training and technical assistance. Staffing constraints of the FD are
exacerbated by the excessive time to protect forests from encroachment and illicit felling. This
activity along absorbs over 50% of the field staffs' time and even at this level of staff time
involvement, the FD is not able to protect the forests effectively. The STC has computerized its
accounting system and the regional offices have established separate profit centers for different
segments of operations. As required under the project and the mid-term review, a structuring
study was carried out. The study recommended removal of the current monopolistic privileges
of the STC and restructuring it as a public company. Action on these recommendations has been
postponed until the recommendations of the National Task Force are officially known.
12.    Future Operations: The Government has planned to start the third phase of the forest
sector development program as the first stage of implementing the revised Forestry Sector
Master Plan in line with the new forest policy. A National Task Force consisting of senior
officials from the relevant ministries and NGO representatives is currently engaged in
formulating guidelines o implement the policy and to reform the related legislation and
procedures. The preparation of the proposed Forestry III project has therefore been postponed to
a later date when the recommendations of the National Task Force will be officially known. The
Ministry has discussed with EU, ODA and NORAD possibility for further financing of the
forestry development and has requested EU to provide two consultants to assist the local
preparation mission for the Forestry III project.
13.    Key Lessons Learned: The main lessons learned from the implementation of the
project are:
(a) Plantation sites should be clearly identified at appraisal in order to ensure availability of land
for plantations.
(b) Institutional capacity analysis may be needed before a project can be executed. This is true
at the level of FD whose operations were hampered by understaffing, outdated financial
regulations, and overcentralized decision-making.
(c) The work of the consultants and counterpart staff must be integrated in project activities and
evaluated systematically to ensure correct transfer of technology.
5



(d) Although not obvious at the time, in retrospect it may have been advisable to delay appraisal
of the project until the outcome of the cofinancing was known so that more information on other
donor programs and project priorities would have been available.
(e) The Bank's experience in this project of having addressed some important basic policy
issues such as stumpage charges, selfinancing of production plantations, restructuring of STC,
must continue to form an integral part of any future investment in the forestry sector to allow the
technical and other developments from the sector program to yield positive results.
H. Next Steps
14.   Upon return to Rome, the mission will prepare a draft ICR in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines for submission to the Bank by the end of December 1996. GOSL will prepare
its own evaluation and send it to the Bank in due course for incorporation in the final ICR.

APPENDIX B
ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
A. Introduction
1.        This appendix presents the assumptions and results of investments made by the
Forest Department under the Forest Sector Development Project. Since a Mid-term evaluation
had been carried out by the Bank in 1994, the present evaluation builds on it, updating
physical and financial values to constant 1996 prices. The economic rates of return (ERR) are
re-estimated at 13% (for the project as a whole), 30% (for the forest management component)
and 6% (for new plantations). Both direct and indirect costs have been included in estimating
the ERR for forest management and new plantations. Other main assumptions made in the
SAR/Mid-term evaluation and ICR are set out below.
B. Economic Analysis
Appraisal Estimates.
2.         At appraisal, the project's ERR was estimated to be 28%, and the ERRs for forest
management and new plantations to be 45%  and 13% respectively, based on the following
assumptions:
project life of 45 years;
-    all values expressed in constant 1989 prices;
-    quantifiable benefits to be the output of sawlogs and small wood;
-    without the project, the management and silvicultural treatment to
commence five years later than with the project;
-    logs adjusted upwards by 30% to arrive at a sawlog price from which the
felling and transport costs (adjusted by 0.75 SCF) were deducted;
-    economic stumpage value of small wood (used for pulpwood, poles and
fuelwood) arrived at by deducting the felling and transport cost (adjusted by
0.75 SCF) from market prices; and
See memo dated September 27, 1994, by H. Lee, SA3AG.

economic prices of non-tradeable outputs derived from their financial prices
adjusted by 0.75 SCF, and unskilled labour by a conversion factor of 0.65.
ICR Estimnates.
3.         The recalculations of the ERRs follow the SAR methodology, refined by mid-term
and ICR mission's evaluation. The main differences are:
-    project life of 45 years for teak plantations and 40 years for the mahogany
plantations;
-    all values expressed in constant 1996 prices;
-    quantifiable benefits to be the sawlogs, small poles and fuelwood;
-    without the project, forestry management treatment to commence five years
later than with the project and the total output of the existing plantations
without project to be 20% of the 'with project' situation;
-    teak price is based on imported sawn timber price of Burma teak, and 25 %
deduction made for quality differentials; mahogany, which is consumed
domestically and will not be internationally traded, is derived by applying
the SCF; the economic stumpage value of other round woods (used for
pulpwood, poles and fuelwood) is derived by using the SCF;
-    actual investment costs used  for project years  1990-96  with  past
expenditures restated in 1996 prices using wholesale price (Table 1); and
-    SCF of 0.9 used to convert financial prices to economic values in respect of
non-tradeable inputs and output, and a conversion factor of 0.9 for
converting financial wage (unskilled labour) into economic wage.
Based on the above assumptions, prices (Table 2), plantation programme (Table 3), and species
mix and expected yields (Table 4), the current estirnates of ERRs for the project as a whole, for
forest management and new  plantations are  13%. 30%  (Table 5) and 6%  (Table 6)
respectively. The principal factors which have contributed to the lower ERRs compared with
the appraisal estimates are much smaller production volumes from new plantations than
expected at appraisal, and the addition of substantial bilateral inputs (in technical assistance,
training etc.) which were not included at appraisal and which were concentrated in the areas of
non-quantifyable benefits..
C. Sensitivity Analysis
Tests have been conducted to assess the sensitivity of the project's ERR to possible adverse
impacts. The results are presented in Table 6. The tests indicate that the project will remain
sensitive to reduction of benefits.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORI
SRI LANKA
FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (Cr. 2043-CE)
APPENDIX C
GOVERNMENT'S COMMENTS
1.    Project Description
The project was designed to: (a) strengthen the management of forests and established
plantations, and inventory of additional natural forests and young plantations for management
purposes; (b) establish an environmental management system to ensure conformity of forestry
operations with environmental guidelines; (c) establish and maintain 17,900 ha of new
plantations; (d) expand and augment resources for professional and technical education and
training facilities; and (e) strengthen the Forestry Planning Unit of the Ministry of Lands,
Irrigation and Mahaweli Development, reorganize the management and strengthen the field
organization of the Forestry Department, and upgrade information and data processing at the
State Timber Corporation. The project also includes an applied research program consisting of
species trials, as well as technical assistance, civil works, vehicles, equipment, materials, and
additional staff to be used for the project.
Through the project modern, economically, environmentally and scientifically sound forestry
practices would be introduced in Sri Lanka. These practices would increase the production of
wood, provide greater protection to the environment, and crate employment opportunities for
the rural population. Altogether they would allow the country to meet most or all of its
requirements for wood and wood products over the long run. The investments to be made
under the project do not convey any major risk. However, implementation might fall short of
expectations if the current political situation does not improve in the near future.
2.    Project Costs
IDA allocation for the project was SDR 15.5 (US 19.9 million equivalent). FINNIDA agreed
to provide US$ 2.8 million as a grant under a separate agreement, while the Government of Sri
Lanka agreed to provide US$ 8.7 million. However, after the agreement was entered, other
donors (ODA, UNDP/FAO) pledged support towards the project.  The reduction of the
plantation program in the dry zone and the delay in preparing management plans in the wet
zone as a result of the conservation review being carried out resulted in further savings of IDA
project funds. Under these circumstances it was mutually agreed to cancel US$ 7 million from
the IDA credit.
The total project expenditure as at February 1997 is approximately US$ 11.16 million.

3.    Progress of Project Components
A summary of progress of the main aspects in the project components are given below:
Environmental management: The section on environment management within the Forest
Department was established and has contributed towards integrating the environmental
management aspects in forestry development activities. A conservation review in the wet and
dry zones of the country were completed. Seven Management plans for areas in the wet zone
have also been prepared and are due to be implemented. A data base on environmental
information management system has been set up at the Forest Department.  In addition,
development of EIA guidelines, guidelines for harvesting and logging have been developed.
Forest management: Two management plans for up-country Eucalyptus plantations have been
prepared and implemented. Work on preparation of management plans for teak and pine
commenced although not fully completed. An interim management plan for mahogany was
completed and is being implemented.
Plantation establishment and maintenance: The original target of plantation establishment of
23,000 ha had to be considerably reduced in view of the problems encountered in the dry zone
and also the non-accessibility in certain areas due to security reasons. However, the original
planting targets were over ambitious in comparison to the capacity of the Forest Department.
The total extent planted during the project period is 18,894 ha throughout the country.
Education and training: The MSc in Forestry at the University of SJP has so far trained
nearly 69, including 11 from the Forest Department and 2 from the private sector. The course
is drawing more students particularly more independent students. The intake of students for
academic year 1996 is 27. A new BSc. course in Environmental Science was also introduced
and a new department of forestry was created. The university is well equipped with the
necessary infrastructure and with the increase in intake of independent students the course
could be sustainable in the future. The Sri Lanka Forestry Institute is also equipped with all
necessary infrastructure required for training technical forestry personnel.
Institutional support: The Forestry Sector Development Division (FSDD) of the ministry has
contributed much towards the development of the sector in terms of policy and planning. The
development of the Forestry Sector Master Plan (FSMP) and a National Forestry Policy were
initiated and coordinated by the FSDD. The FSDD also initiated the necessary legislative
changes required for the forestry sector to implement the new policy and the FSMP. The
establishment of the environmental management division in the Forest Department is an
important aspect. The department was also able to increase its field cadre and other required
staff so that the capacity for carrying out the expected activities could be increased.
4.    Obligations under the loan agreement
The government came into several agreements during negotiations, as per Appraisal Report of
May 17, 1989.
All agreements were complied with except for: (i) all forestry operations will be undertaken
according to management plans, which are partially completed; (ii) establishment of new
2



plantations on lands allocated for forestry, maps are being prepared at present. However, this
matter will be taken care of with the establishment of the National Forest Estate.
5.    Comments
One of the most important aspects of the project was the activities performed in respect of
environment management. In addition, activities relating to forest management, plantation
establishment and maintenance, forestry education have contributed to the development of the
sector. However, the progress made in the project was overshadowed by the IDA withdrawal
from the forestry sector, having on many occasions consented to continue to assist the sector
activities. The sudden withdrawal with short notice has hampered the systematic development
of the sector to a great extent.
