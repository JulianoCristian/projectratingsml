for any debt, such lien will equally and ratably secure the payment of the principal
of, and interest and other charges on, the Loan, and in the creation of any such
lien express provision will be made to that effect, at no cost to the Bank; and

year;
(b)   the term  "net income from operations" means the gross operating
revenues from electric power, less all operating expenses;
(c)   the term  "operating expenses" includes: direct costs of operation,
administrative, overhead and adequate maintenance expenses; straight-line
depreciation based on the useful life of major categories of assets; taxes (if any),
but does not include interest and other charges on debt; and
(d)   the term "net value of fixed assets in operation" means the gross value
of such assets, as determined in accordance with methods of valuation or revaluation
acceptable to the Bank, less accumulated depreciation, such assets to include, inter
alia, (i) from the year in which the Euphrates Dam first generates one thousand
gigawatt hours or more, the value of electricity generating assets at the Euphrates
Dam, the Thawra-Aleppo transmission lines, the Thawra sub-station and such part

with the provisions of Section 3.02 of the Guarantee Agreement No. 986-SY signed
on May 23, 1974 between the Bank and the Guarantor, (ii) the value of the electric
generating and distributing facilities of the electricity supply area of Latakia.
Section 5.06. Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Borrower shall
not incur any debt if its net revenues for the fiscal year next preceding such
incurrence or for a later twelve-month period ended prior to such incurrence,
whichever amount is the greater, shall be less than 1.5 times the maximum debt
service requirements on all debt (including the debt to be incurred) in any
succeeding fiscal year. For the purposes of this Section:
(a)   "debt" means any debt maturing by its terms more than one year
after the date on which it is originally incurred; a debt shall be deemed to be
incurred on the date of execution and delivery of a loan agreement providing for
such debt or, in the case of a guarantee of debt, on the date of execution and
delivery of the agreement providing for such guarantee;


﻿9
(b)   the term "net revenues" means gross revenues from operations adjusted
to take account of rates in effect at the time of incurrence of the debt even though
they were not in effect during the twelve consecutive months to which such
revenues related, less operating, administrative and overhead expenses, including
adequate maintenance expenses and provisions for taxes, if any, but before provision
for depreciation, interest and other charges on debt;
(c)   the term "debt service requirements" means the aggregate amount of
amortization (including sinking fund payments, if any), interest and other charges
on debt; and
(d)   whenever it shall be necessary to value in the currency of the Guarantor
a debt payable in another currency, such valuation shall be made on the basis
of the rate of exchange at which such other currency is obtainable by the Borrower,
at the time such valuation is made, for the purposes of servicing such debt or,
if such other currency is not so obtainable, at the rate of exchange that will be
reasonably determined by the Bank.

be made in respect of:
(a)   expenditures in the currency of the Guarantor or for goods or services
supplied from the territory of the Guarantor;
(b)   expenditures prior to the date of this Loan Agreement, except that

expenditures.

item in any Category is inconsistent with the procedures set forth or referred to

any other right, power or remedy of the Bank under the Loan Agreement, by
