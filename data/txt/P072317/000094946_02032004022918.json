Other impacts include\n            uncontrollable pasturage and soil erosion caused by\n            livestock. Overuse of agrochemical inputs linked to\n            agricultural intensification will be avoided by sensitizing\n            and educating targeted populations through agricultural\n            extension to disseminate information about integrated pest\n            management. Ecosystem disturbance will be alleviated by\n            avoiding the destruction of existing protective works. The\n            exploitation of available water resources (the decrease of\n            the water table and disturbance of the hydrological\n            network), the increase in water use because of intensive\n            agricultural production, uncoordinated maintenance of the\n            forest or inappropriate cultural practices increasing\n            erosion and siltation, accidental chemical spills-all could\n            lead to flooding problems, a decrease in livestock\n            resources, water pollution, and an amplification of\n            socio-economic problems and would be exacerbated during the\n            rainy season. These problems will be mitigated by\n            integrating environmental protection into proposed methods\n            for forest management, reforestation and revegetation, and\n            selecting resistant plant species. Drainage works will\n            control the flow of surface water. Providing filters and\n            planting vegetation along embankments and among alluvial\n            deposits and upstream water bodies will protect natural\n            resources threatened by soil erosion and excavation."}, "docdt": "2002-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
