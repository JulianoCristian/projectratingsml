Mountainous\n            and Forestry Areas Development Project for Tunisia were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: an efficient partnership for local and\n            community-based development is possible between governmental\n            and non-governmental organizations in Tunisia. This is best\n            illustrated by the high level of contributions leveraged\n            from ODESYPANO (Northwest Forestry and Pastoral Development\n            Agency - Office du Developpement Sylvo-Pastoral du\n            Nord-Ouest) partners (35 percent on average of the total\n            cost of the 476 CPAs (Annual Program Contract - Contrat\n            Programme Annuel) executed under the project. This\n            achievement is largely due to the partnership mechanism\n            implemented by the ODESYPANO with active collaboration from\n            regional and sub-regional public administrations in the five\n            governorates. However, further strengthening is needed to\n            consolidate these established local partnerships. As\n            indicated, the sustainability of this partnership will\n            depend on enhancing and institutionalizing key requirements\n            such as: (a) better linkages between PDC (Community\n            Development Plan - Plan de Developpement Communautaire)\n            programming and financing as well as planning and budgeting\n            procedures used by the regional administrations, and (b)\n            more flexibility in regional administrative procedures for\n            allocating budgets to technical ministries, so that CPAs can\n            be financed when ready, rather than having to wait for funds\n            at fixed intervals during the fiscal year. The use of\n            community-based Integrated Participatory Approach (IPA) has\n            helped the administrations at regional and local levels to\n            move from an often confrontational relationship with\n            communities in project areas to a more productive\n            relationship based on mutual trust. IPA has also helped\n            communities progress from a mentality of passive contributor\n            to that of an active participant in their own local\n            development. From an environmental viewpoint, IPA has also\n            reinforced community adhesion to soil and water conservation\n            works on private lands, when combined with productive\n            activities in the context of PDCs. These works are then\n            better designed and maintained since they are conceived in\n            close collaboration with populations."}, "docdt": "2010-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
