while ensuring sustainable\n            management of the natural resources. To this end, project\n            components will: 1) support capacity building activities to\n            strengthen the Northwest Forestry and Pastoral Development\n            Agency - ODESYPANO - by financing the adjustment of\n            ODESYPANO's organizational structure, through the\n            redefinition of responsibilities, human resources planning,\n            and management. Technical assistance will be provided to\n            update operations, and help formulate community development\n            plans. In addition, information systems will be improved,\n            training programs provided, and, capacity building for\n            beneficiary communities and partners should enhance\n            participation in the implementation of development\n            activities; 2) support the implementation of integrated\n            pilot operations, through forestry extension services, and\n            provision of equipment, training, and trial demonstrations\n            on improved forestry practices; land consolidation\n            operations to facilitate agricultural farming, targeting\n            communities requiring titling operations; and, promotion of\n            micro-enterprise projects, including assistance on\n            technically and financially sound proposals for presentation\n            to financial institutions; 3) strengthen the extension\n            services for improved crop production, livestock husbandry,\n            and veterinary services. In addition, rehabilitation of\n            small-scale irrigation schemes will be supported, depending\n            on beneficiary demand; 4) support the improvement of\n            environmental, and natural resources management, through\n            practices in soil and water conservation, pastures and\n            rangelands under-utilized, and agro-forestry development;\n            and, 5) support rehabilitation and/or construction of basic\n            rural infrastructure, to facilitate community access to\n            markets, and social services, by improving rural roads, and\n            access to potable water."}, "docdt": "2002-09-26T00:00:00Z"}
