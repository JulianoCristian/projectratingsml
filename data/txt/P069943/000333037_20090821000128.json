Health\n            Care and Nutrition Project for Iran were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: it\n            is important for the Bank to ensure that there is a\n            consensus within the country on the project before seeking\n            approval for it, even when the Bank is time constrained to\n            take a project to the Board. Especially when the Bank is\n            trying to move quickly on a project or country relationship,\n            arrangements must be made to ensure that the Borrower's\n            key project staff are hired and familiarized with Bank\n            processes and procedures before the actual start of project\n            implementation.  In a country like Iran where nothing can be\n            done without the approval of the relevant financial\n            controller who must therefore be familiar with World Bank\n            guidelines and requirements, it is advisable to design a\n            project that is simple and can be managed and implemented\n            under the jurisdiction of only one financial controller. It\n            is inefficient for a Bank project to finance, procure and\n            monitor a large number of low cost small works scattered\n            over a large geographic area, but very efficient in\n            procuring large numbers of equipment or vehicles where a\n            centralized tender process is possible. Attribution of\n            results must take into account parallel programs and the\n            synergy must be acknowledged."}, "docdt": "2009-07-30T00:00:00Z"}
