sustain access to, and\n            quality of primary health care, while improving the\n            nutritional status of children, and mothers. The components\n            will: 1) focus on an improved access to, and quality of\n            health, through the refurbishment of primary health care\n            facilities, phasing out civil works, and equipment costs\n            over a five year period. Medical equipment will be replaced,\n            and, additionally required equipment will be procured, such\n            as X-ray equipment, particularly for those communities in\n            need of diagnostic care; 2) improve nutrition of children\n            under the age of two, and of pregnant/lactating women,\n            through extensive training practices, focusing on\n            dissemination of information, education, and communication\n            for better nutrition. A strengthened monitoring system will\n            aim at preventing malnutrition among the target groups, and\n            decreasing the prevailing iron deficiency anemia among young\n            mothers. Functional nutritional literacy will be provided at\n            the household level; and, 3) strengthen the capacity\n            building, through improved management training, evaluation\n            activities, and operational research."}, "docdt": "2000-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
