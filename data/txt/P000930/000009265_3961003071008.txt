MEMORANDUM AM RECOMMATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE    RNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECtllVE DIRCORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDfT TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A NATIONAL IJVESTOCK SERVICES PROET
1.   I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Ghana for SDR 15.3 million, the equivalent of US$
22.45 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a national
livestock services project.
2.   Backgim. Agriculture Is the dominant sector of the Ghanaian economy, contributing
about half of the GDP and about three quarters of export earnings. Most of the population
live in rural areas and derive their income from agriculture. Agriculture is also an important
source of public revenues and has direct and indirect influences on public and private savings
and investment. Government's long-term objectives for the agricultural sector include greater
food security, higher employment and incomes in rural areas, regional balanced growth and a
greaer contributon of the sector to GDP, foreign exchange earnings and government
revenue.
3.   To achieve these objectives, the Government formulated a Medium Term Agricultura
Development Strategy (MTADS) in 1990 with the assistance of IDA. This strategy has three
main components, for each of which IDA assistance has been sought. Flrst, significant
changes in the incentive framework for agriculture are being undertaken, with support from
the recently-approved Agricultura Sector Adjustment Credit. The main objectives In this area
are the privatzation of input supplies for agriculture, the divestiture of para-statal marketing
and storage facilities, the ending of government purchasing of grains, the liberalization of
eternl trade in palm oil, cotton, coffee and sheanuts and the privatization of domestic
purchasing of cocoa. When complete, these reforms will have almost completely elimnated
the role of the State in agricultural input and output marketing, with the one major exception
of extn   trade in cocoa. Second, the strategy envisages a significant increase in
infrastuctural investment, especially in rural roais and, to a lesser extent, in irrigation. IDA
asistance in these areas is being provided through a recently-approved Nationat Feeder Roads
ProJect, and is baing sought through an Agricultura Sector Investment ProJect, which would
support small-scale rural investments with a strong focus on village and district-level planning
and execution. Third, the strateg lays heavy emphasis on the reform and strengthening of
public services to generate and dissemi    agricultural technology, to conserve naural
resources and to raise the long-run productive potential of the sector. In support of these
objectives, four closely-related projects have been prepared, three of which have been
approved by IDA. These are the Nadonal Agricultural Research Project, the National
Agricultura Extension Project and the Environmetal and Natura Resource Management
Project. The fourth, a National Livestock Services Project, is described below. This project
wuld, in paricular, complement the National Agricultural Extension Project and the National
Agrical Research Project by controlling livestock diseases, providing improved breeding
stock and planting material for forage production, developing stock water supplies and
mpoving the quality of livestock subject-matter specialists. The Government has issued a
letter of livestock sub-sector development policy on which the project is based.



-2-
4.   PWec  ObThe primary objective of the project would be to increase meat,
egg and milk production, to raise producer Incomes, particularly those of smallholders, to
reduce the courtry's increasing dependence on imports of livestock and livestock products and
to reduce the financial burden on the Government of services it provides to the livestock sub-
sector. This would be achieved through a combination of institutional reforms and Investment
that would lead to Improved access by producers to livestock health services, improved
breeding stock, Improved animal production technology and markets. A subsequent objective
of the project would be to improve rangeland utilization and resource management. The
project would strengthen the public sector by increasing its capacity to render services to the
private sector and privatizing activities in which It does not have a comparative advantage.
5.   TfhQec Desgion.  Te institutional and policy reforms include: charging fill cost
recovery prices for government services in an effort to promote privatization of animal health
services; closing down non-productive govenument farms; restructuring of MOAks animal
production and health services; and community involvement in the development, operadon
and maintenance of livestock water supplies. Project investment comprises: (a) strengthening
animal health services and developing their infrastructure (US$9.6 million, 33 percent of total
costs); (b) developing forage production on range and fann lands (US$2.1 million, 7 percent
of total costs); (c) developing livestock water supplies (US$4.43 million, 15 percent of total
costs); (d) improving livestock breeds (US$4.84 million, 17 percent of total costs); (e)
intmducing a pilot dairy development scheme (US$1.10 million, 4 percent of total costs); and
(t) institution building (US$7.01 million, 24 percent of total costs).
6.   The total cost of the project is estimated at US$29.06 million equivalent with a foreig
exchange component of US$17.97 million (62 percent of total costs). IDA would finance
US$22.45 million, which is 84 percent of the total project costs excluding duties and taxes.
ITe breakdown of costs and financing is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement as well as the disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group Operations are
given In Schedules C and D, respectively. A map of Ghana is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 11058-GH, dated October 29, 1992 is being distributed separately.
7.   Ibiect ljnbementatia. 7The project would be implemented by the Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA) in cooperation with the Council for Scientific and industrial Research
(CSIR). The project would be mainly managed and implemented by two newly established
departmen ts in MOA, namely Animal Production Department (APD) and Veterinary Services
Department (VSD), in collaboration with: (a) the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority,
MOA, which would implement the stock water development component; (b) the Crop
Services Department, which would implement the pasture and forage seed multiplication
component; and (c) the Animal Research Institute, CSIR, which would conduct the feed
analysis for MOA. In addition, the Pblicy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Department,
MOA, would ensure that the project has a satisfictory management and information system
(MIS) and that project activides are adequately monitored and evaluated. MOA's Department
of Agricultr Extension would extend improved livestock technologies, backed up with
animal production subject matter specialists, and assist in contacting and selecting and
organizing farmers to participate in aimal breeding, seed production and community
lIvest  worker programs. The MOA Project Coordinating Unit would arrange procurement
and disbursement under the project and the MOA Manpower Development and Training
Department would make arrangements for staff training.



- 3 -
8.   MOA has sufficient qualified professional staff to implement the project. However,
adminitatve and management reforms are needed. Technical assistance would be required,
particularly for setting up the livestock information and financial management systems and for
training Ghanaian counterparts in operating these systems. In addition, short-term assistance
would be required in the areas of animal breeding, forage development, the control of tse tse
flies and poutry diseases and starting the pilot dairy development component.
9. Thect Sustainabliq. The sustainability of the project lies in the strong human
resource development and institution-building components, in strengthening the capacity of
MOA to formulate policies and programs for the development of the livestock sub-sector and
for monitoring and evaluating their impacts. The project would also enhance MOA's capacity
to provide effective services to the livestock industry. The net contribution of the
Government to the project would be US$3.11 million. The incremental recurrent expenditure
during the first year of the project would be US$0.66 million gradually increasing to US$2.01
million in the final year. Overall incremental recurrent costs represent less than 8 percent
p.a. of AHPD's current allocation for recurrent expenditure. The additional burden on the
Goverment's budget should not be onerous, particularly if MOA is vigilant in recovering the
cost of services rendered to farmers and if it disposes its 22 unproductive farms as planned
under the project.
10. Lessons Learnt from Previous IDA Involvement. In general, IDA funded livestock
projects in Sub-Saharan Africa performed rather poorly up to 1982. The most important
causes for this poor performance were poor macro-economic conditions (mncluding declining
farm gate prices due to rigid domestic price controls, overvalued exchange rames, worsening
world markets and escalating input shortages and prices); attempts to transfer inappropriate
echnology to smallholders with inadequate understanding of smallholder farming systems;
project designs inappropriate to local conditions; and weak government institutions (parastatal
ranches and dairy fms and complex pastoral development components).
11.  Since 1983, the Bank has been incorporating these lessons in the design of livestock
projects and related components. Bank livestock lending has now moved towards an emphasis
on the policy framework and on the development of smallholder and pastoral production and
instution-building, especially in the promotion of private sector services. Continent-wide
this has resulted in a substaDtial number of projects which in one way or another promote
private animal health care. In the dry areas, the animi health care activities have been
supplemented with a focus on animal traction and more recently with dairy, smallholder steer
fattenn and small stock production. The project now proposed maintains a similar
emphasis.
12.  Rationate for IDA InvolxyMna. The livestock sub-sector in Ghana has been largely
neglected by policy-makers, and an improvement in services and livestock technology is long
overdue. The relationship of this project to other agricultural service projects is explained in
para.3 above, and their complementarity provides a strong justification for contiued
assistace from IDA. In helping to finance the whole range of essential services in
agriculture, IDA would have the opportunity to ensure consistency in institutional and policy
reforms and to monitor closely the implementation of the MTADS. Of particular importanc
in this respect is the consistent emphasis on smallholder farming systems and on the
devdopment of private sector pardcipation in the provision of services. The privaization of



-4-
animal health services, breeding and forage seed production to be supported under this project
would be consistent with the overall objectives of the MTADS. Therefore, the project is fuily
consistent with the Bank's country assistance strategy for Ghana, which emphasizes the
achievement of sustainable enhanced growth, including an expanded role for the private
sector, and places more emphasis on effective management of public sector resources.
13.  Ag&ed Actions. Agreement was reached at negotiations on the following:
(a) contracting out vaccination and meat inspection services in areas where veterinarians
establish private practice and withdrawing government services in these areas as guided by a
committee that would include representatives from the private sector and the Veterinary
Medical Association; (b) progressively increasing charges for animal health services to full
cost recovery by January 1, 1994; (c) establishing quality standards for manufactured feed by
December 31, 1993; (d) closing 18 MOA farms not required for livestock breeding and
research, not later than December 31, 1993; (e) designing and implementing a management
information system by December 31, 1993; (f) preparing annual work program and budget
not later than September 30 of each year; (g) preparing a study of the impact of imports of
subsidized meat from- the EEC on domestic production and consumption of meat and lack of
credit on the supply of feed for the poultry and pig industries by September 30, 1993; (h)
preparing a mid-term report by September 30, 1995 for a joint review to be held not later
than December 31, 1995; and (i) preparing a national tse tse and trypanosomiasis plan not
later than December 31, 1996.
14.  Conditions of Credit Effectiveness. The Borrower would: (a) establish the Project
Steering Committee; (b) recruit an administrative and financial management expert; (c) raise
its cost recovery of non-mandatory vaccination, clinical treatment and other services it renders
to the public to 75 percent of the cost of the service, including cost of drugs, vaccines and
supplies used, and charges for transport, finance and personnel; (d) submit to IDA a draft
model contract between MOA and Stock Water User's associations, specifying their
contributions, functions and responsibilities in the development and management of the water
supplies and the range resources commanded by them; and (e) establish a Livestock Services
Project Account and pay into this account its first contribution of the equivalent of US$70,000
in Cedis.
15.  The Conditions for Disbursement are: (a) for the feed laboratory component: signing
of a memorandum of understanding between CSIR and MOA on the supply of feed analysis
equipment to the Animal Research Institute and the services it would render in analyzing
samples of commercial feed for regulatory purposes and in support of MOA's feed resource
development and breeding program; and (b) for the stock water development component:
signing a memorandum of understanding between MOA and the Ghana Irrigation
Development Authority on designing, contracting and supervising the construction of stock
water supplies and the training of water users' associations in their proper use and
maintenance.
16. Environmental Aspects. The most likely negative environmental impacts from the
project are related to the potential overgrazing due to higher livestock numbers raised as a
result of project interventions and the tse tse fly control involving an area of 2,500 sq km.
The project would seek to mitigate this potential impact through a number of interventions to
improve the productivity of rangelands and their management. Livestock producers would be
organized into associations around water supplies, i.e., dams, dugouts or boreholes. Water



5-
supplies would be developed or rehabilitated and maintained through these associations. Both
pasture and tree legumes would be introduced into the rangelands and burning of the range
controlled in collaboration with the associations. This is expected to substantially increase the
carrying capacity of the natural pastures to enable them sustain production at a higher level.
Adverse effects of insecticide use in the tse tse control program are expected to be limited as
no blanket spraying of insecticide is envisaged, and the odor baited screens and traps that will
be used are non-polluting.
17.  Progr Objective Catoes. Poverty in Ghana is primarily a rural phenomenon with
*             nearly 80 percent of the national incidence of poverty found in the rural areas. The growth in
livestock production expected of the project would be of prime importance in alleviating rural
poverty, improving nutrition and enhancing food security. Women constitute more than half
of Ghanaian farmers and, therefore, play an important part in rearing livestock. Even in farm
households headed by men, women are responsible for rearing poultry, pigs, small ruminants
and calves. Women would have increased access to livestock services provided by the project
and the benefits of increased livestock productivity would directly accrue to them.
18.  Pmiect Benefis. The project would help generate a substantial increase in livestock
production and would improve the nutrition, income and standard of living of a large number
of rural families through improved animal disease control services and the diffusion of
improved technologies in forage and livestock production and facilitating access to off-farm
inputs, credit and markets. Specifically, project benefits should manifest themselves in three
main areas of increased livestock production, development of human resources and increasing
institutional capacity to cater to the development needs of the livestock industry. Livestock
production, estimated for only the veterinary, forage and water improvements on cattle and
small ruminants, indicate that the project would result in incremental production of 8,370 tons
of meat and 8,770 tons of liquid milk in a period of five years valued at about US$12.65
million in constant 1992 prices. The average annual incremental production is estimated at
1,755 tons of meat and 1,750 tons of milk during the first 5 years. This would increase to
3,210 tons of meat and 7,100 tons of liquid milk in years 5 to 10. The project's internal
economic rate of return is estimated at 52 percent; but decreases to 30 percent if product
prices reduce by 20 percent and costs increase by 20 percent.
19.  Bisks: Possible project risks include: (a) ineffective management and training of
personnel; (b) low adoption rates of technical recommendations by farmers; (c) the possible
inability of Government and/or donors to sustain the long-term commitment required to
achieve durable improvements in the effectiveness of livestock support services; and
(d) unfavorable output:input price ratios. Improved management of livestock services is
expected as a result of the improved organization, training, monitoring and evaluation, and
technical assistance to be provided under the project. Decentralizing decision-making, by
conferring more authority and responsibility at the regional level, would improve
managemnent. Ihe station and on-farm research support provided by the National Agricultural
Research Project and the strong research/extension linkage in planning the research and
extension program built into the National Agricultural Extension Project should reduce the
risk of low adoption rates. The annual review of work plans and budgets, as well as the
mid-term implementation review, would provide good opportunities for program review and
enhancing long-term Government and donor commitment. Use of improved technology and
increased access to inputs and produce markets would help reduce the cost of production as
well as the spread between wholesale and farm gate prices.



20.  Iemmedation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve It.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES
1.     Wile ohaa's ovall disbusmet perfomance continues to compare fivorably with other ountries
in tho Regon, disursments on invesment lending have been declining since PY89. An inreased focus on
implementation, complemeted with actions to address genetic as well as prqect issues, rWesuld in a reversal
of the trend in FY91. Key actions taen to improve perfornance included a Country Implementation Review
in May 1991, which led to a breakthrough in the simplification of procurement prcedures and the approval
proem, and follow-on sector implemetation roviews. The Resident Mission's supevision capacity was
l-_lo W,and its polio monirg activities icsed. Intensivo supervision and mid-tem revews were
used to redesign slow-moving projects in accordance with Bank policy. Anticipated political changes, along
with uncertainty over possible shifts in personnel, led to a slow-down in actions to address implementations
problems, as reflected in lower disbursements in FY92. Nonetheless, continuing efforts to improve
pformance, including a CIR plan of 1993, are expected to bring activities back on track aftr the settling-in
period of the new government. The status of projects which are particularly slow-disbursing is discussed below.
2.     Cocoa Rehabilitation (FY88).  To address the administrative problems that had led to slow
implementation, project administration has been tightened, clear working relationships between implementing
agencies have been eostablished, and mechanisms have been put in place to monitor progress. However,
difficulties with procurement procedures and cost increases in toe roads component have caused continued
delays in implementation. Following a mid-term review in March 1992, various components of the project have
been redesigned and atioon taken to re-allocate credit finds.
3.     Mining Sector Rehabilitation (FY88). The SGMC rebabilitation component has been lagging
substantially owing to slow decision making onjoint venturing and rehabilitation of the mines. A cofinanciers'
meeting was held in October 1992. Main actions for improvement include steps to joint venture, continued
downsing of SGMC, and preparation of plans to close one of the mines.
4.     uEst  (FY89).  Implementation problems included weak project mmanament, shortage of
professional staff, and Govenment uncertainty about the likely effectiveness of the technical assistance
program. Actions have been taken to enhance staff tgainig, seek approval for an increase in incentive
packages, and restrnre th technical assistnce program. Project management has now improved and, as a
result of the mid-term review in January 1992, implementation procedures have been simplified and action taken
to reallocate poceeds.
S.     Ruinc (FY89). Although disbursements improved in FY92, drawdown on the credit line is
still slower than expected owing to problems of high interest rates, high credit risk peception by both lenders
and borowers, and significant delays by the project implementation unit. The June 1992 mid-term review
proposed several actions to accele    disbursements including ways to einminate delays in the processing of
claims frmi participating financial institutions.
6.     Water Sector Rehabilitation (FY90). There has been significant progress in resolving financial issues
(tariff rates were increased in February 1992), and steps have been taken to address institutional problems. The
key issue of shortage of qualified senior n staff, however, remains unresolved. Technical
recommendations have been submitted to the Provisional National Defence Council but a decision is not
expected until after the elections in November 1992. Afler a two-year delay, physical implomentation of the
project is now on track and disbusments are expected to pick up at the end of the engineering design stage
in May 1993 when the rehabilitation process begins.
