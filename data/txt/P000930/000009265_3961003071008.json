primary objective of the project is\n            to increase meat, egg and milk production, to raise producer\n            incomes, particularly those of smallholders, and to reduce\n            the financial burden on the government of services it\n            provides to the livestock subsector.  This will be achieved\n            through a combination of institutional and policy reforms\n            and investment that will give producers improved access to\n            livestock health services, water and forage resources,\n            improved breeding stock, improved animal production\n            technology and markets. The institutional and policy reforms\n            include:  charging full cost recovery prices for government\n            services in an effort to promote privatization of animal\n            health services; closing down non-productive government\n            farms; restructuring the Ministry of Agriculture's\n            animal production and health services; and community\n            involvement in the development, operation and maintenance of\n            livestock water supplies.  Project investments comprise:\n            (a) strengthening animal health services and developing\n            their infrastructure; (b) developing forage production on\n            range and farm lands; (c) developing livestock water\n            supplies; (d) improving livestock breeds; (e) introducing a\n            pilot dairy development scheme; and (f) institution building."}, "docdt": "1992-11-11T00:00:00Z"}
