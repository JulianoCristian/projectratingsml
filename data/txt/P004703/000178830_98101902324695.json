capacity\n            each; (b) construction of civil works including power plant\n            structures and buildings, fuel supply handling and storage\n            systems, water cooling systems, makeup water, etc.; (c)\n            supply and installation of the boiler, turbogenerator,\n            auxiliary electrical, mechanical and miscellaneous equipment\n            for the first 500 MW generating unit; (d) construction of\n            230 kV switchyard at Bang Pakong and substations at Rangsit\n            and Bang Kapi and 110 km of 230-kV transmission lines\n            linking Bang Pakong power station to the EGAT grid; (e)\n            supply of construction equipment (hoists, cranes, welding\n            equipment, earth movers, concrete mixers, etc.); (f)\n            engineering services; and (g) a study of future generation\n            and transmission projects. The project will help meet the\n            country's growing electricity demand including that of\n            the accelerated rural electrification program.
