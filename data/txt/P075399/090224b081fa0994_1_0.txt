                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to make progress toward achieving its development objectives, under full commitment of the leadership and staff at the Ministry of Finance. The project has
                         now a cumulative IDA disbursement of US$63.5 million (85%), with US$14.5 million disbursed in the last one year. The Treasury and Budget Management Information System
                         (TABMIS) is now functioning well in about 1,500 sites throughout the country, which has significantly strengthened state budget execution and monitoring. Steady progress was
                         achieved on other important activities including (i) taking-over TABMIS from the contractor, introducing commitment control, and engaging with consultants on TABMIS Portal and

                         public debt and risk management; implementing DMFAS system for domestic debt; and adopting the legal framework to strengthen monitoring of SOEs fiscal risks. Overall project
                         management remains satisfactory.

                         However, the final amendment to TABMIS contract for additional user licenses and support services, system operational acceptance and MoF’s takeover process have not been
                         completed yet. With only a few months away from the project closing dates, there are still a large number of ongoing consultancy activities across the components, which requires
                         acceleration of progress while ensuring good quality of the important work supported by the project.
