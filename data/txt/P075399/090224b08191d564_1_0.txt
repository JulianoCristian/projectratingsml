                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to make progress toward achieving its development objectives. The leadership and staff at the Ministry of Finance (MoF) remain highly committed to
                         successfully complete the project. The project has now a cumulative IDA disbursement of US$60 million (80%), with US$11 million disbursed in since July 2012. The Treasury and
                         Budget Management Information System (TABMIS) has been operational in all intended treasuries and financial agencies across all 63 provinces, and 37 spending ministerial
                         organizations. TABMIS rollout completion in late 2012 has been one of the major milestones of the project. The Government of Vietnam has now the core platform for the

                         development of a wide range of financial management planning, control, reporting and analysis. Steady progress has been noted on the activities to enhance the management of
                         public debt– notably was the smooth implementation of the DMFAS system for recording and management of domestic debt. The activities to strengthen the monitoring of SOEs
                         fiscal risks have gathered pace recently, with the finalization of relevant legal framework and gradual enhancement of risk management and assessment capacity. Overall project
                         management remains satisfactory.

                         However, there are outstanding issues related to the remaining contract deliverables by TABMIS contractor (IBM) and their final handover of responsibility to MoF. Resources and
                         capacity of MoF appear to be thin and therefore needs significant augmentation to be able to successfully take over the operation and maintenance of the system. Though TABMIS
                         has been operational for a while, several software issues of TABMIS remain persistent. Some critical functions such as commitment control and Treasury Single Account operation
                         have yet to be fully implemented. Further work is needed to fully utilize TABMIS reporting capability to provide policy makers, managers and data users the information they require
                         for policy-making, and economic and budget management purposes.
