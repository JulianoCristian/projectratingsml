PROJEC-", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Public Financial\n            Management Reform Project for Vietnam were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was negligible to low, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the timeframe\n            for the project needs to be realistic so that unnecessary\n            extensions of the closing date can be avoided. For smooth\n            implementation, close coordination and contact between the\n            donors, including the Bank and the Government are important.\n            It is necessary for the government to come up with measures\n            to motivate the staff to be committed to pilot projects.\n            Providing assistance and knowledge transfer by international\n            and national consultants to the project management unit\n            (PMU) as well as the ministry of finance (MOF) leadership\n            giving to the PMU strong and timely guidance, support and\n            directions will empower it to make timely procurement\n            decisions. Bank team received important constructive and\n            innovative advice and clearance from regional procurement\n            management (RPM) for the design of project procurement\n            arrangements and subsequent bidding process for treasury and\n            budget management information system (TABMIS) contract.\n            Strong and sustained commitment of the government leadership\n            is critical to the success of a project. Availability of\n            specialized information technology (IT) expertise within the\n            Bank project team is critically important to assure the\n            quality of design and supervision of the projects that\n            support development of complex IT systems. Continuity of the\n            core team working on the project, both from the Bank side\n            and the government side, is very important for the success\n            of a project. For big system implementation with a turnkey\n            contract like TABMIS, it is necessary to clearly mandate the\n            contractor's responsibility in training and knowledge\n            transfer to government staff to ensure good system operation\n            and administration well before the contract ends and help\n            the government to own and master the system right after\n            taking over from the contractor."}, "docdt": "2014-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
