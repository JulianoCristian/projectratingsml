               PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REFORM PROJECT


                                 RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A.      SUMMARY

1.       This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Regional Vice President to extend the
closing date of the Financing Agreement (FA) for the Vietnam Public Financial Management
Reform Project (PFMRP: Project Identification No. P075399, Credit Numbers 3767-VN and
4863-VN) from February 28, 2013 to October 31, 2013. The proposed extension is necessary to
ensure successful hand-over of the Treasury and Budget Management Information System
(TABMIS) from the contractor to the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and to complete the remaining
critical activities. The project’s closing date was first extended in 2009 for two years, and later
extended in 2011 for another two years in conjunction with the Additional Financing.

2.       This Project Paper also seeks the approval of the Country Director to amend the FA to
reallocate the proceeds among the expenditure categories. The adjustment is necessary to align
project activities to changing circumstances.

B.      PROJECT STATUS AND RATIONALE FOR RESTRUCTURING

B.1.    Project Background

3.      The subject project was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on May 22, 2003,
and became effective on September 4, 2003. The Project aims to strengthen the government’s
capacity to plan, execute and report on its budget and to improve the transparency and
accountability of the budgetary systems and processes. The project includes major investments to
upgrade the core systems of public financial management (funded by IDA credit), and Technical
Assistance to support institutional reforms, policy formulation, and capacity building (partly
funded by DFID co-financing). Total cost of the project is US$96 million, out of which US$75
million is IDA credits, US$11 million is DFID grant, and US$10 million is counterpart
contribution.

4.      On January 31, 2013, the Government of Vietnam proposed to restructure the project
including (i) extending the closing date from February 28, 2013 to October 31, 2013; (ii) revising
project activities and their associated output indicators; and (iii) reallocating proceeds across
different categories. The proposed adjustments do not involve any changes to the project
development objectives and key performance indicators.

B.2.    Status of Implementation

5.      The project is already making a significant difference in the way the budget is prepared,
executed, monitored and reported in Vietnam. Specifically, the project will: (i) enable the
government to plan, execute and monitor the state budget through a centralized financial
management information system, on a transparent and real-time basis; (ii) assist to strengthen the
links between budget management and government's goals within a medium-term expenditure
framework; and (iii) significantly improve the management of public debt and other fiscal risks.
The project is making progress to meet its development objectives as discussed below.
6.      Component 1 (Strengthening treasury and budget management): Five out of six stages
of TABMIS implementation (design, development, testing, piloting, and roll-out) have been
completed. TABMIS is now operational in all intended 1,500 treasuries and financial agencies
across all 63 provinces, and 37 spending ministerial organizations. The last critical but still
ongoing stage is to stabilize TABMIS operation and ensure smooth handover from the contractor
to the MoF. These require (i) strengthening in-house capacity to be able to take over TABMIS;
(ii) addressing remaining software issues to stabilize the operation; and (ii) fully activating
several system functions, which were pending due to lack of legal framework.

7.       Component 2 (Strengthening state budget and investment planning): The medium-term
fiscal framework (MTFF) and the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) have been
successfully piloted in 6 ministries and 4 provinces. The original objective of developing the
methodology to implement the MTEF in Vietnam and testing its feasibility was achieved. There
were plans to (i) mainstream the MTEF in the annual budget process by having it mandated by
the budget law, to amplify the pilot results; and (ii) study the feasibility of a Budget Preparation
System which can also support the MTEF. However due to the time consuming amendment of the
law, the former activity is delayed to 2013 while the latter is proposed to be dropped.

8.      Component 3 (Strengthening the management of public debt and other fiscal risks ):
There has been considerable progress in this component, particularly in relation to the technical
assistance activities (e.g. promulgation of the public debt law and development of debt
management reform plan), and implementation of the DMFAS system for recording and
management of domestic debt. The work to strengthen the monitoring of SOEs fiscal risks has
gathered pace recently, with the finalization of relevant legal framework and gradual
enhancement of risk management and assessment capacity.

9.       Component 4 (Project implementation support): This component remains satisfactory.
Institutional arrangements remain effective (including the Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee,
Component Technical Units, and Project Management Unit organized into specialized teams).
Support of consultants has improved during the period of project implementation.

11.    Disbursement and commitments. As of January 31, 2013, disbursement from IDA, DFID
and counterpart fund was 80 percent, 93 and 66 percent respectively. The project had a
cumulative IDA disbursement of US$59.6 million, with US$11 million disbursed in the last seven
months. There has been a good disbursement progress in the recent years– largely on account of
the steady progress in TABMIS implementation.

12.   Fiduciary Management. There are no overdue or qualified audit reports. Financial
Management and Procurement have been rated Satisfactory and Moderately Satisfactory
respectively. The project procurement performance has notably improved with the signing of a
major Change Order (CO) for the TABMIS contract, an ICB contract for procurement of
additional computers and a dozen of consultants' contracts. Nevertheless, compared to the earlier
agreed Procurement Plan, there have been delays particularly due to the CO, and some contracts
(mostly small consulting services) remain outstanding. Safeguards compliance is not required for
this project.

B.3.      Rationale for Extension of Project’s Closing Date

13.      The proposed extension is essential to ensure successful hand-over of the TABMIS from
the contractor to the MoF and completion of remaining critical activities. The original plan was to
complete the system roll out by the end of 2011, and for the MoF to take another year to
gradually take over the system that has been developed under a turn-key contract. However, the
project experienced delays due to time consuming implementation and procurement involving
large and complex IT system. The nationwide TABMIS roll-out was completed at the end of
2012, thereby delaying progress by nearly a year. The long implementation period is however
within the norm for such IT based PFM projects in Vietnam and other developing countries. The
extension of the project by another eight months will ensure a smooth and efficient handover and
realization of full potential of the TABMIS system.

C.        PROPOSED CHANGES

C.1.      Extension of Closing Date

14.      The closing date of the FA would be extended from February 28, 2013 to October 31,
2013. To justify for the proposed extension, the MoF has updated the Action Plan including the
disbursement schedule during the extension period. Following the detailed discussion with the
Bank team, the MoF has realistically updated the procurement plan for the outstanding contracts
including another CO for the TABMIS contract (Annex 1). While a detailed proposal for this CO
is yet to be submitted by the MoF, it is envisaged that the CO can be processed in parallel to
TABMIS handover activities and therefore would not hamper the project overall progress. The
plans have been reviewed and found acceptable.

15.       Key activities to be completed in the extended periods include:

         Strengthening capacity to fully take over TABMIS and prudently manage the final
          operational acceptance of the system while addressing a number of remaining software
          issues to stabilize TABMIS operation;

         Fully activating a number of critical TABMIS functions (e.g. commitment control and
          cash management);

         Designing TABMIS Portal and developing GFMIS model and roadmap;

         Developing detailed guidelines for nationwide implementation of MTFF and MTEF;

C.2.      Reallocation of Proceeds

16.      It is necessary to adjust the allocation of proceeds to align them with the changes in
project activities.
         For the Original Credit (Cr 3767-VN): TABMIS is delivered under a turn-key contract
          covering both goods and operating costs– it is therefore not possible to split category 2
          and category 3a in each bill. The government wishes to charge the entire contract amount
          to category 2, thereby requesting to reallocate SDR5.74 million from category 3a (which
          was supposed to finance operating costs of the turn-key contract) to category 2.

         For the Additional Credit (Cr 4863-VN): The government requests to reallocate fund
          from category 2 to category 3a and category 4 to fully utilize the remaining fund to meet
          the additional consultancy and training needs in order to fully achieve the objectives of
          the project.
17.       Schedule 2 of the FA should be updated accordingly as follows:
