                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to make progress toward achieving some of its development objectives. MOF management remains committed to successfully complete the project. An
                         Addition Financing (AF) of $14million and a 4-year extension were approved on account of cost overrun; scaled-up the implementation of selected activities; and addition of limited
                         number of new activities. However, to date completing the key project activities by the closing date remains a challenge, as addressing key technical and contractual issues is taking
                         time. Two missions were conducted in 2011 to provide timely implementation support for the project.

                         For component 1 (strengthening Treasury and Budget Management), significant implementation progress of the Treasury and Budget Management Information System (TABMIS)
                         has been made with roll out completed in another 16 provinces since January 2011. By end of February 2012, TABMIS was operational in the treasury and finance offices at the
                         central level, and at the provincial and district levels of 46 of 63 provinces-- including Hanoi. There were also improvements in system response time and increased awareness of

                         MOF to take strong ownership on system administration and monitoring. A dedicated core team of IT specialists has been created to take over the system administration role.
                         Additional advisory support is being engaged to help in rapid resolution of critical technical and contractual issues. Additional 4,200 Oracle EBS software licenses were purchased.
                         However, there is still an urgent need to resolve a number of critical issues: (i) timely purchase of additional hardware to ensure successful nationwide rollout by project end
                         (notwithstanding the technical difficulties in server sizing); (ii) timely resolution of a number of issues regarding the standard Oracle's software platform to improve system
                         performance and capability; (iii) staffing and capacity of MOF to fully take-over the administration role after completion of the rollout; and (iv) completion of the important work toward
                         the government’s longer term vision of Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) (including preparatory activities for the Budget Preparation System, the
                         GFMIS Web Portal, and expansion of Budget Allocation Module). Attention from MOF leadership to timely resolve these critical issues is an imperative.

                         For component 2 (strengthening State Budget and Investment Planning), the medium-term fiscal and expenditure frameworks have been successfully piloted in 6 ministries and 4
                         provinces. Further work under the the AF include (i) preparing for the institutionalization of the MTFF and MTEF into relevant law and mainstreaming them into the annual budget
                         process; and (ii) completing a feasibility study on a Budget Preparation System which among other things can support the preparation of MTEF. However due to more time
                         consuming preparation of the new budget law, both these actions have been delayed to take account of some of the critical changes expected by the law. Related activities were
                         therefore not initiated in 2011 but planned for 2012.

                         For component 3 (strengthening Management of Public Debt and Monitoring of SOE Fiscal Risks), the implementation of the domestic debt recording system (DMFAS) has started
                         following the finalization of related contracts. The public debt strategy to 2020 was submitted to the government, taking into consideration the contingent liabilities from State-Owned
                         Enterprises. MOF is keen to enhance monitoring fiscal risks from the SOEs, and is formulating a comprehensive set of monitoring indicators. In general, envisioned activities are on
                         track.

                         For component 4 (Project Management Support), overall project management remains satisfactory. MOF has been rationalizing internal procurement procedures toward better
                         harmonization with Bank guidelines. The procurement plan has been frequently updated and rationalized to ensure a timely completion of ongoing activities and a successful
                         implementation of the additional activities.
