                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to make progress toward achieving its development objectives, under strong leadership and full commitment of the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The project has
                         been long, complex and at times very challenging. At this stage, the project is largely completed and ready to be wrapped up. The project, and Treasury and Budget Management
                         Information System (TABMIS) in particular, is already realizing commendable benefits for the government during challenging budget times thanks to improved accuracy, timeliness,
                         and transparency in budget execution and reporting at each level of government. Experience from the pilot Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) and Medium-Term Expenditure

                         Framework (MTEF) has resulted in valuable lessons towards improving budget planning in Vietnam particularly to inform the ongoing amendments of the State Budget Law. The
                         implementation of the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS) and a number of other Technical Assistance activities have steadily helped the government to
                         strengthen the institutional arrangements, systems, and capacity for the management of public debt and the monitoring of fiscal risks from the State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). The
                         envisaged outcomes and intermediate outputs of the project have largely been achieved. The operation remains to be highly relevant to the country’s current development priorities,

                         and the project development outcomes will very likely be maintained.

                         However, with only a few weeks away from the project closing date, there are still a number of ongoing consultancy activities across the components, which requires acceleration of
                         progress while ensuring good quality of the work supported by the project.
