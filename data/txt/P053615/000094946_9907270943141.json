performance\n            and outcome were satisfactory as the major objectives of the\n            loan were achieved and assessed to be sustainable. Main\n            lessons learned were: The capability of the Borrower to\n            understand, contribute to, and commit to a comprehensive\n            reform program is a prerequisite. The Bank should maintain,\n            or have access to, a capacity to more effectively track\n            developments in financial sectors of countries that are near\n            graduation, or have graduated; the crisis took the World\n            Bank by surprise because the Bank was not carrying out\n            economic and sector work in Thailand, and did not analyze\n            the underlying financial framework nor verify the accuracy\n            of financial information. A single tranche policy-based\n            operation--such as this project--with the bulk of policy\n            actions clearly laid out in a precise timetable prior to\n            Board approval, is a focused and flexible approach to\n            provide support for structural reforms in a rapidly changing\n            situation. It is important to a recovery operation with\n            multiple financiers to agree on the best course of action\n            which includes an appropriate division of responsibility. In\n            emergency situations, the Bank should relax labor-intensive\n            activities so that expertise may be freed for more\n            substantive analysis and creative solutions, and should\n            shorten the procurement process. Sustained technical\n            assistance is needed to implement loan conditions and to\n            supplement Bank staff resources, and to help establish\n            strong relationships with governments."}, "docdt": "1999-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
