       Thailand's record o f economic growth duringmuch o f the last quarter o fthe 20th
century was very strong. Poverty declined significantly and overall welfare improved
markedly. But in 1997, after more than a decade o f exceptionally strong economic growth,
Thailand experienced a major macroeconomic and financial crisis, which spread rapidly to
neighboring countries. Inspite o f assistance from the international financial institutions (IFI)
and a wide-ranging reform program, the Thai economy didnot beginto recover for some
year and a half after the crisis. The number o fpeople living inpovertyjumped dramatically
following the crisis, from 6.8 millionpeople in 1996to 9.8 millionin 1999. The last several
years have witnessedrobust growth o f over 6 percent per annum in2003 and 2004, which
has helpedto reducepoverty rates to their pre-crisis level, although the average per capita
income in2004 was still below its pre-crisis level. With the exception o f Indonesia,
Thailand's recovery has been slower than most other countries that suffered a crisis inthe
1990s.

       The country has madeprogress ina numbero fkey areas, includingsupervision o f
financial institutions, corporate governance and disclosure, and development o fthe bond
market. Nevertheless, considerable challenges remain, inthe financial, corporate, and legal
regimes. And some early actions, under advice from external agencies, which with the benefit
o fhindsightcould have been avoided, may have deepened the crisis and affected the
subsequent response. The attached report summarizes what happened and the outcomes inthe
reform areas supportedby three Bank loans, comprising lessons o f experience.

    The main findings for stronger results from the review o f these loans are:

    0   The significant cost o f cleaningup financial crises can offset the progress made over
        many years inpoverty alleviation and other social improvements, both o fwhich are
        central to the Bank's mandate. Giventhis, the Bank must continue to play a role in
        client countries inboth improving financial sector governance and soundness to
       reduce the probability o f crisis and inpost-crisis management and well-structured
        recovery.

    0   The severity o fthe crisis was initiallyunderestimatedbythe Bank and others, as was
        thenegative impact on the economy o fthe large scale closure o fthe finance
        companies (FCs) inthe early phase o f the reforms. Early underestimates o f the
        severity o fthe crisis and the impact o f the closure o f the FCson the economy raised
        concerns about the credibility o fthe International Financial Institutions' approach
        and, most important to Thailand's future, about the financial reform itself. This
        suggests that crises inother countries needto be approachedmore comprehensively,
        taking into account potential negative impacts o f large scale closures.

0 Short-term crisis managementpolicies can compromise essential structural reforms.
 The failure to factor into the design ofthe reforms the inadequacieso fthe Thai legal
  andregulatory infrastructure ledto approachesthat may have increasedthe cost o f
  cleanup. For example, traditional procedures inThailand for corporate restructuring
  were notoriously slow and generally benefitedthe debtor; thus, the corporate
  reorganization proceduresmodeled after the UnitedStates (Chapter 11style) were ill-
  suitedto the situation andmay have servedto worsen it (longer-delays, reduced
  restructuring). A better approachwould havebeento simplifyliquidation
  procedures, involving the stakeholdersand abankruptcy administrator, rather than the
  court system.

0 The sequencing and timing o freforms are crucial. Too little early emphasis was
  placed on reforming bankruptcy and foreclosure laws, developing a deposit
  insurance scheme, and fostering development o f capital andmoney markets. The
  government that came to powerjust after the crisis emerged was reform-minded,
  butthe adversemacro-economic impact ofthe earlypolicy changes gave reform
  an unfavorable image inThailand.

0 The allocation o fpieces o fthe reform package amongthe three International
  Financial Institutionsmay have made sense, but only ifit hadbeen followed by
  better coordination. As it turned out, the division ledto an absence o f a clear
  guidingvision for the reform o fthe financial system. Thus, for example,
  commercial bankrestructuring was carried out very differently from finance
  company restructuring, even whenthey suffered from the same problems. In
  addition, the division o f labor broke down, as the Bank fairly quickly became
  involved inFIrestructuring and capital market development.

0 Succeedingloans with increasingly broader goals and a growing list o f conditions
  diffusedthe focus o freform andmeaningful monitoring. A better approach might
  have beena well-designedprogrammatic one now used (but not available at that
  time), which seeks to develop a set ofpriorityreforms and sequencesthe steps for
  supporting those reforms through successiveloans.

   IEG Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report
      The IndependentEvaluationGroup assesses the programsand activitiesof theWorld Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank'sself-evaluationprocess and to verify thatthe Bank's work is producingthe
expected results, and second, to helpdevelop improveddirections,policies, and procedures throughthe
disseminationof lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGannually assesses about25 percent of the
Bank's lendingoperations. Inselectingoperations for assessment, preferenceis givento those that are innovative,
large, or complex;those that are relevant to upcomingstudies or countryevaluations; thosefor which Executive
Directorsor Bank management haverequested assessments; and those that are likelyto generateimportant lessons.
The projects, topics, and analyticalapproaches selectedfor assessment support larger evaluationstudies.
       A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is based on a reviewof the ImplementationCompletion
Report(a self-evaluation by the responsibleBank department)and fieldwork conducted by IEG.To prepare
PPARs, IEGstaff examine projectfiles and other documents, interviewoperational staff, and in most cases visit
the borrowing country for onsite discussionswith projectstaff and beneficiaries.The PPARtherebyseeks to
validate and augment the informationprovided in the ICR, as well as examine issuesof special interestto broader
IEGstudies.
       Each PPAR is subject to a peer review processand IEG managementapproval. Once cleared internally,the
PPAR is reviewed by the responsibleBank department and amended as necessary.The completedPPARis then
sent to the borrowerfor review;the borrowers'comments are attached to the documentthat is sent to the Bank's
Boardof Executive Directors.After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System
       The time-tested evaluationmethods used by IEGare suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work. The
methodsoffer both rigor and a necessary levelof flexibilityto adapt to lending instrument, projectdesign, or
sectoralapproach. IEG evaluators all applythe same basic methodto arrive at their project ratings. Following is
the definitionand ratingscale used for each evaluationcriterion (more informationis availableon the IEGwebsite:
http://worldbank.org/IEG/eta-mainpage.html).
       Relevance of Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistentwith the country's
current developmentprioritiesand with current Bank country and sectoral assistancestrategies and corporate
goals (expressedin Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, CountryAssistanceStrategies,Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectiveswere achieved, or expectedto be achieved,taking into
accounttheir relative importance.Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved, or is expectedto achieve, a return higherthan the
opportunity cost of capitaland benefits at least cost comparedto alternatives.Possibleratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible.This rating is not generally applied to adjustmentoperations.
       Sustainability: The resilienceto risk of net benefitsflows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
 Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
       lnstitutional DevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improvesthe ability of a country or region
to make more efficient, equitableand sustainable use of its human,financial, and natural resourcesthrough: (a)
 better definition,stability,transparency, enforceability,and predictabilityof institutionalarrangements and/or (b)
 better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organizationwith its mandate,which derives from these
 institutionalarrangements. InstitutionalDevelopment Impact includes both intendedand unintendedeffects of a
 project. Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
        Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectiveswere achieved,or are expectedto be
achieved, efficiently.Possibleratings: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory,Moderately
 Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured qualityat entry and
supported implementationthrough appropriate supervision(includingensuring adequatetransitionarrangements
for regularoperationof the project). Possibleratings: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
 Unsatisfactory.
       Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrowerassumed ownership and responsibilityto ensure
 qualityof preparationand implementation,and compliedwith covenantsand agreements,towards the
 achievementof developmentobjectivesand sustainability.Possible ratings: HighlySatisfactory, Satisfactory,

and FinanciaZAdjustment Loan (EFAL) for US$400 million equivalent; and Second
Economic and Financial Adjustment Loan (EFAL 11)US$600millionequivalent. This
report is based on the President's Reports for the projects, legal documents, project files,
relatedto economic and sector work, and implementation completion reports (ICRs) for
the projects (prepared by the East Asia andPacific Region). Inaddition, discussions with
Thai officials, other donors, other stakeholders, andWorld Bank Group staffwere
valuable inputsto the report. This report examines information for the period 1997
through 2003 or 2004, dependingon data availability, to arrive at an assessment o fthe
outcomes of these operations.

        An Independent EvaluationGroup (IEG) missionvisited Thailandin2004 to
discuss the effectiveness o fBank assistancewith governmentofficials, donors and other
stakeholders. Their cooperation and assistanceinpreparing this report i s gratehlly
acknowledged.

Summary

1.       Attached i s the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) on three loans to
the Kingdom of Thailand: Finance Companies Restructuring Loan (FCRL) for US$350
million; Economic and Financial Adjustment Loan I(EFAL I)          for US$400 million; and
Second Economic and Financial Adjustment Loan II(EFAL 11) for US$600 million.
FCRLwas approvedinDecember 1997, EFALIinJuly 1998, and EFALI1inMarch
1999 andwere all single tranche operations. A fourth loan, Financial Sector
Implementation Assistance, was under implementation at the time this PPARwas
planned. These loans constituted part o fa coordinated effort, along with the International
Monetary Fund(IMF) andAsian Development Bank (ADB), to help stabilize the Thai
economy after the financial markets crisis o f 1997. The Bank assumedprimary
responsibility for actions related to Finance Companies (FCs) andhelpingto improve the
regulatory and supervisory framework.

2.       The objectives o f all three loans were related to long-term processes, andwere
therefore similar. The loans sought to support: (i)   fiscal and macroeconomic stability;
(ii) suspensionandclosureanddisposalofFCassets;(iii)
     FC                                                           treatment of depositors and
creditors; (iv) restructuring and recapitalizationof core financial institutions (FIs);
(v) restructuring ofcorporations; (vi) improvingcorporate governance and disclosure;
(vii) strengthening the supervision andregulatory environment; and(viii) developing the
bond market. EFALIplaced a greater emphasis on corporate restructuring, while EFAL
I1initiatedthe reforms inthe government bondmarket.

Context

3.       After more thanadecade o fexceptionally strong economic growth, Thailand
experienced a major macroeconomic and financial crisis, which spreadrapidly to
neighboring countries. Inspite o f assistance from the international financial community
and the implementationo fmany reforms, it took well over a year after the onset o fthe
crisis before the Thai economybeganto recover. In2003 and 2004, strong growth rates
of over 6 percent per year havehelpedto reduce poverty rates to their pre-crisis level,
although the 2004 per capita income was still below its pre-crisis level. With the
exceptionof Indonesia, Thailand's recovery has beenslower than most other countries
that suffered a crisis inthe 1990s.

4.       While there has been substantial progress inthe corporate and financial sectors in
 a number o f dimensions, large challenges still remain inthese areas. This report
 summarizes outcomes inthe reform areas supportedby three Bank loans.

Fiscal Policy and Macroeconomic Stability

 5.      While the Government o f Thailand (GOT) was able to tighten fiscal policy in
 1997 inresponseto conditionality on achieving afiscal surplus for that year, it was
 initially unable to fully meet the subsequent targets which reversed direction andcalled
 forfiscal deficits under EFALIand 11. Considerable debate exists over whether the fiscal
 targets set inthe early phaseso fthe crisis were appropriate, inboth an ex ante sense,

                                               X



given what was known and anticipated at the time interms o f the magnitude o f the crisis,
and ex post, interms o fwhether the early stringent fiscal target helpedor hindered
economic recovery. On balance, IEGholds the view that the impact o fthe fiscal stance
in1997andearly 1998mayhave contributedto sluggisheconomic recoveryinthe
aftermath o f the crisis; the cumulative fall inGDP was higherinThailand than inother
crisis-affected countries (except for Indonesia) and GDP growth inThailand took longer
to rebound thaninthese other crisis affected countries. Although the Bank was not the
lead agency insetting fiscal targets nor were the targets a major focus o fthe loans,
conditionality under all three loans adopted the fiscal targets set bythe IMF, andthus the
three Bank loans under reviewhere are associated with these macroeconomic outcomes.

Finance Companies suspension and closure

6.      Prior to the July 1997 depreciation o fthe baht, the Thai authorities had suspended
16 FCs, and inAugust 1997, the Bank o f Thailand (BOT) suspendedanother 42 FCs
(almost the entire FC sub-sector), and later closed these 56 FCs. The closure o fthe 56
FCs, which represented at the time some 14percent o f assets o fthe financial sector, had
considerable impact on the economy: even healthy companies were unable to access
financial services, and this added strainto an already fragile corporate sector. The impact
of the closed FCs spilledover to unsuspended financial institutions boththrough the
corporate sector andthrough the direct equity claims of other financial institutions inthe
FCs, and added downward pressure on an already contracting economy. Rather than
closure o fthe FCs, establishing a bridgebank very early on mighthave been more
effective inisolating insolvent FCs from healthy ones; the performing assets o fthe FCs
could thenhave been serviced by the bridge bank, andperforming debtors would have
continued to have access to additional credit and other financial services. A bridge bank
was eventually established inThailand, but came too late: the good assets o f the
intervened financial institutions hadturnedbad and the bridge bank was no longer useful.
The outcome o fthe FC suspension andclosure i s therefore considered unsatisfactory.

Disposal of Finance Companies assets

7.       By contrast, giventhe decisions on closing the FCs, the disposal o fFC assetswas
carried out by the responsible Thai agency (the FRA) as well as possible underthe
circumstances. The magnitude o f the task was huge, as some 869 billion baht (about
US$25 billion, dependingon the exchange rate used) were transferred to the FRAYthe
quality o fthe assets was poor, and the economic situation inthe country andthe region
was dismal, with neighboring countries also trying to dispose o f financial sector assets.
Given these factors as well as other constraints, the fact that the FRA was able to dispose
of some 86 percent o f assets by end 2000, at an average recovery rate o f 35.3 percent o f
face value, through open and fair actions i s highly commendable. Nevertheless, one
unanticipatedoutcome o fthe process was a strongly negative perception o f it bythe
public once it learned that most o fthe successful bidders on these assetswere foreigners,
many o f whom were suspected o f flipping the loansback to the original borrowers at
 substantial profit. Many o fthose interviewed by IEGnoted that the public reaction to the
 asset disposal affected the momentum o fthe reform program and made reform-minded
leaders reluctant to pursue a similar approach to corporate restructuring. Taking into
 account the satisfactory achievement o fthe basic objective o f asset disposal but the

                                               x i


unanticipatednegative public perception, IEGrates the outcome o f the disposal of FC
assets as moderately satisfactory.

Treatment of creditors and depositors

8.      Theblanket creditor and deposit guaranteesmayhavebeenneededearly inthe
crisis to stabilize the system, andmay have beenpolitically expedient,but it was, and
remains, detrimental to long-term structural reform; it is also contrary to well-
disseminatedBank guidance for deposit insurance. Incontrast to the IMF's advice andto
the Bank's subsequent efforts to supporta limiteddeposit insurance system, the blanket
guarantees were not temporary; the creditor guarantee was phased out only inNovember
2003, and the blanketdeposit guarantee remainedinplace evenlonger, for at least seven
years after the crisis. Theoutcome of this aspect is considered highly unsatisfactory.

Restructuring and Recapitalization of CoreFinancial Institutions (FIs)

9.      The Thai authorities intervenedinsix commercial banks(accounting for some 24
percent oftotal loans inthe financial sector), and subsequently merged a number o f
closedFCs and an FIinto a state owned bank. As o f 2004, three FIs, including one
which the government agreed to privatize under EFALI1bymid-2001,were still state
owned. EFALI1also supported the recapitalizationo fseveral intervenedFIs, which
occurredmainlythrough the transfer o fnon-performing loans, rather thanthrough an
increase inequity, andthe recapitalized state owned banks continue to be characterized
bypolitical interference, allegations o fcorruption, management turnover, andinadequate
business plans. The outcome o fthe recapitalization andrestructuring o f the core FIs is
rated as unsatisfactory.

Strengthening Supervision and Regulatory Environment

10.     The outcomes on improving supervisionandprudential regulationhavebeen
good, although the modernization, even some seven years after the crisis, has not been
complete and delays have been long. Nevertheless, newprovisioning guidelines are in
place (although BOT engaged inforbearance, at least through 2002), the BOT has better
legal authority for intervening, licensing standards havebeen improved, the BOT has
upgraded their skillbase, and on-site examinations occur regularly. Outcomes under this
component are considered satisfactory.

CorporateRestructuring

11.     Progress incorporate restructuring has been slow and incomplete. BothEFALI
and EFALI1contained conditions pertainingto this component, but the GOT met fierce
resistance inParliament to proposedbankruptcy and foreclosure reforms. Progress on
these reforms remains unsatisfactory, with the result that the framework for bankruptcy
andother aspectso fcorporate restructuringremains weak. Theprocess o frestructuring
corporations has relied on voluntary, out o f court procedures, andhas focused on
financial reliefthrough restructuring debts through an extension o f the maturity,
extension o fthe grace period, or reduction of the interest rate. Inaddition, there has been
little operational restructuring, and a significant portion o f these restructuringshave been
unsuccessful: in2002, for example, about 30 percent of the debt restructuredrevertedto

                                             xii


nonperforming status within a few months and by the first half o f 2003, two-thirds o fthe
corporate loans restructured byprivate banks hadrevertedto non-performing loan (NPL)
status. Finally, the process was far from complete some six years after the onset o fthe
crisis. Bymid-2003, only 48 percent o f corporate debt cases hadbeen restructured in
out-of-court programs (compared to 95 percent inKorea, 77 percent inMalaysia, and 56
percent inIndonesiaby mid-2003). Overall, the outcome of corporate restructuring is
considered moderately unsatisfactory.

Improving Corporate Governance and Disclosure

12.     The improvements incorporate governance and disclosure are demonstrable and
recognizedby international surveys, which show progress instandards o f companies
listed on the Thai stock exchange, andfavorable comparisono fcorporate governance
practices inThailand with some neighboring countries. New accounting standards have
been introduced andimplemented, and although further improvements are still needed to
improve oversight o f the accounting practices, and enhance oversight o f corporate
directors, the outcome of this component is considered satisfactory.

Developing the Bond Market

13.     The improved infiastructure andorganization o f the government bondmarket are
impressive. The BOT succeeded indeveloping a yield curve for government bonds with
a maturity range form less than a year to fifteen years andmade improvements to the
regulatory framework. It also introduced an efficient clearing and settlement system.
Over time this may contribute to the development o f a robust corporate bondmarket,
although to date the contribution to the raising of capitalbythe private sector is not
evident. Nevertheless, the outcome of this component is considered highly satisfactory.

Rating the Loans: FCRL

14.     Although the disposal o f FC assets was a primary focus o fthe FCRL, which this
assessment finds to have had a moderately satisfactory outcome, the FCRL was also
predicated on the suspension and closure o fthe FCs, which had a negative impact on the
economy, and an unsatisfactoryoutcome. Inaddition, the FCRL explicitly supported the
fiscal surplus, which may have contributed to the economic contraction. The remaining
components o f the FCRL had more mixed outcomes: improving supervision and
prudential regulation (moderately satisfactory underthis loanbecause o f forbearance by
BOT) and amendments to the bankruptcy law (not done). Finally, although developing a
strategy for phasing out the blanket guarantee was discussed inFCRL and included ina
matrix o f conditions, no specific agreement was sought to take any actions and the
blanketguarantee for bothdepositors and creditors continued. Onbalance, the outcome
of the FCRL is considered moderately unsatisfactory.

 15.    The concept o fsustainability is difficult to apply to the FCRL, mainly because
mucho fthe focus o f the loan was on short-term emergency measures, such as the closure
of FCs, which had a detrimental impact on the economy (and therefore the concept o f
sustainability does not apply) and disposal o fFC assets, which was camed out well, but
whose benefits are not easily thought o f interms o fresilience to risk (the definition o f

                                             xiii


sustainability). While the improvements to supervision andprudentialregulationbegun
under the loan are consideredsustainable, the blanket guarantees for creditors, which
lasted for six years (untilNovember 2003), and for depositors are detrimentalto the
development ofprudent financial intermediation, and thus work against sustainability.
Given all these considerations, IEGhas not ratedthe sustainability of FCRL.

16.      Interms ofthe institutionaldevelopment impact (IDI)ofFCRL, the closing and
disposing o f assets o f FC involved the acquisition o f expertise by Thai professionals
associated with the process, and thus may have put the country inabetterposition to deal
with another crisis should one occur inthe near future; inthis sense, ID1was substantial.
O n the other hand, an unintendedimpact o f the FC process was the public perception o f
the process, which was so negative that it detracted from public support o f the longer-
term reform agenda. While the strengthening o fbanking supervision andprudential
regulatory policies has beensubstantial, the failure to address the blanket guarantee o f
creditors and depositors was detrimental to longer term institutional development. Given
these quite different impacts on institutions under the FCRL, ID1is considered modest.

17.      Bankperformance is mixed under FCRL. The Bank supported two policies -
fiscal tightening, and suspension and closure o f the FCs, which mayhave contributed to
the contraction o fthe economy and exacerbated the crisis. Although the Bank played a
supporting, rather than a leading, role inthese policy decisions, the FCRLprovided
reinforcement for them. Onthe suspension and closure o fthe FCs, these decisions were
technically made bythe Thai authorities before this loanwas approved,but they were
part o fa larger program for restructuringthe financial sector which the Bank supported
prior to going forward with the first adjustment loan. Duringthe formulation o fthis
restructuring program, inthe immediate aftermath o fthe onset o fthe crisis, the Bank
provided technical assistanceto the authorities andparticipatedinIMF missions that also
provided assistanceto the authorities to articulate the restructuringprogram, which
included dealing with the FCs. Evenifthe Bank didnot take the lead inthe discussions,
andeven ifthere were Bank staffwho disagreed withthe approach, much o fthe focus o f
the FCRLwas on implementingthe fundamental decision to close the FCs, so the loan
was implicitly fully supportive o fthe decision. Inthis aspect, Bank performance is
considered unsatisfactory. By contrast, Bank performance i s considered satisfactory in
its support for the disposal o fFC assets. Onbalance, Bankperformance under FCRL is
considered unsatisfactory.

 18.     Thai authorities and agencies did a goodjob o f implementingthe policies agreed
with the Bank, closing the FCs and, inparticular, disposingofFC assets under difficult
circumstances; the agency involved hired appropriate consultants, and carried out its
difficult mandate as efficiently as possible; their performance on this aspect i s considered
highlysatisfactory. Against this shouldbe set Borrower performanceon creditor and
depositor guarantees, considered highlyunsatisfactory. While the authorities made
progress on strengtheningprudentialregulations, considerable BOT forbearance meant
that there was little enforcement o fthe new standards. On balance, however, Borrower
performance under FCRL is considered satisfactory.

Rating theLoans: EFAL I

19.     Thepolicy objectives of EFAL Iwas better designedthan under FCRL, but
achievement o f the objectives was mixed, with significant weaknesses. EFALI
incorporated a change inthe direction o f fiscal policy, from a surplus target underFCRL
to a fiscal deficit target, but the Government was unable to increase expenditures enough
to reach the deficit (the actual fiscal deficit for FY98 was lower thanthe target). To deal
with the FCs, it includedthe establishment o fthe bridgebankto manage the assets o fthe
FCs, although it was too late inthe process o fFC closure to be useful. Itplaced greater
emphasis on starting the process o frestructuringcore FIs (notjust the FCs), which was
begunbut not carried out satisfactorily, and o fdefiningthe longer term strategy for the
FIs, whichwas done. ButEFALIdidnot successfully address the blanketguarantee on
depositors and creditors, which remainedin effect. EFALIcontinued the process o f
strengthening FIsupervision andregulation, although BOT forbearance continued;
focused on establishing the framework for bankruptcy and strengtheningother
commercial legislation, whose progress has been limited; and focused improving
corporate governance and disclosure practices, whose outcome is considered satisfactory.
Onbalance, the outcomeof EFAL Iis consideredmoderately unsatisfactory.

20.     The sustainability of the benefits achieved under EFAL Iis considered likely.
Although some o fthe benefits under EFALI, as the start o f FIrestructuring, may
                                                  such
not be resilient to risks, most other benefits achieved under the loan are considered
sustainable. These include continued progress on strengtheningprudential regulation and
supervision, and improvements incorporate governance anddisclosure, where external
pressures involvinginternational reviewsof standards and codes andprivate sector
surveys o fthe business climate and accounting standards are likely to sustain the
momentumto work toward international standards.

21.     On institutional development, the impact in some areas supported by EFALIwas
substantial - strengthened FIprudential regulation, for example, as well as improvements
to corporate governance and disclosure. Incorporate restructuring, although progress
achievedwas not as rapid or as substantial as hoped, the emphasis on civil court
procedures and the development o f a specialized bankruptcy court should leadto an
improved process andbetter performance over time. Inother significant areas, however,
such as restructuringFIs, and continuedBOT forbearance inenforcing the strengthened
prudential regulations, ID1is considered modest, andthis i s the overall rating under
EFALI.

22.     Bankperformance is considered satisfactory under EFAL I. EFALIplaced
greater emphasis on restructuringthe whole financial sector, inspite o f the earlier
agreement on the division o f responsibilities amongthe international financial institutions
(IFI),and focused onlonger term issues for the sector, allofwhichwere appropriate. It
also focused on the critical area o f corporate restructuring andreforms, andprovided
substantial technical assistance inthis area to help the Government deal with corporate
restructuring. The Bank thus addressed importantweaknesses inthe overall environment
for effective financial intermediation and took a pro-active approach to implementing the
broader set o freforms.

23.     Incontrast, Borrowerperformance is rated unsatisfactory underEFALI.
Although the Borrower continued satisfactory disposal o fFC assets and it strengthened
its regulation and supervisiono f FIs, it didnot enforce the stricter prudentialregulations,
andit allowed the blanket guaranteeto persist. Itcarriedout reforms inthe framework
for corporate governance, but its performance on restructuringand recapitalization o fFIs
and on restructuring corporations i s considered weak, and progress with the corporate
bankruptcy law was unsatisfactory, due inpart to stiffresistance from Parliament.

Rating theLoans: EFAL 11

24.     The objectives of EFALI1appropriately shiftedthe emphasis for the treatment of
depositors to developing a deposit insurance scheme with limitedprotection; it also
appropriately included for the first time the development o f the government bond market.
Although there was some progress toward puttinginplace the limiteddeposit insurance
scheme, which was to have occurred by end-1998, it was not completed at the time o f this
writing. The outcome o fthe development o fthe government bond marketis considered
to havebeenhighly satisfactory. As notedinparagraph 8, bankingsupervision continued
to be strengthened andthe outcome o fthis component i s considered satisfactory. The
other objectives which receivedparticular emphasis under EFAL I1were achieved to a
muchmore limited extent, insome cases with significant shortcomings; these include
core FIrestructuring, strengthening the legal framework for corporate restructuring, and
improvingprogress on corporate restructuring, as discussed inparagraphs 7 and 9. As a
result, the outcome of EFAL 11is considered moderately unsatisfactory.

25.      EFAL 11receives a sustainability rating of likely, because the benefits such as
strengthened supervision andregulation andimproved corporate governance and
disclosure are likely to be resilient to risks for reasons noted inparagraph 18. Although
one aspect, FIrestructuring, i s not considered sustainable, the sustainability o f the
development o f the bond market i s considered highly likely, as the probability i s highthat
the benefits will continue to grow undermost economic scenarios.

26.      IDIfor EFAL 11is rated as substantial,becauseinaddition to the factors
mentioned inparagraph 19 under EFAL I, development o fthe government bond
                                              the
marketrepresents a significant contributionto the institutional developmento fthe
financial sector. It permits the establishment of a benchmark yield curve, a crucial
element for hrther capital market development. These achievements will facilitate the
development o fthe corporate bondmarket, trading inderivative instruments andmore
efficient pricing of equities. Thus the institutional contribution o f EFAL I1to capital
market development i s considered high.

27.      Bankperformance is rated satisfactory. As inthe case o f EFALI, design o f
                                                                              the
EFALI1was appropriately focused onbroader andlonger-termissues thanwas the case
underFCRL. EFALI1design also added an objective of capital marketdevelopment,
which was highlyrelevant to longer term financial market development and stability.
The Bank worked effectively with government and relevant private sector entities to
develop an sound plan for corporate governance and disclosure. And althoughthe
division o fresponsibilities following the crisis allocated capital market development to

                                              xvi


the Asian Development Bank, the Bank took the leadunderEFALI1ina first step inthis
process o f supporting improvementsto the government bondmarket.

28.    Borrower pe$ormance under EFAL11is rated, on balance, unsatisfactory.
Althoughperformancewas strongincertainkeyobjectives ofEFAL11,itwas weak in
others. Onthe positive side, the Borrower's performance was highlysatisfactory with
respect to improvements incorporate governance anddisclosure anddevelopment o fthe
government bondmarket. On the negativeside, however, while it maybe argued that the
blanketcreditor anddepositor guaranteeinitiallyputinplacewas thejoint responsibilityo f
the IF1andThai authorities, the failure over a sustainedperiodo ftime to phase out the
deposit guarantee andreplace itwith a limiteddeposit insurance program, supported under
EFAL11,was theresponsibility of the government. Inaddition, there was considerable
political oppositionto legislative proposals that would have servedto strengthen the legal
andinstitutionalinfrastructure for corporate restructuring, andasnotedinparagraph 9,some
ofthe legislativeproposals have servedto weaken the framework for bankruptcy andother
aspectso fcorporate restructuring, andthere hasbeen insufficientprogress onbothcorporate
restructuring andFIrestructuring andstrengthening.

Summary of diferent performance ratings under the loans

29.     At the timethe first o fthesethree loans, the FCRL, was approved, the Bank
supported policies (fiscal tighteningandclosure o f FCs) which may have contributed to a
deepening and prolongationofthe crisis. Inaddition, partlyas a result o f the agreement
with the other F I s onthe division o flabor, the FCRL focused mainly onthe FCs andto a
more limitedextent on larger sectoral issues, such as developing a limited deposit
insurance scheme, stronger financial sector supervision; corporate restructuring;
corporate governance. By contrast, insubsequent loans, the Bank appropriately
broadened its approach to focus more on these areas andto support relevant reforms.
Primarilyfor thesereasons, Bankperformanceis consideredunsatisfactory under the first
loan andsatisfactory under the subsequent EFAL Iand11.

30.     The Thai authorities did a goodjob of implementingmost ofthe policies agreed
under the FCRL, under very difficult conditions. They also made a good start at
undertaking the reforms agreed, such as strengthening prudential requirements and
proposing amendments to the bankruptcy act. For these reasons, IEGrates their
performance as satisfactory under FCRL. Under EFALIand 11, by contrast, progress
was muchslower on boththe reforms (bankruptcy andforeclosure laws, deposit
 insurance, continued forbearance - at least up to 2002 - on implementingprudential
regulations) and on restructuring FIs andcorporations. IEGtherefore rates Borrower
performance unsatisfactory under bothEFALIand EFAL11.

Findings and recommendations

 31.    The main findings from the review o fthese loans are:

    0   The impact financial crises can offset progress made over many years inpoverty
        alleviation and other social improvements, both o fwhich are central to the Bank's
        mandate. Giventhis, the Bank should continue to play a role inclient countries in

                                       xvii


 bothimprovingfinancial sector governance and soundnessto reduce the
  probability o f crisis and inpost-crisis management and well-structured recovery.

  The severity o fthe crisis was initially underestimated bythe Bank and other
  International Financial Institutions (IFIs), as was the negative impact on the
  economy o fthe large scale closure o fthe FCs. This inturncreated problems for
  the credibility o f the IFIs' approach and, most important to Thailand's future,
  about the financial reform itself. This suggests that crises inother countries
  should be approached more comprehensively, taking into account potential
  negative impacts o f large scale closures.

0 The nature o fthe short-term responseto crisis can affect longer-term structural
  reforms. For example, traditional procedures inThailand for corporate
  restructuring were slow and generally benefitedthe debtor; thus, the corporate
  reorganizationprocedures initially adopted that were modeled after the United
  States (Chapter 11style) were not well suited to the situation andmay have
  worsened it (longer-delays, reduced restructuring). A better approach would have
  been to simplify liquidationprocedures, involving the stakeholders and a
  bankruptcy administrator, rather thanthe court system.

0 The sequencing andtiming o f reforms is critical. Too little early emphasis was
  placed on reforming bankruptcy and foreclosure laws, developing a deposit
  insurance scheme, and fostering development o f capital andmoney markets. The
  adverse macro-economic impact o fthe initialmeasures to contain the crisis made
  subsequent reforms politically difficult.

0 The allocationo freforms amongthe three IFIsmay havebeenappropriate, but
  could only work ifit hadbeen followed by good coordination. As it turned out,
  the division resultedinan absence o f a clear guidingvision for the reforms. For
  example, commercial bank restructuringwas carried out very differently from
  finance company restructuring, evenwhen they suffered from the same problems.
  Inaddition, thedivisionoflaboramongtheIFIsdidnothold, astheBankquickly
  became involved inFIrestructuring andcapital market development.

  Each succeeding Bank loanhadbroader goals and a wider list o f conditions than
  the previous one. This approach diffused the focus o freformandmade
  monitoring difficult. A programmatic approach, now usedwidely inthe Bank,
  would have beenbetter, although it was not available at that time.

1. Introduction

1.1      After more than a decade o f strong economic growth, Thailandexperienced a
major macroeconomic and financial crisis inmid-1997, which spread rapidly to
neighboring countries. Its impact lasted for a number o f years, resultinginlarge capital
outflows (totaling some 60 percent of GDP over the following five years), negative
economic growth, and a drop o f some 40 percent inper capita GDP, which has still not
fully recovered. Thenumbero fpeoplelivinginpovertyjumpeddramatically following
the crisis, from 6.8 millionpeople in 1996 to 9.8 million in 1999. The last several years
havewitnessed robust growth o f over 6 per cent per annumin2003 and 2004, which has
helpedto reduce povertyrates to their pre-crisis level, althoughthe average per capita
income in2004 was still below its pre-crisis level.

1.2      Inthe firsthalfofthe 1990's, theassetsoftheThaibankingsystem(including
Finance Companies (FCs)) quadrupled. This high-growth environment generated both
internal andexternal optimism about the Thai economy. As a result, investment boomed,
the market capitalization o f stocks traded on the Thai exchange doubled, andthe real
estate prices andnew constructionsoared. Mucho f this continued investment and growth
was financed by inflows of foreign capital, largely short-term money.

1.3       Therapid expansion o f financial institutions duringthe early 1990's masked, and
may even have exacerbated, fundamental weaknesses inthe Thai financial sector.
Prudential regulationo f financial institutions was weak and uneven across types o f
institutions. Regulatory practices were not always well-defined or standardized, regulatory
forbearance was common andthe Bank o f Thailand (BOT) lacked adequate, skilled
supervisory personnel. Inaddition, substandardaccounting andweak disclosurepractices
clouded regulators' understanding o f the underlyingweaknesses inthe system and
impededmonitoringbythe private sector.

1.4       Financial institutions hadaccumulated excessive risk intheir loan portfolios due to
highexposures to the real estate sector, smallcompanies, insider lendingandconnected
lending. Their balance sheets also contained considerable unhedged foreign exchange and
interest rate risk. The problems were evenmore serious within the FCs, which accounted
for about 20 percent o fthe assets o f Thai financial institutions (FIs). The Thai financial
systemwas (andremains) heavily bank-centered. The year before the crisis, banklending
(including FCs) accounted for nearlyall the external fundingo fThai corporations.'

1.5       The Thai economy has heavily concentrated corporate ownershipwith the top 15
families dominatingmore than halfthe corporations* and a small number of family groups
owning bothbanks and corporations. Inthe absence o f effective bank regulatory and


 During 1996, bank lending financed about 31.3 percent o fgross fixed capital formation, while net issues o f
bonds financed some 1.9 percent. Part o fthe reasonthat Thailand had such anunderdevelopedbondmarket is
that the government had an enviable record o ffiscal rectitude, with little government debt outstandingandno
new issues o fgovernment bonds fiom June 1990 to 1998.
 Claessens, Djankov and Klingebiel (p. 29) report that only the Philippines (55.1) and Indonesia (61.7) had
a heavier concentration o f ownership than Thailand ( 5 3 3 , where the numbers inparentheses indicate the
percentage o f ownership control among the top 15 families.

                                                    2


supervisory constraints on connected lending, this kindo f institutional framework resulted
inweak creditmonitoring anddiscipline andenabled some Thai firms to obtain an
excessive amount o f leverage despite 1ow.profitability. This environment permittedfamily
groupsto retain control andmaintain highgrowth rates, but left them especially
vulnerable to economic shocks. More broadly, leverage was highinthe corporate sector,
both inabsolute terms and relative to averages inother emergingmarkets and most
developed countries. With inadequate capital to buffer against loss, corporations quickly
passed financial stresses to their lenders once difficulties inthe real economy emerged.

1.6     Prior to the 1997 crisis, the Government o f Thailand (GOT) took a number o f
destabilizing policy actions. Onthe macroeconomic front, interest rates were rising, the
current account deficit was growing andthe bahtwas under considerable pressure in
international markets. The IMFhad advised government officials to allow greater
exchange rate flexibility and/or to devalue the baht. Instead, Thai officials triedto
suppress the growing foreign exchange crisis: BOT intervened, massively and secretly, in
the foreign exchange market to support the baht. This policyrapidly depleted foreign
exchange reserves and caused foreign exchange traders to be suspicious about the stability
of the Thai economy andbankingsystem.

1.7      Inaddition, theBOTcontinuedpoliciesofforbearance withregardtobadloans
and extended huge amounts o f liquidity to FIs, through the Financial Institutions
Development Fund(FIDF). Despite these actions to disguise or postpone recognition o f
the fragility o f financial institutions, public concern about the financial sector grew.

1.8      At the sametime, evidence o fan economic slowdowninThailand andthe region
was emergingby the spring o f 1997. Thai exports were declining. The stock market
declined dramatically. The real estate market collapsed. Interest rates rose to double
digits. And downward pressure on the baht continued. These developments hrther
weakened the condition o fFIs, leading quickly to capital adequacy problems.

 1.9     InJune 1997, sixteenFCswere suspended. Aftermonthsofdelayinaddressing
the situation, these actions were undertaken partlyto assurethe Thai public that the
authorities stood behindthe remaining FCs and that deposits would beprotected and
partly to demonstrate to the international community that tough actions were being taken.
While the desire to shore uppublic confidence was understandable, the actions themselves
hadperverse consequences.

 1.10    OnJuly 2, the exchange ratewas allowed to float and the baht depreciated by over
 50 percent by end 1997. Thailand experienced huge capital outflows as the inflow o f
 short term money that hadhelped finance economic expansion was reversed. GDP
 declined 1.4percent in1997. OnAugust 5, another 42 FCswere suspended bythe BOT.

 1.11 Duringthe latterhalfo f 1997, corporations were caught betweenrisingdebt
 service costs3and collapsing revenues, exacerbated by the austerity measures negotiated


  The substantial depreciation ofthe exchange rate roughly doubled the cost o f servicing unhedged foreign
 currency-denominated debt and the sharply higher interestrates increasedthe cost of servicing baht-
 denominated debt.

                                                       3


with the IMF.4The impact o fthe closure ofthe FCs, incombination with a deteriorating
macro-economy, caused borrowersto default on loans from other FIs. Because Thailand's
bankruptcy and foreclosure laws were weak andhighly inefficient, they were unable to
deal with this flood o fnon-performingloans.


2.       Post-Crisis World BankAssistance

Context

2.1      OnAugust 14, 1997, GOT andthe International MonetaryFund(IMF) agreed on a
34-month stand-by facility valued at US$3.9 billion. Otherprospective donors agreedto
fillthegapbetweentheIMFfacilityandtheUS$17.2billionthatThailandwasexpected
to need to fund a successhl stabilization~ r o g r a m .In      ~ addition, the International Financial
Institutions (IFIs) agreed to a division o fresponsibilities for dealing with the Thailand's
financial sector. The IMF assumedresponsibility for commercial banks, the Bank had
responsibility for FCs and improving the regulatory and supervisory framework, andthe
Asian Development Bank (ADB) hadprimaryresponsibility for capital markets
development. Inthe event, however, this division o f labor broke down as the Bank
supported reforms affectingbothcommercial banks andthe capital market (see, for
example, paragraphs 2.7,2.11, and 2.28).

Loan Objectivesand Design

Description of Loans

2.2      The Bank's program for Thailand consisted o f four loans, o fwhich three are
assessedhere.6 The Finance Company Restructuring Loan (FCRL) was approved in
December 1997 for US$350 million; the second, Economic andFinancial Adjustment
Loan (EFAL I),June 1998 for US$400 million; andthe third, Second Economic and
                    in
Financial Adjustment Loan (EFAL II),             inMarch 1999, for US$600million. A timeline of
agreements with the Bank andthe IMF i s inTable 2.1 below.




  Although views vary on the extent to which the IMF's approach inthe early part of the crisis contributed to
deepening the crisis, most agree that fiscal tightening inthe early period didnot help the country to emerge
from its crisis. Radelet and Sachs (1998) note: ".,.mistakes byboththe Asian governments and the IMF
contributed to the panic and unnecessarily deepened the crisis." pp 3-4, while Berg (1999) inan IMF
working paper notes that the restrictive fiscal policy may have played some role inexacerbating the output
declines (p. 44), and Lane et a1(1999) inanother IMFpublication notes that fiscal policies should have been
more expansionary from the start, but that inany case there is a limit to the impact that expansionary fiscal
policy could have hadunder the circumstances (p. 64).
  Japan contributed US$4 billion, the Bank, US$l.5 billion and the Asian DevelopmentBank, US$1.2
billion. Inaddition, the governments o f Australia, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore allpledged
US$1billion each. Indonesia and Korea eachpledged US$0.5 billion.
  The fourth loan, Financial Sector Implementation Assistance, was under implementationat the time this
PPAR was planned.

2.3       To varying degrees, all three loans addressedninepolicy areas: (1) fiscal policy
andmacroeconomic stability; (2) FC restructuring; (3) dispositionof FC assets; (4)
deposit insurance (or treatment o f depositors and creditors); (5) restructuring and
recapitalization o f core institutions; (6) strengthening supervision and prudential
regulation; (7) corporate restructuring; (8) corporate governance anddisclosure; and (9)

2.4       Key decisions and actions with respect to macroeconomic andfiscal policy and FC
suspension and closure had been undertaken by the GOT/BOTduring the summer andfall
of 1997under the guidance of the IFIs. The IMF appears to have dominated these crucial
policy decisions, but the Bankprovided technical assistanceto the Thai authorities inthe
summer and fall of 1997 andparticipated inIMF missions related to these policy
decisions. Muchof the focus o fthe FCRL was on implementingthese policies,
particularly inrelation to the FCs. Inaddition, the FCRL also focused on strengthening
the supervisionandprudentialregulationo fFIs, andhad elements o f corporate
restructuring and corporate governance and disclosure.

2.5       The BoardCondition for the FCRLwith respect to macroeconomic andfiscal
policy called for a shift from a fiscal deficit o f 1.6 percent o f GDP in 1996/97 to a surplus
o f 1percent o f GDP in 1997/98.

2.6       Withrespect to restructuring the FCs, FCRL supported decisions andactivities
already underway. With 58 FCs suspended and a process for reviewingtheir viability
 already inmotion, a GOT decree inOctober 1997 had initiated most o f the actions inthe
Board Conditions. The FCRL definedinstitutional details andtiming.7




   These included: the establishment o f the Financial Sector Restructuring Authority (FRA) and the Asset
Management Corporation (AMCorp), deffition of the rehabilitationhesolution process o f suspendedFCs,
provision of financial support by GOT to FRA and AMCorp andthe fiscal arrangements to properly reflect
the cost o f restructuring, definition o f treatment o f depositors and creditors o f FIs, and conditions for
 liquidity support fromFIDF.

2.7     For strengthening the supewision and regulatory environment, the process was
definedbywhichthe BOTwould address open, weak FIs. Inaddition, loanclassification,
income recognition and provisioning requirements were to be made consistent with
international standards and a time line was set for phasing inthese changes. Finally, the
BOT was to establish procedures for prompt corrective action, strengthening licensing
requirements, prudentialregulation, andthe supervisory regime (inspite o fthe agreed
division of labor inwhich the IMFwas to deal with the banks - see paragraph 2.1).

2.8     With respect to corporaterestructuring (called strengtheningmarket discipline),
GOT was to improve the legal and regulatory framework for corporate workouts. In
particular, GOT was to submit legislative proposals for corporate reorganization, facilitate
financing to companies under reorganization, and speed collateral foreclosure.

2.9      On strengthening corporategovernance and disclosure (also under strengthening
market discipline), GOT pledged to upgradeto world standards its generally accepted
accounting principles, disclosures on portfolio quality, income recognition practices,
ownership structures, and auditing standards.

EconomicandFinancialAdjustmentLoan (EFAL I)

2.10     EFALIaddressedthe same areas as FCRL, with greater emphasis on corporate
restructuring. On macroeconomic andfiscalpolicies, EFALIrequiredthat GOT reverse
direction from contraction (under the FCRL-para 2.5) to expansion and make
satisfactory progress toward a public sector deficit target for 1997/98 o f 3 percent o f GDP.

2.11 Onfinancial restructuring, measuresto address the closed FCs were reiterated,
specifically progress on FRA sales and establishment o fAMC; establishment o f a bridge
bank, RadhanasinBank (RB)was an added objective. Rather thanfocusing exclusively
on FCs, as hadbeenthe case under the FCRL, greater emphasis was put on restructuring
the entire financial sector. Lookingmore to the future, EFALIset the objectives of
redefiningthe role o fFIs inamodernfinancial sector anddeveloping a comprehensive
framework for supervision. It also addressedthe restructuring o fbanks that hadbeen
taken over bythe BOT (again, in spite o f the agreed division o f labor with the IMF- see
paragraph 2.1). EFALIreiteratedthe regulatory/supervisoryobjectives o f improving
legal provisions and regulations andstrengtheningthe capacity o f the supervisory
agencies.

2.12     With regard to corporate restructuring, EFALIretainedthe goal o f developing
 appropriate legal andinstitutional frameworks for bankruptcyand reorganization and
 added goals for providing a legislative and institutional framework for secured lending
 andimprovingthe process of enforcing commercial contracts and other commercial
 legislation. EFAL Ialso included(under the headingjkcalobjectives) tax reforms to
remove the bias infavor o f debt over equity financing, to promote debt rescheduling and
 encourage cash-free asset transfers, share acquisitions, andmergers as methods o f
 corporate restructuring. Inaddition, GOT pledgedto remove tax obstacles to the
 formation of special purpose vehicles inorder to facilitate securitization ofbank assets.

                                                      6


2.13     On corporate governance and disclosure, GOT promisedto rationalize the
institutional framework for setting accounting standards andregulating accounting and
auditing practices. The Instituteo f Certified Accountants and Auditors o f Thailand
(ICAAT) was to become an independentself-regulatory professionalbody by the end of
1998. Corporate governance was to be strengthened by a series of measures, including
enhancing the financial oversight role o fthe board of directors, the establishment o f audit
committees, legal and regulatory changes to enhance protection o fminority shareholder
rights and strengthen the accountability o f corporate officers and directors, and
strengthening enforcement o flaws andregulations for public companies.

SecondEconomicandFinancialAdjustmentLoan(EFAL 11)

2.14     Thethird loan continued the focus onmacroeconomic and fiscal conditions,
financial sector restructuring, and corporate restructuring.' EFALI1reiterated the
commitment inEFALIto fiscal stimulus, incontrast to the fiscal tighteningrequiredin
FCRL. Explicit goals were set for government spending and a program for easing the
credit crunch was called for.

2.15     With regardtofinancial sector restructuring, the only new theme inEFALI1was
development o f a deposit insurance system. EFALI1placed greater emphasis thanthe
previoustwo loans on corporate restructuring. The GOT was to strengthen the legal and
institutional framework for: (i)      corporate insolvency, to facilitate the reorganization o f
companies andthe recovery o f distressed assets; and (ii)         secured lending, by expanding
the types of assetsthat couldbe usedbydebtors to secure loans andby speeding upthe
procedures for the realization o f secured interests. Finally, a credit bureauwas to be
established that would be open to all FIs andtrade creditors, facilitating the establishment
and operation of private asset management companies and eliminating the remainingtax
disincentives to corporate restructurings.

2.16     With regardto corporate governance and disclosure, EFALI1repeated most o fthe
same objectives as EFAL I.

2.17     The mainnew initiative inEFAL I1was capital market development. The GOT
was to deepen the government bondmarket to ensure the successhl placement o fnew
issues and lay the foundation of a broader bondmarket with sufficient breadthand depth
to facilitate raising capitalby the private sector and the conduct o fmonetarypolicy.


Relevance of Objectives

2.18     Because most o fthe objectives of the three loans related to long-term processes,
there was considerable overlap among them. This i s not a criticism o fthe loans, but an
explanationfor the discussion below, which i s organized around themes rather than loans.




* Competitiveness,poverty, and social protectionwere also loan objectives. These not covered by this
assessment, which i s focused on financial sector issues.

                                                         7


Macroeconomic and Fiscal Policy

2.19     With the benefito fhindsight,the fiscal objectives inthe FCRLwere too
restrictive, based on an underestimationo fthe full scope o fthe macroeconomic
consequences o fthe large-scale financial systemrestructuringandon over-optimism about
the speed andmagnitude o fthe expected recovery o fthe Thai economy. The fiscal
austerity may have beendamaging to the Thai economy: the cumulative fall inGDP was
higherinThailand thaninother crisis-affected countries (except for Indonesia) and GDP
growthinThailandtook longer to reboundthan inthese other crisis affectedcountries (see
paragraph 3.2 and Tables 3.1-3.3) andmost observers interviewedbythe IEGmission
were sharply critical o fthe IFIs for this initialposition.' The subsequent easing o f fiscal
targets under the later loans proved difficult for the Thai authorities to meet and didnot
result inan economic rebound.

Finance Company Restructuring

2.20      The precipitous suspension and subsequent closure o fthe FCs andthe rapid
disposition o f their assets through FRA were decisions made prior to the approval o fthe
FCRL. Nevertheless, the Bank was present duringthe discussions leading up to these
decisions andmucho f the focus o fthe FCRLwas on implementingthe policies. The
objectives for FC restructuringcontained inFCRL and EFAL Iand I1were largely
administrative innature, andwere generally practical andappropriate requirements for the
required restructuring, although some proved to be important. For example, the tight
deadline for FRA's disposition o f assets subsequently became controversial.

2.21      EFALIaddedthe objective o festablishing RadhanasinBank (RB)as abridge
bankto managethe assetso fthe closed FCs. Thiswas avery good objective, but itwas
already too late inthe process, because by the time EFALIwas approved inJuly 1998,
one year after the onset of the crisis, the assetsthat hadbeengood hadturned bad, so there
was little for the bridgebank to do. BothEFALIand EFALI1includedobjectives to
restructure and recapitalize the banksthat hadbeenintervenedbythe BOT, which were
also relevant for rehabilitatingthe financial sector.

Strengthening the Supervision and Regulatory Environment

2.22      All ofthe objectives underFCRLthat relatedto strengtheningsupervision o f
banks andFCs, as well as to FIaccounting, disclosure, andprudential regulation are
relevant andimportantto the restructuring o f the Thai financial system. While specific
regulatory changes were definedinFCRL, both EFALIandI1contained broader
 objectives to improvelegal provisions andregulations for supervision o f FIs andto
 strengthenthe capacity of the supervisory agencies. These were badly neededandvery
 relevant goals.




 'Although   the initial conditions on fiscal restraint were set by the IMF inits LOI, the Bank's FCRL
 reiterated these conditions - see Annex C, Matrix of Board conditions.

                                                        8


2.23     Nevertheless, there shouldhavebeenearly and stronger emphasis on limitingthe
depositor guarantee andon introducing a limiteddeposit insurance scheme (a strategy for
phasingout the blanket guarantee was inthe FCRLmatrix, butno specific conditiontied
to it, and the development o f a deposit insurance scheme to replace the blanket guarantee
was inthe Letter o fDevelopment Policy inEFALIandbecame a Board condition in
EFAL11). Bycontrast, arguably less emphasis shouldhave beenplacedonbroader and
longer-term objectives, such as definingthe future role o fFIs anddeveloping a
comprehensive framework for supervision o f a modernized system, which were
introduced inEFALIandrepeated inEFAL11. Although relevant, emphasis on these
issues while still ina crisis seems to be a questionable use o f scarce regulatory resources.


CorporateRestructuring

2.24       The objective o f corporate restructuringwas highlyrelevant, and deserved greater
emphasis than it got inthe first two loans. HadGOT achieved greater success ingetting
legislative approval for andimplementing essential reforms inbankruptcy and foreclosure
laws earlier inthe crisis, these reforms would have made it easier to restructurethe
financial sector and less costly to dispose o fthe FRA assets.

2.25      The success o fbank restructuringultimately dependedon the successhl work-out
o fnon-performing loans. But the willingness ofbanks to restructure existing loans and
extend new loans depended on their confidence that corporate borrowers would undertake
credible restructuring measures to repay andcouldbe compelled to repay should they
prove unwillingto do so. The deterioration inThailand's credit culture that was
associated with the closure anddisposition o f assets o fFCs made FIsmuch more reluctant
to restructure existing loans meaningfully or advance new loans.

2.26      Inaddition, Thailandneededaninsolvency framework that wouldreducelegaland
financial uncertainty, promote efficiency and provide fair and equitable treatment of
 stakeholders ininsolvent firms. Traditional procedures were notoriously slow and gave
the debtor enormous scope for delay; thus, reorganizationprocedures essentially adopted
 from the UnitedStates ("Chapter 11style") were probably the wrong model, as they were
 likelyto exacerbate delays, which inturnincreaseuncertainty, reduce efficiency andmay
 even worsen equity, especially when small creditors are trapped ina moratorium.
Moreover, suchprocedures require a highly specialized judiciary, which Thailand lacked.
Itwould havebeenpreferableto focus on improving simple liquidation procedureswhich
 emphasize the involvement o f stakeholders rather than the court inbusiness decisions.lo


 Corporate Governance and Disclosure

 2.27     Weaknesses incorporate governance -ineffective boards o f directors, weak
 internal controls, unreliable financial reporting,inadequate audits andweak market
 discipline -have been implicated as underlyingcauses of the Thai financial crisis.

 lo example, ageneralcreditorcouldapplyfor
   For                                              the court to appoint a bankruptcy administrator whenthe
 corporationhas defaulted o n its debt to the general creditor. The court would then choose an administrator
 from a list of licensed administrators and creditors would have the right to request a replacement only o n the
 narrow grounds o f fraudulent or malicious behavior.

                                                   9


  Neither bank lendersnor their corporate borrowers were subject to effective market
  discipline and so the objective o f strengtheningcorporate governance, accounting,
  auditing, and disclosure standardswas highlyrelevant.

  GovernmentBond Market Development

  2.28     The objective ofbondmarket development was also highlyrelevant because the
  Thai economy was heavily dependent onbanks for external finance. Sincebanks were the
  dominant financial institutions inThailand andwere highlyleveraged, the economy was
  more vulnerable to crisis than it would havebeenifthere hadbeen awell developed capital
  market. When thebankingcrisis occurred, the damageto therealeconomywas much
  greater thanifborrowers hadhadaccessto awell-hctioning bondmarket. Moreover, the
  financial restructuringprocess was more difficult thanit would have beenifThailand hadhad
  a robust capital marketto facilitate securitization.


  3.       ImplementationExperience

  Macroeconomic and FiscalPolicy

  3.1      The GOT managed to meet the stringentfiscal targetfor a surplus in 1997, but it
  hadmore difficulty inmeetingtargetedfiscal deficits. Throughout fiscal 1997/98 and
  1998/99, the GOT substantially undershot its target fiscal deficits -that is, its deficits
  were lower than the targets (Table 3.1). The reason for this apparent paradox i s that it was
  easier for GOT to stop expenditures than to start them. Once expenditures were stopped,
  it was often necessary to start anewbiddingprocess andrenegotiate contracts before
  expenditures could beresumed. Inaddition, the credit crunch inthe financial sector meant
  that suppliers were often unable to submit newbids.

  3.2      This fiscal performance, however, may have contributedto poor economic
  performance inthe immediate aftermath o fthe shock (Table 3.2). Economic growth was
  considerably lower thanprojectedinthe year following the crisis, although growth
  resumed in 1999, and since 2002, overall economic performance has beenvery strong in
  terms not only o f growth, but also fiscal performance and low inflation. Nevertheless, the
  cumulative fall inGDP was higher inThailand than inother crisis-affected countries
  (except for Indonesia); GDP growth inThailand took longer to reboundthan inthese other
  crisis affected countries; and GDP inbothThailand and Indonesia took longer to reach

their pre-recession peaks (Table 3.2). To the extent that the early fiscal targets were too
stringent andthat the shift from a fiscal surplus to a deficit target was difficult to attain for
the GOT, the fiscal targets inthe three Bank loans should have called for higher deficits.

FinanceCompanySuspension and Closure

3.3        After the FRA completed its evaluationo fthe viability o f each suspended FC, 56
were closed and their assets were transferred to the FRA. Over 80 percent o f the liabilities
of these institutions were loans from the FIDF, so the ultimate cost o fthe F C closure had
already, implicitly,beenshifted to the Thai public. These actions were inplace before the
first Bank loan was approved. The actions taken by the Thai officials inthe summer o f
 1997,with the urgingand support o fthe IFIs, did stem deposit outflows somewhat, but
aggravated the negative effects on other FIs andthe macro-economy.

3.4         Although the FCs technically remained "open" intheir suspended status, the Thai
regulatory authorities lacked the experienced personnel to perform eventhe most basic
functions. As a result, normal bankingprocedures broke down and documents were not
 safeguarded. The regulatory agencies also lacked the authority, the procedures, and the
resources to undertake closure ofthe 56 FCs, and inany case, inadequate record-keeping
 andaccounting practices complicatedthe audits o fthese institutions. Finally, the absence
 of deposit insurance complicated the situation interms o fpublic confidence."




 l1Itis doubtful that       regulatory agency, even one experienced inthe closure o f FIs, could take o n 56 FIs
 at once. Rather than suspension and closure, establishing a "bridge" bank facility would have beenmore
 effective inseparating the good assets o f insolvent FCs from the bad and isolating insolvent FCs from
 healthy ones. The performing assets o f FCs could have been transferred to the bridge bank facility where
 they would have continued to be serviced; performing debtors would have continued to have access to
 additional credit and other financial services. Ths approach would have had a number of advantages: (1)
 by isolatingnonperforming assets early inthe process, more FCswould likely have survived; (2) the credit
 contraction associated with closure and the adverse macroeconomic impact would have been smaller; and
 (3) the asset quality o f closed institutions would have beenbetter protected to minimize the ultimate public
 cost o f resolution. Although not a panacea, a bridge bank facility, supported with assistance from IFIs and
 private sector experts, and combined with other restructuring measures, would ldcely have had a better
 outcome, compared to the large scale closure and disposition o f assets that amounted to 15 percent o f GDP.

3.5       The government that came to powerinNovember 1997 established the bridge
bankRB(an objective inEFALI), this was already too late. Bythe time it was
                                          but
established inFebruary 1998, approximately 80 percent o fthe commercial loans o f closed
FCs were non-performing." RBwas expected to be abidder inFRA auctions, but was
never adequately capitalized.


FinanceCompanyAsset Disposition

3.6       With the closure of 56 FCs, 869 billionbaht, or 14percent o fthe assets ofthe
financial sector, was transferred to the FRA for disposition. An asset disposition o fthis
magnitudewould be a daunting task under any circumstances andthe dismal economic
situation inThailand andthe region created additional challenges. Informulating the sale
process, FRA officials' biggestconcern was whether there would be sufficient bidders
from either within Thailand or externally, giventhe economic uncertainty, andthe
perceivedinadequacies o f Thai bankruptcy andforeclosure laws andpractices. In
addition, other countries inthe regionwere experiencing similar problems and also trying
to sell their non-performing loans.

3.7       The emergency decree that created the FRA gave it the authority to dispose o fthe
assets through methods they deemed appropriate for each type of asset. It also indicated
that the preferredmethodwas an open auction. The FRA didnot have authority to
restructure or renegotiate loans. At the same time AMCorp was set up to act as the
bidder-of-last-resort inFRA auctions. Assets that could not be sold for a higherprice
were transferred to the AMCorp which thenworked to restructure the loans to recover as
muchas possible. Initiallythe FRAwas requiredto complete its task byend1998, only a
year after the closure o f the FCs. Later, this deadline was extended a year.

3.8       There was no expertise inThailand to undertake such a complicatedprocess. FRA
officials hired a foreign investmentbankto help structure the sales andprepare and
package the loans for sale. The FRA heldits first auction o f core assetsI3inJune 1998, six
months after the closure of the FCs. By end 2000, 86 percent of FRA assets hadbeen sold
with an average recoveryrate o f 35.3 percent o fface value. Most ofthe remainingassets
were involved inlitigation. By the second quarter o f 2001,the FRA distributed its
recovered fimds, 218 billion baht, to the creditors o f the FCs andthe FIDF. The Ministry
o fFinance (MOF) had taken the positionthat debtors could not bidon their own loansl4
and the IFIs generally agreedwith this policy. O fthe 600 billionbaht incore assets
auctioned, about 50 percent were purchasedby a few foreign, institutional bidders. In




l2Veerathai Santiprabhob, p. 25.
13Coreassets exclude items such as real estate, autos, and artwork.

l4Inaddition to collusionamong debtors, MOFandFFL4officials were concerned about "strategic default".
Ifdebtors couldbuytheir owndebt atbelowface value, there wouldbe anincentive for debtors to stop
paying on loans inthe expectation that they could be bought later at a substantial discount. Widespread
strategic defaults would have further eroded asset quality inan already fragile financial system and might
have done long-term damage to the credit culture by underminingthe expectation and cultural normthat
debt i s repaid.

                                                         12


addition, one of the winning bidderswas the investmentbankingfiim that hadbeenhired
to advise the FRA."

3.9       These results were widely criticized after the public learned that most o fthe
successful bidders were foreigners, many o fwhom were suspected o f "flipping" the loans
back to the original borrowers at substantial profit, and that one o fthe successful bidders
was the advisor to the FRA. There i s no evidence, however, that particular bidders were
favored, foreign or otherwise. All parties had access to the same information andthat
information is now available to the public inthe national library. It i s possible that ifthe
FR4hadoffered smaller lots of assets, moreThai bidders could have come forward, but
largepackages o f the loans were neededto diversify the risk enough to attract large
bidders and, inany case, small lots wouldhavemade collusion among debtors easier.

3.10      Second, the prohibition o f debtors biddingbecame controversial inThailand.
Since some o f the winning foreign bidderslater resold loans to the original debtors, the
public believed that the cost o fthe asset disposition andthe loss o fwealth to foreigners
would have been less ifdebtors hadparticipatedinthe auctions directly. Although foreign
buyers"flipping" the assets backto the debtors at aprofit looks suspicious, giventhe
prohibition on direct sales to debtors there i s little else the FRA could have done. FRA
officials were concerned about attracting enough qualified bidders and any attempt to
discourage large, institutional foreign bidders would have been counterproductive. In
effect, institutional buyers acted as debt restructurers for Thailand and took considerable
risk,giventhe uncertainquality ofthe assets. Profits from "flipping" canbeconsidered
compensation for restructuringthe loans andthe risk assumed indoing so. Moreover,
lettingdebtors buytheir own debt at a discount is fraught with moral hazardproblems (see
footnote 14).

3.11 Third, the speedwith which the assets were sold also raised public concerns. Since
the economy was at its nadir at the time o fthe auctions, the common view i s that better
prices would have been received ifthe assets hadbeenwarehoused longer. But the assets
had already deteriorated considerably and, with ongoing uncertainty about the economy,
further delays would likelyhavereducedasset qualitymore. Since the rapid dispositiono f
assets helpedrecycle the assets andclear the real estate market, it i s likely that the
disposition effort helped the economy recover sooner. Holding the assets longer could
well havepostponed economic recovery.

3.12      The deadline decreed for the FR4to sell its assets was onerous giventhe work
involved to hold such auctions.I6 But FRA officials reportedto IEGthat they were
determinedto demonstrate that they could resolve the problem and didnot feel hampered



l5Allowing the foreign fmthat was advising the FRA to bid was a politically bad decision. Inprinciple,
suchpotential conflicts o f interest canbe managedby erecting Chinese walls betweenthe two different lines
o fbusiness. The FRA was assured by the fmthat appropriate practices were being followed and there is
no reason to believe that the process was compromised. Butthe perception o f it by the Thai public was
predictably very negative.

 l6Itis also a tight deadline relative to similar operations indeveloped countries. TheU S ResolutionTrust
Corporation, for example, took five years to dispose o f a much smaller stock o f non-performing assets
relative to GDP, with more experienced and expert staff, and under muchless troubled economic conditions.

                                               13


bythe short deadline. The FRA'sresults mighthavebeenbetterifthey hadhadthe power
to restructure or renegotiate the loans transferred to them, butFRAwas denied this
authority, on the grounds o f enhancing transparency and minimizing the opportunity for
corruption. Restructuringwould have likelyrecycled some loans more quickly and
released collateral, hastening the rehabilitationof viable debtors and might have allowed
theFRAto avoid some o fthe mostnegative public reactionto thewhole cleanup process.

3.13    The deficiencies inthe bankruptcylaws and other restructuringinfrastructure were
animportant deterrent to attracting morebidders. Ifbankruptcyprocedures hadbeenin
place, the asset sales would have likely attracted more bidders andbetter prices. In
addition, the public cost o fthe asset disposition would have beenless ifthe FRAhad
partneredwith an experienced investmentbanker or debt restructurer and entered into an
incentive agreement based on recovery. The FRA did attempt such an approach on a
small scale, andthe recovery rate was somewhat better, but the arrangement faced heavy
public criticism becauseo fthe image o fturningthe process over to a foreign company
that would profit from the arrangement.

3.14    Giventhe size andcomplexity o fthe task, the FRAperformedits rolewell, andin
a timely way. The process involved open and fair auctions inwhich all interestedbidders
had equal access. The auctions returnedto productive use assets that amounted to about
15 percent o f 2001 GDP. The recovery rate was less than the pre-auction estimate (made
byindependent auditors in1997) of42 percent, but several years o fworse-than-expected
economic performance had intervened.

Treatment of Depositorsand Creditors

3.15    The FCRL supportedablanket guaranteefor bothdepositors andcreditors.
Depositors o f suspendedFCs could exchange deposits for notes o fKrungThai Thanakit
Finance Company (KTT -paragraph 3.19), the maturity of which depended on the size o f
the deposit. Althoughdepositors insuspendedFCs lost the liquidityo ftheir deposits, they
eventually (insome cases over a year later) received full face value. At the time o f the
second FC suspension inAugust 1997, a blanket guarantee was extended to all depositors
andcreditors o f all FIsinthe system, notjust those that hadbeen suspended. The
guarantee may havebeenneeded early inthe crisis to stabilize the system, andmay have
beenpolitically expedient, but it was, andremains, detrimentalto long-term structural
reform; it i s also contrary to well-disseminated Bank guidancefor deposit insurance (see
paragraphs 4.10-4.12 for discussion).

Restructuring and Recapitalizing Core FIs (banks)

3.16    The GOT beganthe crisis owning two FIs, andby 1998, four were state-owned.
After combining two, three institutions were still state-owned as o f2004. UnderEFAL11,
these institutions were to be privatizedby mid-2001. The GOTBOT maintains that it i s
committed to privatizing these institutions, but no further progress has beenmade.

3.17    Over the year anda halfbeginninginthe fall o f 1997, the BOT intervened insix
commercial banks (constituting 24 percent o ftotal loans of the FIsystem) and 12 FCs.
The management andboards of directors o fmost o fthe intervenedbanks were removed

                                               14


andreplaced. Workingon a case-by-casebasis, the authorities addressedthe intervened
banks using a combination o fmerger, consolidation, closure and sale to foreign interests.

3.18    Incontrast to thetreatment ofthe FCs, the interventionapproachbytheBOTwas
inmanyways preferable. Publicconcerns were calmedwhenitwas clear that depositors
were protected and the system became more stable. The interventions and subsequent
mergers have helped consolidate a system that consisted o ftoo many, small,
uncompetitive FIs. The authorities' out-of-pocket costs havebeen contained, compared to
a payout under the deposit guarantee.

3.19    The authorities merged five FCs into a state-owned FC, KTT; subsequently, seven
more FCs and one intervenedFIwere combinedwith KTT to form Bank Thai (BT). One
intervened bank was mergedinto state-owned KrungThai Bank (KTB). The outstanding
loans from FIDF on these merged institutions' balance sheets were convertedto equity so
the mergers were a means o frecapitalizing the state-owned institutions. Inaddition,
KTB's non-performing loans (NPLs) were transferred to a govemment-owned Asset
Management Company (AMC) in2000. The assets were transferred, through some
creative accounting, at enhanced prices (relative to market) to further recapitalize KTB,
andthe transfer allowed KTB's NPLratio to fall from 58 percent to 8.4 percent andits
risk-adjustedtier one capital ratio to rise to 9.5 percent. Assets were paid for with FIDF
bonds, structured to help KTB meet its interest obligations.

3.20    BT andthe other three state-owned banks at the time were treated similarly. Inthe
case o f BT, NPLs were transferred to a covered asset pool that remained inhouse, rather
thana state-owned AMC. Itslosses, however, were to becoveredbythe FIDFand
therefore had no impact on BT earnings. BT was given a yield maintenance agreement by
the FIDFto support servicing o fdeposits.

3.21    The BOT attemptedto sell their majority shareinthe four remainingintervened
banks. Dueto the large number o fNPLs, the BOT had to offer yieldmaintenance or
gaidloss sharing agreements to potentialbuyers. With manyAsian banks trying to
privatize or looking for strategic partners, few bidders came forward, although two o fthe
four intervenedbanks were successfully sold.

3.22     The recapitalization o fthe four state-owned banks resulted innearly a trillionbaht
of NPLs transferred to state-owned or state-supported AMCs. These recapitalization
efforts resulted inthree "good" state-owned banks and a fourth with its N P L s effectively
isolatedfrom its ongoing business. The accounting techniques employedinrecapitalizing
these institutions, however, do not constitute effective restructuring. The recapitalized
state-owned banks are still burdenedwith political interference, allegations o f corruption,
management turnover, inadequate business plans, and for several of them, issues related to
their merger.


ImprovingSupervision and Regulation

 3.23    The BOT set new provisioning guidelines early inthe crisis, but stopped short o f
bringingthemto internationalstandards. Theywere fully phased inat end2000, but

                                                      15


forbearance still occurred, at least through 2002,         l7inanattemptto reducethe stress on
weak institutionsandor to increase lendingto stimulate the economy. Forms o f
forbearance includedallowing the loan loss provision to be calculatednet of collateral
without critical assessmentof its value. The effect o fthis was to lengthen the period o f
time over which loan losseswouldberealized. Other forms o fforbearance included
weakening standards on classificationo f loans, including restructured loans, and
weakening rules for types o f collateral andcollateral valuations. A phase-out o f some o f
these forbearance tactics was scheduled for end 2003, but international standards are still
not met. The forbearance has manynegative consequences for the health o f the financial
system.l8

3.24      Otherregulatory and legal changeshavebeen achieved, though with some delay
compared to the timeline agreed uponthe Bank. The BOT has acquired the authority to
intervene inan illiquidor insolvent institution, and has promulgatedthe standards and
guidelines for doing so. Legal authority to bringa prompt corrective action against an
institution has been given(though over four years late) andthe procedures defined.
Regulationhas been standardized acrossbanks andFCs, foreign ownership rules have
been liberalized somewhat, and licensing standards have beenreviewedandimproved.

3.25      The BOT has reengineeredtheir supervisory function, upgraded their skillbase
significantly, andtrained bank examiners. On-site exams now occur regularly. The BOT
i s buildingthe capacity to beginrisk-based examinations, inaccordance with international
standards.

3.26      InEFALIand11, the BOTwas urgedto develop a longer-termframework for the
future o f Thai financial services inorder to bringit to internationally accepted standards to
be able to compete ina global industry. A task force was appointed which developedthe
Financial Sector Master Plan, publicly released inearly 2004. The Master Planhas been
reviewedby industryrepresentatives andprofessional groups and forwarded to the
Cabinet. The Master Plan addresses a wide range o ftopics fi-om licensing o f various types
o fFIs, to initiatives to improve financial services to the poor and for consumer protection.
The document attempts to define a more level competitive arena for foreign institutions in
terms o fbranching andbusiness scope.


CorporateRestructuring

3.27      The GOTpursuedaprivate-sector led, voluntary solution to the mountingvolume
of NPLs, which requireda number o fchanges to the enabling environment, including

 l8 it
   First, postpones, but does not eliminate, the needto realize losses. Second, it impedes appropriate FI
restructuring by supporting the existence o f weak FIs and industry overcapacity at the expense o f stronger
institutions. Tbd, FIs continue to operate with too little actual capital and have less competitive pressure to
restructure or raise more capital. Fourth, since outsiders cannot accurately understand capital positions,
assess losses or make valuations, raising capital from private investors or attracting a foreign partner (as the
GOT has encouraged) is more difficult. Finally, inabsence o fthe blanket guarantee, depositors and
creditors would have had incentives to distinguish among FIs that remain inbusiness because o f regulatory
forbearance, and those that manage and disclose riskbased on accepted standards

                                                       16


most importantly, modernizedbankruptcy and foreclosure laws and enhanced enforcement
capacity."

3.28     The GOT met fierce resistance inParliamentto its proposedbankruptcy and
foreclosure reforms, particularly inthe Senate where anumber of Senators were
themselves strategic defaulters.20 Debtors fearedthat the proposed amendments would
reduce their bargainingpower and waged a major campaign inopposition, stirringup fears
that Thai firms would be driven into bankruptcy and taken over by foreigners at bargain
prices. As a result, the foreclosure reforms under EFAL Iwere carried out intwo phases.
The first phase was approved by Parliament according to the original timetable, but the
second phase was delayed andultimately passed ingreatly watered-down form
(paragraphs 3.37-3.3 8).

3.29     After the politically damaging experience withtheFRA (paragraphs 3.9-3.12),
GOT avoided reliance on a centralizedgovernmentasset resolution agency, incontrast to
Korea, Malaysia, andIndonesia. Instead the GOT emphasized decentralized, less
transparent, less politically vulnerable ways o fresolvingNPLs. To encourage banksto
recognizethe losses implicit intheir NPLs, GOT offered a public support scheme to
ensure that banks hadenough capital to withstand losses inrestructuring troubled
corporate debt.21

3.30     The Corporate Debt Restructuring Advisory Committee (CDRAC) was launched
inJune 1998to coordinate the renegotiationofcorporate debt andtheBangkok Approach
was devisedto provide a voluntary, out-of-court framework for restructuring NPLs.
CDRAC first targeted the 350 largest NPLborrowers. Progress was slow through the end
o f 1998 and so EFALI1placed special emphasis on speeding up the process. The quantity
of cases resolvedunder the auspices o f CDRAC increased markedlythereafter, but the
quality o fthe restructuringagreements left muchto be desired.

3.31 More thanthree-quarters ofthe cases involvedno reductioninthe book value o f
the lender's claim on the borrower, relying instead on an extension o fmaturity, the
provision of a grace period, or a reduction inthe contractual interest rate.22 This would
have been appropriate ifborrowers faced liquidity problemsrather than solvency issues. It
i s likely that banks favored this "cosmetic restructuring" to protect their fragile capital


l9 changesthatwererequiredinvolvedestablishingguidelinesfortheaccountingtreatmentof
   Other
restructured debt and the regulatory treatment o f NPLs; changes to the tax law; and providing training in
corporate bankruptcies and formal corporate reorganizations for judges and receivers as well as trustees-in-
bankruptcies, company managers, lawyers, accountants and others.
*' See Annex C for a chronology detailing how one senator, who controlled the largest corporate debtor in
Thailand, managed to evade creditors for at least seven years.

21 With two exceptions, banks not subject to intervention avoided participationinthe recapitalization offer,
preferringinstead to engage incosmetic restructuring that would defer the recognition of loss and, if
economic conditions improved markedly so that borrowers could resume servicing their debts, perhaps
avoid recognition of a loss.

22 Less than a quarter o f the cases involved a forgiveness o fprincipal or accrued interest, a swap o f debt for
assets or debt for equity or other restructuring techniques. This inference is based o n Table 8.ls, inVeerathai
Santiprabhob, (p. 85).

                                                   17


positions, avoid dilution of control, and to maintain the option ofborrowers' repayment o f
the principal ifthe economy andborrowers shouldre~over.'~                The inadequacy o fthis
approach to corporate restructuringcontributedto the very slow reduction inNPLs.

3.32    With laggingeconomic recovery andcontinueddelays incorporate restructuring,
NPLs continuedto grow through the first quarter o f 1999. As o f January 1999, N P L s
accounted for nearly halfthe loans at Thai commercial b a r k z 4During2001 and 2002,
the "reentry" of NPLs that hadbeenrestructured under CDRAC exceeded new NPLs; in
in2002 alone, for example, some 30percent ofthe debtrestructured revertedto NPLs
within a few               Bythe first halfo f2003, two-thirds ofthe loans restructuredby
private bankshadrevertedto NPLstatus.26

3.33    The progress inNPLrestructuringunder CDRAC was largelyamongprivate FIs.
The restructuring o fN P L s at state-owned FIs (and at private FIswhere state owned banks
were involved) provedto bemuchslower. They hadless capital capacity to accept a loss
and they lacked sufficient legal immunityfor their employees anddirectors, who faced
potential criminal liability for incurring lossesto the state even ifa reduction inthe book
value o f a loan enhanced its economic value. These restraints on the involvement o f state-
owned banks were later eased.

3.34     Bymid-2003, after five years o foperation, the CDRAC process hadcompleted 49
percent (by face value) o f its US$67 billion (2.9 trillionbaht) target cases. The remaining
cases failed the CDRAC process andwere transferred to the Civil Courts for resolution
(US$31 billion) or to the Thai Asset Management Corporation (TAMC) (US$4 billion).27

3.35     Established inJune 2001, TAMC has become the largest public A M C inThailand.
Bythe second quarter o f2003, the TAMC hadacquired nearly 18,000 loanswith
aggregate book value o f 784 billionbaht (US$19.8 billion),28 andhad approvedresolution
plansor undertaken legal enforcement measures for over 70 percent o fthe transferred
assets. By the second quarter o f2003, however, fewer that halfo fthe cases under the
headingo f "DebtBusiness Restructuring" hadbeen signed, with the remainder awaiting
final agreement. The overall implementationofthe out o f court corporate restructuring
does not compare well to neighboringAsian countries that experienced crisis, as shown in
Table 3.3.




23 The BOT'Spolicy on classification ofrestructured loans may also have encouraged this approach.
Originally, the BOTpermitted restructured loans to be reclassified to normal status and their provisions
reduced only ifthe borrower had fulfilled payment obligations for at least three payment periods or three
months, whichever was longer. InMarch 1999, however, the BOT relaxed the IWLgraduation standard to
encourage a faster reduction inIWLs. See Veerathai Santiprabhob, p. 78.

3.36     Inaddition, concerns havebeenraisedabout the transparency ofthe process,
particularly the need for more information about actual andprojected cash recoveries from
all types o fresolutionprocedures. AlthoughTAMC projects a recovery rate of 46.28
percent o f the book value, so far cash recoveries amount to about 2.5 percent o f all the
"resolved" cases. Since every Baht not repaidbyborrowers on these loans must be repaid
byThai taxpayers, these cashflows deserve carefulmonitoring.

3.37     Interms ofthe legalframework, the two phasedamendmentsto thebankruptcy
law, inApril 1998 andApril 1999, failed to provide a strong legal framework for court-
supervised reorganizations or to strengthen foreclosure rules that would provide incentives
for borrowers to negotiate out-of-court workouts. For example, the amended law
shortened the bankruptcy period so much as to render it ineffectual for creditorspursuing
a strategic defaulter suspected o f concealing                        FIshave therefore preferredto
pursue creditors inthe civil court, where creditors may have up to ten years to locate
hidden assets. The amendedbankruptcy law suffers from other defi~iencies.~'Thus the
twice amended bankruptcy law failed to make a strong contribution to speeding up the
corporate restructuring pro~ess.~'




29The amendment shortened the bankruptcy period (the period before the debtor could be viewed as having
dischargedhis debts) from ten years after the last allocationby the receivers to three years after the court's
bankruptcy ruling. Since it usually takes at least two years from the bankruptcy rulingto the last allocation
of assets by the receiver, this shortened the effective bankruptcy period by at least nine years relative to the
GOT'Sinitial proposal. See Santiprabhob, p. 74, for additional discussion.

30For example, the criteria for initiating bankruptcy proceedings are based onbalance sheet solvency rather
than the debtor's cash flows, which allows debtors to avoid servicing their debts while arguing that they are,
nonetheless, solvent. The amended law also fails to provide for a quick conversion o f an unsuccessful
rehabilitation into a liquidation; ifthe rehabilitation fails, all insolvency proceedings terminate and the
debtor can continue doing business, which provides considerable scope for a nonviable debtor to delay
liquidation. See IMF Staff Country Report No. 00/21, p.25.

31InSeptember 2003, the LegalReformCommittee for Development o fThailand (LRC) submitted revisions
of the bankruptcy act regarding personal bankruptcy liquidation to the Cabinet, which mainly provide
greater protections for bankrupt individuals, except when the Central Bankruptcy Court rules that the
individual was dishonest or guilty o f fraud. As o f the time o f this report, it was uncertain when the proposed
revisions would be submittedto Parliament

                                                       19


3.38      Progress with the corporate bankruptcy framework i s also unsatisfactory. At the
time o fthis report, revisions hadbeenproposedbutnot yet submittedto the Cabinet,
which were essentially debt~r-fiiendly,~~which do not addressthe hndamental
                                                   and
weaknesses o f the existing structure, especially the inadequate leverage providedto
creditors for bringingtroubled debtors to the bargainingtable. Moreover, they do not
address the need to identify andrescind transactions with connected parties prior to the
bankruptcy that may have contributed to the distress and underminedthe repayment
priority among debtors. Most o f the revisions ofthe Bankruptcy Act targeted inEFALI1
have not been carried out.

Corporate Governance and Disclosure

3.39     New accountingstandards have beenintroduced and implemented.Accounting
and auditing professions inThailand were to become under supervision o f the
independent, self-regulatory Federationo fAccounting Profession (FAP) expected to be
established upon enactment of the Accounting Profession Act in2004. Companies listed
on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) have audit committees inplace, andthe Institute
o f Directors has provided training to largenumbers o fcorporate directors.

3.40     Thepromisedrevisions ofthe Securities andExchange CommissionAct andthe
Public Company Act havebeen inprogress, though at a slow pace.33The former needs to
be revised to strengthen the role and enhance the fiduciary duties o f directors, including
the imposition o f constraints on relatedparty transactions, with sanctions for violations.
The latter needs to be amendedto provide protection for minority shareholders and legal
channels for shareholders seeking redress. And the process o f improving accounting and
auditing practices needs to be continued.

3.41     The unfinished agenda for corporate governance includes, inaddition to the above
issues, the introduction o f severe sanctions on insiders, misleadingdisclosure, and
disciplinary actions andsanctions for accountants who violate the professional code o f
accountants or commit fraud.         34 More broadly, the expansion of a thriving institutional
investor sector -pensionplans, mutual funds and life insurance companies -which i s
critical to capital market development i s also likely to increase pressures for
improvementsincorporate g~vernance.~'




32Some of the proposed revisions included: (1) allowing honest debtors to petition for rehabilitation; (2)
regrouping creditors to recognize the revenue and tax authorities as a creditor group onthe same level as
financial creditors; (3) requiring 75 percent o fcreditors' vote by credit value to accept a restructuring plan
instead o f the current 50 percent. Source: Thailand: Economic Monitor, April, 2004. p. 38

3'The market incentive for adopting good corporate governance practices canbe quite significant. An
international investor opinion survey, conducted by McKinsey during 1999, showed that institutional
investors were preparedto pay at 25.7 percent premiumfor corporations that adopted good corporate
governance practices inThailand. The mark-upthey were willing to pay inthe U.S. was 18.3 percent and in
the U.K., 17.9percent (ThailandEconomic Monitor, July 2001, p.27).

GovernmentBondMarketDevelopment

3.42     Although the development o fcapital marketshas been limited, there has been good
progress indeveloping a strong government bondmarket, which was the aspect that the
Bank supported. Thailandpromptly implementedreforms designed to stimulate
development o fboththe primary and secondary markets for governmentbonds. The BOT
made an effort to introduce a quarter-ahead calendar o fregular issuance o f government
bonds inthe primarymarketto enhance transparency. It succeeded indeveloping a yield
curve for government bondswith a maturity range from less than a year to fifteen years.

3.43      InJune 1999,theBOT allowedFIsto conduct securities borrowing andlending
business to promote riskmanagement and market liquidity. It also instituteda code o f
conduct for market participantsthat includedthe establishment o f a market committee to
settle any disagreements betweenparticipants inthe secondary market. Credit ratings
were required for those corporate bonds sold to the public andInstitutionalInvestors.

3.44     The BOT developedaprimary dealership system to facilitate the conduct o fopen
market operations andrequiredprimarydealers to make a market ingovernment securities
as well as quote indicative prices. Thailand also plannedto fhther promote inter-dealer
broker systemto facilitate transactions betweendealers, and the repurchase marketwas
expanded. The BOT launched a filly automated delivery-versus-payment real time gross
settlement system for government securities. Clearing and settlement o f corporate bonds
andequities, however, remainedwith the Thai Securities Depository andwas based on a
nettingsystem. A unified andintegrated clearing andsettlement systemfor all securities
holds the promise o f increased efficiency andreduced transaction costs. Moreover, it
would facilitate cross-collateralization among debt, equity, and derivatives markets that
facilitates the development o f derivatives markets.

3.45     The GOT also participated inthe establishment of a regional bond fund and
committed to developing an action planto harmonize the bondmarket infrastructure
among key capital markets inEast Asia includingthe establishment o f regional credit
rating agencies, the linkingo fregionaltrading platforms andsettlement systems andthe
acceptance o f sovereign bonds o fthe Association o f South East AsianNations (ASEAN)
membersas collateral at central banks. These initiatives were designed to makebetter use
o fthe significant pool o f savings amongthe ASEAN countries and decrease reliance on
volatile capital flows.

3.46     Also, duringMay 2003 the Derivatives Act passedto authorize the development o f
derivatives exchange to facilitate hedgingo f financial risks. The new derivatives market,
whichwill trade futures on the stock index, interest rates andforeign exchange, was to be
established in2004 with 300 millionbaht o f seed capital from the SET. The MOF

mostly conducted over the counter. Thailand still lacks a significant institutional investor

natural source of demandfor long term capital instrumentsand characterizes countries that
have flourishing capital markets.

3.48    The reformmeasures have beenmore successful inimprovingthe infrastructure o f
the government bondmarket and the regulatory framework for the corporate bond market
than instimulatingsignificant activity inthe corporate bond market. The secondary
market remains rudimentary, and new issues o f corporate bonds, although larger than
duringthe pre-crisis period, remainmodest. The stock o fcorporate debtoutstandingis 14
percent o fbank loans (2003 figure).

3.49    Thai corporations remainmainly dependent onbanklendingfor external finance.
The structure of the Thai financial systemhas not changed much since the crisis, despite
the efforts to restructure the banking system andpromote the development o f capital
markets. Domestic savings continue to flow mainlythrough a few banks, which continue
to collateralize most domestic lendingwith property, because it remains the most reliable
collateral despite the difficulties inforecl~sure.~~The potential gains from capital market
development are genuine, butthey are yet to be realized.


4.      OutcomesandAssessment

Macroeconomic and FiscalPolicy: Unsatisfactory

4.1     The fiscal objectives inthe FCRL were, inretrospect, too restrictive, based on an
initial underestimate of the macroeconomic consequences o fthe financial system
restructuring and on an initiallyoverly optimistic assumption about the ability o f the Thai
economy to rebound from the crisis. Fiscal austeritymay have had damaging
consequences for the Thai economy. The subsequent easing of fiscal targets under EFAL
I was appropriatelyexpansionary, butGOT
was unableto expand its expenditures enough        Figure 4.1: Quarterly Real GDP in countries

financial sector restructuringresulted inpoor macroeconomic performance for an
extendedperiodo ftime. Except for Indonesia, Thailand's GDP growth rates fell bymore
andfor a longerperiodo ftime following the crisis thaninother countries experiencing
crisis (see Figure4.1).


FinancialCompany Suspensionand Closure: Unsatisfactory

4.3     The suspension and subsequent closure ofFCs, although decidedbythe Thai
authorities inconsultationwith the IFIs prior to the FCRL, which the FCRL supported,
had a detrimental effect on Thailand via several interrelated channels. These includedthe
macro-economic impact, the effect on other FIs, the effect on the credit culture andthe
inadequacy o f regulatory resources to manage the problem.

4.4     Macro-economic impact. With customers o fthe suspendedFCs unable to access
hnds or acquire new loans, the real economywas heavily affected. Many small, family-
owned and medium-sized companies relied on FCs for their working capital, so many
healthy companies were denied access to financial services. Inaddition, borrowers fiom
suspendedFCs often could not seek funding at other FIsbecause their collateral was
frozen at the suspended institution. As a result, ongoing, healthybusinesses were
suddenly without access to working capital, deposits, or collateral, and began to face
solvency issues themselves. This added strainto an already-fiagile corporate sector (see
discussion on corporate restructuring), loans to unsuspendedFIswere not paidback and
asset quality throughout the systemsuffered. Thus the abrupt suspension o f such a large
number ofFCs addeddownwardpressure to an already-contracting economy.

4.5      Impact on other FIs. Despite Thai officials' desire to prevent the spread o f the
FCs' problemsto commercialbanks (CBs), the transmission o fthe adverse economic
impact o fthe suspension o fthe FCs to other FIs, evenhealthy ones, was inevitable. One
direct channel o f contagionwas the substantial direct equity andcredit claims o f CBs on
FCs. Inaddition, CBs andFCs hadmanycommon customers; borrowers from CBs were
unable to service their loans because their assetswere suspended at FCs.

4.6      Impact on credit culture. An indirect impact o fthe closure was a long-term,
detrimental effect on the credit culture. Inmany cases, little effort was made by
suspendedFCs or FIsto collect on loans; the public quickly learnedthat there was little
reason to payback loans to suspended institutions, especially as there was little prospect
of receiving additional credit. As a result, loans that could have remainedperforming
became non-performing. Inaddition to worsening the problems o f the FCs themselves,
thishada serious negative effect onthe credit culture inThailand, exacerbated bythe
 subsequentdisposition ofthe FC assets (see paragraphs 3.7 - 3.13). The Thai credit

FCs was the use of a bridge bank (described infootnote 11, page lo), which would most
culture has not hlly recovered today. An alternative to the suspension and closure o f the

 likelyhave had a lessnegativemacroeconomic impact, and a less negative effect on other
FIs and on the credit culture.

 4.7     Impact on regulatory resources. The regulatory challenge related to the
 suspensiodclosure was also a concern. The size and scope o fthe suspension and
 subsequent closure overwhelmedregulatoryresources andmagnifiedthe negative macro-

                                                      23


economic impact. The IFIs should not have supported the suspension or closure o f so
manyFCs at onetime, without a coherent planand clear capacity for security o fthe
assets, and for managing the next steps intheir resolution. Most important, the closure,
and its perceived effects, underminedpublic confidence inthe Thai authorities, damaged
the reputation o f the IFIs, andunderminedprogress on needed structural reforms.

4.8       Given the negative impact on many aspects o fthe economy and needed reforms in
the financial sector, the outcome o fFC suspension and closure is rated unsatisfactory.


Disposition of Finance Company Assets: moderately satisfactory

4.9       Had the original policy decision o f closing so many institutions precipitously not
been taken, so large an asset dispositionwould not have been necessary insuch a short
time span. Ifclosure and disposition are taken as a given, the overall objective o f
disposing o f the FC assetswas accomplished, and the process was very well executed by
the FRA. Outcomes might have beenbetter ifalternative methods, such as restructuring,
and the time needed to restructure or renegotiate loans, hadbeen grantedto the FRA. One
significant unanticipated outcome o fthe disposition was the disastrous public perception
o f it which was, and remains today, devastating to the reform-minded leaders associated
with the FRAYthe IFIs, andthe long-termreform agenda. Takinginto account boththe
satisfactory achievement o f the basic objective but the unanticipatedoutcome o f the
negative public perception o fthe process, the overall outcome o f the disposition o fFC
assets i s rated as moderately satisfactory.


Treatment of Depositors and Creditors: highly unsatisfactory

4.10      While the deposit guarantee seemedto calm public concerns about the safety o f
deposits, the distortions causedbythe guarantee are costly to Thailand as long as it
remains inplace. Incontrast to IMF advice, and to the Bank's subsequent efforts to
 support a limited deposit insurance system, the guarantee was not temporary, andwas still
inplace seven years later. The guarantee originally givento creditorswas phasedout only
 inNovember 2003, some six years later. Thedevelopmentofa limiteddeposit insurance
planto replace the deposit guarantee is still under considerationbyParliament.37

 4.11     Deposit guarantees, by definition, subsidize weak institutions and encourage risk-
 taking. This serious moralhazard problem was magnified inThailand because the
 guarantee covered creditors as well as depositors. A creditor-guarantee made all sources
 o f FIs' finding risk free, so creditors had no incentive to ration credit based on risk. In


 37Iflimiteddepositinsuranceprogramwereputinplace,largedepositors,ifconcerned,wouldseekout
      a
 lower-risk institutions or instruments. This would bringmarket discipline to the deposit market, rather than
 maintaining risky institutions under a blanket o fprotectionimplicitly funded by the taxpayer. Guarantees
 and deposit insurance should be used only to protect (relatively) small depositors who have few alternatives,
 not large depositors who can seek alternatives consistent withtheir risk appetite and liquidityneeds. In
 addition, depositor and creditor guarantees encourage a bank-centric economy. Withrisk-free bank
 deposits, the development o f other short term, liquidsaving instruments is discouraged. Ifcreditors can
 provide funding for FIs without risk, the development o f short-term money markets as alternative sources o f
 liquidity is also discouraged. Thailand, like most emerging economies, has a highneedto develop capital
 and money markets as alternatives to FIs for both saving and borrowing.

                                                         24


such a situation, poorly managed FIs can survive when they shouldnot and prudently
managed FIs are put at a competitive disadvantage.

4.12      The guarantee givento FIcreditors may havebeenneededinthe very early part of
the crisis to calm the market, but its persistence for six subsequent years was not
appropriate policy. The deposit guarantee may also havebeenneeded early inthe crisis to
stabilize the system, and may have been politically expedient, but it was, and remains,
detrimental to long-term structural reform.38The continuation o f an unlimiteddeposit
guarantee postpones ahealthy recovery o f the Thai financial system. The costs and risks
shifted to the taxpayer by the guarantee are serious, negative effects. The outcome o f
treatment o f depositors and creditors i s rated highly unsatisfactory.


Restructuring and Recapitalizing Core FIs: Unsatisfactory

4.13      Compared to the earlier closure o fthe FCs, GOT/BOT approach inintervening
core FIs (commercial banks, CBs) hadthe benefit, inprinciple, o fprotecting the
performing assets o fthe intervened FIs. Inreality, however, resources were strained and
good assets were not given the attention needed. The asset quality o fbothKTB andBT
deteriorated inthe aftermath o fthe mergers. Aside from consolidating problems into
fewer institutions, it i s unclear whether the forced mergers have remedied anything.

4.14      The debuequity swap was viewed as a cheap way to recapitalize the state-owned
FIs,but the cost was only cheap inthe out-of-pocket sense. When the BOT intervened,
the losses embedded inthose FIsbecame publicly owned and mergers, debt/equity swaps,
and accountingmaneuvers only reshuffledthepublicly-owned losses. Rather than
intervening andconverting these institutions to state ownership, a preferable approach
mighthavebeenfor the BOT to combine these institutionsinto a goodbank-bad bank
structure andthenprivatize the good bank andtransfer the bad assets to an AMC.

4.15      Inaddition, the state-owned banks appear to have grownrapidly inrecent years.
For example, by end 2003, the loans o fthe two largest state-owned banks hadgrown at
rates o f 13 percent and 19percent, compared to 2-3 percent inthe private sector, and the
two largest state-owned banks owned 30 percent o fthe loans outstanding and a 54 percent
 share o f new lendingby the eight largest CBS.~'A number o fprivate Thai bankers

 38 The IMFsupports a blanket guarantee for deposits to bolster confidence and stem deposit outflows, if it is
temporary, part o f a credible plan to restructure the FIsystem, and has the strong commitment of the
 government. It contemplates that the guarantee would last 6 months to a year (IMF, "Managing Systemic
Banlung Crises" 2003). The IMF's conditional endorsement o f their use is insharp contrast to research
results that indicate the far-reaching detrimental effects o f deposit guarantees. Inanalyzing outcomes across
 countries incrisis, research shows that blanket guarantees raise the ultimate fiscal costs o f resolving the
 crisis, and do not help reduce the output loss associated with the crisis or hastenan economic recovery. In
 contrast, ifdeposits are not guaranteed and depositors share some o f the costs o fresolving FIdifficulties,
 financial intermediation i s restored sooner and the economy tends to recover sooner. (See Honohanand
 Klingebiel(2000) and (2003); Claessens et a1(2001); Kane and Klingebiel(2002)).

 39 With the many transfers o f assets to AMCs and other accounting restructurings, the data on lending are
 not always consistent. Boththe state-owned and private FIs gained share o f the loan market since the
 beginning o f the crisis, but it appears that gains for both sectors were at the expense o f foreign FIs.
 Inferences drawn from the Thai loan data seem to be highly dependent on timing. Thailand Economic
 Monitor, May, 2004, p.25.

                                                        25


reported to the IEGmissionthat state-owned FIspersistentlyunderprice loans. This
suggests that the highgrowth of state-owned FIs i s inpart at the expense o f the growth
and profitability of the private bankingsector.

4.16     The treatment o fthe core FIs (isolating NPLs, recapitalization, merger, and other
restructuring tactics) was preferable to the treatment o fFCs, which has led to greater
stability and an improving situation ofthe NPLs. Inaddition, there are fewer institutions
ina systemthat neededconsolidation, althoughthe consolidationhasbeenlargelydictated
bythe GOTBOT. At the sametime, the banking systemis not particularly profitable4'
and i s beingtaxpayer-subsidized to a larger extent thanbefore the crisis. After nearly
seven years o f IFI-ledrestructuring, more FIs are state-owned than before the crisis and,
while the data are mixed, it appears that the state-owned sector is controlling a growing
share o f credit extension. Based on 2004 data, about 28 percent o fthe total FIsector is
state-owned; this state-owned sector was supposed to have beenlargelyprivatized by mid-
2001. Thus, the outcome o frestructuring and recapitalizationo f core FIs i s rated as
unsatisfactory.

ImprovingSupervision and Regulation: Satisfactory

4.17     The outcomes on improving supervision andprudentialregulation have beengood,
thoughthe modernizationhas not been complete and delays have beenlong.
Nevertheless, stronger regulations are inplace, the BOT has greater authority to intervene,
licensing standards have been improved, and the BOT has upgraded its skills; on-site
exams occur regularly, and its buildingcapacity to move to a risk-based system o f
supervision. Accordingly, outcome i s rated as satisfactory. An unfinished agenda
remains, but seems likelyto be achieved over time.

Corporate Restructuring: Moderately unsatisfactory

4.18     Progress incorporate restructuring has been slow and incomplete. Although
progress has beenmadewith debt restructuring, remarkably little corporate or operational
restructuringhas beenaccomplished. Corporate control remains highly concentrated in
the hands o f 15 families andfew mergers and acquisitions have occurred. The failure to
 efficiently deal with the distressed assets effectively lockedup a substantial amount of
 financial resources that could have beenused more productively elsewhere inthe
 economy. Consequently, the recovery of investment was slow -relative to experience in
 Thailandinearlier recoveries andto the contemporary experience o f its East Asian
neighb01-s.~~  Recovery was ledprimarilyby exporting firms that benefited from the
 substantial depreciation of the exchange rate and tendedto have access to foreign funds.

 4.19    Second, manylegal and institutional reforms supported by the three loans have still
 not beenaccomplished. The amendedbankruptcy law, for example, contains important


 40While profitability has improved, it still lags that for other Southeast Asia economies, including those who
 went through similar crises inthe late 1990's. See, for example, IMF, Thailand: SelectedIssues, January,
 2004, p.30.

 41See Thailand: Economic Monitor, April 2004, p. 18.

                                                       26


weaknesses, andthe bankruptcyframework has not yet beenrevised; proposed revisions
do not address fundamental weaknesses. Most ofthe reforms inEFALI1to strengthen
security rights and foreclosure procedures have not been implemented.                   42


4.20       Survey data from a sample o f local law firms andbankruptcyjudges insix middle
income countries, reportedinDoing Business in 2004, show that Thailand appears to lag
others intwo important respects. Based on the specifiedbankruptcy scenario, the time to
go through insolvency inThailand (2.6 years) i s exceeded only by Indonesia (6 years) and
Argentina (2.8 years). Moreover, the costs o f going through insolvency inThailand (38
percent of the bankruptcy estate) are markedlyhigher than inthe six other countries.43

4.21       Progress was slow andmuch remains to be done before Thailand's bankruptcy and
foreclosure laws and institutions can produce the desired outcomes o f efficiency,
maintenance ofthe priority o fclaims andreducinguncertainty. While to some extent
Thailand's relatively slow recovery was attributable to the deptho f the crisis andthe
extent of overinvestment that preceded the crisis, it was exacerbatedbythe weakness o f
measures taken to improve the legal and institutional infrastructure for restructuring
corporate debt. For these reasons, outcome for corporate restructuring i s rated
moderately unsatisfactory.

Corporate Governance and Disclosure: satisfactory

4.22       The improvements incorporate governance anddisclosure are demonstrable and
recognizedby international surveys. A 2003 survey on corporate governance practices
(released by the Institute o fDirectors) o fthe 337 corporations listed on the stock exchange


42 Thailand still lacks an automated central credit registry and the legal infrastructure to expand secured
lendingbeyond real estate. Similarly, although two credit bureaus were establishedto facilitate the sharing
of credit informationthe implementation o f the Credit Information Business Act (enacted in2002 and
effective inMarch2003) caused bothbureaus to temporarily cease operations because o f the severe criminal
sanctions for any violation o f the Act, notjust for willful violations and fraud. Thailand: Economic
Monitor, M a y 2003, p. 39. The April 2004 edition o fthe Monitor (p. V.) reports that a draft amendment o f
the Credit Information Business Act was submitted to the Parliament which would reduce the legal risk for
 Credit Bureaus and their members. Doing Business 2004, presents a more optimistic view of the success o f
the reforms. This survey showed that private credit bureaus are now operating, but have markedly lower
 coverage than credit bureaus inthe five other countries that have credit bureaus. Thailand ties with Korea for
the top position with regard to creditor rights. Inaddition, the number o fprocedures inThai civil courts (19)
 is relatively low. Although Thai civil procedures are much speedier (210 days) than inMalaysia (270 days),
 Indonesia (225 days), Mexico (325 days) and Argentina (300 days), they lag procedures inKorea (75 days)
 and Turkey (105 days).

 43 For example, although the amendments to the Code o f Civil Procedures speeded up foreclosures and
 asset-disposal by expediting the process o f claim, judgment, execution and collection, and limiting the
 power ofjudges to rescind auction sales, results have been disappointing. As o f December 2003, the
 backlog o f cases inthe Civil Courts, where mortgages are enforced, included more than 73,000 cases, about
 the same number o f unresolved cases as the year before. Attempts to reduce the backlog by providing out-
 of-court mediationhadnot hadmuchimpact by April 2004 (See Thailand: Economic Monitor, April 2004,
 p.37). Similarly, attempts to speed-up the auction o fforeclosed propertybyreducing the reserveprice have
 beenapplied only to foreclosed properties that hadbeen o n the auctionblock for over 10years by April
 2004 and thus had limited impact. InM a y 2003, the Thailand Economic Monitor reported that at current
 rates o f sale, it will take the Legal ExecutionDepartment "ten years to liquidate the Bt 152 billion (in)
 foreclosed assets o n banks' balance sheets as o f end 2002."

of Thailand showed that, relative to 2002, there hadbeenimprovement infive standards
and deterioration inone (Controlling System and Internal                         A cross-border survey
o f corporate governance practices shows that Thai practices compare favorably with those
inChina, the Philippines andIndonesia, butfall short ofthose inMalaysia, Korea and
India.45 Thailand received a score o f 4.6 out o f              A corporate governance ROSC
scheduled for 2004 should provide a better measure of how Thailand's corporate
governance practices and accounting and auditing practices measure up to OECD
principles and international standards. While some improvement instandards needs to be
accomplished and enforcement needs to be greatly strengthened, the achievement o fthis
objective has been substantial, and the outcome i s rated as satisfactory.

Government Bond Market Development: highly satisfactory

4.23      The improved infrastructureand organization o fthe government bondmarket are
impressive. Over time this may contribute to the development o f a robust corporate bond
market, althoughto date the contribution to the raising o f capital by the private sector i s
not evident. Thus, althoughthe overall development o fthe capital market is
unsatisfactory, the improvements inthe government bond market are highlysatisfactory.
Overall, outcome ingovernment bond market development is rated as highly
satisfactory.

would have on the Thai economy. Even once into the crisis, there was a persistent
tendency on the part of all the IFIs to underestimate its severity or likely longevity.

4.25     WorldBank-International Monetary Fund Relationship. Duringthe critical first six
months o fthe crisis, the IMFdominatedthe policy agenda; inthe view o fmost o f the Thai
officials interviewedby IEG, IMF advice and conditions were all that mattered. One
might argue that this isnot a serious problem. The IMF, after all, hasprimary
responsibility for crisis management and the Bank has responsibility for longer term,
structural reforms. This position is unpersuasive for at least two reasons.

4.26     First,the way inwhich crises are managed can compromise essential structural
reforms. To be more than a bridgeto the next financial crisis, crisis management mustbe
informedby a clear and consistent vision o fhow the financial system should be changed.

4.27     Second, a country's appetite or tolerance for reform i s limited and i s typically most
intense at the deptho f a crisis. As the Thai case illustrates, once the crisis has passed, the
urgency o fundertaking meaningful reform dissipates. Ifthe crisis management stage has
beentraumatic for the country, the IFIs mayno longer beable to act as effective advocates
for reform. Partially due to the policy mis-steps proposed by the I F I s and followed bythe
Thai government inthe early stages o fthe crisis, the resolutionprocess has beenvery
difficult andcontroversial inThailand.

4.28     The IMF andBank needto forge an agreement about the appropriate policyrecipe
for addressing financial crises. The actions taken inThailand indicate clearly that the IMF
andBank didnot agree up front on some ofthe mostbasic principles andadvice. Beyond
this, both IFIs needto commit to a more collaborative process inthe design o f a program
for a particular country when a problem emerges. This would allow all IFIs to speak with
one voice, and with a voice that speaks to long-term structuralneeds, as well as short-term
crisis management. Failure to do so makes the long-termrole o f the Bankmore difficult.
Ifthe IFIsarenotableto converge around anappropriateprescriptionfor suchcrises and
work together to agree on appropriate policies, the Bank needs to decide what it will do in
the event o fdisagreement with IMFpolicydecisions.

4.29     The policymaking process resultedinThailand inconflicting views, confusion of
the long-term effects o f short-term actions, and a failure to recognize the interaction
betweenmicro-policies and macro-conditions. One former senior Thai official noted that
the problemwith the policy advice was that hehad "received a cacophony o f advice" from
the IFIs.

 4.30     Earlyinthe crisis a division o flabor was agreedto amongthe IFIs. Under this
 agreement, the IMFhad responsibility for commercial banks, the Bank hadresponsibility
 for finance companies and structuralreform o f the system, and the AsianDevelopment
 Bankhadprimaryresponsibility for capitalmarkets development. This division mayhave
 made sense, but it needed close cooperation among the IFIs to ensure coherent and

                                                 29


comprehensive reform. Inaddition, the division o f labor was not followed infact under
the loans, and this may have added to a lack of coherence inapproach.

4.3 1 Resources. The Bank's slow response was compounded by the lack ofpersonnel
with hands-onexperience indealingwith a financial crisis. The first teams sent to
Thailand were described by Thai officials interviewedbythe IEGmission as young and
inexperienced. Whenmore experienced practitioners arrived, they lacked experience with
theweak institutional andlegal environment of emergingmarkets. Moreover, there were
tensions within the Bank teams between the economic policy researchers andthe
practitioners.

4.32     With EFALIandEFALI1the Bank sent new and increasingly larger teams. Some
Thai officials expressed frustration at the lack o f continuity, confusion about roles and
responsibilities, andlack o f expertise on Bank teams, although the more experienced Bank
teams assembled subsequently along with a strengthened local Bank team are givenhigh
marksbyThai officials for their responsiveness, the quality o ftheir advice, andtheir
commitment to the task.

4.33     With the importanceandfrequency o ffinancial andbanking crises, the Bank
should maintain the expertise to be able to respond quickly insuch crises. This expertise
needs to include both experienced practitioners, who have relevant real world experience,
and knowledgeable researchers to provide historical perspective and state-of-the-art
advice. Allowing the experience gained inEast Asia to dissipate would be a mistake,
although this assessment does not have the basis for recommending whether this requires a
defined group, such as was established inthe Bankto deal initiallywith the Asian crisis,
or a "virtual team" o f expertswithinthe Regional organization that canbe called upon
with little notice.

4.34     Thai policymakers praised publications andresearch made available to them from
the Bank, such as comparative studies conducted by Bank economists, which highlighted
the policy choices confronting countries incrisis and indicated the outcomes most often
associated with these alternatives.

4.35     Conflicts of Interest. InThailand, the Bank operated inat least three capacities:
 advisor, investor (through the International Finance Corporation [IFC]) and fiduciary
 agent (on behalfo f investors inIFC projects). The potential conflict o finterest among
these roles caused two notable problems. First, senior Thai officials told IEGthat they
 agreed to the blanketguarantees for creditors because ofpressure from the IFC. Second,
 the IFC devised a goodbank/bad bank restructuring for FinanceOne, the largest o fthe
 failed FCs, a plan that was rejected. AlthoughIEGfound no evidence the rejection was
 due to fear that it would appear that the Bank, acting as advisor, was showing favoritism
 to the IFC, the potential conflict o f interest was genuine andthe perception o f it affected
 the reputation o f the Bank.

 4.36     Conditionality of Loans. A fundamental function ofthe FCRLwas balance o f
 payments support; the loan was approved within six months after the crisis erupted and,
 likethe other loans that followed, was paidout immediately. The conditionality inthis
 kindo floanneeds to be carefully phased, so that a set ofrealistic andhighlytargeted

                                                 30


 reform areas are selected. The scope o f conditionality became broader with each
 successive loan, so that by the time that EFAL I1was approved, the policy matrix
 contained a very broad range o fpolicy areas, with no clear set o fpriorities or sequencing.
 When every policy change i s a priority, there is no clear priority. Such broadening can
 detract the attention o f the authorities fkom the more critical areas for reform.


 Ratings for Individual Loans

 4.37    To arrive at ratings for the individual loans, IEGconsidered the importance o fthe
 nine objectives listed above ineach loan, reflected inTable 4.2, and the ratings o f each
 loan, reflecting these weights, are summarized inTable 4.3 below (page 33).

 FCRL Ratings

 4.38     The FCRL focused mainly on the suspension and closure of the FCs (which had a
 detrimental impact on the economy), the disposition o fFC assets (which had a moderately
 satisfactory outcome), and the treatment o f depositors and creditors (because the blanket
 guarantee persisted far longer than anticipated i s considered highlyunsatisfactory); and to
 a somewhat lesser extent on improving supervision andprudentialregulation (under this
 loan, it i s considered moderately satisfactory, mainly because of forbearance by BOT in
 the early years, although for allthree loanstogether, its outcome is considered
 satisfactory). Inaddition, the outcome o fthe macroeconomic objectives is considered
 unsatisfactory because it supported a fiscal surplus which IEGconsiders to have been the
 wrong policy for that point intime. Overall, the outcome o f the FCRL i s considered
 moderately unsatisfactory.

 4.39     The sustainability o f FCRL's benefits is difficult to assess, as the macroeconomic
 targets are not considered a benefit andinany case were reversed inlater loans (thus the
 surplus was not sustained), andthe closure and disposition o fassets o fthe FCswere one-
 time actions for whichthe notion of sustainability isn't easily applied. At the same time,
 the blanket deposit guarantee, which was not specifically addressed through conditionality
 under the FCRL, is detrimental to the development o fprudent financial intermediation,
 andthus works against sustainability. The improvements to supervision andprudential
 regulations are, however, likely to be sustained. Given all these considerations, IEGhas
 not ratedthe sustainability o fthe FCRL.

                                               31


4.40     Oninstitutional development impact (IDI),the closing and disposing o f assets o f
FC involved the acquisition o f expertise by Thai professionals associated with the process,
and thus may haveput the country inabetter position to deal with another crisis should
one occur inthe near future. Onthe other hand, an unintendedimpact was the public
perception o f the process, which was so negative that it detracted from public support o f
the longer-termreform agenda. While the strengtheningo fbanking supervision and
prudentialregulatory policies has been substantial, the failure to address the blanket
guarantee o f creditors and depositors was detrimental to longer term institutional
development. Giventhese quite differentimpacts on institutionsunder the FCRL, IDI is
considered modest.

4.41     Bankperformance is mixed under FCRL. The Bank supported two policies -
fiscal tightening, and suspension and closure of the FCs, which may have contributed to
the contraction o fthe economy and exacerbated the crisis. Although the Bank played a
supporting, rather than a leading, role inthese policy decisions, the FCRLprovided
reinforcement for them. Onthe suspension andclosure o fthe FCs, these decisions were
technically madeby the Thai authorities before this loanwas approved, butthey were part
o f a larger program for restructuring the financial sector which the Bank supported prior to
going forward with the first adjustment loan. Duringthe formulation o f this restructuring
program, inthe immediate aftermatho fthe onset o fthe crisis, the Bank provided technical
assistanceto the authorities andparticipatedinIMF missions that also provided assistance
to the authorities to articulate the restructuringprogram, which included dealing with the
FCs. Even ifthe Bank didnot take the lead inthe discussions, and even ifthere were
Bank staffwho disagreed with the approach, much o fthe focus o fthe FCRL was on
implementingthe fundamental decisionto close the FCs, so the loanwas implicitlyhlly
supportive ofthe decision. Inthis aspect, Bank performance is considered unsatisfactory.
Bycontrast, Bankperformanceis considered satisfactory inits support for the disposal o f
FC assets. Onbalance, Bankperformance under FCRL is considered unsatisfactory.

4.42     Thai authorities and agencies did a goodjob o f implementingthe policies agreed
withthe Bank, closingthe FCs and, inparticular, disposingo fFC assets under difficult
circumstances; the agency involved hiredappropriate consultants, and carried out its
difficult mandate as efficiently as possible; their performance on this aspect is considered
highly satisfactory. Against this shouldbe set Borrowerperformance on creditor and
depositor guarantees, considered highly unsatisfactory. While the authorities made
progress on strengtheningprudential regulations, considerable BOT forbearance meant
that there was little enforcement o f the new standards. On balance, however, Borrower
performance under FCRL is considered satisfactory.

EFALIRatings

4.43     Thepolicy objectives ofEFAL Iwas better designedthan under FCRL, but
achievement o fthe objectives was mixed, with significant weaknesses. EFAL I
incorporated a change inthe direction o f fiscal policy, from a surplus target under FCRL
to a fiscal deficit target, but the Government was unable to increase expenditures enough
to reach the deficit (the actual fiscal deficit for FY98 was lower than the target). To deal
with the FCs, it includedthe establishment ofthe bridgebankto manage the assets o fthe
FCs, although it was too late inthe process o f FC closure to be useful, as the good assets

                                               32


had turned bad and there was little for the bridge bank to manage. Itplaced greater
emphasis on starting the process o frestructuringcore FIs (not just the FCs), which was
begunbut not camed out satisfactorily, and o fdefining the longer term strategy for the
FIs, which was done. But EFALIdid not successfully addressthe blanket guaranteeon
depositors and creditors, which remained ineffect. EFALIcontinuedthe process o f
strengthening FIsupervision andregulation, although BOT forbearance continued;
focused on establishingthe framework for bankruptcy and strengtheningother commercial
legislation, whose progress has been limited; and focused improving corporate governance
and disclosure practices, whose outcome i s considered satisfactory. Onbalance, the
outcome of EFALIis considered moderately unsatisfactory.

4.44     The sustainability of the benefits achieved under EFAL Iis considered likely.
Although some o f the benefits under EFAL I,      such as the start o f FIrestructuring, may not
be resilient to risks, most other benefits achieved under the loan are considered
sustainable. These include continued progress on strengthening prudentialregulation and
supervision, and improvementsincorporate governance and disclosure, where external
pressures involving international reviews o f standards and codes and private sector
surveys o f the business climate and accounting standards are likely to sustain the
momentumto work toward international standards.

4.45     Institutionaldevelopment impact insome areas supported by EFALIwas
substantial - strengthenedFIprudential regulation, for example, as well as improvements
to corporate governance and disclosure. Incorporate restructuring, althoughprogress
achieved was not as rapid or as substantial as hoped, the emphasis on civil court
procedures andthe development o f a specialized bankruptcy court should leadto an
improvedprocess andbetterperformance over time. Inother key areas, however, such as
restructuring FIs, and continuedBOT forbearance inenforcing the strengthened prudential
regulations, IDI is considered modest, and this is the overall rating under EFALI.

4.46     Bankperformance is considered satisfactory under EFAL I.EFAL Iplaced
greater emphasis on restructuringthe whole financial sector, inspite o fthe earlier
 agreement on the division o fresponsibilitiesamong the international financial institutions
 (IFI),andfocusedonlongertermissuesfor the sector, allofwhichwere appropriate. It
 also focused on the critical area o f corporate restructuring and reforms, andprovided
 substantial technical assistance inthis area to help the Government deal with corporate
restructuring. The Bank thus addressedimportant weaknesses inthe overall environment
 for effective financial intermediationandtook a pro-active approach to implementing the
broader set o freforms.

 4.47    Incontrast, Borrowerperformance is rated unsatisfactory underEFALI.
 Although the Borrower continued satisfactory disposal o f FC assets andit strengthened its
 regulationand supervision o fFIs, it didnot enforce the stricter prudential regulations, and
 it allowed the blanketguarantee to persist. It carried out reforms inthe framework for
 corporate governance, but its performance on restructuring andrecapitalization o fFIs and
 on restructuringcorporations i s considered weak, and progress with the corporate
 bankruptcy law was unsatisfactory, due inpart to stiff resistance from Parliament.

EFALI1Rating

4.48    The objectives o f EFALI1appropriately shifted the emphasis for the treatment o f
depositors to developing a deposit insurance scheme with limited protection; it also
appropriately included for the first time the development o fthe government bondmarket.
Although there was some progress toward puttinginplace the limiteddeposit insurance
scheme, which was to have occurred by end-1998, it was not completed at the time o fthis
writing. The outcome o fthe development o fthe government bondmarket is considered to
have been highly satisfactory. As noted inparagraph 8, bankingsupervision continued to
be strengthened andthe outcome o fthis component is considered satisfactory. The other
objectives which receivedparticular emphasis under EFALI1were achieved to a much
more limitedextent, in some cases with significant shortcomings; these include core FI
restructuring, strengthening the legal framework for corporate restructuring, and
improving progress on corporate restructuring, as discussed inparagraphs 7 and 9. As a
result, the outcome of EFAL 11is considered moderately unsatisfactory.

4.49    EFAL 11receives a sustainability rating of likely, because the benefits such as
strengthened supervision and regulation and improved corporate governance and
disclosure are likely to beresilient to risks for reasons noted inparagraph 18. Although
one aspect, FIrestructuring, i s not considered sustainable, the sustainability o f the
development o fthe bond marketis considered highlylikely, as the probability is highthat
the benefits will continue to grow undermost economic scenarios.

4.50     ID1for EFALIris rated assubstantial, becauseinaddition to the factors
mentionedinparagraph 19 under EFALI, development ofthe government bond
                                              the
marketrepresents a significant contribution to the institutional development o fthe
financial sector. Itpermits the establishment o f a benchmark yield curve, a crucial
element for further capital market development. These achievements will facilitate the
development o fthe corporate bondmarket, trading inderivative instruments andmore
efficient pricing o f equities. Thus the institutional contribution o f EFALI1to capital
market development is considered high.

4.5 1    Bankperformance is rated satisfactory. As inthe case o f EFAL I, design o f
                                                                               the
EFALI1was appropriately focused on broader and longer-term issues thanwas the case
underFCRL. EFALI1design also added anobjective o fcapital market development,
which was highlyrelevant to longer term financial market development and stability. The
Bankworked effectively with government andrelevantprivate sector entities to develop a
sound plan for corporate governance and disclosure. And although the divisionof
responsibilities following the crisis allocated capital market development to the Asian
Development Bank, the Bank took the leadunder EFALI1ina first step inthis process o f
supporting improvements to the government bond market.

4.52     Borrower performance under EFAL 11is also rated unsatisfactory. Although
performance was highlysatisfactory with respect to improvements incorporate governance
anddisclosure anddevelopment o fthe government bondmarket, itwas considerably weaker
on other keyobjectives o fEFAL11. Whlle it maybe argued that the blanketcreditor and
depositor guarantee initially put inplace was thejoint responsibilityo fthe IF1andThai
authorities, the failure over a sustained period o ftime to phase out the deposit guarantee and

                                                  34


replace it with a limited deposit insurance program, supported under EFAL11,was the
responsibilityo fthe government. Inaddition, there was considerable political opposition to
legislative proposals that would have servedto strengthenthe legal andinstitutional
infrastructure for corporate restructuring, and as noted inparagraph4.19, some o fthe
legislative proposals have servedto weaken the framework for bankruptcyand other aspects
o fcorporate restructuring, andthere hasbeeninsufficient progress onbothcorporate
restructuring andFIrestructuring andstrengthening. Offsettingthese weaknessesin
performance is the satisfactory progress achievedbythe Borrower on corporate governance
anddisclosure andthe reformsmade ondeveloping the government bondmarket (paras. 4.22
and4.23).

5.       Findingsand Recommendations

Lessons Learned

 5.1     The significant cost o f cleaning up financial crises can offset the progress made
over many years inpoverty alleviation and other social improvements, both o fwhich are
 central to the Bank's mandate. Giventhis, the Bank should continue to play a role in
 client countries inboth improving financial sector governance and soundness to reduce the
probability o f crisis and inpost-crisis management and well-structured recovery.

 5.2     The severity o fthe crisis was, inretrospect, initiallyunderestimatedbythe Bank
 and others, as was the negative impact on the economy o fthe large scale closure o fthe
 FCs inthe early phase o f the reforms. Thai officials interviewed by the IEGmissionnoted
 that these earlymis-readings o fthe severity o fthe crisis andthe impact o f the closure o f
 the FCs on the economy raisedconcerns about the credibility o f the IFIS'approach and,
 most important to Thailand's future, about the financial reform itself. This suggests that
 crises inother countries should be approached more comprehensively, taking into account
 potential negative impacts o f large scale closures.

 5.3     Short-term crisis management policies can compromise essential structural
 reforms. The failure to factor into the design o f the reforms the inadequacies o f the Thai
 legal and regulatory infrastructure led to approaches that may have increasedthe cost o f

                                             35


cleanup. For example, traditional procedures inThailandfor corporate restructuring were
notoriously slow and generally benefitedthe debtor; thus, the corporate reorganization
procedures modeled after the UnitedStates (Chapter 11style) were ill-suited to the
situation and may have served to worsen it (longer-delays, reducedrestructuring). A
betterapproachwould havebeento simplify liquidationprocedures, involvingthe
stakeholders and a bankruptcy administrator, rather thanthe court system.

5.4      The sequencing andtimingo freforms i s critical. Too little early emphasis was
placed on reformingbankruptcy and foreclosure laws, developing a deposit insurance
scheme, and fostering development o f capital andmoney markets. The governmentthat
came to power just after the crisis emergedwas reform-minded, but the adverse macro-
economic impact o f the earlypolicy changes gave "reform" a badname inThailand.

5.5      The allocation ofpieces o fthe reform package among the three International
Financial Institutions (IFIs) may have made sense, but only ifit hadbeen followed by
better coordination. As it turnedout, the division o fresponsibilitiesresulted inan absence
o f a clear guidingvision for the reform o fthe financial system. Thus, for example,
commercialbank restructuringwas carried out very differently from finance company
restructuring, even when they suffered from the same problems. Inaddition, the division
o f labor broke down, as the Bank fairly quickly became involved inFIrestructuring and
capital market development.

5.6      Succeeding loans with increasinglybroader goals and a growing list o f conditions
diffusedthe focus o freform andunderminedmeaningfulmonitoring; abetter approach
would have been the programmatic one now usedwidely (but not available at that time),
which seeks to develop a coherent set o fpriority reforms and sequences the steps for
carrying out those reforms ineach successive loan.

                                   4. InvestmentClimate

Inthe late 1990sYemen's investment climate seemedto beonanupswing. Withthe end
of the civil war, security improved. Infrastructurewas beingrehabilitated. A
                                  bvt b N F
DebtreliefsubstantiallyreducedYemen's payments to creditors.

Despite the improvements, the investment climate did not become adequately attractive.       !

Investor confidence again deteriorated with the bombing o fthe USS Cole inOctober
2000 and inthe aftermath o f September 11,2001. The economy and the budget remained
heavily dependent on oil. Fuelandwater subsidies distortedincentives. A large and
inefficient state-owned sector impededprivate sector development. Pervasive corruption
was a serious obstacle to increased investment. Yemeni business was highly taxed in
comparison with neighboring countries. A few large business groups dominated the
small and relatively protected domestic market.

Bank Strategy

The OED's 1999 Country Assistance Review was critical o fthe Bank's earlier strategy
for improving the investment climate. It stated:
        "A weakness ofthe assistancestrategy is the relatively lowpriority given to
        removing constraints toprivate sector development. IDA'Sefforts inthis area
        have included modest support for privatizationo fpublic enterprises; a large credit
        for financial sector reforms; and support for private investments for Aden port.
        But IDA could have done more. Except for the FIASreport in 1997, IDA has
        carried out no Private Sector Assessment. Inaddition, IDA could have supported
        efforts to limit illegal anddestructive fishingpractices inthe RedSea."
Since then, improving the investment climate has become a central objective o f the
Bank's country assistance strategy. CAS99 sought "to attract diversified productive
private investments that help the economy grow out ofpoverty anddependence on oil".
CAS02 aimedto create an "attractive investmentenvironment to generatejob
opportunities". Both documents emphasized the interdependence with other CAS
objectives, inparticular the contribution that better public administration and governance
could make to improve the investment climate.

The underlyingchallenges were to diversify the productionbase and to createjobs for a
rapidly-growing labor force. Oil productionpeaked in2002 anddeclined steadily
thereafter. Barringnew oil discoveries, Yemen's oil was projected to be depleted by
around 2015. Moreover, the oil sector provided relatively few jobs. Non-oil investment
and diversification for employment growthwere critical to prospects for poverty
reduction. Further complicating the challenge o f diversification andjob creation was the
potential exhaustion o f groundwater inthe highlands. This implieda need to shift the
focus of growth toward coastal regions. The Bank focused on three major needs:

     (i)     To improve the private business environment by altering the way government
             interacted with the private sector;


                                                                                          1

    (ii)    To developAden as a magnet for investment,and
    (iii)   To address sectoralconstraints to growth.

CAS99 proposedan ambitious program o f lendingand AAA to promote improvements in
the investment climate. Proposed lendingincluded a privatization project, financial
sector adjustment credit, a series o f adjustment credits to promotebudgetary
management, two legal andjudicial reformprojects, as well as infrastructureprojects in
support o ftransport, power, and water. Substantial ESW and strategy/policy advice was
also plannedto improve public expenditure management, promote non-oil growth, and
improve the investment climate, including sector work on landregistration and advice on
establishing anindependentcommission against corruption.

Muchofthisprogramwas notimplemented. Itwas unrealistically ambitious, giventhe
problems inrecruiting experienced field staff and the waningreform momentum as the
price o foil rose and obscured the needfor action. Furthermore, the Government
enthusiasm hadnot been sustained, while opponentsof the reform mobilized against
manyprogram elements. CAS02 was less ambitious, proposing, among others, aPort
Cities Development Project, a Rural Access Project, and a project for Power
Restructuring andExpansion. ProposedAAA remainedwide-ranging and included non-
lendingadvisory support for investmentclimate reforms, financial sector dialogue and
technical assistance, trade policy advice inconjunctionwith the IntegratedFramework
for Trade and Development, as well as sector work on landregistration.

Inall, five ofelevenproposednewprojects' underthe CAS programswere carriedout
duringFY99-05. The privatizationprojectwas approvedbutneverbecame effective
because o fParliamentary opposition. The proposed series ofthree PSMAC projects was
terminated after one project. Only one o fthe two proposed legal andjudicial projects
was carried out. Support for development of the Aden Free Port was given, after some
delay. Inboththe power andtransport sectors, two projects were proposed. Only one
was approved ineach sector duringthe review period.

Implementationof AAA is harder to track but the pattern o f slippage and dropped work
was similar. A broad-ranging CEM on sources of growth was completed in2002. It also
included a useful InvestmentClimate Assessment. Only one PERwas completed andthe
dialogue on expenditure rationalization didnot last inmost sectors -nor didthe proposed
sector strategy advice. However,the Bank completed a usefil study o f the Budgetary
and PovertyImpact of PetroleumPricing inDecember 2004.

ProgressinAchievingBankObjectives

From 1998-2004 Yemen's real GDP growth slowed down considerably compared to the
precedingsix-year period, averaging 3.7% per year, barely above the population growth
rate o f 3.5%. This partlyreflects the fortunes o f the oil sector. In2004 real output o f oil

                                                                                             2

       and gas was only 11%above that of 1998 (average annual growth rate o f 1.8%) and
       output hasbeen declining since 2002. But slow overall growth also reflects the modest
       growth o f the non-oil economy, an average o f 4.0% per year.

        growth that has taken place. Government services accounted for 28.9% o f non-oil
        growth from 1998 through 2003 -- the most recent year for which data i s available.
       Because o fthe way output o f government services i s usuallymeasured innational
        income accounts -mainly as a fbnction o f government employment -there i s reason to
       be skeptical o fthe actual contribution o fthis sector to growth. Rather, the growth o f
        government employment i s a reflection o fhighoil revenues and i s unsustainable.

        There are also reasons to questionthe contribution and sustainability o f qat, which
        accounted for 9.4% o f incremental growth o fnon-oil output from 1998-2003. Because o f
        its water intensity, qat production plays a key role inthe depletion o fYemen's aquifers.

          water
        much lower than its value added at market prices. See the Box nearby.

        Yemen's short-term macro management was adequate duringthe first halfo fthe review
        period, but faltered duringthe second half. The Government cut expenditures inresponse
        to a sharp drop inthe price o f oil in 1998 andthen maintained expenditure restraint after
        oil prices beganto rise. The current account moved into surplus in 1999 andhas since
        remainedpositive. The overall fiscal balance (including grants) also moved into balance
        in1999 and surplusin2000. However, by2002 anoverall fiscal deficit hadre-emerged
        as revenue fell and expenditures continuedto rise. More importantly, the Government
        failed to come to grips with Yemen's longer-term macroeconomic challenges. Highoil
        prices obscured Yemen's long-term dilemma andreduced the Government's incentive to
        sustain fiscal (and reform) efforts. The IMF has estimated that inorder for Yemen to
        reach a sustainable debt burdeninthe absence o f new oil discoveries, Yemen will need to
        reduce its fiscal deficit by about 2% o f GDP each year for the next 12 years.

        BankContribution

        Growth and diversification The Bank's main contribution to development o f labor-
        intensive non-oil production has been in small-scale fishing development. Ina Fishery
        Sector Strategy Note (Report No. 19288-YEM), the Bankwarnedthat licensing
        agreements with foreign commercial trawlers brought little benefit to the economy,
        impededlocal small-scale fishingdevelopment, andthreatened depletionofcoastal fish
        stocks. The Note recommendedthat hrther lendinginthe sector should be contingenton
        improvingpolicy. The Government responded by strictly enforcing foreign agreements,
        leadingto cancellation o f almost all foreign industrial fishing licenses. Inthe last four
        years small-scale fishing production, employment, and exports all grew at double-digit
        rates, Fishexports in2004 amounted to $210 million, making fish the second largest
        export. A new Bank fisheries project will support fisheries resource management and
        infrastructure for small-scale fishing development.

I                            Box: The Social Cost of Producing Qat
  Qat has been widely grown and used inYemen for centuries. There has long been a tendency
  for outsiders to view qat as a quaint or charming custom and for Yemenis to take a degree of
  ncdbnalpride ina distinctive custom. But inrecent years,rapidly-growing p r o d x t m n a d use
  have ledto an intensified debate over qat and its effects on society.

  The social and health effects of qat use have been especially contentious. Chemically, it i s a
  mildnarcotic similar to amphetamines. Prolongedchewing is necessary to achieve any effect.
  Itis usedmainlyprimarily by groups o fmenwho sit inrooms inthe afternoon chewing qat
  and conversing. The effects are said to be suppression o f appetite and wakefulness.
  Proponents view it as a harmless social convention, promoting social harmony and providing a
  forum for collective decision-malung. Many business and government policy decisions are
  said to be made duringqat sessions. Opponents say it i s harmful to health, leads to
  absenteeism, excludes women, and impoverishes families. Qat use also lowers spending on
  education and even food for poor families.
  Government policy toward qat i s ambivalent. Imports are banned, butproductioni s legal and
  sales are taxedheavily. This contrasts with policy in Saudi Arabia and some other
  neighboring countries where production and consumptionare illegal. A few politicians have
  spoken out against qat use, but there has beenno coordinated anti-qat campaign.
  Though less debated, the effects o f qat productionmay be even more important than that o f
  consumption. Qat production has lifted many rural households out o fpovertybecause it has a
  higher value at market prices than alternative crops such as coffee. But qat has potentially
  disastrous environmental effects. It i s very water-intensive and probably unsustainable. It
  reduces not only current production o f alternative crops, but also the future o f agriculture
  because it i s miningnon-rechargeable fossil aquifers. It also imperils the viability o f urban
  areas inthe highland. The poverty benefits of qat productionare largely illusory, and certainly
  unsustainable. Whatever the social costs o f qat consumption, the real economic and social
  costs o f qat production are much higher than market costs. The contribution of qat to output,
  properly valued for externalities, i s less than measured at market prices.
  The Bank's Agricultural Strategy Note o f 1999 analyzed the costs and benefits o f qat
  production. The analysis showed that the domestic resource cost (DRC) o f qat was above
  average and the report recommendedthat the Government should lift the ban on imports o f
  qat, along with that on competing crops, and that diesel subsidies be eliminatedto reflect
  actual economic costs of pumping. (Imports of qat are equivalent to "virtual imports" of
  water.) The 1999 CAS endorsed these recommendations and also called for Bank support for
  public education on qat. This was fine as far as it went, but the Bank gave fairly low priority
  to its efforts, andthe 2002 CAS had little discussion o f qat and proposed no new programs.



 Inpower andtransport, theBank's contribution was mixed. Project ratings for outcome
 varied from moderately satisfactory to unsatisfactory, but inmost cases institutional
 development was considered modest. The series o f Public Works and Social Fund
 projects were motivated mainly by social protection objectives, but they have had an
 impact on the investment climate as well. The micro credit facility o fthe SFD has
 reportedly been successful inhelpingmicro enterprises, while the contracting and
 supervision methods of these projects have given a boost to small-scale contractors and
 the local contracting industry.

Development of the Aden Free Porthas gone slowly. The Port Development Project only
started inFY03 andthere have been some delays inimplementation. Industrial estates in
Aden andother coastal areashave so far attracted little investment. TheBank did,
however, make a significant ccmhdmtm to P>he

process for contracting out port management after dissolution ofthe original
management agreement. This was not a formal part o fthe Bankproject. Bank assistance
was given on an informal basis, but was instrumental inhelpingconduct an arms-length
search andbiddingprocess.

Perhaps the greatest shortcoming o f the Bank's assistanceprogramwas the failure to
develop a more coherent and aggressive stance on qat production(see Box).     The Bank
helpedsponsor a workshop on qat in2002. Butit shouldhavebuilton its analytical work
to elaborate on qat's productioncosts andbenefits andto linkthis information to water
policy andinstitutions. This could have provided a basis for a more active andbetter-
informed public information program andpolicy dialogue.

Macroeconomic management Although Yemen's short-term macroeconomic
management was adequate duringthe review period, the Government missed an
opportunity afforded byhighoil prices to restructure taxes and expenditure for
sustainable debt andbudget management after oil earnings disappear. The IMFtook the
leadon tax issueswhile the Bank focused mainly on the expenditure side o f fiscal policy.
Bankprojectshavebeen largely unsuccessful inhelpingimprove Yemen's public
expenditure policy. The proposed series o f PSMACs was cut short after one operation.
OEDratedthe outcome o fthat operationmarginally unsatisfactory onthe grounds that it
was too modest for an adjustment operation.

The contribution o fthe Bank's AAA i s more ambiguous. The Bank did less work than
anticipated onpublic expenditure allocation, but a policynote entitled "Budgetary and
Poverty Impacts o f PetroleumPricing inYemen" attracted attention. Buildingon a
longstanding dialogue and other analyticalwork such as an ESMAP study ("Household
Energy Supply and Use inYemen"), the note stressed the highcost o fpetroleumproduct
 subsidies to the budget (6.5% o f GDP in2004) and to resource allocation (overuse o f
pumpedgroundwater andsmugglingo fcheap diesel fuel out o fthe country). The Bank's
note recommended a gradual, pre-announced series o fprice increases to be followed by
 the creation o f an automatic price adjustment mechanismthereafter) combinedwith
 increasedpro-poor spending to offset the impact o fprice increases.

 Inthe event, the Government raisedthe price ofdiesel substantially(from YR 17to YR
 45) inone step on July lgth2005. Although expenditure on social welfare was also
 expanded andother tax and salary adjustments were made, the Government rolled back
 the price o f diesel to YR 35 on July 26thinresponse to mass demonstrations andriots and
 reported deaths o f 36 people. The Bank's approach was inline with best practice inthis
 case -grounded inanalysis and sensitive to protectingthe poor and to considerations o f
 the political economy o f reform. The Government's judgmentwas that it was better to get




                                                                                        5

 thepain o fadjustment over with quickly. Clearly the Bank didnot succeedinpersuading
 the Government to follow a gradual approach.

 Structural and institutional reform The Bank has tried to promote structural and
e i o n dreformintheareas o fprivatization, investrndpmmtmn, fin=-
 . .
 reform, trade reform and integration, and landpolicy. Its efforts inthese areas havebeen
 generally well-designedbut havehad only amodest impact on outcomes.

 The Bank's potential contribution to privatizationwas reduced bythe collapse o fthe
 privatization project. Although the Bankhas continuedto work informally with the
 Government to provide advice on privatization issues, the resources it can devote and the
 influence it canbringto bear on resolving difficult problems are limited. Advice from
 FIASin 1997 underpinnedchangesininvestmentlegislationandthe establishment ofthe
 GIA andExport Council. The institutional changeshavehad only amodest impact on
 the investment climate, however. Some officials inthe Ministryo f Planningwere
 dismissive o f Yemen's investment promotion efforts. Intheir view, Yemen has every
 agency but does not follow through on substantive reforms.

 The Bank has given considerable support for financial sector reform and development,
 butthe impact has beenmodest. A Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC) approved
 inFY98 andcompletedinFYOOwas ratedsatisfactory byOED Theprojecthad
 appropriately limitedobjectives, but implementation o freforms has been slow because o f
 a failure to provide complementary technical assistance. At the end o fFY05 the
 Government issued a decree outlining reforms to restructure public sector banks with
 World Bank support. OED cross-country reviews o f financial sector reform and o f
 FSAPs, however, concludedthat Yemen's financial sector remainsweak andthat Bank
 interventions had a negligible impact.

 Lack o f access to land and insecure registrationhas longbeen identified as important
 obstacles to business development. Both CAS99 and CAS02 proposed to do AAA on
 land issues, but the work was only completed at the endo f FY05. The analysis and
 policy proposals seem sound, but it is too soon to evaluate its impact.

  Overall Assessment

  Outcome The overall outcome for the investmentclimate was moderately
 unsatisfactory. Although short-term macroeconomic performance (growth, inflation,
  fiscal and balance o fpayments deficits) was adequate, much o f this was due to highoil
 prices. But these same highoil prices reduced the incentive to address the longer-term
 macroeconomic challenge o freducing the non-oil fiscal deficit. Growth o f the non-oil
  economy was too low (4% per year on average) to promote diversification andmuch o f
 the growth that didtake place, notably government services and qat production, was o f
  questionable benefit for long-term development. Progress on structural and institutional
 reforms such as privatization, trade policy, financial sector development, and investment
 promotion was modest. Progress incombating the critical constraint o f corruption was




                                                                                          6

negligible. Finally, exogenous events reduced security, though strenuous Government
efforts have yielded some improvements inrecent years.

Institutional development Institutionaldevelopment has beenmodest. Although
inv3        4    .  l.     t      h       e      D        m       -                     L
promotion and export agencies were established, these do not yet function very
effectively. There have been some improvements inbankingsupervision andregulation.
The Technical Privatization Office established at the Bank's recommendation has
effectively promoted privatization (or liquidation) o f small-scale enterprises, but major
companies havenot yet beenprivatized. Some improvements inpublic financial
management are underway, but tax and expenditure policy i s still largely ad hoc.

Sustainability Because o fthe precarious security situation, continued corruption, and
uncertainty inthe long-term economic outlook, sustainability does not seem likely. The
risks o f deterioration inthe investment climate seem to outweighprospects for
improvement. Nonetheless, what needs to be done i s well understoodbythe Government
and a crisis mayhelp galvanize action as it didwhen oilprices fell in 1998.

Bank contribution The Bank's assistance strategy has been largely relevant to Yemen's
needs for improving the investment climate, with the exception o f a failure to link the
 issue o f qat production andthe critical water constraint. The Bank's Investment Climate
 Assessments have helped focus attentionon critical constraints to improving the
 investment climate, and AAA on oil pricing, public financial management, and
 (belatedly) landissues has created a good basis for policy dialogue and fbture action in
 important areas. The impact or efficacy o f the Bank's assistance inbringingabout
 improvements inthe investment climate has been limited, however. The Bank's program
 was for the most part too ambitious to be implemented, especially inthe post 9/11
 environment, but the main limitingfactor was the Government lack o freceptivity.
