The loan supports government\n            efforts toward the resolution of suspended finance companies\n            and ensuring safety aqnd resiliency of the remaining finance\n            companies through: a) better handling of weak companies; b)\n            strengthening prudential regulation; and c) ensuring that\n            finance companies pursue more viable strategies. The\n            operation also sets the agenda for future reform of all\n            financial institutions by initiating action to improve the\n            incentive for financial market participants to be prudent\n            and responsible in their decisions.
