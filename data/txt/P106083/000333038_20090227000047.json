Reduction Support\n            Grant (PRSG-5) continues to support the Government of Rwanda\n            (GoR) as it implements measures to foster broad based growth\n            in the context of enhanced decentralization reforms. PRSG-5\n            is the second operation in the second series of PRSGs.\n            PRSG-5 focuses on reforms to ease human capital and\n            infrastructure constraints to growth, foster fiscal\n            decentralization, and strengthen the results orientation of\n            the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the budget\n            process. Continued capacity support to enable implementation\n            of reforms to financial management and the budget and\n            procurement frameworks is also envisioned. Overall, the\n            operation will emphasize support for reforms that promote\n            increased spending efficiency, to lay the foundation for\n            increased absorption and effectiveness of higher aid\n            inflows. This program document outlines the components of\n            the operation. Discussion of the country context in section\n            two focuses on economic developments in realizing key\n            outcomes targeted by the EDPRS. Section three outlines the\n            GoR's program followed by the discussion of the\n            Bank's support to the GoR's strategy in section\n            four. Section five describes the areas to be supported under\n            PRSG-5. Section six concludes with an overview of the\n            implementation arrangements, benefits and risks of the\n            proposed operation."}, "docdt": "2009-02-13T00:00:00Z"}
