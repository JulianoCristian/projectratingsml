Strategy\n            Grant Project (PRSG-4) for Rwanda continues to support the\n            Government of Rwanda (GoR) as it implements the next steps\n            in its reform program to support growth, now being\n            undertaken in the context of enhanced decentralization\n            reforms. Within this context, the PRSG-4 is expected to help\n            the GoR to : 1) maintain a stable macroeconomic framework,\n            put in place reforms to ease the human capital and\n            infrastructure constraints to growth, with the aim of\n            creating a strong basis for private sector-led economic\n            growth, driven by agricultural transformation, promotion of\n            exports, deepening of the financial sector, and the use o f\n            information communications technology; 2) strengthen further\n            the linkages between strategic planning and the Medium-Term\n            Expenditure Framework (MTEF), by broadening the focus on\n            service delivery to include more strongly the agriculture,\n            transport, and financial sectors, while continuing to\n            maintain and deepen the progress made in the education,\n            health, water, and energy sectors; and 3) continue improving\n            governance and transparency through capacity support to\n            enable implementation of completed reforms to financial\n            management, and the budget and procurement frameworks, with\n            a particular emphasis on strengthening the process of fiscal\n            decentralization. Expected benefits are as follows: 1) in\n            creased access to infrastructure services while continuing\n            to consolidate and improve access to education and health\n            services to increase the supply of skilled labor in the\n            workforce; 2) improved efficiency of spending by supporting\n            reforms to strengthen the MTEF and public procurement\n            process; 3) strengthened capacity to implement through\n            support to civil service reforms to improve ministerial\n            structures and provide incentives to staff, increase skills\n            of the civil service and reduce turn-over."}, "docdt": "2008-01-15T00:00:00Z"}
