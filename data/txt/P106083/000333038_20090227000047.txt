Program Development  The proposed operation will contribute to the strategic outcomes outlined in the CAS by focusing
Objective(s) and     support on two EDPRS flagship programs ­ Growth for Jobs and Exports, and Governance Support
Contribution to CAS  to these two flagship areas will be aimed at: (i) raising agricultural production in a sustainable
                       manner; (ii) increasing access to infrastructure services; (iii) strengthening the framework for post-
                       basic education, with the aim of building a skilled workforce and promoting science and technology;
                     (iv) deepening the financial sector including capacity building measures to facilitate increased
                       access to finance by micro-enterprises; and (v) strengthening the management of public resources at
                       the central and local levels. The operation complements the sector budget support operation being
                       developed to support continued reforms in health and the implementation of the Village Umurenge
                     Program (VUP).       PRSG-5 preparation capitalizes on the much improved, fully government-led
                     donor coordination, a direct result of the budget support program in Rwanda. It draws from the
                     recently completed Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) for monitoring the
                     EDPRS, to reduce the transaction costs of Government reporting to donors on the use of aid funds.
Risks and Risks      The main risks to the program arise from two areas: (i) continued instability in the Great Lakes sub-
Mitigation           region and the effects on economic stability and donor support; (ii) continued global economic
                     slowdown. Though international and regional efforts to mitigate instability in the Great Lakes sub-
                     region are continuing there is a substantial risk of flare ups in the eastern Congo. The Bank supports
                     efforts aimed at fostering peace and security between Rwanda and its neighbors.              Internally
                     Rwanda's security and political situation remains stable. Predictability of donor financing, is an
                     issue, though alignment of donor disbursements with the GoR's budget cycle has improved. Risks
                     associated with capacity weaknesses in the country's fiduciary framework, will be addressed through
                     the PFM Action Plan. The second PRSG series (covering PRSG-4 to PRSG-6), supports the GoR's
                       capacity building efforts in the above areas. There is also a downside risk to Rwanda's economic
                       growth should the global slowdown persist. The immediate risk would arise from a likely increase
                       in the external account deficit from potential reductions in the commitments of budget support
                       donors. The Bank will closely monitor the situation and could provide supplemental financing as
                       needed. Government will continue its policy of identifying areas for contingent spending should
                       more external resources become available. It will also continue to protect priority spending from
                       any reductions in overall spending. Finally, it will continue with measures to expand the tax base
                       and improve the efficiency of the tax system.

                                     PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
            PROPOSED FIFTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT GRANT (PRSG-5)
                                   TO THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA


                                          I. INTRODUCTION


1.      The proposed Fifth Poverty Reduction Support Grant (PRSG-5) continues to support the
Government of Rwanda as it implements measures to foster broad based growth in the context of
enhanced decentralization reforms. PRSG-5 is the second operation in the second series of PRSGs
(beginning with PRSG-4). It forms an integral part of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),
approved by the Board of Executive Directors on September 26, 2008 in support of the Government's
Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS). The EDPRS covers the period 2008-
2012 and takes stock of a decade of achievements in rehabilitation and reconstruction, presenting a
strategy focused on accelerating growth and human development, with emphasis on decentralization, and
a greater role for the private sector. The EDPRS priorities are articulated through three flagship programs:
Sustainable Growth for Jobs and Exports; Vision 2020 Umurenge, focused on community development;
and Governance.

2.      The EDPRS highlights the importance of enhanced decentralization to provide equitable,
efficient, and effective pro-poor service delivery while promoting local development in an
environment of good governance. The Government's strategy reflects its commitment to transform the
society and overcome the causes and consequences of the genocide which are seen to have been due to
poor governance and a lack of local voice and empowerment. This provides the rationale for GoR's
model of democratization, grounded in a decentralized administration to promote peace and
reconciliation, with the aim of facilitating increased participation of local communities in defining their
own development.

3.      In line with the EDPRS, the second PRSG series supports measures to generate sustained
economic growth, emphasizing improved delivery of economic and infrastructure services. The
PRSG series focuses on the Growth for Jobs and Exports, and Governance, pillars of the EDPRS, and is
centered on 5 priority areas: (i) raising agricultural production in a sustainable manner; (ii) improving
access to and quality of key economic infrastructure services; (iii) strengthening the framework for post-
basic education, with the aim of building a skilled workforce and promoting science and technology; (iv)
deepening and widening the financial sector; (v) strengthening management of public resources at the
central and local levels.

4.      The second PRSG series, starting with PRSG-4, complements the Community Living
Standards Grant (CLSG) currently under preparation.             The CLSG is a sector development policy
grant concentrated on Government efforts to strengthen service delivery to the poorest and most
vulnerable. It defines a 3-year program of support to the Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP) with a
focus on the social protection and health sectors. The program will strengthen implementation of public
works employment, cash transfer to the poor and landless, and delivery of high impact health and
nutrition interventions at the community level.

5.      PRSG-5 focuses on reforms to ease human capital and infrastructure constraints to growth,
foster fiscal decentralization, and strengthen the results orientation of the MTEF and the budget
process. Continued capacity support to enable implementation of reforms to financial management and
the budget and procurement frameworks is also envisioned.           Overall, the operation will emphasize




                                                   1

support for reforms that promote increased spending efficiency, to lay the foundation for increased
absorption and effectiveness of higher aid inflows.

6.       PRSG-5 is the first in the PRSG series to be fully aligned with the Common Performance
Assessment Framework. PRSG-4 was prepared as a transition operation that allowed sufficient space
and time for consultation in preparing the Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF). This
approach, discussed and endorsed by Government and donors, enabled the Bank to respond in a timely
manner to the GoR's urgent need for resources. PRSG-4 actions were therefore developed in the context
of initial consultations during preparation of the CPAF, drawing from the key areas of the EDPRS and the
related EDPRS policy matrix.

7.       The CPAF has been developed under the leadership of the Government of Rwanda (GoR)
and in close collaboration with donors and other development partners. The policy measures and
indicators have been prioritized based on consultation and discussions held both through the sector
reviews and sector working groups, as well as the Joint Budget Support Group. Prior actions and triggers
for PRSG-5 are taken directly from the CPAF and reflect the broad based consultation undertaken in-
country in its preparation. However, all stakeholders also recognize the need to strengthen the policy
actions included in the CPAF. The Bank team will continue to work with other donors to support
Government in refining the policy actions to ensure these are outcome oriented and appropriately tied to
the relevant indicators. In that regard, the updated Partnership Framework includes agreed guidelines for
updates to the CPAF, as the policy context evolves. This will also enable the strengthening of policy
actions in the outer years. Box 3 in section IV of this program document summarizes the process used to
develop the CPAF.

8.       The remainder of this program document outlines the components of the proposed
operation.    Discussion of the country context in Section II focuses on economic developments in
realizing key outcomes targeted by the EDPRS. Section III outlines the GoR's program followed by the
discussion of the Bank's support to the GoR's strategy in section IV. Section V describes the areas to be
supported under PRSG-5. Section VI concludes with an overview of the implementation arrangements,
benefits and risks of the proposed operation.

                                A.   RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

Recent Growth Performance


9.       Rwanda's economy has remained resilient over the last five years, with GDP estimated in
2008 to be US $4.2 billion in nominal terms, enabling the country to sustain macroeconomic
stability despite exogenous shocks that affected agricultural productivity. Estimates are that the
economy grew by 8.5 percent in 2008, fueled, in large part, by a strong recovery in agriculture, which
grew by nearly 15 percent, with the ongoing expansion of the crop intensification program (CIP). This
contrasts with the 7.9 percent growth that occurred in 2007 which was driven by growth in the services
and manufacturing sectors as agricultural output expanded by just less than 1 percent in 2007 due mainly
to poor weather conditions. In 2008, the services and industrial sectors, as well as private consumption,
continued to expand but at a slower pace (see Table 1), while growth in investment remained rapid. To
date, the recent global economic slowdown, which has brought down commodity prices has not affected
overall growth due to the small share of exports in GDP. Nevertheless, short-term risks to economic
growth may have increased due to likely effects of the slowdown on FDI, remittances, and external
finance.

10.       Rwanda appears to have fully exhausted the growth effects of the post-conflict
reconstruction period; sustained growth over the short-term will depend heavily on the agricultural
sector. Average real GDP growth rates showed a considerable slow-down from an annual rate of about
10.5 percent attained over 1996-02 ­ the first few years following the conflict--to 5.6 percent over the
period 2003-2007. Average growth over this period is below the annual minimum of 8 percent needed to
meet the GoR's poverty reduction target for the MDG.1 The strong performance of agriculture in 2008
helped raise average annual growth to 6.1 percent over the period 2003-08, demonstrating that raising
agricultural productivity is critical for attaining higher growth and reducing poverty. This is an area that
needs to be prioritized over the short-term, to meet the broad based growth and poverty reduction targets,
given that over 80 percent of the population is employed by the agriculture sector.

11.       Global increases in fuel prices through September 2008 and the subsequent economic slow
down have caused further challenges to achieving growth targets. In a context where external shocks
and structural constraints have led to declining growth in the agricultural sector, ongoing developments in
global commodity markets have severely affected the country's level of competitiveness and
consequently its ability to sustain growth. As a land-locked country in which transport costs represent as
high as 40 percent of export and import values, Rwanda is particularly vulnerable to global increases in
fuel costs. In 2008, the higher cost of fuel which translated to higher transport costs had a significant
impact on domestic food and fertilizer prices. The higher fertilizer prices posed a risk to the
Government's program to strengthen agricultural productivity, which was mitigated through the
supplemental financing to PRSG-4.

12.       Higher fuel and food prices contributed to an increase in inflation from 9.1 percent in 2007
to an estimated level of 15 percent by end-2008. Average inflation increased slightly from 8.9 to 9.1
percent between 2006 and 2007 despite higher food and energy prices due in part to GoR's consistently
prudent macroeconomic management. However, during 2007, core inflation ­ i.e excluding energy and
food prices ­ incurred strong upward pressure resulting in an estimate of 9.7 percent annual growth,
mostly due to one-off tariff increases in education, health and water and the rise in housing costs of
almost 50 percent during the year. By end-2008, annual average inflation is estimated to have increased
sharply partly as a result of high international commodity prices and domestic demand pressures.
Pressures on prices are expected to ease in 2009 as import prices for fuel and food decline.

  Estimates based on household surveys suggest that modest reductions in the incidence of poverty were achieved from
60.percent to 56.9 percent between 2000/01 and 2005/06.

External Balance

13.      Import growth exceeded the increase in exports, leading to a substantial worsening of the
trade balance in 2007 and 2008 (see Table 2). In 2007, exports increased by 20.1 percent (f.o.b., US
Dollar terms), mainly due to an expansion of the volume of mining exports and the commodity price
boom. Traditional exports, on the other hand, performed poorly, with the value of coffee exports
contracting by almost 40 percent, mainly due to adverse weather conditions and the slight decline in the
value of tea exports. Growing imports of capital goods as well as intermediate goods for infrastructure
projects in line with higher public capital spending were the main contributors to the large increase of
imports (30.2 percent in US Dollar terms, f.o.b.). The higher fuel prices negatively impacted the current
account balance in 2007, but the effect was mitigated by a gradual reduction of import tariffs and excise
taxes. The surge in food prices did not affect the external balance negatively in 2007, but the pass-
through was stronger in 2008 compared to 2007, because of relatively higher world prices. Inflation
targets have been revised upwards and preliminary estimates suggest that rising fuel and food prices
added 1.6 percent of GDP to the current account deficit in 2008 (see Box 1 for the likely effects, over the
next year or two, of the global economic slow down).

14.      There has been a worsening of the current account deficit in 2008 compared to 2007. Much
of this has been driven by the continued slowdown in global demand coupled with high international
prices. An increase in the trade and services deficit between 2007 and 2008 has been the main driver of
the worsening current account deficit (including official transfers) which increased from 4.9 to 7.1
percent. The widening of the current account deficit would be compounded by a possible decrease in
donor grants should the global recession deepen.

Fiscal Performance

15.      The fiscal stance remained expansionary over 2008.            Total expenditure and net lending
increased from 24.9 to 27.1 percent of GDP between 2007 and 2008 (see Figure 1). This increase in
spending in 2008, in part, reflected a supplementary budget approved late in the year for additional
priority spending (in education, health, infrastructure and agriculture which accounted for roughly half of
spending). The result was a widening of the fiscal deficit (before grants) in 2008 to an estimated 13.8
percent of GDP from 11.1 percent in 2007. The rise in public expenditure has been financed by increases
in domestic revenues. Fiscal revenues as a percent of GDP rose from 13.6 percent of GDP in 2007 to
14.2 percent of GDP in 2008 due to higher growth and inflation, as well as taxation of growing imports.
The higher domestic tax revenue was largely attributable to revenue collection efforts. External grant
financing increased to 13 percent of GDP in 2008, from 9.8 percent in 2007.

Monetary and Financial Sector Policies and Performance

16.      The Rwanda Franc remained stable against the US Dollar in 2008. The nominal exchange
rate depreciated by 2.7 percent, year-on-year at the end of 2008, while the real effective exchange rate for
the first 8 months of 2008 appreciated by less then 0.5 percent on average compared to 2007. A new
method of determining the exchange rate was introduced in February 2008 and modified in June 2008 to
allow more exchange rate flexibility. The previous auction-based system to sell foreign currencies was
abolished in June 2007 and the NBR is now selling foreign exchange directly to commercial banks at the
day-to-day reference rate. A weekly adjustment is carried out against the US Dollar, based on the
performance of foreign exchange sales which is compared to a weekly target derived from the annual
projected amount of foreign exchange sales.

17.      The central bank is increasingly relying on the sale of foreign exchange to sterilize excess
liquidity and limit the sale of domestic instruments to meet the reserve money target agreed under
the PRGF.      Rising prices and the increased demand for money and currency in circulation also
contributed to a tight monetary situation. This led to a reduction in the excess reserves of banks. As a
result of the tighter monetary stance, broad money declined indicating a reduction in the monetary
overhang that persisted through early 2008 and that was caused by expansionary fiscal spending.
Government will continue to rely more on maintaining the flexibility of the exchange rate to contain the
growth in the money supply.

18.      Broad money supply (M2) growth slowed in 2008. M2 grew by 13.6 percent in 2008 compared
to 31 percent in 2007, reflecting the tighter monetary policy and reduction in the monetary overhang.
Budget support, development projects and private transfers contributed to the accumulation of foreign
reserves from US $552 million at the end of 2007 to US $599 million at the end of 2008 (representing a
growth rate of 9 percent). As a result, reserves remained at around 5 months of imports. Net credit to the
private sector, grew by 21 percent in 2007 and 20 percent in 2008. Credit to Government continued to
decrease in 2008 due to the high volume of external disbursements.

19.      To control inflation, the central bank uses various instruments, including setting the level of
reserve requirements, money market interventions, as well as an interest rate corridor and a policy
rate. Besides the overnight and 7-day instruments, a 4-week instrument has been reintroduced and
repurchase agreement operations ranging from 1 to 90 days have been established in 2008. The interest
rate structure of the money market will be adapted to the new instrument. Overall, the financial sector
indicators attest to the soundness of the sector and financial sector reforms are guided by the Financial

Sector Development Plan (FSDP), which was launched in 2007 to promote the growth and efficiency of
the financial sector. Recent progress includes the recapitalization of commercial banks, amendments to
the central bank act to enable the NBR to regulate insurance companies, the compliance of a number of
microfinance institutions with the new and higher capital requirements and the ongoing restructuring of
the payment system.

Debt Sustainability

20.     Debt as a share of GDP remains low (about 17 percent of GDP as of end-2007) following the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative in 2006. Domestic debt as a percentage of GDP fell from 12.1
percent in 2006 to 10.7 percent in 2007. However, despite stronger than expected export performance,
Rwanda's external debt situation was slightly less favorable. The NPV of external debt-to-exports ratio
rose to 72 at the end of 2007, up from 67 percent at end 2006. In terms of the composition by creditor,
about 72 percent of the public debt at end -2007 was with multilaterals and 12 percent with bi-laterals, the
remainder being domestic debt.

21.     The most recent DSA concludes that Rwanda is now at a moderate risk of debt distress due
to its narrow export base. With the exception of the net present value of exports to debt which breaches
the threshold of 150 under extreme stress tests, all debt indicators remain below their respective
thresholds. Exogenous shocks to exports or imprudent borrowing on non-concessional terms could cause
a rapid deterioration in the medium-term outlook. In response, the GoR has to date limited external debt
and kept to a minimum 50 percent grant element. In addition, a debt management strategy has been
prepared with limits for loans, government guarantees and contingent liabilities that will guide future
borrowing to prevent the reemergence of unsustainable debt.

22.     The infrastructure gap and large financing needs pose a significant challenge.
Considerations by the Government to partly finance large multiyear projects in priority sectors, necessary
to address the severe infrastructure constraints and boost agricultural productivity, on less concessional
terms, would result in a breach of the policy-dependent threshold of 150 percent by 2013. However, even
with this non-concessional financing, the NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio and the NPV of debt-to-
revenue ratios will remain well below their thresholds, while debt service payments will continue to be
manageable at below 10 percent of exports.

                  B.     MEDIUM TERM PROSPECTS AND FINANCING REQUIREMENTS

23.     The GoR's medium term outlook is for real GDP growth to be maintained at 6 percent with
economic growth being driven by increased productivity in the agricultural and service sectors,
accompanied by strong public and private sector investment activity. This outlook is contingent on
favorable weather conditions in the next few years, continued implementation of policies to promote
commodity exports and successful implementation of the medium-term policy agenda as outlined in the
EDPRS on five fronts: (i) carrying out Government's planned investments in infrastructure; (ii)
improving agricultural yields, supported by actions in the new fertilizer strategy; (iii) sustaining progress
on the private sector development program; (iv) accelerating overall export growth and diversifying the
export base; and (v) taking actions aimed at enhancing the efficiency of investment as outlined in the new
Public Investment Policy. This would counter the apparent slowdown in growth, as the economy has
moved beyond the post-conflict recovery period, and raise growth from the average of 5.6 percent during
2003-2007 to about 6 percent over the period 2009-2011.

24.     The projected annual GDP growth of 6 percent would be sustained through increased
public and private sector investments to improve agriculture productivity and address
infrastructure constraints to growth. Reflecting the strong emphasis that GoR is placing on public



                                                  6

infrastructure investment, overall investment rates are projected to rise fairly steadily from about 21
percent of GDP in 2007, to about 23 percent of GDP by 2011. Public investment will increase from 8.6
percent in 2007 to close to 10 percent of GDP by 2011. With the private sector's engagement in the
social sectors and also in infrastructure expected to be strengthened, private investment would also trend
upward gradually to about 13 percent of GDP per year, in the medium-term.

25.      Strong import growth stemming from higher capital imports associated with the expanding
public investment program, is expected to outpace moderate expansion in exports, resulting in a
higher current account deficit. Export volumes led by receipts from traditional exports and tourism, are
forecasted to increase at a relatively slower rate as the GoR implements its export promotion strategy,
supported by the PRSG series. This is expected to widen the external current account deficit considerably
from about 5 percent of GDP (including grants) in 2007, to about 9.5 percent of GDP (including grants)
by 2011.

26.      Government capital spending would increase strongly over the medium term, in line with
the need for increased investment to accelerate and sustain growth, causing the overall fiscal balance to
remain in deficit. The deficit (including grants) would widen to about 3.0 percent of GDP by 2011, up
sharply from under 1.6 percent in 2007. Part of this increase would be due to higher investment, but the
projections also reflect the possibility of a continued high projected world price level of imports to
Rwanda.

27.      The share of priority spending will increase annually by about 2 percent of GDP depending
on the availability of sufficient resources. More resources will be dedicated to public infrastructure,
agriculture, education, health and water. Increased spending in the education sector will go towards
improving delivery of primary education and vocational training and skills development. In the heath
sector, focus will be on financing programs to improve primary heath care, financing of the mutuelle
scheme and purchase of drugs. Infrastructure spending will be geared towards addressing the issue of
limited and insufficient energy through construction of hydro power dams, generation of power from the
Lake Kivu Methane gas power plant, and rehabilitation of infrastructure. At the decentralized level,
transfers to districts are projected to increase as the Government implements its fiscal decentralization
policy, with increases in capitation grants in education and performance based financing in the health
sector, feeder roads financing in the transport sector and funds to cover district overhead costs.

28.      Consistent with the medium-term policy objective of maintaining macroeconomic stability,
the Central Bank is expected to contain inflationary pressures from any fiscal expansion and
scaled-up external assistance. Average inflation is expected to decline from around 15 percent in 2008,
due to rising food, transport and energy prices, to single digits by 2009. The reduction in inflation reflects
the price pass through from declining international food prices and domestic policy. Projections are that
with strong implementation of monetary policy, inflation could decline to single digits over 2009-12.

29.      The above medium-term outlook assumes that Rwanda continues to be able to cushion itself
from the adverse impacts of the global slow down. The impact of the global slow down on Rwanda's
economic growth rates, over the medium term, will depend on how strongly the drivers of growth ­i.e.
agriculture and services-- are impacted. Some of the large scale investments that are expected to be
funded from external borrowing and investment in the energy and agriculture sectors will be critical for
growth. These could be adversely impacted as the global economic slow down persists and external
resources become scarce. All of this could potentially lead to stronger adverse growth effects in the
medium to longer term.

30.      Continuation of the global economic slowdown would result in significant downside risks to
the balance of payments, remittances, FDI, and external finance. The greater risk to the balance of



                                                    7

payments would result from a reduction in grants should budget support donors have to substantially
curtail their commitments. External finance as a share of GDP amounts to 13 percent (or close to 50
percent of the budget). In contrast remittances and FDI, although they have increased significantly in
recent years, are still estimated, in total, to be around 5 percent of GDP. Therefore, the greater immediate
risk to the Government program would arise from a sudden and significant reduction in grants.

                       Box 1: Likely Impact of the Global Economic Crisis in Rwanda, 2008-2010

At present, the global economic slowdown has had a limited effect on Rwanda's economy due to its relatively closed
nature. However, a continued global slowdown would negatively effect GDP growth through the impact on grants, foreign
investment, remittances and the financial sector. There would need to be a downward revision on spending as revenue declines,
particularly if foreign aid becomes scarce. Export receipts would also be negatively affected leading to a widening of the current
account deficit. Also, health and education outcomes are particularly susceptible to household economic conditions. Financing
of services could be adversely affected due to lower revenues, reduced household ability to pay user fees, and any potential
reductions in grants.

A continued global slowdown would lead to projected growth of around 6 percent (compared to 8.5 percent for 2008),
over the medium term. The lower growth trend would arise from lower tourism receipts, reduction in remittances and a
slowdown in the construction sector. Over the medium term, growth would be driven by increased productivity in agriculture in
line with implementation of the Crop Intensification Program. The expected impact of the crisis over the medium-term is
expected to be relatively limited due both to the low level of integration with the global economy and the relatively high
dependence on subsistence agriculture.

Despite the strong increase in export receipts of coffee, tea, minerals and tourism, the trade deficit is expected to widen in
2009 due to the higher growth in import payments. An appreciation of the Rwandan franc would exacerbate the situation.
Over the medium term, with continued strong growth in volume and production, exports are projected to grow at 10 percent per
annum, which will be outpaced by imports growth of 20 percent per annum. As a result, the current account deficit is projected
to increase from US $303.5 million (or 7.1 percent of GDP) in 2008 to US $400.7 million (or 8.2 percent of GDP) in 2009
(including official transfers). To date, no large reductions in foreign direct investment (FDI), grants and borrowing are
expected as most planned investments have already been reconfirmed by donors. Although there are no visible pressures on
the balance of payment yet, a continued global recession would eventually lead to lower grants. As a precaution, given last
year's high level of inflation, GoR will reduce spending if necessary.

The fiscal program in 2008 remained broadly on track despite increased expenditures for the purchase of seed, fertilizer,
and food storage (largely financed by grants from IDA and AfDB, and the road maintenance fund). Revenues outperformed
their targets reflecting an increase in collections from income and consumption taxes, high inflation and GDP growth. Although
it is too early to get a good assessment of the overall and concrete impacts of the global financial crisis, the authorities are taking
proactive measures to mitigate any possible negative impacts. In its mini-budget for January to June 2009, fiscal policy is aiming
at: i) limiting contingent spending; and ii) saving higher-than-programmed revenues for future use. The budget deficit is
expected to remain on track for 2009 due partly to these measures.

In terms of the financial sector, all 8 commercial banks have been in compliance with the minimum capital requirements
of FRw 5 billion (approx. $9.2 million); foreign exchange exposure ratios reported have been within the prudential BNR
benchmarks; and the quality of the credit portfolio has improved. As of end June 2008, gross non-performing loans (NPLs)
reached FRw 32.2 billion against FRw 40.1 billion in December 2007 and the average ratio of NPLs to total loans declined to 12
percent from 18.5 percent in 2007. Although to date there is yet no impact of the crisis on the level of capitalization of banks and
NPLs, slower growth could result in rising credit risks increasing the vulnerability of the banking sector.

To manage the pressure of high resource inflows on inflation, the Central Bank has instituted measures to increase the
flexibility of the exchange rate enabling more effective sterilization of liquidity (which is the Central Bank's primary
instrument for monetary policy). In the last six months, the real exchange rate appreciated by 15 percent following the rise in the
US dollar--to which the Rwandan franc is closely tied--against other currencies. It has been exacerbated by the high rate of
domestic inflation (estimated at 22 percent in December 2008). The result has been a rising demand for foreign exchange and
imports. This acceleration in imports relative to exports is a concern for the authorities even as world commodity prices continue
to fall. Despite higher sales of foreign currency by the authorities, foreign exchange reserves exceeded programmed levels due to
higher than expected external budget support disbursements. As a result, the actual level of international reserves was $580.7
million at end September 2008, and is estimated to have increased to $599 million by end-2008.


Adequacy of the Macro-Economic Policy Framework

31.        Overall, the medium term macro-economic framework is assessed to be sound and adequate
to support the Government's program. As noted by the recently completed fifth review of the IMF's



                                                               8

PRGF, the medium-term outlook, including inflation, economic growth and financing remains favorable,
even though risks of contagion from the deteriorating external environment have increased. GoR will
continue to exercise prudence in implementation of macro-economic policy with a focus on ensuring
coordinated fiscal and monetary policies. It will also continue with structural reforms that will help raise
investment rates, expand the private sector, deepen the financial sector, and diversify the production and
export base. In particular, there is an emphasis on private sector led growth through the development of a
Public Investment Program, implementation of the Financial Sector Development Plan and the Rural
Development Program. Investments are planned to improve agriculture productivity, reduce soil erosion
and improve irrigation. There is also evidence that the investments in the energy sector aimed at reducing
the dependence on thermal power is paying off with the progress made in power generation in the Lake
Kivu electricity project. This along with investments in the Nyaborongo hydro-power project will help
reduce the cost of energy to firms and households. GoR is also now in the process of developing a
strategic plan for post-basic education to address the issue of skills development. These measures should
help to expand productivity and establish the foundation for long-term sustainable growth.

32.     In terms of external financing, GoR will continue to rely mainly on grants and highly
concessional borrowing to safeguard debt sustainability. Borrowing decisions will be guided by the
new debt management strategy and a medium-term public expenditure management framework.
Infrastructure projects that are needed to alleviate bottlenecks to private sector growth will be carefully
evaluated on a case-by-case basis in terms of their cost-effectiveness and impact on the public debt. In
addition, the ongoing and planned reforms in public financial management that are outlined in the
Government's Public Financial Management Strategy and Action Plan will help ensure that public
resources are allocated efficiently. Finally, GoR will continue its efforts to expand the local tax base and
improve tax administration, with the aim of increasing revenue collection and reducing the dependence on
aid.

External Financial Requirements

33.     Strong import growth stemming from higher capital imports associated with an expanding
public investment program, is expected to outpace moderate expansion in exports, led by receipts



                                                                   9

from traditional exports (particularly coffee), and tourism. This will keep the current account in deficit
and rising over the medium term. Accordingly, external financing requirements would grow to about
$2.66 billion over 2009-2011. With about $2.62 billion in identified financing (largely from grants,
concessional loans, and private capital inflows, including foreign direct investment), the program is fully
financed during PRSG-5. For the PRSG-6 period, the projection is that the program will continue to be
fully financed. Should there be an unforeseen shortfall of grants (compared to projections), Government
will revise the spending plan as needed.


                                  III. GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM


34.      The Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS), the Government's
second-generation PRSP that lays out a development plan for 2008-2012, was launched in
September 2007. It outlines the strategies and actions to stimulate rapid growth and lead to the reduction
of poverty in line with the Government's national vision document (Vision 2020) and the MDGs, under
three flagships:     (i) Sustainable Growth for Jobs and Exports; (ii) Vision 2020 Umurenge; and
(iii)Governance.

35.      The EDPRS builds upon and aims to consolidate gains achieved under the PRSP-1 reform
program. The broad reform program, (summarized in Annex 6), is focused on laying the overarching
institutional/ legal/regulatory framework, for the key areas of focus of the PRSP. Several key pieces of
legislation were enacted under PRSP-1, including the updated Organic Budget Law, the Organic
Education Law, the Land Law, and the Procurement Law, thereby establishing the legal and regulatory
framework for the implementation of the EDPRS in these critical areas. In addition, sector strategy
development was advanced in the Agriculture, Health and Education sectors with the adoption of the
Strategic Plan for Agricultural Transformation (PSTA), the Health Sector Strategic Plan (2005-2009), and
the Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP 2005-2008). In the agriculture sector, several new agencies
were created to support the institutional reforms needed to strengthen the research and extension system,
as well as improve inspection and quality. These agencies include the Rwanda Agricultural Development
Authority which is charged with development of appropriate technologies and the dissemination of these
through advisory, outreach and extension services to stakeholders in the agriculture sector with the aim of
modernizing the sector. In the livestock sector, research and extension is under the purview of the
Rwanda Animal Resources Development Authority.              In addition, the former Rwanda Investment
Promotion Agency was restructured into the Rwanda Investment and Export Promotion Agency to
strengthen its role in export promotion and trade facilitation. The office of tourism promotion (ORTPN)
was restructured to better support development of the sector. In the case of public financial management
and procurement, the School of Finance and Banking was created to support development of the
accounting and finance professionals which has been direly lacking. Furthermore, the National Tender
Board was created with the aim of improving transparency in procurement; the Office of the Accountant
General was created, and that of the Auditor General was restructured to align with the updated Organic
Budget Law.

Progress in implementation under Flagship 1: Growth for Jobs and Exports

36.      Recent reforms under this flagship have focused on deepening the financial sector,
improving the quality of infrastructure and related services, fostering increased trade and regional
integration, and laying the foundation for a more skilled labor force. Progress in the implementation
of the Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP), adopted in 2007, is evident from recent laws that have
been passed to improve regulation of insurance companies and combat money laundering (passed
respectively in July and October of 2008). Reforms have also focused on consolidating the banking and
insurance supervision, in line with international standards; and development of a payment systems bill to



                                                   10

establish a clear framework for oversight for the central bank and settlements. In addition, the Union des
Banques Populaire (UBPR), previously a large microfinance network obtained a commercial banking
license in mid-February 2008 and entered into a strategic partnership with a banking group from the
Netherlands which now owns 35 percent of the shares in UBPR. Micro-finance institutions also complied
with higher minimum capital requirements in 2008.          Finally, an over-the counter debt market was
launched in January 2008, listing four bonds, and the Capital Market Advisory Council was established.
Furthermore, the Executive Secretariat of the Council is operational and the first bonds have been issued.


37.      Aside from reforms to strengthen the financial sector, Rwanda is engaged in a number of
regional initiatives in the energy and transport sectors to improve road transport and connectivity
of trade routes. Some of these initiatives are financed by the World Bank. These include investments to
strengthen transport and communication links to markets in neighboring countries that are being financed
through the East Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation Project, the Regional Trade Facilitation Project,
and the Regional Communications Infrastructure Project which are discussed further in section IV below.
Rwanda is also engaged in regional initiatives to develop greater ICT connectivity in the region.


38.      Within the country, several laws have been passed in the power sector with the aim of
establishing the institutional, legal and regulatory framework to promote increased private sector
involvement in the electricity and transport sectors ­namely, through public private partnerships. Two
separate laws were enacted to separate the electricity and water utilities with the aim of improving cost
recovery and efficient service provision. Also, the National Energy Development Agency was created to
promote and facilitate implementation of energy policy and strategy, supporting pilot activities and
capacity building, with a focus on household energy, biomass, small scale renewable energy, and off-grid
developmental activities, as well as related oversight, monitoring and reporting. Creation of NEDA will
over time leave MININFRA to focus on policy setting as its main function. In the transport sector, a
Transport Policy and Road Maintenance Strategy were completed and adopted by Cabinet defining
priorities and approaches to strengthen institutions for efficient operation of the sector, and involvement
of the private sector and local communities.    In the water sector, Government will continue to promote
private-public partnerships and private participation in the operation of piped, rural water supply systems.
The Water Ministry is working on a program to encourage investment in the water and sanitation sub-
sector; a number of donors are in the process of mobilizing funds to scale up their efforts in this area. The
creation of a Water Commission to be responsible for service delivery is currently under legislative
review and could be established some time next year.

39.      In terms of skills development, having achieved significant growth in enrollment, the focus
is now turned to improving quality of nine year basic education, raising completion rates and
strengthening post-basic education. A comprehensive strategy for post-basic education, including the
formulation of a technical and vocational education and training (TVET) policy and a higher education
policy have been adopted by Cabinet. However, the sector is missing two key policy components to fully
realize its goals of producing a skilled and flexible labor force ready to respond to the challenges of a
global economy. The two policy components are a secondary education policy; and an overall strategy
for integrating all aspects of post-basic education. This will require a change from a secondary school
system that caters to very few academically inclined students for limited slots in universities to a mass
system which prepares all young people for a lifetime of learning and changing economic opportunities.
Such a transformation of the education system requires changes in content, structure, and organization
which will need to be explicitly addressed in Rwanda's education policy framework.


40.      Finally, Government has begun implementation of the STI Policy drawing on the results of
the recently completed needs assessment. The STI Policy responds to the challenges and potential
impediments identified in the Vision 2020 and proposes detailed actions to address each of these


                                                   11

impediments. These can be divided into four categories: (i) Governance of STI; (ii) Human capacity to
implement STI programs; (iii) Knowledge generation and technology transfer to rural villages and local
businesses; and (iv) STI infrastructure and support systems. The policy puts emphasis on promotion of
knowledge acquisition, creation, transfer, and a culture of innovation.

Progress in implementation under Flagship 2: Vision 2020 Umurenge


41.     Flagship two (Vision 2020 Umurenge or VUP) focuses on ensuring shared growth and on the
creation of opportunities for the poorest Rwandans. It has four components (public works, credit
packages, and direct income support) that involve four complementary elements: (i) agricultural
productivity improvement for households with land; (ii) publicly funded, socially productive, labor-
intensive employment for landless Rwandans without job opportunities; (iii) social assistance for landless
people incapable of work; and (iv) improved access to credit for input purchases or micro-enterprise
development by members of households assisted through elements (i)­(iii).

42.     The VUP is currently in the pilot phase, and is targeted to the rural areas of the poorest
villages in each of the 30 districts. Pilots have started in 25 of the 30 districts. Government is also in
the process of elaborating the institutional framework for coordination and implementation of the VUP
which the Bank will support through a three year sector budget support operation to be focused on public
works, micro-finance schemes and development of community health services.             In that regard, the
Ministry of Health (MINISANTE) has implemented measures to strengthen the link between community
health services and family planning with the aim of reducing population growth.              In particular,
MINISANTE has doubled the budget for family planning services in the coming year and transferred
resources from certain HIV projects to next year's budget for family planning.             There are also
complementary off-budget targeted resources, such as programs supported by USAID.


43.     A number of substantial reforms have also been instituted in the health sector to support
increased coordination. The initiation of a SWAp process has facilitated an increased commitment to
on-budget financing that includes budget support and more ring-fenced mechanisms. This has led to
increased public financing of health services from US$26 per capita in 2006 to US$33 in 2008. With
regard to the specific indicators monitored in the health sector, 60 percent of children under five used
insecticide-treated bed nets in 2007. In 2008, 52 percent of births were attended by skilled personnel; and
75 percent of the population was covered by community-based (mutuelle) health insurance.


Progress in implementation under Flagship 3: Governance


44.     Flagship three (Governance) seeks to strengthen political and economic governance,
building institutions and capacity of the state. Emphasis is given to maintaining peace and security,
promoting peace and reconciliation amongst Rwandans, reforming the justice system to uphold human
rights and the rule of law, and empowering citizens to participate in their own social, political and
economic development. A wide range of reforms are envisaged to strengthen public sector institutions
and capacity including further decentralization, enhancing accountability at all levels of government,
strengthening public financial management and increasing the predictability and transparency of policy-
making. The other elements of the flagship include improvements in the "soft infrastructure" needed to
strengthen commercial justice systems, business and land registration reforms, and regulatory frameworks
to promote good corporate governance.

45.     Recent reforms have been centered on strengthening the framework for public financial
management.       In December 2007, Parliament passed the Accountants Bill which now requires all



                                                  12

financial institutions and large and public companies to comply with International Accounting Standards
(IAS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). District budget reports are now published
on the Government's website. Guidelines to budget agencies for preparation of the MTEF have been
completed and were produced on the MINECOFIN website in June 2008. Following consultations with
development partners, the PFM reform strategy and action plan for 2008-2012 was published in
September.      Government is in the process of elaborating a framework for strategic guidance,
implementation, monitoring, and financing of the PFM reform strategy. This will facilitate coordination
in implementation of the strategy. In line with identified needs, capacity building and training in PFM is
ongoing.


46.      The legal text to establish the Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA) which is in
line with international best practice was adopted and gazetted and the board of directors appointed
in March 2008. The text includes all functions belonging to a modern procurement regulatory and
oversight body. In addition, procurement audits were completed in 66 procuring entities (80 audits in
total were scheduled). Also, independent review panels have been established and made operational at
the national and district levels (according to the law, 5 members are from the private sector and civil
society organizations). Bidders on public procurement contracts have recourse to independent appeal.
Finally, the NTB website now publishes a list of debarred firms.


47.      There has also been progress in reforms to strengthen the civil service. MIFOTRA has
completed the functional audit of 6 ministries (MIFOTRA, MINECOFIN, MINISANTE, MINEDUC,
MINITERE, and MININFRA) - the results of the review will be used to develop an action plan for each
ministry to address the issues raised pertaining to weaknesses in the structure, staffing and procedures. A
monitoring framework for the EDPRS has also been developed along with a CPAF around which all
budget support donors have agreed to focus and align their fiduciary requirements.


Overall Implementation, Monitoring and Harmonization Arrangements


48.      Significant progress has been made in the process of harmonization, alignment and mutual
accountability of donors and Government. A Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF)
to provide a framework for monitoring the EDPRS was concluded, along with a framework for
monitoring the progress of donors toward the Paris 21 initiative. The CPAF was drawn from fully
developed EDPRS sector policy matrices outlining the medium term policy actions and outcomes based
on agreed sector priorities. Some of these matrices are drawn from well developed or documented sector
strategies and will form the basis for undertaking sector reviews (undertaken through the SWGs), that will
in turn inform the overall Joint Budget Support Review (involving the joint review of progress in key
areas of the CPAF on an annual basis against planned and actual expenditures).                   Eight new
Implementation Working Groups (IWGs) reflecting the priority thematic areas of the EDPRS serve as the
forum to coordinate across sectors, and between government and development partners, to discuss policy
issues and monitoring of the EDPRS. Each IWG comprises stakeholders from related sector working
groups. In addition, a Partnership Agreement laying out procedures and modalities for a multi-donor
approach to budgetary support was signed in October 2008, between the Government and the key budget
support donors. Also, Sector-Wide Approaches have been adopted in the energy, agriculture and health
sectors as a means of having a coordinated framework and sustained financing for reforms in these areas.
This has also involved the development of a medium term expenditure framework linked to EDPRS
priorities for each sector. However, to date, only the agriculture sector has a comprehensive strategy
document.

                 IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

                             A. LINK TO THE CAS AND OTHER BANK OPERATION

49.     The Banks support to the implementation of the EDPRS is detailed in the FY09-12 CAS
that was discussed by the Board on September 26, 2008. The CAS seeks stronger impact through
greater selectivity and is organized around two strategic themes: the first concentrates on activities that
will promote economic transformation and remove bottlenecks to growth; the second pillar brings
together activities geared toward reducing social vulnerability. In addition, it further sets as its objectives
a strong collaboration with Government, as well as a stronger focus on results and outcomes and
harmonization among development partners. With the PRSG program seen as the overall umbrella
for Bank support and policy dialogue, these themes will be largely supported through the PRSG
series and complemented by select investment lending.

50.     The proposed operation, in alignment with the EDPRS and the CAS themes, continues to
focus on three main areas: (i) promoting sustainable growth and private sector development supported
by science, technology and innovation; (ii) increasing capacity to implement the Governments
decentralization program and budget reforms, with particular attention to strengthening district reporting;
and (iii) continuing to support improvements in service delivery with a focus on economic and
infrastructure services and on increasing the availability of skilled labor.         All of these areas are
interrelated and mutually reinforcing. The PRSG program is designed and implemented to take advantage
of these synergies.

51.     The PRSG program builds on and complements a solid base of a well-performing IDA
portfolio. There are currently 11 active projects in Rwanda and several sectoral investment projects are
planned to complement the support of the PRSG series in the key focal areas of infrastructure
development and capacity building including the Electricity Access Roll-Out project, Transport Sector
Development Project and the Land Harvesting Water Management and Hillside Irrigation project. In
addition, Rwanda is participating in three regional infrastructure projects (see Annex 8).

52.     The regional projects are designed to strengthen Rwanda's links to regional markets
through improved trade facilitation and a reduction in the cost of doing business regionally. The
HIV/AIDS Great Lakes Initiative contributes to the reduction of HIV infections and is focused on the
prevention, care, and treatment of HIV/AIDS for mobile, and vulnerable groups such as refugees,
transport sector workers, and highly affected/infected populations within the region. The East Africa
Trade and Transport Facilitation Project supports specific measures targeted at the EAC to strengthen
implementation of the customs union and related market; improve efficiency of the supply chains in and
out of the region and along the main trade routes; support the development of an integrated system and
common database linking customs departments in the member states and Rwanda to the EAC Customs
directory in Arusha.    The Regional Trade Facilitation Project's is targeted at the COMESA and
addresses the concerns of risks related to a lack of policy continuity and consistency by providing
insurance against the risk of a reversal in the government's policies which negatively affects business.
The insurance facility also covers losses resulting from the occurrence of war and civil disturbance, thus
addressing the second component of country risk that impedes increased private sector capital flows to the
region.   The Regional Communications Infrastructure Project aims to reduce the cost of doing
business in Rwanda and contribute to the government's ability to implement e-Government. It will
support investments and technical assistance to lower prices for international capacity and extend the
geographic reach of broadband networks

53.     Finally there will be a parallel programmatic DPO series to support the GoRs
implementation of social protection and community health strategies.                   This operation will



                                                  14

complement the PRSG focus on growth with a focus on poverty reduction, particularly in rural areas. The
PRSG series will therefore be more focused on economic and infrastructure related constraints to growth,
on measures to improve the supply of skilled labor, and on deepening reforms in service delivery. In
addition, the PRSG will support the implementation of recommendations arising from the Science
Technology and Innovation (STI) report that are key to the transformation of the economy.

                           B. COORDINATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

54.      Coordination with the IMF: The proposed PRSG has been prepared in parallel with the PRGF
review and coincides with the Article IV review that took place in October 2008. The aim is to ensure
coordination and consistency in the macroeconomic and structural policy programs of the PRSG and
IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The PRSG's focus on structural and institutional
reforms, to improve the quality of spending and program implementation and to support growth,
complements the IMF's areas of focus as it leads the macro dialogue.

55.      Coordination with Other Donors: Donors are collaborating to support Rwanda in implementing
the EDPRS, by providing financial and technical support in a coordinated way. Key coordination
mechanisms including the Development Partners Coordination Group (DPCG), the Budget Support
Harmonization Group (BSHG), and Sector (i.e. SWGs) and cross sector Clusters or Implementation
Working Groups have been formed by Government. These groups have been involved in preparatory
consultations and joint review of the implementation of Rwanda's Poverty Reduction Strategy through
the biannual joint budget support donor missions that were initiated in 2004.

56.      The PRSG continues to seek synergies with other donor programs and projects through
continued support to the use and development of sector-wide approaches, currently being
undertaken in the context of Sector Working Groups (SWGs). In addition, as of the 2009 budget
year, all budget support donors, including the Bank through PRSG 5, are now fully aligned to the CPAF.
The framework for alignment is outlined in the Partnership Agreement, including procedures and
modalities for a multi-donor approach to budgetary support. This was signed by the Government and the
key budget support donors in October 2008. The measures supported by this operation draw on the new
framework and have been adapted from triggers outlined in PRSG-4 in order to fully integrate this
operation with the CPAF.

                                   C.    ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

57.      PRSG-5 builds on analytical work carried out over the last few years, as well as ongoing
analytical work on public expenditure management to support Pillar 1 (Jobs for Growth and
Exports), and Pillar 3 (Governance) of the EDPRS. Analytical work completed during the last year
includes the FY07 Country Economic Memorandum, the FY07 Agriculture Policy Note, and the FY07
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment. The Multi-year TA public expenditure
review (PER) currently underway will play a major role in implementation of PRSG activities by
informing the prioritization of measures to improve the quality of spending in the PRSG series. It is also
providing technical assistance to the Government for the institutionalization of the PER process while the
Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) update, recently completed in close collaboration with the IMF and in
consultation with the Government aims to ensure macroeconomic stability. The program also builds on
analytical work carried out by the Government including the FY06 Poverty Report and the Financial
Sector Development Plan. This section highlights three areas of analytic work that support the policy
dialogue under the PRSG: (i) drivers of growth and poverty reduction, (ii) sectoral work, and (iii)
governance or fiduciary issues. Box 2 outlines the key constraints to growth which this PRSG series aims
to address based on the results of the above listed analytical works.

58.     Drivers of growth and poverty reduction--the importance of infrastructure and agriculture.
The Country Economic Memorandum (FY07) entitled Rwanda: Towards Sustained Growth and
Competitiveness identifies the poor condition of infrastructure, low base of skilled labor and the low use
of modern inputs, improved seeds in agriculture, as the major constraints to growth and comes to the
following conclusions and strategic priorities. In the short to medium term, the focus should be on
improving productivity in the agricultural sector.       In the medium to long term, increased capital
investment to reduce the costs of energy, water and transport and to increase the supply of skilled labor
are needed.    The recently completed Investment Climate Assessment (FY08) also highlights the
importance of attention to the infrastructure constraints, as well as the need to deepen the financial sector.
In particular, the FIAS study of informal enterprises highlights the need to improve financial
intermediation and build capacity of micro-enterprises to access micro-finance. The study identifies the
low level capacity in business development skills and lack of information on the kinds of credit
instruments that are available and how to access these. Salient findings include the following: (i) 52
percent of Rwandans do not use either formal or informal financial products; (ii) 77 percent of those who
use financial products use informal products; (iii) bank usage is dominated by the BPR; (iv) excluding
BPR, only 1 percent of the adult population uses formal bank products.

59.     The recently completed Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) for Rwanda highlights the
continued constraint posed by the poor state of infrastructure to economic growth and regional
competitiveness. Over 70 percent of firms in the manufacturing sector reported electricity to be a major
constraint. Almost 40 percent of firms in Rwanda said that transportation was a serious obstacle, higher
than all comparators for the EAC, except Kenya, where 53 percent of firms ranked transport as a serious
obstacle. Finally, subjective ratings by transport operators in Rwanda were significantly lower than that
of operators in the rest of the other EAC countries. Transport and energy (see Figure 4) costs as a share
of sales continues to be higher in Rwanda compared to EAC comparator countries.

60.     The poverty update also highlights the importance of infrastructure to Rwanda's
competitiveness and economic growth. The findings of this poverty analysis appear to validate the
policy directions proposed in the EDPRS, and supported by the PRSGs, namely the importance of: (i)
prudent management of public finances to preserve the funding for growth enhancing and poverty
reducing sectors; (ii) extending infrastructure services in rural areas, particularly road access to markets
and electrical supply, to mitigate poverty among rural households; and (iii) sustaining increases in
agricultural productivity for maintaining the long term trends in broad based growth and poverty
reduction.

61.     Sectoral Work. Analytic work at the sector level forms an integral part of sector development
programs and thematic reform programs. Priority issues for analytic work are typically discussed during
annual sector reviews. In the education sector, the Joint Reviews of the Education Sector (JRES) have
increasingly focused on the quality of education in Rwanda. Challenges raised include inability to attract
and retain skilled teachers due to low salary levels, particularly for primary teachers, slow progress in
universal completion of quality primary education, (currently at 51.7 percent), transition to upper
secondary, monitoring and evaluation of school and district level performance. The updated country
status report will reflect recent developments in decentralization and resulting implications for the sector.
An impact evaluation of performance-based contracting which will be used to strengthen the design of the
performance based system is currently underway. Work is ongoing to underpin the development of a
strategy for vocational and technical education and skills development.

62.     The Science, Technology and Innovation Needs Assessment for Rwanda (financed from the
Norwegian Post-Primary Education Trust Fund), outlines several concrete recommendations to




                                                   16

improve Rwanda's STI capacity.2 Six priority STI capacity building areas identified by the joint
Government/Bank team that prepared the report include: food-processing, value-added exports,
development and diffusion of appropriate technologies, delivery of clean drinking water, geo-sciences and
geothermal energy, and client-focused agricultural research and outreach. Recommendations from the
report include, for example, a stronger focus of teaching and research efforts on training Rwandans to use
knowledge to develop, produce, and deploy high performance, low-cost technologies. Examples of these
technologies include: more efficient wood burning stoves; manual irrigation pumps; food-processing and
storage equipment; more efficient, low-cost construction materials and methods; and non-electrical
refrigeration and food-cooling equipment.

63.      The report on water legislation and institutions led to the drafting and approval of the water law
by Parliament, the implementation of which is being supported under this PRSG series. The report on
water data management stresses the need for further capacity building in monitoring activities through the
use of a network, to improve coordination for the development of an integrated water resources
development and management program.


                           Box 2: Main Constraints to Economic Growth and Exports in Rwanda

 The 2007 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) identifies three major areas of constraints to growth in Rwanda: This
 includes the poor water management, low use of modern inputs such as fertilizers and improved seeds and lack of
 extension services in agriculture; the poor condition of infrastructure ­ particularly electricity, transport, and water ­ that
 has limited the development of the manufacturing and service sectors; and the low base of skilled labor, particularly
 technical and managerial skills. In addition to the results of the CEM, the Diagnostic Trade Integrated Study and the
 recently completed Investment Climate Assessment identified infrastructure costs as a major factor lowering the returns to
 trade and exports. These documents note that improving productivity and supply is critical to improving exports.

 The table below shows, substantial gains in productivity can be realized through appropriate use of improved inputs in
 agriculture. Furthermore, the dependence on rain-fed agriculture, environmental degradation leading to severe soil erosion,
 lack of investment on irrigation and poor water management, have been the key factors undermining agricultural productivity
 and growth. On infrastructure, the 2005 Rwanda Industry and Manufacturing Survey (RIMS) showed that 81 percent of firms
 ranked power shortage as the highest constraint to their business and 41 percent of firms cited transport costs as a constraint.
 In addition, capacity utilization of manufacturing firms was estimated to be around 60 percent and closely tied to power
 shortage. The RIMS also showed that 40 percent of firms consider the availability of skilled labor a major constraint to their
 operations. The low scarcity of technical skills hinders development across manufacturing, service and agricultural sectors as
 well as small-scale enterprises and the public sector. It also limits innovation.

 Bureaucratic and administrative costs of doing business are also high in Rwanda. The Rwanda Investment and Export
 Promotion Agency (RIEPA) is taking the lead in implementing the Government's Doing Business action plan following the
 deliberations in the Doing Business (DB) workshop of April 2007. Actions have been focused on areas where immediate
 improvements can be made, particularly on trade facilitation and customs, registering property and trading across boundaries.
 This effort is being supported with technical assistance from the Bank's CEDP project, in close collaboration with IFC and
 FIAS.

64.     Detailed analysis of the agriculture sector is contained in the Agricultural Policy Note (FY07)
which identified the underlying causes of low profitability of agriculture as among others, low farm-level
productivity, limited availability and high costs of agricultural inputs and a weak human capital base.
Recommendations therefore include stimulating productivity growth in food staples, scaling up
sustainable development of land and water resources, overhauling national agricultural research and
extension systems and promoting agricultural export growth and diversification. The Financial Sector
Development Plan (FSDP) identified the need to develop the microfinance sector as critical to monetizing
and deepening the financial sector. The report highlights the importance of developing the payment
system if Rwanda is to reduce its predominance of cash transactions in the system, particularly given the
country's vision of developing the tourism sector and a service based economy. The DTIS highlights the
importance of reducing the cost of infrastructure services to stimulating export growth and trade. Finally,
the CEM highlights the problem posed by the high level of maintenance costs with low cost recovery that
affects upkeep of the infrastructure network and its efficiency. This also has an impact on investments.
In the road sector, maintenance is constrained by the lack of road maintenance funds. In the electricity
sector, poor maintenance has contributed to high transmission losses and frequent outages.

65.     Governance and Fiduciary Work. Ongoing and existing analytical work on fiduciary
arrangements set out action plans for improvements in public financial management and public
procurement, providing important insights for the preparation of this operation. These works include the
FY07 PEFA, which highlights the importance of continuing to support capacity in pubic financial
accounting and reporting particularly at decentralized levels, MTEF development, and procurement. The
recently completed Public Financial Management (PFM) Action Plan outlines a costed plan for reforms to
strengthen PFM capacity. These will be key areas of support under the PRSG series. Another update of
the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) has been recently completed in close collaboration with the IMF
and in consultation with the Government to ensure that the Government's expenditure program does not
jeopardize macro economic stability.

66.     Non-lending activities will continue to play a major role in the implementation of PRSG
activities, and will focus on capacity building. As mentioned previously, a technical assistance in
support of improving public expenditure management is currently underway. In addition, a Multi-year
Agriculture Policy technical assistance is ongoing to complement financial operations and investment
projects in the sector.

67.     Aside from ongoing and completed analytical works, several studies are planned to support
the PRSG agenda including: (i) additional science and technology needs assessments and action plans to
identify STI capacity building programs to support the infrastructure and financial sectors; (ii) a labor
study focused on skills development and employment generation, to improve understanding of the
employment and poverty effects of past growth; and (iii) an Education Policy Analysis.

                           D.     LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS PRSGS

68.     The Implementation Completion Report of PRSG 1 to 3, along with experience from PRSG-
4 reinforced the importance of capacity in terms of lessons that will be reflected in the PRSG-5 and
PRSG-6. First, strong Government commitment backed with Bank support to reinforce capacity to
implement has led to substantial achievements of targeted outcomes and reforms.            This has been
particularly evident in the education, health, water and agriculture sectors that have received support in
the development of sector strategies and MTEFs. Bank support has also greatly facilitated the move to
SWAps in the education, health, agriculture and energy sectors.         Similar momentum is also being
generated in the transport sector. Therefore, support to developing sector strategies, MTEFs and SWAps
continues to be a key area of assistance under PRSG-5 and PRSG-6.




                                                  19

69.      Second, there has been a need for strong capacity support in the area of fiscal
decentralization and civil service reform. Government successfully implemented an ambitious and
challenging civil service and decentralization reform program, including large retrenchments. However,
thinly spread out staff coupled with low retention and incentives continues to be an issue. The World
Bank through the second PRSG series (and in close collaboration with other key donors supporting
reforms in these areas ­i.e. DFID, Netherlands, German Corporation) will continue support to put in place
incentives for capacity strengthening and retention of civil service staff. Measures to be included under
the PRSG-5 support these areas of the Government's reform program.

70.      Third, the PRSG series has enabled (even in the case where there are already existing
complementary sector projects) elevation of the policy dialogue in key sectors such as energy and
water. This has enabled more in depth discussion and follow-up of policy issues compared to the
situation where sectors are engaged only through project support. An example in the water sector pertains
to support to local private operator schemes and in energy an example is that of the issue of extra energy
generation capacity and related policy reforms. PRSG-5 and PRSG-6 will continue with this approach,
incorporating the transport sector and expanding the policy dialogue in the water sector as it relates to
ensuring the efficient operation of the newly created water utility, with greater focus of the policy
dialogue to ensure it supports the Government's vision to move toward a more integrated approach to
water resources management.

71.      Fourth, in response to a key lesson learned under the first series of PRSGs, to have a more
focused and lean harmonization and accountability framework, the Bank (through the PRSG
process) has worked with other budget support donors, under the leadership of Government to
develop a CPAF. The prior actions and indicators for the PRSG-5 and PRSG-6 are drawn from the
CPAF. In addition, the monitoring indicators and data sources will rely on the framework developed as
part of the CPAF.

72.      A key lesson learned regarding the support to GoR in the development of the CPAF, during
the PRSG-4 transition operation, is the importance of engaging early in the process and
maintaining close consultation with Government and donors. The design of PRSG-4 allowed space
for the dialogue and consultation needed to develop a CPAF that has the buy-in of the key stakeholders.
However, in a context of low capacity, the process of strengthening the CPAF and ensuring outcome
oriented policy actions is ongoing. The CPAF is a work in progress and this has been recognized by
Government and donors and a mechanism for review and improvement of the framework has been agreed
as part of the Partnership Framework for Budget Support (see Box 3). This highlights the need to make
room for country ownership and leadership of the CPAF.            To foster this country ownership and
leadership, the PRSG series may need to work with policy measures in the outer years that are not as well
defined in order to give ample opportunity for consultation, discussion and analytical work to support the
improved identification of measures.

                                   E. REFORMS SUPPORTED UNDER PRSG-4

73.      Achievements under PRSG-4 focused on key institutional and legal reforms related to the
monitoring framework for the EDPRS, as well as measures to support human capital development
and a reduction in the infrastructure constraints to growth. The PRSG-4 supported the development
of a national M&E framework for monitoring the EDPRS including the establishment of an M&E
secretariat in MINECOFIN and the recruitment of sector M&E staff. The operation also supported the
development of the Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF), which draws on the policy
actions and indicators elaborated at the national level for the EDPRS monitoring framework (see Box 2).
There was also support toward developing the strategic planning and budgeting framework in the
agriculture and transport sectors.

                         Box 3: The Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF)
What is it?
The Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) consists of a set of indicators and policy actions selected from the
EDPRS Results and Policy Matrix and the Joint Governance Assessment (JGA). It forms the basis for budget support and
donors' joint assessment of the Government of Rwanda's performance in the implementation of the EDPRS. The CPAF is
complemented by the Donor Performance Assessment Framework (DPAF) which consists of a set of indicators and actions
drawn from international and national agreements relating to aid and its effective delivery, and forms the basis for government's
assessment of donor performance. The assessments would include performance of all partners (including non-budget support
donors) at both the aggregate and individual level.

The Process for Elaboration of the CPAF
The process of developing the CPAF (and the EDPRS Results and Policy Matrix, as well as the JGA) involved extensive
consultations and drew from the work of the existing 15 sector working groups (SWGs). Each SWG is chaired by a lead
Government institution and co-chaired by a Lead Donor. Initial consultations involved the development of sector policy and
results matrices with technical support and financing from DFID, World Bank and other Donors.

Development of the CPAF started in April 2008 and was based on the EDPRS Results and Policy Matrix that was done at the
national level for monitoring the EDPRS, and coordinated (over roughly a 12 month period) with each SWG of the EDPRS.
Simultaneously, a Joint Governance Assessment (JGA) was launched in March 2008 which summarizes GoR's performance in
the implementation of governance reforms in areas related to justice, voice and empowerment and accountability. The CPAF
was then derived as a subset of the national monitoring framework for the EDPRS supplemented with select indicators on
Governance from the JGA and the Government's PFM action plan. Indicators for the CPAF were agreed based on consultations
between Government and budget support donors and limited to a list of 18 strategic outcomes and 47 indicators (see Annex 2 and
Annex 4). To emphasize the commitment of all budget support donors and the Government, a MoU was signed in which all the
parties agreed to use the new reporting mechanisms (CPAF and DPAF) as part of a mutual accountability and harmonization
process aligning with the Paris Declaration.

Using the CPAF to Report on and Monitor EDPRS Achievements
Reporting of performance against individual CPAF indicators is led primarily at the sector level in advance of the Joint Budget
Support Review (JBSR). Sector performance reports are prepared in time for further discussion at the JBSR. The dialogue in the
JBSR is based on the joint assessment of progress in EDPRS implementation, including governance indicators and PFM reform,
using the CPAF as a single framework. For additional governance topics not covered in the CPAF an assessment is to be
reviewed based on the JGA annual review.

A forward-looking joint review will be held prior to the submission of a draft Finance Law or budget to the Cabinet in respect of
the following fiscal year. This review allows signatories to discuss proposed budget allocations, forthcoming activities in relation
to public financial management reforms, and the revision of the contents of the CPAF. This will be held in March in each budget
calendar year.

A backward-looking review of performance will be undertaken jointly within the four months that follow the end of the
Government fiscal year in question. During this review, signatories will discuss the progress and challenges encountered in the
implementation of the EDPRS in the previous year, reviewing budget execution and audited Government accounts of the year
before and value for money.

Process for Revision of the CPAF
Policy actions and targets of the CPAF are revised on an annual basis during the forward-looking Joint Budget Support Review.
Under exceptional circumstances, policy actions and indicators may be changed/ adjusted as long as they remain consistent with
the EDPRS and ongoing government policies and programs. The revised CPAF is agreed by all signatories and takes the form of
an annex to the minutes of the Review. Joint Reviews provide a forum for dialogue around the performance of both the
Government and its budget support partners and draws from the DPAF. It is undertaken following the same annual cycle as the
assessment of progress in the implementation of the EDPRS based on the CPAF.

74.      Table 6 below summarizes the key actions supported by PRSG-4. The PRSG-4 operation
supported reforms designed to lay the foundation for a comprehensive program to enhance the skills of
the labor force, and expand access to health services at the community level. Reforms in the eduation
sector focused on reducing the ratio of qualified teachers to pupils and developing a national TVET policy
that is responsive to the needs of the private sector. Reforms in the infrastructure sector focused on fully
incorporating into the Government's budget measures to improve water resources management for both
improved production activities and service delivery as well as irrigation and soil conservation. In the
financial sector, reforms focused on broadening the available financial instruments through the
establishment of a bond market and putting in place the legal framework for effective operation and
oversight of micro-finance institutions.

75.      In order to strengthen the focus of the second PRSG series on growth, continued Bank
support to the health sector reforms will proceed under the Community Living Standard Grant
(CLSG). Government has achieved important policy actions and milestones in the health sector, with
support from the PRSG series. PRSG-4 supported the adoption of the law governing mutuelles (prior
action for PRSG 4). Following on the above, a study on the sustainability of the mutuelle system has
been published, which provides input to the government's strategy for achieving universal coverage. A
milestone originally proposed for the PRSG-6, incorporation in District budgets of a subsidy to the
mutuelles, has already been achieved. At the same time, performance-based financing of facility-based
services was scaled-up in 2008 so that all of the over 400 public sector health centers in the country
receive support under this mechanism. Under the system, health facilities receive funding on the basis of
performance on a set of coverage and quality indicators, allocating the funds to staff remuneration as well
as maintenance and investment.       Before-and-after comparisons have shown substantial increases in
service utilization associated with the PBF system, and data is currently being analyzed from a
randomized impact evaluation that involved household and facility surveys. The related policy milestone
for PRSG-4 has been achieved ­ financing of US$ 0.90 per capita annually channeled through the PBF
mechanism to all participating health facilities.

76.      The Bank, through the CLSG, will continue to support the health financing policy,
emphasizing health insurance and performance-based financing, along with the community health
strategy, with the aim of expanding access to services. The PBF mechanism addresses supply-side
issues, largely through improving accountability, the expansion of mutuelles coverage, and reduced
demand-side constraints, particularly financial barriers to care. A third pillar of the government's strategy
to expand access to services, with particular emphasis on the rural poor in support to the VUP, is to scale-
up coverage of high-impact interventions delivered by community health workers, including a
performance-based incentive scheme. Relevant milestones were included in the PRSG-4 policy matrix,
including publication of the package of community health services (PRSG-4). Going forward, these
policies will be supported by a proposed Community Living Standards Grant (CLSG) series of
development policy operations.

         V.     THE PROPOSED FIFTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT GRANT

77.      The proposed fifth poverty reduction support grant (PRSC-5) is the second in the second
PRSG series consisting of three annual operations supporting the implementation of the EDPRS, in
line with the 2008 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). It continues to focus on two flagships of the
government's growth and poverty reduction agenda ­ Growth for Jobs and Exports, and Governance.

78.      The focus on the growth and governance aspects of the EDPRS aims to address the main
constraints to growth. The 2007 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) identified three major areas
of constraints to growth in Rwanda (see Box 2): (i) poor water management; (ii) low use of modern
inputs such as fertilizers and improved seeds and lack of extension services in agriculture; (iii) the poor
condition of infrastructure ­ particularly electricity, transport, and water ­ that has limited the
development of the manufacturing and service sectors; and (iv) the low base of skilled labor, particularly
technical and managerial skills. In addition to the results of the CEM, the Diagnostic Trade Integrated
Study identified infrastructure costs as a major factor lowering the returns to trade and exports. It also
noted that improving productivity and supply was critical to improving exports. In addition, the recently
completed Investment Climate Survey (2008) indicated the above factors continued to pose a constraint to
growth and highlighted the importance of increasing access to finance for small and medium enterprises
(SMEs). Finally the attention to governance aspects recognizes the constraints posed by low capacity to
implement reforms and the importance of transparency and accountability for sustained growth.

79.      The operation is fully aligned to the Common Performance Assessment Framework
presented in Annex 2 which has been prepared with Government leadership in consultation with
development partners. In choosing indicators to align with the CPAF, the evolution from triggers to
prior actions for the PRSG-5 operation has been defined so as to ensure continuity of reforms and
progress toward meeting key prioritized outcomes. Furthermore, as a reflection of the substantive strides
achieved during the first wave of reforms that established critical laws and institutions including sector
strategies to implement the Government strategy, the PRSG-5 matrix (Annex 3) includes critical actions
related to the second generation of reforms that are now focused on the implementation of sector



                                                              24

strategies and the strengthening of the planning and budget preparation, execution and monitoring
function in the key sectors. Close consultation with Government and other budget support donors during
the development of the CPAF has enabled continuity in the reform program despite the fact that PRSG-4
was prepared as a transition operation toward full adoption of the CPAF. A smooth evolution from
triggers to prior actions has been possible because, in general, Government has completed all prior actions
and this has enabled a continuation in the reform program by taking from the CPAF the follow-on policy
measures and the next steps in the reform program.

80.      Prior actions have been selected on the basis of: (i) their importance in contributing to address
key constraint to the implementation of the intended reform and (ii) their alignment with the EDRPS
strategic objectives. The CPAF may be updated as necessary and critical updates will occur once a year
during the forward looking review of the budget. In that context, triggers for PRSG-5 have been modified
to ensure they are fully aligned to the CPAF. In particular, during consultations/discussions with donors
and government in the preparation of the PRSG-4, it was agreed that the operation would proceed without
the CPAF. Triggers defined for PRSG-5 reflect ongoing discussions held while preparing the CPAF and
indicate the continuity of the reform programs proposed by the Government and supported by the current
PRSG series. The evolution of triggers as defined in the PRSG-4 document to those in the PRSG-5
operation have been defined by two factors: (i) changes in the policy context which have influenced the
state of progress of reforms; (ii) the need to align with the CPAF which has been greatly facilitated by the
fact that many of the triggers/prior actions defined under PRSG-4 for PRSG-5 have been achieved. It is
therefore important to highlight and commend Government on their commitment and the substantial
progress in the reform program.

81.      Given the above context, support will continue for two uncompleted triggers for the PRSG-
5 which have been changed or modified to align with the CPAF--all other triggers have been
achieved as defined under the PRSG-4 operation. The two actions were: (i) signing of a performance
contract for the National Power Utility for 2009 to 2011, which includes targets on costs for generation,
cost recovery ratio, revenue and quality of supply; and (ii) the Rwanda Public Procurement Authority
(RPPA) is made operational and all procuring entities submit a draft procurement plan to MINECOFIN
after approval of the budget. In the case of the first action, the performance contract has been delayed due
to the need to first establish the power utility, the Rwanda Electricity Company (or RECO). This prior
action has therefore been changed to submission of the Law on Electricity and Gas to Parliament.
The second trigger was not completely achieved. The RPPA was established, but not all procuring
entities submitted a draft procurement plan to MINECOFIN primarily due to lack of incentives on the part
of the agencies to include the plans. MINECOFIN now plans to enforce the requirement by making it
mandatory in order for budget agencies to receive their budget allocation. As a result, the action to
submit the procurement plans has been kept as a PRSG-6 trigger. This action is critical to the effective
planning and implementation of projects and to ensure these are integrated into the budget (particularly
for those that are externally financed).

82.      The expected results at the end of the series are summarized in Table 10, in section VI and
include the following: In the area of governance, the reform program is expected to lead to substantial
improvements in public expenditure management as measured by both the PEFA indicator system and
Joint Governance Assessment. In the area of fiscal decentralization the reform program is expected to
reduce implementation constraints due to low capacity and weak institutions. Regarding civil service
reforms, the program is expected to produce (i) an improvement in organizational effectiveness and (ii)
strengthened public sector capacity for effective service delivery.

83.      In the area of service delivery, results to be achieved will cover the key sectors related to human
development as well as economic and infrastructure services. In terms of skills development, the focus
will continue to be on improvements in the quality of education. Towards this end, the PRSG series will

aim to increase the transition rates to upper secondary; and to develop technical and vocational education
and training systems that reflect the need of the labor market. For infrastructure, the series would lead to
an increase in access to electricity, an increase in the percent of classified road network in good condition,
and increased access to safe water and sanitation and its sustainable use. In the case of the financial
sector, the operation will contribute to increasing access to financial services to support micro-enterprise
development. Finally for agriculture, a substantial improvement in agricultural productivity is expected.

                                  A.    GROWTH FOR JOBS AND EXPORTS

84.      The PRSG-5 will continue to focus on key areas that have been identified as constraints to
growth.    These are discussed in this section: (i) Invest in Human Capital and Skills for Growth
education-- increase the number of well-trained teachers and make TVET private sector oriented; adopt
measures to promote development of science, technology and innovation (STI); (ii) improve economic
infrastructure; (iii) raise agriculture productivity and value-added exports; (iv) deepen and broaden the
financial sector.

(i)      Invest in Human Capital and Skills for Growth

Raise the Quality of Education by Increasing the number of well-trained teachers and make TVET
Private Sector Oriented

85.      The main challenge to developing a skilled and productive labor force that meets the needs
of the private sector continues to be the poor quality of education, and the need to improve
transition to secondary education. This has been a particular challenge given the substantial increases
in primary enrollment, requiring the absorption of large numbers of students and the need to close the
persistent gap in learning outcomes between girls and boys. More teachers with better qualifications are
needed to manage the higher primary enrollment rates and expanded demand for post-basic education,
thereby raising transition rates. In addition, the greater focus on science, technology and innovation (STI)
in the EDPRS will require an effective and well-functioning primary education system that is coherently
linked to a comprehensive and strategic post-basic education system.

86.      The government's response to the above challenges has been to focus on: (i) increasing the
supply and quality of teachers with the aim of reducing the pupil: teacher ratio; (ii) establishing a post-
basic education strategy focused on building the needed skills for the economy; (iii) an assessment of the
gap in needs for teachers and classrooms to inform teacher recruitment and development of infrastructure;
and an (vi) evaluation of the curriculum to make it more relevant to the needs of students and the
streamlining of subjects in primary and lower secondary education to make learning more effective and
focused on core subjects and skills relevant for the labor market in Rwanda.

87.      Toward these ends, the proposed second PRSG series is providing support to develop a
comprehensive strategic framework for post-basic education, including the development of a technical
and vocational education and training system that reflects the needs of the labor market and
implementation of the STI program. The prior action for PRSG-5 is the publication of the TVET
Policy. This has been achieved and approved by Cabinet. A TVET strategy is being developed in two
parts: (i) one for technical education that is being led by JICA; (ii) another for vocational training which
is being led by GTZ. The aim is to have a draft strategy that combines the two components. This will be
followed by a mid-term review to assess progress in 2009 and inform the costing exercise.

88.      The trigger for PRSG-6 will be to develop and cost the TVET strategic plan. Other actions to be
completed will include completion of an employers' survey to establish baseline information on
employment of TVET graduates. The related indicator will be the proportion of employers satisfied with
the performance of TVET graduates, and transition rates from basic to upper secondary education.

Promote Science, Technology and Innovation


89.      To complement the development of a skilled labor force and facilitate the adoption and
adaptation of science, technology and innovation (STI), the growth agenda of the EDPRS calls for
the use of STI to improve productivity. This will be critical to the transformation of the economy from
one that is based on semi-subsistence agriculture to one that is based on the production of more
knowledge-intensive, higher value added goods and services. Given the high population density and
landlocked position of the country, the adaptation, adoption and application of the relevant technologies
will be needed to generate the level of productivity necessary to sustain growth.

90.      The Government is meeting this challenge through the development of the needed policy, legal
and regulatory framework as well as the governing institutions for putting in place a program to promote
science and technology.      A National Science, Technology and Innovation Policy has already been
approved that provides a framework for STI to contribute to the Government's broader development
goals, more specifically to diversify the economy, generate wealth via the expansion of higher value
added production, and create higher paying jobs. In addition, there is a Ministry of Science, Technology
and Scientific Research (MINSTR) which sits under the President's Office. Government is also in the
process of developing a legal and regulatory framework and governing institutions for science and
technology. Activities will include the identification and design of the institutional structures required to
implement the STI Policy, along with new legislation required to bring these institutions into effect. This
is being done in partnership with DFID.

91.      The PRSG therefore supports the development of the institutional structures required to
implement the STI Policy, ensuring strong links to the post-basic education strategic framework.
Specifically, the PRSG will provide support to Government in developing efficient and effective
arrangements for implementation of the recommendations from the Needs Assessment and Action Plans
(NAAPs) for the implementation of the STI Policy and ensuring its integration into sector plans by:

    (i)     Selecting the recommendations that will be implemented as a priority and that have high and
            demonstrable expected beneficial impacts; and are simple and straightforward enough to be
            easily and quickly implemented by a relatively inexperienced implementation unit.

    (ii)    Developing staffing and institutional arrangements for implementing the recommendations.
            Staffing and institutional arrangements will be described in detail in an operations manual.
            The aim is to have a small, flexible and efficient implementation team that is sufficiently
            equipped to not only implement the recommendations, but also ensure solid monitoring and
            evaluation so that lessons learned are taken into account in future activities, and results can be
            disseminated to relevant stakeholders.

    (iii)   Designing detailed implementation arrangements and procedures for these recommendations.
            The operations manual will contain the complete program design of all recommendations that
            are to be implemented during FY2010, including forms, eligibility criteria, evaluation
            processes, financing, etc.

    (iv)    Executing the initial stages of the implementation arrangements and ensuring sufficient
            budget is allocated to the prioritized activities enabling full incorporation into the budget by
            July 1, 2009.

92.      During the PRSG-5 implementation period, the focus is on providing technical assistance to
Government to prepare for full incorporation of STI in the CPAF in order to facilitate identification of
prior actions and triggers for the PRSG series.

(ii)    Improve Economic Infrastructure

93.     PRSG-5 continues to support reforms to address the policy, institutional and regulatory
environment needed to increase access of the population to infrastructure services while reducing
the cost of service provision. It complements the activities being financed through the key infrastructure
projects in the transport, urban infrastructure and water, rural water and sanitation, and electricity sectors.
An important aspect of the PRSG support to the infrastructure sector will be on the rigorous application of
the sector strategy to the MTEF to strengthen the budget framework. Also, the PRSG will support the
development of a harmonized donor involvement that has worked well for the social sectors. In line with
this, 3 outcomes (along with 4 related indicators) have been prioritized and selected from the CPAF: (i)
number of households and firms with access to electricity; (ii) MW of electricity generated; (iii) percent
of classified district road network in good condition; (iv) percent of water resources complying with water
quality standards certified by Rwanda Bureau of Standards (RBS). These are summarized in Table 10.
There is also discussion with Government to revisit some of the indicators in the water and private sector
development/financial sector to consider those that are more directly affected by the proposed policy
actions in the CPAF. These will be further discussed, and baseline information collected for those which
are agreed during the preparation of PRSG-6.

Increase Electricity Access and Supply

94.     Insufficient and expensive supply of electricity remains one of the main infrastructure
bottlenecks to growth, requiring more and cheaper sources of energy. Rwanda currently uses diesel
generators to supply a large part of the needed electricity. The goal, reflected in the CPAF, is to generate
130 MW of electricity by 2012, providing access to over 200,000 households. One of the projects
planned by Government to improve the situation is the construction of a hydro-electric power plant
at Nyaborongo, which is expected to supply 27.5 MW by 2011. To finance the cost of the project of
US $112.7 million over 4 years, Rwanda plans to borrow US $97.7 million from the India Exim Bank
with a grant element of 40 percent. The remainder of the amount will be financed through Government's
own resources. In the meantime, since October 2008, the first pilot of the Lake Kivu project has been
producing 1.3 MW of electricity. Further ongoing developments are, among others, the construction of
the Rukarara hydro power plant, as well as several micro hydro power plants, and the construction of
different electricity lines.

95.     Government is also proceeding with reforms to put in place the needed institutional and
legal framework to support efficient generation and distribution. Based on the recent law to separate
the water and electricity utilities, the Rwanda Electricity Company (RECO) and Rwanda Water Supply
Company (RWASCO) will be established in 2009. RECO will be responsible for bulk transmission and
distribution and retailing functions, while new large generation projects are planned for development by
the private sector that would sell to Electrogaz/RECO under a power purchase agreement or other
purchase arrangements that could be elaborated at a later date.

96.     Support under PRSG-5 and onward, in line with the priorities identified in the EDPRS, continues
to focus on improving the overall planning and expenditure framework, reducing the service cost and
introducing tariffs that reflect the cost structure of the national utility. The prior action for PRSG-5 is
the submission of the Law on Electricity and Gas to Parliament establishing a transparent regulatory
framework and an environment conducive to private sector participation in the sector, and clarifying the
roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in the sector. This action has been met. For PRSG-6, the
triggers will be the implementation of a cost reflective tariff for electricity generation--i.e. involving the
restructuring of tariffs to introduce tariffs that reflect the cost of generation and distribution with cross
subsidies for poor households through the application of a life-line block (yet to be determined).

Integrated and Sustainable Management of Water Resources

97.       In the water sector, the main issue is ensuring sustainable supply and improving access to
the population. This poses a constraint both through the availability of water for production purposes
(i.e. in industry and in irrigation or agriculture production), and also for safe water to prevent disease. In
particular, the low level of irrigation and terracing poses a significant constraint to agriculture
productivity. Given the various uses of water (i.e. for production, drinking and sanitation), Government
has moved to an integrated and sustainable approach to water resources management. Closer coordination
and collaboration of the key agencies charged with water supply and its use (i.e. MINIFRA which is
responsible for water infrastructure; MINRENA which now oversees the integrated management of water
resources including the formulation and implementation of policy; and the ministry of agriculture--
MINAGRI) is critical for the efficient management of water resources.                 The overall institutional
framework has improved coordination and harmonization in the sector, and has been strengthened
through the adoption of a law for the operation of the Rwanda Water and Sanitation Corporation
(RWASCO).

98.       The water sector management information system (WIS) would be instrumental to
coordination and planning in the sector. It would enable: (i) monitoring the programs of various
service providers to limit gaps in sevice; (ii) provision of information for projecting future needs and
assessing trade-offs between competing demands. The Water Ministry has put in place a policy of
encouraging donors to concentrate their efforts in specific regions of the country and views
decentralization of spending as key to successful delivery of service in the sector. Districts are and will
be increasingly responsible for executing large portions of budgetary allocations. The WIS would enable
government to monitor the activities and programs of various government agencies, donors, and other
stakeholders to ensure there are no gaps in service delivery. Finally, to achieve faster economic growth
and reduce the vulnerability to weather shocks (arising from ineffective water management), sufficient
water resources need to be available for productive uses; and the water sector information system would
play a critical role in assessing this availability.    Data from the WIS would enable government to
determine the trade-offs for optimal water use for economic growth, and is critical to developing a sound
approach to the integrated management and planning of water resources.

99.       Reforms to enable the operationalization of RWASCO will also be a key area of priority.
This involves implementation of the provision of the law creating RWASCO by: (i) concluding a
performance contract between the Ministry and RWASCO Board of Directors defining the power, rights
and responsibilities of each party to facilitate supervision of the utility; (ii) putting in place arrangements
for effective management through the conclusion of a performance contract between the Board of
Directors and the management of the utility with well defined performance indicators; (iii) completion by
RWASCO of the needed institutional arrangements to enable hiring of staff including the preparation of
the book of accounts and establishing appropriate tariff setting mechanisms and guidelines.

100.      The PRSG will provide assistance in putting in place the institutional arrangements and
guidelines and work with Government to outline the critical reforms needed to implement the tariff
(which could form a basis for future policy triggers/milestones).             The water sector management
information system (WIS) will cover water resources and both rural and urban sanitation. The objective
is to develop and provide a sound and credible data base on the water sector, and facilitate efficient
monitoring and evaluation of operations in the water sector. The institutional structure is in place, the
design of a comprehensive WIS has been completed, along with the data management structure and the
staff that will operate the information system have been hired and trained. What is needed now is to
populate the databases related to water and sanitation and water resources, including use of water.
Establishment of the system will begin with the water and sanitation sector.




                                                     31

101.     The prior action for PRSG-5 is to establish a management information system for the water
and sanitation sector including a national inventory of water and sanitation infrastructure, to
facilitate effective water resource management. This has been achieved and the overall design and
institutional arrangement for the system has been validated by the relevant stakeholders. The next action
is to operationalize the WIS, to adopt a process for collecting, analyzing, reporting and dissemination of
information generated from the system, and to develop the various databases for the sector (rural and
urban water supply and sanitation, irrigation water use and water resources potential and use) in an
integrated manner. Establishing and operationalizing the WIS will be critical to identifying bottlenecks in
water availability and gaps in service delivery

Increase Rural Road Access by Improving the Condition of the Classified District Road network

102.     The main problem related to access pertains to a need to put in place a framework for
regular maintenance and rehabilitation of the road network that is fiscally sustainable, particularly
in rural areas. As a result, Government reforms have focused on improving road maintenance and
rehabilitation as well as the overall framework for strategic planning and budgeting in the sector.
Government has recently completed a Road Maintenance Strategy that also includes a District/Rural Road
Maintenance and Decentralization Strategy.          The strategy specifies the institutional framework and
financing sources along with procedures and standards for classifying and maintaining the road network.
It also outlines the roles and responsibilities of the central government and Districts in road maintenance.

103.     The Government has also launched the process for a Public Expenditure Review to more
deeply examine the key constraints to improve road maintenance planning and prioritization,
harmonize implementation of road works on classified and non-classified roads, and design a more
strategic approach to cost recovery and funding policies for road maintenance. The PER analysis
for this sector will therefore examine the spending and financing patterns of the Road Maintenance Fund
(RMF) to determine how well spending is aligned with the EPDRS and sector objectives and explore
ways to improve the efficiency of spending. This work will also include technical support to project
evaluation and choice of investment to support the development of the sector's investment plan and
MTEF.

104.     The prior action for PRSG-5 is the adoption by Cabinet of a Maintenance Strategy
(including the framework for maintenance and decentralization of District/Rural roads). It includes
a framework for the financing and operationalization of road maintenance, clarifying the roles and
responsibilities of the Central Government and Districts in road maintenance. This action was achieved
in December 2008. For PRSG-6, the triggers will be the signing by Districts of 3 year Multi-Annual
Output and Performance Based Road Contracts with at least 2 additional contractors. Expected outcomes
at the end of the PRSG series will be: an improved strategic and expenditure framework to support
increased investment in the sector, an institutional framework for decentralized road maintenance with
emphasis on rural roads, an increase in the percent of the classified road network in good condition.

(iii)    Raise Agriculture Productivity and Value Added Exports

105.     Investments in irrigation and water management, research and extension, increased access
and use of fertilizers and improved seeds, and the adoption of appropriate farming technologies
and practices are needed to sustain agriculture growth and reduce the dependence on rain fed
production. The proposed PRSG will complement support provided through the Rural Sector Support
Project and by the Belgian Cooperation. In particular the RSSP is focused on promoting client oriented
applied research; investments to promote soil and water conservation technologies; strengthening farmers'
associations and cooperatives; soil and water conservation; and building the policy, capacity and
institutional frameworks to promote increased access and use of inputs including seeds and fertilizers and



                                                     32

the adoption of appropriate technologies. The Belgian Cooperation is taking the lead to support actions in
the areas of extension services.

106.     In addition, Government is working with its development partners to develop a coherent
agricultural sector development strategy aimed at raising the (currently) very low levels of input
use, and minimizing the impact of external shocks, particularly among smallholder subsistence
producers who make up the majority of the farming population. Government is scaling up existing
pilots of the CIP, particularly with the distribution of fertilizer and improved seeds-- only 2 percent of
households accessed fertilizers under the Government's pilot Crop Intensification Project (CIP) last
season. Scaling up the CIP pilots should help to maintain and increase current levels of domestic food
production and protect consumers from the rapidly rising cost of imported foods. Irrigation development,
which the Bank is actively supporting, can be expected to reduce dependence on rainfall and drive
agricultural productivity growth over the medium to long term. IFAD is providing financing of $35
million for the CIP in Kirehe. The IFAD financed component will explicitly rely on and emphasize
intensification and integration of crops and livestock and the use of appropriate agricultural technologies
and practices.

107.     The PRSG focuses on the key areas of support related to reforms to strengthen soil and
water conservation and irrigation, as outlined in the PRSG-4 program document.                   It is also
supporting institutional reforms to develop a private sector led fertilizer distribution system. The prior
action for PRSG-5 is the completion of feasibility studies on watershed management in at least four
(4) out of the thirty-four (34) sites identified for watershed management and terracing under the
Land Husbandry, Water Harvesting, and Hillside Irrigation Program, and including a technical
assessment of such pilot activities and mapping of areas requiring protection through watershed
management and terracing. For PRSG-6 the trigger will be to develop and implement an action plan to
promote emergence of a private sector-led fertilizer procurement and distribution system. The outcome
indicators are the percent of farmers using improved fertilizer (both chemical and organic) increases from
a baseline of 12 and 7, respectively, to targets of 20 percent (chemical) and 17 percent (organic) by end-
2010; and for the area of land sustainably managed against soil erosion and made productive through
irrigation to increase from a baseline level of 40 percent to 60 percent in 2010.

(iv)     Broaden and Deepen the Financial Sector

108.     While much has been accomplished in terms of laying the groundwork for financial
broadening and deepening, the challenges remain daunting.               A household survey, completed in
December, 2008 by FinScope, provides the first comprehensive demand-side assessment of usage of
financial services in the country. By far the most significant barrier to banking in Rwanda is linked to
low incomes. Eighty-three percent of the unbanked population indicates they do not have enough money
left after covering daily living expenses to place money in an account. The largest barrier to borrowing
cited was the fear of being unable to meet repayment requirements. These findings highlight the fact that
just over half of the surveyed population had an income of under FRw 5000 (US $9.20) per month. The
top reasons cited for having a bank account were savings (68 percent), followed by credit (50 percent).
Even among those who bank, cash transactions dominate, reflecting the underdeveloped payments
system.

109.     The low level of rural and agricultural finance represents a constraint to realizing the
Government's objective of raising agricultural productivity. While agriculture represents 40 percent
of GDP and 80 percent of employment, it constituted just 5.4 percent of credit to the economy in 2007. It
should be noted, however, that agricultural credit received just 1 percent of loans in 2001, and has since
expanded over 700 percent (versus growth in credit of 156 percent overall over the same period).
Reasons for the relatively low level of rural credit include: (i) clients are unable to provide adequate
collateral for loans, in part because the legal framework for secured transactions is weak; (ii) the absence
of products widely used elsewhere to finance agriculture, such as warehouse receipts, forward contracts,
inventory financing, leasing and factoring; (iii) rudimentary value chain financing which does not give
banks control over payments; (iv) lack of expertise and experience in agronomy and agricultural
economics among commercial banks which gives rise to perceived high risk in investing in the sector and
poor product development for rural finance; (vi) the preponderance of sight deposits in the funding of
micro-finance institutions (MFIs), and the absence of refinancing or liquidity facilities to enable them to
tailor lending to crop cycles or investment needs of farmers.

110.     In response to the above challenges, Government is putting in place a policy on
microfinance and a related law. The policy defines different types of microfinance institutions, with
graduated capital and prudential requirements depending on their size, whether or not deposits can be
taken from the public, etc.          It also sets forth oversight and reporting arrangements.               The policy is
generally sound and in line with international good practice.

111.     In the case of rural finance, the Government plans to continue with a second phase of its
Rural Investment Facility which has been instrumental in improving access to rural finance. The
second Rural Investment Facility (RIF-2) aims to improve incentives to investment in the agricultural
sector in Rwanda.3 In line with the EDPRS priority given to growth in agricultural productivity, the
Government is pursuing a multi-pronged approach to growth in the agricultural sector, where access to
finance has been identified as a key constraint.4 The Government is therefore adopting measures to
improve rural access to finance in Rwanda through products and services that help investors and bankers
to manage risks and to better serve the rural population. These measures include the piloting of innovative
rural finance products (e.g. leasing, value chain finance) and capacity building for farmers, their
organizations and financial service providers through a pipeline agricultural World Bank operation.5
These activities are being developed in full collaboration with efforts of other partners to provide a
coordinated response to the development of sustainable rural finance. It is acknowledged, however, that
these measures will take some time to take effect and that there is a critical short term gap in incentives for
productive investment in agriculture that can be aptly filled by a second and final phase of the RIF.
Annex 9 provides an overview of the operation of the RIF, as well as the technical terms and conditions
of its implementation. These are well informed by lessons from the first Rural Investment Facility (RIF
1). Achievements under RIF 1 are summarized in Box 4 below.

112.     The modernization of the payment systems has also been launched: a National Payment
Council has been established, and a National Payment Strategy published by BNR. The World Bank is
supporting BNR in introducing a Real Time Gross Settlement system and Automated Clearing House,
which are expected to be operational by 2010. In parallel, the Government and SIMTEL are working

 The total RIF 2 fund endowment will be roughly USD 10 million, of which USD 9 million from IDA under the PRSG-5 and
about USD 1 million ( RWF 500 million) from monies retained from RIF-1, which have been kept by BNR in a special account.

                               Box 4: Achievements of the Rural Investment Facility

Results from the first phase of the RIF indicate that it can substantially contribute to promoting productive
investment in the sector. Under RIF 1, a total number of 4,296 loans received grants totaling US $10.4 million for a
total of fully US $31.3 million in `RIF loans'. Although most RIF recipients were groups and individuals with prior
access to finance, an independent evaluation of RIF-16 found that 77.5 percent of RIF-financed agricultural activities
would not have been undertaken without the RIF facility. Furthermore, the same study found that RIF-financed
activities created an average of 26 permanent jobs per project, which is a substantial contribution to the development
of rural based employment.        Finally, RIF-1 contributed to the rapid expansion of agriculture credit by the
commercial banking sector witnessed over the period 2002-2007. Over that period, the BNR reports that lending to
the sector grew from 1.7 to 5.4 percent of all private loans outstanding in Rwanda, representing cumulative lending
of roughly US $60 million to agriculture. Note that over the same period, RIF loans alone accounted for almost half
that amount.


113.      Despite the above progress in reforms in the financial sector, it remains weak, and much
remains to be done to build capacity and professionalism in the industry if it is to play a significant
role in providing financial services to a broad cross section of urban and rural Rwandans. The
Government, along with the World Bank and several other development partners are providing support to
strengthen the sector (prudential oversight, training, MIS, refinancing lines, audit, etc.).

114.      The PRSG series will continue to support Government efforts to improve access to financial
services (with a focus on rural finance), and promote the development of capital markets and long-term
financing instruments. In that regard, the prior action for PRSG-5 is the signing of an MoU between
BNR and MINAGRI to support investments in the rural sector under the second Rural Investment
Facility (RIF 2). This action has been completed. The proposed trigger for PRSG-6 will focus on the
adoption of appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks for the national payments system, credit bureau,
and secured transactions. These are critical areas in the Governments reform agenda as outlined in its
Financial Sector Development Plan for strengthening the financial system and increasing credit access.

         B.     IMPROVE ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE AND DEVELOP IMPLEMENTATION CAPACITY

115.      Substantial progress in PFM reforms has been achieved; however, low capacity remain the
main constraint to the progress in reforms. In particular, capacity as it pertains to technical know-how
and having in place the appropriate systems and institutions continue to be an area of weakness for PFM
reforms. Recent assessments indicate that the main areas of weakness pertain to having skilled and
professional PFM specialists, adopting a management information system, low capacity in procurement
methods, and the need for the appropriate incentives in civil service reforms to build the capacity of staff
and improve retention.

116.      The areas of support and main outcomes are drawn from the CPAF as follows: (i) develop an
enhanced the public financial management system; (ii) strengthen capacity for procurement methods; (iii)
Deepen the budget and fiscal decentralization reforms; (iv) adopt civil service reforms to build skills,
incentives and retention; (v) develop the system for monitoring and evaluation.

(i)     Develop an Enhanced Public Financial Management System

117.    Although there has been substantial progress in PFM reforms, a number of challenges and
issues remain to be addressed. The Government recently completed an analysis of the strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) for the implementation of the PFM Reform Strategy
which identified a number of key priorities which Government is currently addressing: (i) the need for an
integrated information system to strengthen; (ii) the need to develop comprehensive and costed strategies
for the other key sectors of the EDPRS (this exist currently only for education and health); (iii) low
capacity overall for financial management and accounting specialists. Table 8 summarizes the results of
the SWOT exercise (see also Annex 7). The Public Sector Building Capacity Program (PSCB) has
supported the development of the PFM Action plan through a basket fund. The PRSG series focuses
support on the implementation of the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS).

118.     Given the SWOT analysis and Government priorities as outlined in the PFM Action Plan,
the prior action for PRSG-5 is the completion of development of the PublicBooks software. The
completion of the software will greatly facilitate the improvement of budget preparation, reporting, and
accountability in budget agencies, and increase transparency.          The triggers for PRSG-6 will be
PublicBooks pilots are completed and rolled out to all budget agencies and integrated with the Payroll
system. A key outcome will be the ability of each budget agency to submit completed sets of financial
statements for each year beginning in 2009 as stipulated in the OBL.

(ii)     Strengthen Capacity and Transparency of Procurement Methods

119.     Government has made substantial progress toward strengthening the legal and regulatory
framework for procurement, and now needs to strengthen capacity to implement the reforms.
Following the adoption of the procurement law and establishment of the Rwanda Public Procurement
Authority (RPPA), the GoR now needs to adopt the related regulations and standard bidding documents.
The low capacity within the procuring entities is currently the main challenge to continued reforms. Due
to the capacity problem it is necessary for the RPPA to be involved in procurement operations by
undertaking prior review functions above certain thresholds.

120.     Aside from establishing the legal framework and accompanying reforms, the Government
has put in place institutions to promote increased transparency in procurement. Independent review
panels have been set up and made operational at the national and district levels, according to the provision
of the Law (five members, out of which three are from the private sector and civil society organizations).
During the first semester 2008, twenty six (26) appeals (compared to 29 for the last semester 2007) were
filled, out of which 42 percent led to a change in the contract award (compared to 50 percent). Bidders on
public procurement contracts now have access to independent recourse to appeal contract awards. In line
with this achievement, Government is now publicly publishing the independent review of appeals (which
was previously an internal Government document). In recognition of progress made in this area, this
measure is included as a prior action under PRSG-5. On Fraud and Corruption cases, fourteen (14) cases
were received in 2008, out of which two (2) were convicted of corruption, but ten (10) are still pending to
be tried. In addition, the RPPA website already publishes a list of debarred firms. However, procurement
plans, contract awards, sanctions are not yet being published and enforcement in this aspect is still very
weak.

121.     The PRSG supports the prioritization of actions identified in the draft capacity building
work plan to enable the development of a two-phase strategy. In the short term, this strategy shall
comprise the dissemination of the new procurement regulations (Law, Standard Bidding Documents,
RPPA functions, procurement audits, appeals mechanisms, etc.) to the various stakeholders involved in
procurement operations (procurement officers in the procuring entities, RPPA staff, public decision-
makers, private sector representatives and civil society organizations); the objective is to ensure (i) a
proper implementation of the new regulations, (ii) a greater transparency and competition in the
procurement transactions and (iii) an efficient spending in public funds. In parallel, and in the medium
and long term, this strategy shall aim at developing a curriculum that will cover all aspects of
procurement including training of lawyers, managers, decision makers leading to a degree and/or
professional designation. The partnership agreement shall also ensure that over a defined period of time,
trainers will be drawn from a pool of national and well trained professionals. The RPPA will publish
these procurement plans on its website.

122.     One indication of developed capacity will be the ability of procuring entities to prepare and
publish their procurement plans. This would also facilitate integration of externally financed and
capital spending into the recurrent budget. In addition, the Procurement Code stipulates that all procuring
entities must prepare and publish a procurement plan to indicate the timing, methods and various steps of



                                                   38

the process as well as its expected completion date. To facilitate implementation of the procurement code
and consolidate the results from the capacity building exercises, it will be critical to ensure that all
procuring entities are able to comply with these instructions.

123.     Given the above, the prior action for PRSG-5 is the publication of the 2008 annual report of
the independent panel addressing appeals by contractors of public procurement decisions. The
trigger for PRSG-6 will be the submission of a procurement plan with budget proposals to MINECOFIN,
by all procuring agencies, and the publication of these procurement plans on the RPPA website. This will
facilitate improved transparency and help with the integration of externally financed projects in the
budget.

(iii)    Strengthen Implementation of Budget and Fiscal Decentralization Reforms

124.     The focus of budget reforms has been on strengthening performance based budgeting and
more closely linking the medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) and the annual budget
ceilings. Measures to adopt performance based budgeting aims to ensure that the MTEF structure enables
monitoring of the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) and sector policy
implementation.    In line with this, the economic classification of the budget has been revised in
accordance with the main areas of focus and programs of the EDPRS. Also, the criteria for priority
expenditure has been updated and aligned to the EDPRS to facilitate the monitoring of EDPRS
implementation through the Annual Budget. These changes are being reinforced with training programs
on the new MTEF structure and budget preparation, to support the planning units at the central and local
government levels, and in particular to provide support toward training in costing.

125.     At the decentralized level, since the initiation of fiscal decentralization reforms in 2006,
there has been a steady increase in the absolute and relative amount of transfers to local
governments (see Table 9). Transfers have increased from 8.8 percent of total budget to an estimated 13
percent in 2008. However, there is the issue of a multiplicity of earmarked grants that constrain efficient
planning and autonomy of the districts, and strains capacity.

                                        Table 9: Decentralized Budget

                                                                   2006       2007      2008
                  Decentralized Budget                            35734      64640      80766

                  Decentralized as % of Total Budget                8.8        12.2      13.0

                  Source: Budget Laws, Ministry of Finance, Government of Rwanda, 2008.



126.     Reporting and improved autonomy for the Districts in planning will be greatly improved
through the simplification of the allocation formula and the streamlining of the multiplicity of
earmarked transfers. In order to increase District autonomy in the face of limited own-revenues the
study recommends that other sectors follow the agriculture sector model in the management of earmarked
transfers. Specifically, district budgets have 37 EDPRS defined activity budget lines which have separate
grants. However, for the agriculture sector, multiple lines refer to one grant or transfer. This gives
districts more discretion and autonomy during the budgeting phase to allocate resources across the various
budget lines. The study also highlights the need to further clarify the division of roles between local and
central government in service delivery within each sector. This is critical for strengthening the autonomy
and capacity of the districts and will be an area of continued technical support during the course of the
PRSG series.




                                                      39

127.     Government has outlined priority areas of reform based on a recent review of the existing
grant allocation system which found that there is still scope to strengthen the definition of roles
between central government and districts for service delivery. Government plans to undertake an
assessment of the current block grant system to inform revision of the transfer formula. In addition, an
assessment of Districts' own resource earning potential will be undertaken to inform the design of the
transfer formula since districts are currently heavily dependent on the center for financing. As part of this
effort, all Districts will complete a statement of revenue and expenditure.

128.     The above reforms will have to proceed gradually over time given capacity constraints and
limited local revenue sources. In the meantime, as the capacity is developed in these areas the focus of
this series of PRSGs is on improving reporting on the current level of district transfers and using lessons
learned to inform the continual development of capacity and prioritization of reforms, and the definition
of precise policy actions to be monitored in the CPAF. The trigger for PRSG-6 will be to adopt and
operationalize a comprehensive 5-year capacity building strategy for local government.

(iv)     Adopt Civil Service Reforms to Build Skills, Incentives and Retention

129.     The main issues related to the civil service are as follows: (i) underdeveloped core systems
related to management information, monitoring and performance management systems--which are
currently being developed by MIFOTRA; (ii) understaffing of central ministries in key policy areas; (iii)
existing organizational structures adopted by most ministries that are not aligned with their functional
responsibilities. As a result, ministries have resorted to recruiting temporary staff, project financed staff
or expatriates, which is a necessary interim solution. However, an approach toward building a more
sustainable long-term capacity and skills acquisition is needed.

130.     A long-term approach, to build and retain capacity, requires attention to incentives and the
career path for the civil service. To this end, a recent survey of 46 "leavers" prioritized the following
factors: (i) salary and benefits (cited as the primary reason by 50 percent of those surveyed; (ii)
management problems (raised by 45 percent of the respondents, including individuals "not getting on"
with the boss); (iii) lack of career prospects and possibilities of promotion (mentioned by 40 percent of
respondents). In addition, a pay study noted that pay levels are not necessarily lower than in the private
sector. However, private sector employers generally offer greater upward potential in remuneration.

131.     To address the problem of skills and retention, as well as clarify the functional structure and
coordination across government agencies, Government plans to undertake the following actions:

    ·    Establish an internship program for current and recent graduates to introduce them to the civil
         service and provide a pool of potential new recruits for Government

    ·    MIFOTRA to elaborate manuals and procedures for a performance management system and all
         PRSG ministries to adopt processes for performance management, train staff and use manuals
         developed

    ·    MIFOTRA to establish clear systems, mandates and roles for the relationships between
         Ministries, districts, agencies and other stakeholders (`framework documents') and all PRSG
         ministries are to produce ministerial instructions/decree that clarifies the division of labor and
         oversight arrangements with districts, their agencies and other stakeholders

    ·    MIFOTRA to agree with all PRSG ministries on staffing levels and ministerial structures for
         optimal performance within fiscal limits and all PRSG ministries to adjust structures and staffing
         levels for optimal performance within fiscal limits.



                                                    40

132.     Support under the PRSG will complement the technical assistance being provided under the
Bank's Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PSCBP) to support skills development and staff
retention in the civil service, and strengthen coordination of functions and structures. In addition, triggers
under the PFM section are focused on developing the IFMIS and integrating this with payroll and HR
which will complement the areas of support related to civil service reform and facilitate the availability of
information to enable rigorous audits of MIFOTRA. As part of the restructuring exercise started in July
2008, all ministries and districts have submitted proposals to readjust functions across different
government levels and revisit organizational structures and staffing levels. The PRSG series will continue
to provide support to Government in this area and strengthen the civil service component of the CPAF. In
the meantime, PRSG-6 will support the process leading up to an agreement between MIFOTRA and all
central ministries on staffing levels and ministerial structures for optimal performance within fiscal limits.

(v)      Monitoring and Evaluation

133.     A monitoring framework for the EDPRS along with a Common Performance Assessment
Framework (CPAF) has been developed under Government leadership and in close collaboration
with Donors. The CPAF outlines a subset of indicators and policy actions around which all budget
support donors have agreed with Government to focus. In addition, Governance indicators have been
included into the framework and are based on the PFM action plan. Furthermore, a central M&E
Secretariat has been established at MINECOFIN and 16 M&E officers have been hired who will be made
part of the organigram of Government. These officers will be attached to Ministries and Provinces.

134.     Government has hired M&E officers for each ministry. The aim is for MINECOFIN to
coordinate and provide support to ministries who will have their own M&E officers.                      Sector
monitoring matrices need to be updated and aligned with the M&E tools being developed by
MINECOFIN. Finally, the coordination mechanisms between MINECOFIN and sector ministries will
need to be developed.

135.     A capacity building plan to support these officers is being developed by HIDA and
MINECOFIN.         The plan will combine multiple tools such as training sessions on specific issues,
community of practice, training on the job, etc.        A Road Map that outlines the work program for
developing the system and institutional processes will be developed to facilitate alignment of donor
funding. In addition, there has been continued progress in the institutionalization of the citizen report
cards with the completion of community score cards in key sectors and institutional mechanism for
linking result to Imihigo contracts are being developed.


                              VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                   A.    POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

136.     Overall, the reforms and measures to be supported under this operation are geared toward
improving access of rural households to services to support their income generating and
employment activities and therefore no adverse impacts are foreseen in this aspect. Poverty and
social impact analysis will be used to identify measures to strengthen the aspects of the operation that
most promote inclusive growth. Specifically, to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics that have
defined the pattern of poverty incidence, an analysis of the growth poverty linkage will be used to
examine ways of further refining and targeting interventions to ensure there are greater growth benefits
accruing to the more vulnerable and poor segments of the population. Additional studies are being
undertaken and used to strengthen the design of the capitation grants in education (per capita transfers to
school facilities to provide greater incentives for hiring and retaining teachers, and the provision of school
materials). The education country status assessment will examine disparities in educational attainment


                                                    41

between boys and girls and will inform development of the strategy for improving access for both girls
and boys. In addition, construction of a multidimensional poverty index to assess impacts of transport
development initiatives on poverty is planned as part of the second phase of the development of the
national strategic transport master plan.

137.     The Government also remains committed to understand the distributional impacts of key
policy reforms and economic actions. For example, a quantitative analysis, (using quasi-randomized
methods), of smallholder access to improved inputs in the tea sector finds that there is differential access
to fertilizer between men and women. The reason for this differential access is tied to access to micro-
credit and assets for borrowing. Government has therefore included in its design of the private sector-led
fertilizer distribution system a component to target fertilizer vouchers to small holder wheat and maize
producers, a significant proportion of which are women. In the case of electricity reforms, a poverty and
social impact analysis of the previous increase in the flat tariff showed that because access rates to the
network are very low among the poor, the share of implicit subsidies that prevailed before the increase in tariff
was very low and provided little benefit to the poor. There is a plan now to restructure the tariff to both cover
costs of the utility while also putting in place cross-subsidies for poor households. This will be done through
the application of a life-line block. Lower tariffs for households in the poorer income brackets will increase
the uptake rates of the electricity roll-out program, making it affordable for a large proportion of
households and enabling them to connect and consume electricity. Analysis completed so far shows that
affordability will be the main barrier to achieve Government's target of 35 percent access to electricity (as
outlined in the Vision 2020). Further in depth analysis is planned on the precise structure of the lifeline
and the implications for covering costs and ensuring equitable access for poorer households.

138.     In general, the assessment of the poverty and social impact of the measures proposed by the
EDPRS and supported by the PRSG is carried out in the context of Rwanda's EDPRS monitoring system
and in particular the household living conditions and demographic health surveys that analyze, among
other things, poverty trends and dynamics every five years. The surveys which cover the entire country
provide a rich source of information on household socio-economic characteristics, including consumption
expenditures, employment, and access to social services, etc. The surveys will be complemented by
annual integrated poverty assessments to enable mid-course adjustments towards reaching identified goals
and targets set over a 5 year period.

                         B.      IMPLEMENTATION MONITORING AND EVALUATION

139.     Monitoring and evaluation arrangements will continue to rely on government arrangements
with the aim of strengthening government capacity and institutions. The Government has developed
in close collaboration with partners, including the Bank, a results and performance framework integrated
into the planning and budgeting processes for monitoring the EDPRS (see Annexes 4 and 5). The
integrated results framework/monitoring system consists of three components: a National Results and
Policy Matrix; a Common Performance Assessment Framework; and a Development Partners'
Assessment Framework.          An institutional framework for monitoring in which responsibility for the
overall monitoring of the EDPRS rests with MINECOFIN's Strategic Planning Unit has been established.
In addition, the Budget Monitoring and Reporting team reports on spending of the budget and related
outputs. This team also ensures that the sector spending plans are incorporated into the macro-MTEF,
and budget. The Bank will work closely with these two units to monitor spending and outputs achieved
under the PRSG series.

140.     To improve monitoring systems, the Bank has supported the Government's efforts to build
quality and institutional capacity. Alongside the PRSG, the Bank is implementing grants from the
Trust Fund on Statistical Capacity Building and the Belgian Poverty Reduction Partnership Trust Fund




                                                      42

aimed at enhancing statistical capacity. The Bank's ongoing investment projects each have an M&E
component that supports both the project and the relevant sectoral ministry.

141.    The monitoring and evaluation of the PRSG series draws from the CPAF which was
finalized in December, 2008. Table 11 summarizes the expected outcomes and related indicators and
targets. Monitoring of these indicators will rely on the Government system. Definition of each indicator
along with measurement and data source has been outlined by the National Institute of Statistics. The
Bank will therefore monitor the key indicators and the overall CPAF in close collaboration with other
budget support donors.

                 C.    GRANT AMOUNT, DISBURSEMENTS AND ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT

142.    A single-tranche grant of SDR 53 million (USD 80 million equivalent) would be made
available upon effectiveness, which is expected in March 2009. The proposed grant will follow the
Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy operations. Grant proceeds will be disbursed
against satisfactory implementation of the development policy program and not tied to any specific
purchases or be subject to procurement requirements. Once the Bank's Board approves the grant and it
becomes effective, and at the request of the Recipient, IDA will disburse the proceeds of the grant into an
account designated by the Recipient that forms a part of the country foreign exchange reserves at the
Banque Nationale du Rwanda. The Recipient shall ensure that upon the deposit of the grant into said
account, an equivalent amount is credited in the Recipient's budget management system, in a manner
acceptable to IDA. The Recipient will report to IDA on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency
account and credited in local currency to the budget management system with an indication of the
exchange rate applied. IDA reserves the right to request an audit of said account. If the proceeds of the
grant are used for ineligible purposes (i.e. to finance goods or services on the standard negative list), as
defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will require the Recipient to promptly upon notice from IDA,
refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA upon such
request shall be cancelled. The administration of this grant will be the responsibility of the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Planning.

                                       D.     FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

143.    The public financial management system is reasonably adequate to support the PRSG. In
addition, a key focus of this operation is related to continued support to strengthening the Government's
public financial and expenditure management and procurement systems. Areas of support under the
PRSG have been summarized in the previous section. Assessments of the fiduciary aspects are largely
based on results from the PEFA indicate that public financial management and procurement systems have
been improving steadily in line with government commitment to reform, (as outlined in its Financial
Accountability Review and Action Plan), and the dialogue between the Government and the donors has
been constructive. Fiduciary assessments are also based on results from recently completed PERs in the
education, health, agriculture, and water sectors, 2004 HIPC Assessment and CPAR, as well as the 2005
CFAA. In addition, the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) was subject to a safeguards assessment in the
context of the PRGF arrangement approved on June 12, 2006. The update assessment proposed
recommendations to address continuing vulnerabilities in the external audit and financial reporting areas.
The implementation of these measures is being monitored under the Fund program. Finally, the Bank is
undertaking a policy driven technical assistance PER to provide capacity building support to Government
in expenditure analysis and monitoring.

                                    E.    ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

144.    Under Operational Policy 8.60, on Development Policy Lending, the Bank is required to
determine whether specific country policies supported under the operation are likely to cause significant
effects on the country's environment, and, in the event of such likely effects, assess country systems for
reducing any such adverse effects and enhancing such positive effects. In the event of significant gaps in



                                                   44

the analysis, or shortcomings in the country systems, the Bank is required to identify how such gaps or
shortcomings would be addressed before or during program implementation, as appropriate.

145.    Following these policy requirements, specific country policies supported by the PRSG 5 are not
likely to cause significant effects on Rwanda's environment, forests and other natural resources. On the
contrary, any likely adverse effects are expected to be minor and manageable through the existing Bank
framework in place for the PRSG 5 areas of support.

146.    In the current PRSG series, such minor environmental effects may arise through measures to
support irrigation, watershed management and terracing, rural road maintenance, and fertilizer
distribution. An extensive Environmental Assessment and Social Analysis undertaken during PRSG 1
remain relevant in this regard. As with the first series of PRSGs, the current series (PRSG 4 to 6), will
rely on two areas to address potential environmental concerns: (i) continued strengthening of the overall
framework for environmental management in Rwanda; and (ii) environmental management assessments
undertaken in the context of other Bank projects.

147.    There continue to be improvements in the framework for environmental management in
Rwanda over the last decade resulting in noticeable improvements in the institutional framework
during the last five years. Since 2004, MINIRENA has had the responsibility for the environment,
mines, land, forest, and water resources. For policy formulation and implementation, MINIRENA relies
on a number of specialized public agencies including REMA (environmental agency), REDEMI (mining),
and the National Land Center (land use planning and delivery of titles). Over the last four years,
MINIRENA has secured the adoption of several pieces of legislation by the national assembly, including
laws on forests, land, water, environment, and mining that will improve the management of natural
resources. However, MINIRENA is facing tremendous challenges and many operational constraints. In
particular, the lack of adequate staffing both at the central and district level is a noticeable hindrance to
effective policy implementation and coordination. The capacity constraint seems particularly severe at
the district level where most of the responsibilities for sectoral policy implementation are located. This
second series of PRSGs will support continued capacity building to strengthen the key agencies charged
with environmental management. This will complement the program of small grants for environmental
capacity building provided by UNEP that is being used to build in a framework for environmental
assessments in key ministries. Support to strengthening the institutions for environmental management
also is taking a much longer view that has involved the incorporation and mainstreaming of improved
environmental stewardship into the medium-term expenditure framework of MINIRENA. More work is
needed to incorporate budget allocations in a medium term framework that translates the objectives of the
ministry's 2005-2010 Strategic Plan into measurable actions and results on an annual basis. Appropriate
resources will need to be allocated to well-targeted capacity building activities at the central and district
level, and to cross-sectoral technical support aimed at addressing the environmental management needs of
the second and subsequent series of PRSGs. The focus will be on a long-term sustained support to
building capacity to address environmental concerns in the implementation of the EDPRS.

148.    Environmental management assessments undertaken in the context of other Bank projects
will also help to address any potential environmental concerns for the proposed policy areas of the
PRSG.      In the case of irrigation and marshland development, Government has developed the
environmental framework for marshland development. Policies to support the development of irrigation
schemes will require adequate resources to control the incidence of water-borne diseases, pollution of
surface and groundwater by agrochemicals, water-logging and salinization of soils, and population
resettlement. In that context, the PRSG will rely on completed environmental assessments for the Rural
Sector Support Project which has supported the development of marshlands. Further assessments will be
completed in the context of the proposed Lake Victoria Project and the Land Husbandry, Water
Harvesting, and Hillside Irrigation (LWH) Project which is a comprehensive land-husbandry, water-



                                                   45

harvesting and hillside-irrigation initiative for commercialized and professional agriculture currently
under preparation. In the case of support to development of the fertilizer procurement and distribution
system, the focus is on building institutional capacity for improved fertilizer distribution. Currently, the
total level of fertilizer use is so small and the amounts to be stimulated are projected to be barely 40
percent of the country's total needs. Therefore, the quantity of fertilizer distributed is not expected to be
large enough to have significant adverse environmental impacts while having substantial positive impacts
on productivity. In addition, as part of the RSSP 2, training will be provided to communities in proper
handling and application of these materials as part of local capacity building. Finally, the road
maintenance strategy includes a framework for addressing environmental assessments in line with the law
and regulations of the Rwanda Environmental Management Agency. Specifically, maintenance contracts
are required to include clauses to ensure HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention, environmental protection
and labor standards.

149.    In sum, while the proposed operation is expected to have no significant adverse effects on the
environment, country systems have adequate capacity, and appropriate arrangements have also been made
through Bank work, as outlined above, to address any such minor effects that might arise. The operation
therefore complies fully with the requirements of OP 8.60.

                                    F.    RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

150.    There are four main risks potentially associated with the program as follows:                      i)
macroeconomic and financial sector risk; ii) regional/country risk; ii) program risk; and iv) fiduciary risk.

151.    Macroeconomic and Financial Risk. This is rated moderate to low risk given the GoR's record
in macroeconomic management. Overall GoR's record has been rated as satisfactory as evidenced also
through the satisfactory completion of reviews under the PRSG. Risks to the program could arise through
continued reductions in world commodity prices that compromise export earnings coupled with a
reduction in grants as the world recession deepens in donor countries. To mitigate the potential balance
of payments risk Government has reduced expenditures and increased reserves. The effects of the world
recession are not yet evident in the economy. Should these effects become substantial, the Bank would
consider providing supplemental financing. Government will continue its policy of identifying areas for
contingent spending should more external resources become available. It will also continue to protect
priority spending from any in overall spending. Finally, it will continue with measures to expand the tax
base and improve the efficiency of the tax system. Mitigation of this risk is achievable as long as GoR
continues to implement reforms to increase investment to support growth.

152.    In terms of the large injections of liquidity that has been evident in the past, Government policy
actions have demonstrated the commitment to employ policies that maintain the flexibility of the
exchange rate while sterilizing the excess liquidity. Regarding any appreciation of the exchange rate and
the likely effects on exports, it will be critical to put in effect policies to improve the supply response,
ease the constraints to productivity and support increased absorption. This is the main area of focus of the
PRSG operation.       In addition, Government has demonstrated through its management of previous
injections of liquidity into the economy, its commitment to use market based instruments to ensure that
inflation is contained and any potential exchange rate appreciation is well managed. Furthermore, the
level of gross reserves in months of imports has been between 5 and 6, providing adequate import
coverage and underlining the government's commitment to prudent macroeconomic management.

153.    However, there may be a need for Government to take on some concessional loans, on a selective
basis, to enable the necessary investments to generate growth. The World Bank and the IMF will
continue to support the Government in managing macroeconomic reform and investing in infrastructure
development to ensure continued growth and productivity. In the context of the low income country debt



                                                    46

sustainability framework, the Bank and Fund will continue to monitor the evolution in Rwanda's debt
indicators which are currently substantially below set thresholds.

154.     Regional/Country Risk.       Instability in the Great Lakes Region continues to be a risk to
Rwanda's economic stability and to the consolidation of development progress. Success in addressing
this risk requires the strong engagement of the governments in the region as well as the international
community. The signature on November 9th 2007 of a Joint Communiqué between the Governments of
Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo with the objective of resolving the question of the
presence of Rwandan combatants on Congolese territory, in a collaborative manner, is an important step
forward. In January 2008, the Government of DRC signed a peace accord with over 20 militia groups
operating in the country. At the international level, both the United Nations and the African Union have
continued to support the establishment of peace in the region. UN Security Council Resolution 1804,
adopted in March 2008, exhorts the FDLR and all Rwandan armed rebel groups to lay down their
weapons and return to Rwanda. The recent high-level meeting in Nairobi in November 2008, which
reiterated the importance of implementing the above agreements, is further evidence of the diplomatic
efforts of the international community to find a lasting solution. The Tripartite Plus Joint Commission
continues to work toward identifying measures to counter the negative forces operating in the region.
Following the flare up of fighting in Eastern DRC in late 2008, some budget support donors who
constitute a small share of overall budget support suspended their budget support due to their uncertainty
over Rwanda's compliance with the underlying principles of the Budget Support Partnership Agreement
Framework, related to the promotion of peace and security in the region (Article 18 of the partnership
MoU signed between GoR and Budget Support donors in April 2008).              Since then these donors have
begun discussions with the Government with a view to resolving the issues of contention. On January 20,
2009, the Governments of DRC and Rwanda begun a joint military operation to disarm the FDLR, within
the framework of an accord signed between the two countries on December 5, 2008. This agreement has
been supported by the EU, as a sign of improving relations between the two countries. The joint initiative
demonstrates the willingness of both Rwanda and the DRC to find a lasting solution to the problems of
instability in the region. If successful, this could mark an important breakthrough in achieving greater
peace and stability for the region

155.     Currently, Rwanda's internal security and political situation remains stable.              However
continued effort is needed to address the remaining political effects of the 1994 genocide. Constraints
surrounding the Gacaca system have given rise to contentions both by victims and perpetrators of the
genocide, and highlighted the need to strengthen ongoing efforts to build a strong judiciary. Government
efforts to continue to open the political space also need to continue. As part of this effort, a law on NGO
groups has been revised in line with international experience.

156.     Program Risk. Predictability of donor funding, the ability to mobilize donor funding and debt
sustainability continue to be the main program risks. DFID's three-year rolling program within an overall
10-year commitment provides a good model for enhancing the long-term predictability of donor funding.
There has been a general move toward budget support, and the recent suspension of disbursements by a
few budget support donors (see paragraph 178 above) is not foreseen to have any substantial adverse
effects on the program due to the small share of the amounts. However, the recent global slowdown could
pose a risk to the past increasing trend to budget support for the country. Improvements in frontloading by
donors will help the GoR to plan and implement its budget in a more sustainable manner. In the short-
term, the Bank has worked to help the GoR access the Catalytic Fund for Africa. The Bank could also
consider supplemental financing should there be any indication of a significant shock to the balance of
payments. Over the long-term, the GoR will need to continue to focus on mobilizing additional grant
financing, which is critical if the GoR is to remain within prudent debt sustainability limits.

157.    Fiduciary Risk. The rapid decentralization undertaken by the GoR has heightened potential
procurement and public financial management risks since only limited accompanying fiduciary measures
were included. However, the GoR has committed to accelerating its efforts to address these risks. The
GoR is drafting an easy-reference guide for procurement, along with a technical assistance "hotline" for
procurement officers. It is also accelerating the implementation of the Rwanda Expertise Scheme that is
training accountants, to be deployed at decentralized levels, in the Rwanda public accounting system, and
sponsoring the best among them for professional accountancy qualification. Furthermore, this series of
PRSGs is supporting the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive 5-year capacity building
strategy for local government, which includes measures to strengthen public financial management at the
local level.

                      Annex 4: The EDPRS Implementation and Monitoring Arrangements

1. Formation of Implementation Working Groups7

          The Sector Working Groups (SWGs), which were used to elaborate the EDPRS will be grouped into eight
Implementation Working Groups (IWGs) to correspond to the priority areas of the EDPRS and to link with the
seven technical platforms of Rwanda Economic and Social Development Council (RESC). IWGs are forums to
coordinate between sectors and between government and development partners, to discuss policy issues and monitor
implementation. Each IWG is chaired by one of the Ministry SGs, co-chaired by a donor representative, and
supported by a technical secretariat, based in the Lead Ministry. Each IWG will comprise the stakeholders from
related sector working groups. Through being more closely aligned to EDPRS priorities, this leaner structure should
facilitate the process of monitoring.

          This, however, does not mean that SWGs will cease to exist. The SWGs will operate as usual. Their role
will be to update the sector strategies in line with their logical frameworks and thereafter to conduct annual Joint
Sector Reviews and produce Public Expenditure Reviews. They will also ensure that their respective M&E
frameworks are operational on the ground. However, for coordination, alignment and harmonization purposes and
joint up thinking for implementation and monitoring, SWGs will combine forces under their respective identified
priority areas and work as IWGs.

          MINECOFIN is represented at all platforms of RESC and also all IWGs; DPU will therefore act as the link
between these two bodies. Figure 1 below shows the proposed structure of the EDPRS institutional monitoring
framework. Cabinet will provide the policy direction. Forum of Secretaries General (SGs) will coordinate the eight
implementation working groups (IWGs).

          The EDPRS Central Monitoring and Evaluation Secretariat will monitor information and analysis carried
out in the IWGs. The M&E Secretariat will be supported by the DPU Focal Points and EDPRS M&E Specialists for
different sectors. The Secretariat will forge close links with NISR, which collects and compiles data at central and
local levels to monitor the EDPRS Results and Policy Matrix. Capacity of NISR will be built through a five year
capacity building programme after undertaking a comprehensive skill audit. MINECOFIN will hold regular co-
ordination meetings and agree a clear division of responsibilities with the NISR.

          The Forum of SGs will take into consideration views from development partners through the Development
Partners' Coordination Group (DPCG), which formally monitors the Common Performance Assessment Framework
(CPAF) which has been prepared as a sub-set of the larger EDPRS Results and Policy Matrix. The DPCG is linked
to the IWGs through development partner membership of the IWGs.

          Local government is represented through Province Steering Committee (PSC) representation in IWGs. The
role of the PSCs is to coordinate District implementation and maintain strong channels of communication between
IWGs and Districts, to ensure that IWG priorities are reflected in the work of local government and that local
implementation bottlenecks are highlighted to be resolved by the IWG.

          At the political level, monitoring and evaluation will be carried out through a single EDPRS review
framework that stresses both domestic accountability and accountability to development partners. Domestically, the
EDPRS progress will be reviewed by the EDPRS Annual and Biannual Progress Reports, the steer for which will be
provided by the Forum of SGs, drawing on the work of the IWGs and other reviews and evaluations.

          The EDPRS Annual Progress Report (APR) will be published in April each year, drawing on the Joint

Sector Reviews, Public Expenditure Reviews and District Imihigo evaluations, completed in February . It will
review progress against the annual performance indicators and actions in the EDPRS Results and Policy Matrix for
the previous 12 months. A detailed and harmonized reporting system will be developed for IWGs, SWGs and
districts by June, 2008 taking policy actions and targets of national policy and result matrix into consideration.

          Building on existing systems, the APR will be submitted firstly to the DPCG for consultation prior to
submission to the Forum of SGs. In addition, a Biannual Progress Report will be produced in September, for GoR
consumption only, reviewing interim progress against the annual policy actions in a given year. The Joint Sector
Reviews will be supported by regular Public Expenditure Reviews, Citizen Report Cards and Community Score
Cards.

          The Annual Progress Report will also make clear recommendations for any revision of targets and policy
actions in the EDPRS Results and Policy Matrix, as deemed appropriate. Discussion and agreement of necessary
revisions for the Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) will be made during the April Joint Budget
Support Review.

2. The process to implement the institutional framework for EDPRS M&E

          The National Results and Policy Matrix will be the main basis for monitoring EDPRS at the macro level. It
will be aligned with all SWG M&E Frameworks which will be further refined and developed following a common
universal format. This in turn will help the sectors and DPU to select key indicators, which will then be incorporated
with district imihigo contracts. Technical inputs will be provided by NISR to monitor the performance at national,
sector and district levels.

          The Joint Action Development Forum is responsible for overseeing the progress made on the district
imihigo contract indicators and conducting Joint District Reviews.         The Joint Sector Reviews (JSR) will be
conducted at the end of February every year. The progress made on JSR and Public Expenditure Review (PER) will
be the main basis for sectors to update their M&E frameworks. IWGs will be responsible for feeding information
from the updated M&E frameworks to CMES who in turn will check and update the National Policy and Results
Matrix.

          Based on the above, the secretariat will be responsible for preparing progress reports which will be
submitted to the DPCG for review. Once reviewed, reports will be sent to the Forum of Secretaries General by the
CMES for approval. Reports will finally be submitted to the Cabinet Secretary by the Secretary General's Forum
for approval and policy guidance.

3. Roles and Responsibilities of the Implementation Working Groups (IWGs)

        Each IWG will comprise a number of sectors (including line Ministries, government agencies and
development partners), and will be supported by a Secretariat. The main role of the IWGs is to ensure cross-sectoral
coordination in implementation and discuss policy issues. This contrasts with the role of the sectors/line Ministries,
which prepare the Joint Sector Reviews, conduct Public Expenditure Reviews, establish M&E systems and develop
their sector-wide approaches (SWAps).

Objectives:

          The Implementation Working Groups' (IWGs') key function is to assist in the monitoring of EDPRS
implementation, with a focus on ensuring cross-sectoral coordination. Each IWG will have an associated Secretariat,
located in the Lead Ministry and reporting to the Secretary General of the Lead Ministry, which will be responsible
for ensuring smooth functioning of the IWG and coordinating the production of key outputs including the biannual
reports on progress with the EDPRS matrix. The Secretariat will be supported technically and financially by the
donors intervening in the IWG under coordination of the Lead Donor.

The Cross-Cutting Issues (CCIs) Working Groups' key objective is to attend the IWG meetings and ensure CCIs are



                                                        81

represented in the IWG discussions and actions.

          Specific tasks and outputs: The specific tasks of the IWGs are to meet quarterly to discuss policy issues,
cross-sectoral coordination and produce the biannual progress reports. The IWG Secretariats will provide technical
support to the fulfillment of these objectives, and brief the IWG on key developments.

          Biannual progress reports: the IWG will produce biannual progress reports on relevant sections of the
EDPRS Results and Policy Matrix. The first report, due in March of each year, should report on progress towards
indicators and policy actions in the previous year. The second report, due in August of each year, should report on
progress towards the fulfillment of policy actions in the current year. These reports will be communicated to
MINECOFIN/DPU for compilation into the EDPRS Annual and Biannual Progress Reports.

          Results and Policy Matrix updates: based on the annual and biannual reviews of progress, the IWG will
discuss and recommend necessary revisions of targets and policy actions. These recommendations will be discussed
and ratified by the Forum of Secretaries General and Cabinet.

          Quarterly meetings of the IWG: the Lead Ministry of the IWG will organize quarterly meetings of the IWG,
to discuss policy issues and cross-sectoral coordination. The lead Ministry should ensure that all government
institutions and development partners listed are invited to the IWG or sub-group meeting. It should contact the
following additional organizations to ensure they are informed in time to send representatives to every IWG
workshop: -The five Province Steering Committees + Rwanda Association of Local Government Authorities
(RALGA) -International NGO and local NGO platform organizations -Rwanda Private Sector Federation -Faith
based organizations -Prime Minister's Office -MINECOFIN (Development Planning Unit)

          It is the responsibility of the lead donor to assist the Lead Ministry with the coordination of the IWG and to
ensure the donor community is fully represented in every IWG meeting. Donors should also provide technical
support to the Secretariat, as well as ensuring sufficient financial resources are available to support the process.
Each IWG Secretariat will, in advance of the IWG meetings, produce and circulate quarterly briefings prior to the
IWG meeting, on key developments relevant to the IWG. The briefing should be no longer than 2 pages. It can
include progress on key projects, issues of multi-agency coordination, harmonization and alignment with
development partners etc. The Secretariat will also produce and circulate minutes of the meetings.

Mechanisms of communication with stakeholders:

          The IWG will normally communicate with stakeholders through the quarterly meetings and quarterly
progress reports. The lead donor should assist the Lead Ministry and Secretariat in maintaining track of key
developments on the donor side.

158.    Government has already accomplished several key reforms to address some of the issues
identified in the SWOT exercise. In September 2006, the Organic Budget Law (OBL) was promulgated and
Government launched the development of an Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS). The IFMIS
(or SmartGov) is an integrated suite of software packages that include two key modules-- BudgetMaster and
PublicBooks. BudgetMaster is an application used to prepare and execute the Government budget, including
commitment control, cash management and central treasury payment system. PublicBooks is currently under
development and is the general ledger module that collects information from BudgetMaster for the purposes of
public accounting. Simultaneously an integrated personnel payment information system (IPPIS) for efficient
payment of salaries, payroll records and control is being developed by MIFOTRA. The IPPIS will interface
with SmartGov for data sharing and processing. This will lead to improved control of the payroll and more
accurate salary payments.

159.    Following the enactment of the OBL in 2006, a number of instruments were put in place for its
implementation, namely: (i) Financial Regulations which became operational in February 2007; and (ii) the
Manual of Financial Management and Accounting which was published in May 2007. Among the actions
taken to operationalize these instruments, include the design and dissemination of new reporting formats for
both central and local governments, and the launch of a series of sensitization and training workshops. These
measures provide the framework for substantially improved financial reporting at all levels of government. It
also continues to raise awareness about the importance of PFM in general, and has consolidated the existing
reforms and provided the legislative framework for the production of the first ever consolidated government
financial statements that were produced in May 2007.

160.    Aside from production of the consolidated accounts, there is an ongoing exercise to produce
monthly, quarterly and annual financial reports for all government entities including local governments.
Work to consolidate the accounts at the local government level is also ongoing through the Accountant
General's Office. In addition to the work on the consolidated accounts, there is a capacity building program
for public accountants and internal auditors. The program aims to create sustainable capacity for public
accounting and internal audit in Government Institutions. The training program has a short term aspect (skills
enhancement) as well as a long-term aspect (for professionalizing these staff). In line with this effort the law
establishing the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Rwanda (ICPAR) was adopted by Parliament on
December 20, 2007.

161.    In terms of budget oversight, BudgetMaster generates the total amount spent by each District
but is unable to disaggregate by category to allow functional and economic analysis. In addition, work
has been initiated in the design of a public accounting system (PublicBooks) that would form part of an
integrated financial management information system (IFMIS). Pilot testing of PublicBooks and with roll out
to budget agencies is expected to begin in the first half of 2009. In the meantime, Sage Pastel (which is being
used while the accounting module is developed) and PublicBooks (the accounting module currently under
development) are likely to be run in parallel in 2009. An oversight User Group has been formed and will be
led by the Accountant General's Office to provide input into the development and piloting process.

162.    To improve coordination of PFM reforms and provide a framework for sustained financing, and
address the issues summarized in the SWOT analysis, Government recently completed a PFM Strategy
and Action Plan. The PFM reform strategy and action plan identifies the priorities for reform, provides a
more structured and sequenced framework in which to carry out specific reform activities, guides the
mobilization of resources (including external funding), and improves coordination as well as sustainability of
the reforms aimed at strengthening the PFM systems. The PFM action plan was revised and posted on the
Government's website in September 2008.         The plan focuses on reforms in a range of PFM areas and
functions--budgeting, accounting and auditing, procurement, reporting and external oversight.           GoR is
currently in the process of costing the plan and establishing a basket fund to finance the plan. Over the next



                                                     86

year, Government will be focused on establishing the secretariate and steering committee that will oversee
implementation of the PFM action plan. The aim is to have in place by the end of 2009 all governance and
implementation mechanisms to support the PFM action plan, along with the financing mechanisms.

163.     Further reforms to strengthen spending efficiency will require establishing a closer link between
the recurrent and development budget through the economic classification of capital expenditures.
Actions have been taken toward this end within the new Chart of Accounts and the 2008 budget will be
prepared with a revised economic classification. In addition, there has been a modification of the budget
format to enable an integrated presentation and allow for the partial integration of programs and sub-programs
in the development budget. However, extra-budgetary expenditures remain an issue in some sectors.

164.     The next steps in the integration of the development and recurrent expenditures will involve
developing a framework for monitoring of extra-budgetary expenditures. The objective is to design a
system of capturing and monitoring of own resources and expenditures outside the budget system. Although
information on extra budgetary resources is being progressively collected, there is now a need to put in place a
system to ensure maximum compliance from agencies. There is also an initiative through the ICT department
to capture and integrate the development budget execution reports simultaneously into Smartgov. Efforts to
train and sensitize users on these issues are on-going.

165.     In the case of fiscal decentralization, reporting on transfers is increasingly critical to address. In
order to facilitate reporting, Government supported adoption of the BudgetMaster software which enabled
Districts to report on spending in 2007. However, the classification system (under the BudgetMaster) does not
allow functional and economic analysis of District expenditure. This will need to be addressed to facilitate
improved reporting by Districts

166.     Continued strengthening of capacity will be needed to implement the next stage of procurement
reforms given progress reforms related to the legal and regulatory framework. Some capacity building
activities have already been undertaken with: (i) the recruitment and staffing of procurement officers in all
procuring entities with 116 now on board as of March 08; (ii) a DG Market training provided to procurement
officers throughout 2008, (iii) a two-week induction training for these staff conducted in the first quarter 2008,
by the Rwanda Institute of Administration and Management (RIAM); (iii) a two-month post graduate diploma
in purchases developed by RIAM and attended mainly by civil servants (but which still lacks proper
procurement trainers), (iii) a MOU signed in April 16, 2008 between the RPPA and the School of Finance and
Banking (SFB), which lay out the bases for a future collaboration, and (iv) the design of a capacity building
work plan, adopted by the Task Force and submitted for discussions and inputs from the Human Resource and
Institutional Development Agency (HIDA). The next step is to consolidate these reforms aimed at building
sustainable capacity and institutions for procurement reforms.

167.     To further consolidate procurement reforms, Government is focused on quickly strengthening
the capacity of procuring entities and their staff. Although there have been several short and limited
training sessions, the overall procurement capacity remains very low. Until recently, there was no strategic
plan for procurement capacity building.       The procurement Task Force has adopted a strategic plan, for
finalizing the Code of ethics for staff handling procurement matters. Discussions are still ongoing on the
publication of procurement audits.

          Annex 9: Overview, Terms and Conditions of the Second Rural Investment Facility (RIF 2)

Overview
From the December 2007 evaluation of the first Rural Investment Facility (RIF 1),8 from the
implementation completion report (ICR) for the Rural Sector Support Project (RSSP), from various
assessments and technical missions carried out during the design process, and from other MINAGRI-
initiated surveys on the common interface between production, processing and agricultural finance, a
number of lessons regarding the design of the Second Rural Investment Facility (RIF 2) come to the fore:

     (i) As banks and MFIs continue to regard medium- to long-term investment lending as risky, their
          interest in investment financing could continue to be positively influenced by a grant component
          for such investments, such as that proposed by the RIF 2;

     (ii) The link between grant support and loans by the financial sector for investments should be
          maintained, although the grant/loan ratio in RIF 2 should be updated to reflect current
          Government priorities for the sector (see Table 12 below);

     (iii)The use of long-term funds should be restricted to investment loans, and there should be no grant
          support for working capital. The financial sector today is capable of funding working capital
          loans - which have a repayment period of less than one year - from their own resources. All
          financial institutions regard working capital loans as less risky than investment loans, and have
          fewer restrictions on funding of these loans.

     (iv) Agricultural marketing activities are very profitable, and do not in any way require or justify
          grant support;

     (v) As access to finance is one of the objectives identified for the project, no investor should receive
          grant support more than once and efforts should be made to include poor households with viable
          investment projects;

     (vi) Only financial institutions with a functional management information system (MIS) capable of
          monitoring portfolio at risk should be eligible for participation under the component. Without
          such MIS, they cannot guarantee that they will at all times be in a position to submit regular
          reports on financial performance.

These lessons learned, and others, were fully incorporated into design and implementation technical
parameters informing the following terms and conditions for the RIF 2.

Terms and Conditions

1. Eligible Categories of Investment under RIF 2

The following categories of investment define eligibility for RIF 2 grants (see also clause 2 below): (1)
Primary agricultural production; (2) Processing of agricultural production; and (3) Agricultural support
services, including seed production. The allocations and ceilings governing these categories of investment
are as follows (also summarized in Table 12 below):

     ·    Under the category of "Primary agricultural production", the lower and upper limits per project
          are RWF 1 million and 50 million respectively. Loans up to RWF 10 million will receive a grant
          of 25 percent of the investment loan, while loans above this will receive 20 percent of the
          investment. At least 45 percent of the Facility will be used for this category.

    ·    Under the category of "Processing of agricultural products", the lower and upper limits per
         project are RWF 2 million and 150 million respectively. Loans up to RWF 50 million will receive
         a grant of 25 percent of the investment loan, while loans above this will receive 20 percent of the
         investment. A maximum of 35 percent of the Facility will be used for this category.
    ·    Under the category of "Agricultural support services, including seed production", the lower and
         upper limits per project are RWF 2 million and 150 million respectively. Loans will receive a
         grant of 15 percent of the investment loan. A maximum of 20 percent of the Facility will be used
         for this category.

Grant support under the RIF 2 can only be provided in cases where a participating financial institution
(PFI) has in principle agreed to provide a term loan exceeding 12 months duration for investments.
Eligible investments include: (i) acquisition of fixed assets including vehicles, equipment, machinery and
land required for production, processing, storage, etc.; (ii) construction of buildings for economic
activities in rural areas; (iii) construction or improvements in other physical infrastructure; and (iv)
capacity building, technical assistance and training costs to enhance technical or marketing of the
potential investor.       Excluded from grant support under the RIF 2 are therefore: (i) projects funded by
an investor from equity or loans outside the banking sector; (ii) recurrent and operational expenses of
projects including audit expenses (i.e. working capital); and (iii) minor fixed assets of a value of less than
the equivalent of USD500 per item.

In the case of production loans for cattle, the ceiling for cattle loans introduced after the Mid-Term
Review of the RIF 1 of USD 7 500 will remain in place. Furthermore, no more than 30 percent of the total
amount for a RIF 2 application can be related to vehicle acquisition.

2. Specific Project Eligibility

As per the above, three types of projects are eligible: (i) primary production in agriculture, horticulture,
livestock (including cattle) and aquaculture; (ii) processing of primary production, be it sourced from
other primary producers or the processor itself; and (iii) input supply and other support services for
agriculture (but excluding marketing). Investment projects submitted for grant funding must meet the
following eligibility criteria:




                                                   90

    ·    Project falls into one of the above three major categories;

    ·    Project is technically feasible;

    ·    Project is financially viable;

    ·    Project has a projected cash flow that will enable repayment within a maximum duration of five
         years, exceptionally six years;

    ·    Project is in accordance with standard environmental norms and does not have any negative
         impact on the environment;

    ·    Managers of project have the required technical and managerial competence;

    ·    Application must include a solid business plan, including: (i) a project description; (ii) an
         assessment of the socio-economic impact; (iii) a projection of the expected purchases from local
         raw material suppliers; (iv) detailed assumptions for the planned sales/income and expenses,
         including a realistic assessment of the marketing prospects; (v) a realistic assessment of the
         sustainability of the project after the end of the loan; (vi) an analysis of the risks that may be
         encountered and the risk mitigation measures proposed by the applicant; (vii) a financing plan,
         including the investment loan, equity and other contributions of the applicant, such as a working
         capital loan; and (viii) a summary schedule of the collateral offered. In the case of amounts below
         RWF 5 million, a simplified business plan would suffice.

3. Eligible applicants

The following are eligible for application: (i) individuals; (ii) farmer associations and primary and
secondary marketing and production cooperatives; and (iii) corporate bodies. Persons not eligible are:
Those persons among Senior Government Officials, MINAGRI, Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning (MINECOFIN) and BNR who are in any way involved in the design, decision-making,
implementation or monitoring of the RIF 2 grants program, and their immediate family members, i.e.
their spouses, parents, children and siblings. An applicant can obtain support only once during the
implementation of RIF 2. Those that received support under RIF 1 can in principle obtain a second grant
under this project. Applicants are entitled to obtain other forms of support in parallel, such as the
guarantees provided by the BNR under its agricultural guarantee fund (AGF) in the BNR. Eligible and
potential applicants may also avail themselves of assistance in grant/loan application preparation under
facilities to be provided by the Government, financed by the retained monies from RIF 1.

4. Grant Disbursement

The approved grant amount will be paid out to the investor through the designated loan account through
which the respective PFI receives loan repayments. Upon signature of the grant agreement by all parties,
the grant will be disbursed to the lending institution on behalf of the principal borrower. PFIs will charge
one rate of interest (no higher than their prime lending rate--see Section 6 below) on the portion of the
loan financed by the PFI's own capital; and a lower rate of interest approved by the BNR for the PFI on
the portion of the loan represented by the grant. The rate of interest permitted on the grant portion will
reflect the PFI's prime lending rate minus the cost of funds; the cost of funds is specified in consultation
with the PFI by the BNR in agreement with the Association. After the disbursement of the total principal
loan to the borrower, the borrower repays loan installments up to the required threshold (which is the
loan principal plus interest minus the grant component), and then the remaining debt will be off-set. In
case the principal borrower does not meet her/his obligations, i.e. a delay of installments payment for
more than six months, the bank would inform the principal borrower that the grant arrangement has been
cancelled, and thereafter, the principal borrower would have to repay the entire loan amount without




                                                    91

grants, including interest on the whole loan amount, notwithstanding any other penalties that the financial
institution would foresee. In this case, as in the case of any loan default, the PFI must return the RIF 2
grant to the BNR for its award to another applicant, as per Section 3.3 of this MoU.

5. Eligibility Criteria for Participating Financial Institutions

Two types of participating financial institutions (PFIs) are envisaged: (i) banks; and (ii) microfinance
institutions (MFIs). Eligibility criteria for commercial banks are: (i) Licensed as banking institution under
the supervision of the BNR; (ii) Regular reporting to BNR in line with the laws and regulations; and
(iii) Significant experience in rural lending. Eligibility criteria for MFIs are: (i) Valid license for operating
as a MFI from the BNR; (ii) Rural outreach (through branches, sub-branches, points of sale, etc.);
(iii) Significant experience in rural lending; (iv) Functioning MIS that allows calculation of financial
performance ratios including portfolio at risk; (v) Regular reporting to BNR in line with laws and
regulations; (vi) External audit report submitted to BNR within six months after the end of the financial
year/within the delays prescribed; and (vii) Percentage of loans with payments in arrears for more than 30
days was on average below 10 percent over the six months prior to the application.

6. Interest rates to be charged by PFIs

PFIs are bound to apply no higher than their respective prime lending rate, i.e. the best rate they can offer
to clients. Rates may be variable or fixed throughout the repayment period. PFIs will not be required to
charge below their prime lending rate on the non-grant portion of the loan. The interest rate on the grant
portion will be governed by a level determined by subtracting the cost of funds from the PFI's prime
lending rate; the cost of funds is specified by the BNR in agreement with the Association.

7. Application and Appraisal Process

Applications for grants will be assessed by the BNR project analysts. Once these are satisfied that the
application is in conformity with the grant rules and regulations, and the proposed repayment schedule for
the corresponding PFI loan is in accordance with conservative cash flow projections, they will consider
the applications for approval or rejection. The decision of the BNR will be communicated to the RIF 2
Review Committee. This committee will comprise of representatives from (i) BNR staff, among which at
least one of the project analysts; (ii) MINAGRI; (iii) the Federation of Private Sector. The senior project
analyst will serve as secretary to the committee. The secretary of the committee will convene a monthly
meeting and provide, by email, prior to the meeting a summary of the RIF 2 grant applications approved
and rejected by the BNR in the preceding month. This is in addition to any reporting and monitoring
responsibilities stipulated in Annex 2 to the Memorandum of Understanding between BNR and
MINAGRI. The purpose of the Review Committee is to provide an overview on the direction of the RIF
2 based on approved grants, to provide a sample-based ex-post review on the applications approved and
rejected; and on a periodic basis, conduct on-the-ground review of RIF 2-financed investments.

The application and appraisal process will contain the following steps: (i) decision by a PFI to make a
term loan for agricultural investments, pending only a positive decision on the grant component;
(ii) submission of application for grant support by a PFI to the BNR via email on a standard application
form, including the PFI's own appraisal, also on standard form; these applications should be submitted to
the BNR on an ongoing basis (iii) screening of the application by the BNR unit in charge of the RIF,
checking compliance with the terms and conditions stipulated in this document, governing RIF 2 and
approving or rejecting the application; (iv) distribution via email of applications approved by the BNR to
the members of the RIF Review Committee; (v) the BNR sends the response via email to the respective
PFI, which in turn informs the applicant; (vi) the BNR sends the grant agreement to the respective PFI for
signature by PFI and grant applicant/investor; and (vii) the PFI returns grant agreement to RIF unit,



                                                    92

together with other required documentary evidence. All steps and activities to be undertaken by the BNR
are of course subject to the standard rules and procedures of the BNR, including authorization of
disbursement.

All PFIs are obliged to report any case of major default, as stipulated above in section VI of this Annex,
of the principal borrower and grant recipient immediately to the BNR. PFIs further commit themselves in
the Participation Agreement to comply with the above terms and conditions, and procedures, including
reporting and monitoring as outlined in Annex 2 of this Memorandum.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Rwanda
Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 09/14
February 6, 2009



  Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote
  transparency of the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and
  policies. With the consent of the country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued
  after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member countries,
  of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring,
  and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program
  engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general
  policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

On January 12, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Rwanda.1


Background

Over the past decade, Rwanda's economic performance has been strong, backed by sound
macroeconomic and structural policies and substantial donor assistance. During this period,
real GDP growth has been robust at 7 percent on average and inflation has been generally
low. Rising revenues and assistance from international donors created fiscal space to scale
up public spending, including on pro-poor initiatives. Rwanda qualified for debt relief under
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) in 2005 and benefited from
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in 2006, which significantly reduced its external
debt. Rwanda's external position has strengthened with the aid flows, allowing an adequate
reserve coverage of imports.

Rwanda is advancing toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It has made
significant progress in achieving the objectives on universal primary education, gender
equality and empowering of women, and reducing child mortality. Nonetheless, poverty
remains pervasive.

The Rwanda's macroeconomic policies have been supported by a three-year Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, which was approved in June 2006. The
program is designed to maintain macroeconomic stability while setting the stage for
stronger growth and poverty reduction.

Policy implementation under the PRGF-supported program in 2008 has been satisfactory.
Growth is expected to reach 8.5 percent, reflecting buoyant activity in the agriculture,
manufacturing, construction, and services sectors. Nevertheless, inflation accelerated to
double digits in the second half of the year, reflecting the impact of international
commodity prices and expansion of domestic demand. The fiscal stance was tighter than
envisaged in the first half of the year, largely reflecting strong revenue performance. The
monetary program also remained broadly in line with the program.

________________________________

1. Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the
discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors,
and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

The authorities made good progress in implementing the structural reforms agenda. In
particular, in the second half of 2008 the authorities finalized a medium-term action plan
for the public financial management reform, the national payments strategy, designed to
improve the payments infrastructure and address the development of basic payment
services in Rwanda, and the debt management strategy, which sets the limits for external
debt accumulation consistent with the medium-term fiscal policy objectives.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors commended the Rwandan authorities for implementing sound
macroeconomic policies and important structural reforms over the past years. These
policies and reforms helped achieve high economic growth, keep inflation relatively stable,
and improve debt sustainability.

Downside risks to the near-term economic outlook have increased because of the global
financial crisis and economic slowdown. Also, poverty remains widespread, and social
indicators lag behind those of many other African countries, despite high economic growth
rates. Over the medium term, Directors emphasized that the main challenge will be to
maintain high and broad-based economic growth and reduce persistent poverty, while
pursuing macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability.

Directors considered the authorities' macroeconomic policy framework and structural
reform agenda to be appropriate for tackling these challenges. They encouraged the
authorities to implement cautious fiscal and monetary policies that would ease inflation and
possible balance of payments pressures without stifling economic growth. Continued
determined implementation of structural reforms will be important to raise investment
rates, expand the private sector, deepen the financial sector, and diversify the production
and export base.

Directors commended the authorities' prudent fiscal stance, which focuses on priority
spending while containing inflationary pressures and keeping debt at a sustainable level.
They observed that while Rwanda's revenue collection has improved, it is still relatively
low. They encouraged the authorities to monitor revenue developments carefully, and to
further enlarge the tax base and strengthen tax administration in order to reduce over time
Rwanda's substantial aid dependence. Directors underscored the importance of improving
public financial management and, in this regard, welcomed the efforts to improve the
institutional framework for formulating and executing the public investment program.

Executive Directors supported a scaling up of public investment in view of Rwanda's
substantial development needs. They encouraged the authorities to rely on grants and
highly-concessional loans for its financing in order to safeguard debt sustainability gains. In
this respect, Directors welcomed the authorities' development of a comprehensive debt
management strategy, which sets limits for loans and loan guarantees. They recommended
that the debt strategy incorporate the fiscal risks associated with contingent liabilities,
particularly those relating to planned public-private partnerships. Directors stressed that
the financing of infrastructure projects should be consistent with a well-prioritized medium-
term expenditure framework.

Directors noted that domestic demand pressures and higher world food and fuel prices led
to an acceleration of inflation in the second half of 2008. Although recent signs of easing
core inflation are encouraging, Directors supported the authorities' tight monetary stance
to contain the second-round effects of the commodity price shocks. They recommended
that steps be taken to raise interest rates to positive levels in real terms. They encouraged
efforts to improve liquidity forecasting and management, particularly through better
coordination of monetary and fiscal policies.

Directors noted the staff assessment that the real exchange rate of the Rwandan franc is
broadly in line with economic fundamentals, although rising inflation led to real




                                             95

appreciation pressures toward the end of 2008. In this context, they welcomed the
authorities' commitment to increase nominal exchange rate flexibility and subordinate the
foreign currency sales to monetary policy objectives. Directors underscored the importance
of structural reforms and of the removal of infrastructure bottlenecks to safeguard
Rwanda's external competitiveness.

Directors commended the measures taken in recent years to strengthen the banking
sector, including the passage of legislation in October 2008 to counter money laundering
and terrorism financing. Noting that credit and operational risks remain high, Directors
welcomed the central bank's intention to improve banking regulation and supervision. They
looked forward to the timely implementation of the financial sector development plan.

Directors welcomed the authorities' commitment to promote private sector-led diversified
growth and employment generation. They supported the reforms to improve the
investment climate, and attached high priority to measures aimed at addressing land use
and other structural problems that hinder agricultural development. They encouraged
further trade integration with the East African Community. Given Rwanda's financing and
capacity constraints, Directors underlined the importance of properly calibrating the scope,
timing, and pace of reforms.
