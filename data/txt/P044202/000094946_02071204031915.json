World Bank\n            performance is assessed as unsatisfactory, despite the sheer\n            difficulty of successfully implementing projects in\n            Tajikistan. Also depsite the genuine commitment that the\n            supervision team made to ensure that the project was\n            implemented according to World Bank guidelines and with\n            maximum community participation, there was a failure to\n            resolve sufficiently quickly the extremely tense\n            relationship between the World Bank and the Government,\n            especially in year 2000. Borrower performance is rated\n            unsatisfactory for two reasons: 1) the persistent problem of\n            inadequate counterpart funding, and 2) the Government's\n            failure to follow an appropriate selection procedure for the\n            new Executive Director of the Social Investment Fund in Year\n            2000, the appointment of an Executive Director without the\n            Bank's approval, and the refusal of the Government for\n            several months to correct the situation through an\n            acceptable selection process. Some of the lessons learned\n            were: High-level and sustained borrower commitment is of\n            utmost importance. Continuing fiscal continuity facing the\n            country inevitably cause difficulties for the Government in\n            making available sufficient counterpart funds for\n            IDA-supported funds in Tajikistan. Political interference\n            has to be avoided especially when appointing key TASIF\n            staff. The TASIF needs strong management and leadership, and\n            training is critically important."}, "docdt": "2002-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
