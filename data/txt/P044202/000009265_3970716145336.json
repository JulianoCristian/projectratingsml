The Project\n            objectives are to: (1) have a modest though quick impact on\n            the incomes of some of the poor; and (2) develop capacity at\n            the national and local level to implement participatory\n            approaches to poverty alleviation.  The Project's two\n            components are: scaling-up of on-going nongovernmental\n            organization poverty alleviation programs; and developing\n            the Tajikistan Social Investment Fund (TASIF). The first\n            component further consists of: (1) assisting returned\n            families in the self-help reconstruction of their homes ;\n            (2) expanding existing services and extending activities of\n            the micro-credit program to other districts; (3)\n            strengthening the capacity of social services to support\n            female-headed households with access to and ownership of\n            agricultural assets, and with grants for day-are centers and\n            schools; (4) expanding the agricultural reform program; and\n            increasing staple food crop production; and (5) continued\n            sponsoring of these activities, if they or similar programs\n            modeled after them are successful.  The development of the\n            Social Investment Fund has two sub-components.  In the\n            first, TASIF will be developed by providing equipment,\n            vehicles, salaries, operating costs, training, technical\n            assistance, and financing for monitoring and evaluation.\n            The second sub-component implements pilot micro-projects in\n            order to train staff and test and modify the targeting,\n            promotion, appraisal, approval, supervision, monitoring and\n            evaluating procedures written in the operational manual."}, "docdt": "1997-04-10T00:00:00Z"}
