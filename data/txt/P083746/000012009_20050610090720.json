the\n            Government's housing sector program, and of the Housing\n            Sector Development Policy Loan Project are to strengthen the\n            institutional, regulatory, and fiscal environment for a\n            well-functioning housing market, and for the emergence of\n            market-based solutions to the country's housing sector\n            constraints and needs, in addition to increasing the access\n            of low-income, and severely disadvantaged households, to\n            more affordable and higher quality housing. The loan would\n            support the first objective through policy reforms and\n            measures to modernize urban planning standards and\n            regulations; restructure and refocus public sector housing\n            agencies, and enterprises; and, rationalize and simplify\n            real estate taxes and subsidies. The second objective would\n            be supported by reforms and measures to expand urban slum\n            upgrading, and social housing programs through\n            market-friendly approaches, will improve the efficiency of\n            the residential rental market, and, will expand the access\n            of informal sector and low-income households, to\n            market-based housing finance. However, identified risks\n            concern coordination among the institutions involved; the\n            pace of implementation of the slum upgrading program, and of\n            the Public Housing Operators (OPH) restructuring, and in\n            addition, the potential delays in the legislative reforms\n            for the urban planning code, residential rental sector and\n            real estate taxation, and subsidies, most importantly, the\n            absence of land titling reform. Despite these factors,\n            macroeconomic risks are found to be not critical to the\n            success of reforms."}, "docdt": "2005-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
