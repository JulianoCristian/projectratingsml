The\n            loan agreement was signed on July 18, 2005 and declared\n            effective on August 24, 2005, when the front end fee of Euro\n            580,500 was applied. The first tranche was disbursed on\n            September 2, 2005. The loan's original closing date of\n            December 31, 2007 was extended by six months to June 30,\n            2008. The development objectives of the loan are to: (i)\n            strengthen the institutional, regulatory and fiscal\n            environment for a well-functioning housing market and for\n            the emergence of market-based solutions to the\n            country's housing sector constraints and needs; and\n            (ii) increase the access of low income and severely\n            disadvantaged households to more affordable and higher\n            quality housing. Three years after the approval of the loan,\n            the housing sector in Morocco has gone through profound\n            transformations and is now considered one of the most\n            dynamic sectors of the national economy. All indicators seem\n            to confirm that the policy implemented by the Government as\n            of early 2003, and which has been supported by the\n            Bank's technical assistance at first, and by the\n            present loan for the past three years, has been successful\n            in addressing some of the fundamental sector issues and in\n            reaching the above development objectives. This tranche\n            release document certifies that (i) the progress achieved by\n            the Borrower in the carrying out of the program of reforms\n            supported by the loan is satisfactory; (ii) the\n            macroeconomic framework of the Borrower is satisfactory, and\n            in line with the program, as measured on the basis of\n            indicators agreed upon between the Borrower and the Bank;\n            and (iii) the actions agreed upon for the disbursement of\n            the second tranche have been taken, with the exception of\n            one action, for which a waiver is sought."}, "docdt": "2008-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
