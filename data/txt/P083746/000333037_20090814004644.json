Housing Sector\n            Development Policy Loan Project (HSDPL) for Morocco were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            highly satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: reforming land\n            titling was identified at the preparation stage as one of\n            the critical bottlenecks constraining the land supply for\n            residential purposes. This is still a major issue that\n            remains to be addressed. However, as land titling is not\n            specific to the housing sector, but rather cuts across all\n            areas of the national economy, it was not possible to\n            include its reform in the HSDPL and a separate operation\n            would be required. This issue will have to be addressed for\n            all aspects of land titling, such as in industrial,\n            agricultural, tourism, and residential housing sectors. It\n            is widely understood that current constraints in land tenure\n            and land titling constitute a hindrance to economic growth\n            across all sectors of the Moroccan economy. The high level\n            of financial resources and institutional support to the\n            social housing programs provided by the Government should be\n            accompanied by appropriate safeguard measures to ensure that\n            the intended benefits reach the targeted social groups and\n            are not captured by others, thus undermining the social\n            impacts of the public housing policies and the credibility\n            of the responsible institutions. The public policies in\n            support of the housing sector, and in particular the social\n            housing programs, are part of the Government's broader\n            approach towards poverty alleviation, which include\n            interventions in health, education, and social protection.\n            Insufficient targeting and leakages in the social housing\n            programs will weaken the pro-poor efforts of the Government\n            and undermine its credibility."}, "docdt": "2008-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
