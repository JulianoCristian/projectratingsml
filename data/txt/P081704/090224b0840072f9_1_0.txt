       F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document) 
The project aims at fostering improvements in the performances of supply chains for a range of agricultural and
livestock products, for which Mali has strong comparative advantage The proposed investment is expected to
reinforce the competitiveness of both traditional (cotton, rice) and non-traditional (fruit, horticulture products, oil
seeds, arabic gum, cashews, etc.) agricultural crops through targeted investment to remove critical constraints,
improve productivity and efficiency and build organizational and institutional capacities, both private and public,

       1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      Mali was (and still is) one of the world’s poorest countries, with its per capita
income of US$300 (in 2004) and a poverty rate estimated at 64 percent. Poverty in Mali
was essentially a rural phenomenon with the incidence of poverty being three times higher in
rural areas than in urban centers. The poorest of the population also remained rural households
engaged in subsistence agriculture.

2.      Growth in the agricultural sector was constrained by low and erratic rainfall, poor
and fragile soils, and generally low productivity because of widespread use of traditional
technologies. At an aggregate level, economic growth was severely handicapped by weak
infrastructure, particularly transport and communications and underdeveloped human capital,
as shown by indicators on health and education levels.

3.      The policy direction and quantitative objectives of the 2002 Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP), which integrated the policy priority action programs of the long-
term Master Plan for Rural Development (MPRD)1 of the Ministry of Rural Development
(MRD), were based on a vision of sustained and poverty-reducing growth. The strategy
laid out four pillars: (a) create a macroeconomic environment for accelerated and re-
distributive growth in a context of macroeconomic stability and openness, driven by the private
sector; (b) promote institutional development, governance, and participation; (c) develop
human resources and access to quality basic services; and (d) build basic infrastructure and
develop productive economic activities.

4.      The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) identified four key constraints and issues
in rural development in Mali: (a) declining and erratic rainfall; (b) low productivity of
agriculture; (c) limited access to markets because of poor basic rural infrastructure; and (d)
insufficiently diversified rural economy and weak private sector in rural areas.

1.1           Context at Appraisal

5.      The PAD argued that poverty in Mali is essentially a rural phenomenon and
therefore fighting poverty means improving incomes and livelihoods and, more generally,
providing economic opportunities to rural dwellers. The World Bank had been strongly
supporting the implementation of the government’s rural development strategy in the
framework of its overall poverty reduction strategy and in line with the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for the period 2004–2006 and the government’s MPRD. One of the key pillars
of this overall strategy was to accelerate broad-based growth by systematically tapping more
into the country’s important agricultural potential and strengthening capacities of the private
sector to seize market opportunities. To achieve this objective, this Agriculture
Competitiveness and Diversification Project (ACDP) was designed to have a strong private
sector focus and market orientation and included investment in communication and marketing
infrastructure for commercial agro-supply chains. Hence, it was argued that this ACDP would
                                                            
1
  The Master Plan, drafted in 1992 and updated in 2001, laid out nine priority action programs: (a) support to
agricultural services and producer organizations; (b) development of rural infrastructure and farming equipment;
(c) promotion and improvement of the competitiveness of agricultural supply chains; (d) stimulation of exports
of agricultural, forestry, livestock, and fishery products; (e) intensification and diversification of agricultural
production; (f) reinforcement of food security; (g) promotion of financing of the rural sector and rural credit; (h)
management of natural resources to sustain rural development; and (i) contribution to finalizing and
implementing local development plans.



                                                               1
complement other IDA-funded Agricultural Service and Producer Organization Project
(PASAOP), community-based rural development, and decentralization and large-scale
infrastructure (National Rural Infrastructure Project [PNIR]) projects.

6.      One of the key objectives of the then prevailing Bank’s strategy was to accelerate
broad-based growth by tapping more systematically into the country’s important agricultural
potential and strengthening capacities of the private sector to seize market opportunities. As
specifically identified in the 2004–2006 CAS, the proposed ACDP was an attempt to respond
to the pressing needs for income generation, diversification of products, and improving food
security.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

7.      The PAD, on the other hand, stated the objective as follows: “The project aims at
fostering improvements in the performances of supply chains for a range of agricultural,
livestock, fishery, and gathering products, for which Mali has a strong comparative advantage.”
The PAD correctly reflected the PDO that came out of the QER meeting (with a minutes date
of November 9, 2004) which advised the project preparation team to focus on the improvement
of supply chains performance – including increases in physical outputs as its target. According
to the original Credit Agreement (Loan No. IDA-40940), the objective of the project is “to
increase and diversify rural incomes through improvements in the performances of supply
chains for agricultural, livestock, fishery and harvesting products for which the borrower has a
comparative advantage.” Thus, the PDO that the QER meeting advised to be changed
mistakenly found its way back to the legal agreement.

8.      During the Additional Financing (AF), the Financing Agreement (dated May 27, 2013)
reflected almost entirely the PDO as stated in the PAD but without including “fishery and
gathering” and replacing supply chain with value chain. The AF PP specifically stated that:
“The PDO under the AF extension phase remains unchanged”. The AF Financing Agreement
PDO statement was “to foster improvements in the performances of value chains for a range
of agricultural and livestock products, for which the Recipient has a strong comparative
advantage.” Thus, there was no legal basis to claim the PDO has changed. However, what is
clear is that there was lack of consistency across project documents. The project team could
have done a better job in ensuring the consistency of the PDO across project
documents. During implementation, the PDO that was tracked was this same PDO that was
confirmed during the AF. During this ICR, the inconsistencies across project documents
provided the impression that the PDO was changed. It required further detailed review and the
confirmation of the AF PP and the Financing Agreement to conclude that it was error of
reporting than actual change.

9.      This is the PDO that finally found its way across the different documents and since it
was part of the Legal Agreement, this Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR)
will use this PDO in reviewing project achievements.

10.     The PAD stated that progress toward the objectives will be monitored by key
results indicators covering project performance at all levels and identified six that it referred
to as key result indicators. On the other hand, the Results Framework of the PAD summarized
the PDO as “to increase rural incomes and diversify economic opportunities in rural areas” and
had only two compound outcome indicators: (a) broader range and increased volume of
agricultural products marketed in Mali and (b) increased market shares for Malian products on
regional and international markets.


                                               2
11.    The project chose four of the eight regions of Mali (Koulikoro, Sikasso, Segou, and
Mopti) and Bamako District (in its rural areas) for project intervention. The choice of these
regions was justified by the fact that these are areas of high agricultural production potential,
possess relatively well-developed support infrastructure, and were also home to some
manufacturing entities.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

12.     The PDO was not revised.

13.    As part of the 2013 AF restructuring, the key performance Indicators were
revised. The new set of key performance indicators focused on the number of beneficiaries and
value and volume of production for three selected value chain produces (see table 1).

Note: V/C = Value Chain.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

14.     Project beneficiaries were not explicitly stated in the original PAD. The AF Project
Paper (PP) was able to identify that the PAD failed to include beneficiaries as a core indicator
and also reported that up to that point the number of project beneficiaries had reached 7,000
and that the AF will raise the target figure to 9,000. However, the AF PP also failed to explicitly
define who the beneficiaries of the project are although it mentions, among others, small and
micro enterprises as beneficiaries. The economic analyses included in the PAD did not
specifically mention beneficiaries.

15.     The government completion draft report helped identify the following as direct
project beneficiaries (including women): producers (of mangoes, onions/shallots, potatoes,
and papaya; livestock; and fish); processors (of mangoes, onions/shallots, milk, meat, and fish);
traders/service providers; collectors (of mangoes); exporters; and artisans.

1.5     Original Components (as approved)

16.     The project was structured along five components.

Component 1: Demonstration and dissemination of irrigation, post-harvest, and value-
adding technologies (US$10.35 million)

17.     This component’s aim was to provide support to the demonstration and dissemination


                                                     3
by private sector providers of low-cost, simple, and adapted techniques and technologies to
improve the production, productivity, processing, and marketing of selected high-value
agricultural products. The component included three subcomponents: (a) demonstration and
promotion of technological innovations, particularly through the establishment of on-farm pilot
plots and demonstration centers at the regional level; (b) development of private sector
capacities to provide equipment, inputs, and advisory services; and (c) dissemination of
techniques and technologies and support to investment subprojects, particularly through a
matching grant mechanism.

Component 2: Improvement of performances of agricultural supply chains (US$7.07
million)

18.      The component’s aim was to improve the organization and performances of agricultural
supply chains, reinforcing private sector capacities to respond to market opportunities and
improving the competitiveness of agricultural products, both traditional and new high-value
products, for which Mali has comparative advantage. The component was designed to support
(a) market research and improvement of the information base on supply chains; (b)
improvement in supply chain organization and inter-professional dialogue, through
institutional capacity building and training; (c) promotion of private investment and
improvement in the provision of private services; and (d) quality and food safety management.

Component 3: Access to financing (US$2.93 million)

19.      This component’s aim was to facilitate access to capital and financial services for the
various private actors and operators involved in the agricultural supply chains and
strengthening the current agriculture credit market in Mali. The component was composed of
three subcomponents: (a) technical assistance for operators and financial institutions and
reinforcement of their capacities to appraise and supervise subprojects and operations in the
sector; (b) technical assistance for the operation of a partial guarantee fund to help financial
institutions engage more actively in the sector by providing partial guarantee coverage for
loans; and (c) support to the creation and development of a range of financing instruments
adapted to serve small farmers, artisans, service providers, rural entrepreneurs, agro-
enterprises, and agribusinesses.

Component 4: Market-oriented infrastructure (US$21.49 million)

20.     This component was designed to provide resources to carry out an investment program
aimed at improving basic commercial and communication infrastructure, to improve linkages
to markets and reduce transaction costs. The component included two subcomponents: (a)
construction of commercial infrastructure such as export facilities, cold chain equipment,
storage facilities, pack houses, wholesale markets, and so on and (b) rehabilitation of rural
roads, particularly in cotton-growing areas, and access roads for post-harvest processing and
commercial infrastructure built with the assistance of the project.

Component 5: Project management and Monitoring and Evaluation (US$5.61 million)

21.    This component aimed at providing the resources necessary to ensure adequate project
management, particularly overall coordination, financial management (FM), and procurement
of goods and services, as well as monitoring of implementation and evaluation of results.

1.6    Revised Components


                                               4
22.     No new component was introduced. However, for the component activities supported
under the project there were some revisions made to Components 1 and 4. Under Component
1, the importance of a matching grant facility to finance more subprojects were enhanced by
reallocating more resources to the component. Under Component 4, rural road rehabilitation
was dropped and later upgrading market facilities was undertaken. So the share of Component
1 from the overall credit (including the AF) was raised from 21 percent of the original allocation
to 40 percent by the end of project. On the other hand, allocation for Component 4 was reduced
from 42 percent to 25 percent.

1.7    Other Significant Changes

23.    The project had a total of five restructurings.

24.     The first restructuring done in 2011 had three changes: (a) modified the project’s
intermediate result indicators; (b) reallocated the credit proceeds; and (c) extended the closing
date by six months to December 31, 2012. The PP explained that the change in intermediate
indicators was necessitated due to larger subprojects funded by the project than originally
envisaged while the rationale for the extension was to compensate the project for the observed
procurement delays.

25.     The second restructuring done in 2012 made two changes: (a) a six-month extension
of the project closing date from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013 and (b) a reallocation that
was characterized by the PP as ‘limited/slight’. The restructuring also requested for a
resumption of ACDP implementation activities, as allowed after the September 12, 2012
decision of the Bank management on lifting the suspension and a gradual reengagement. Annex
5 of the second restructuring PP (Results Framework and Monitoring) stated the PDO as, “The
project aims at fostering improvements in the performances of supply chains for a range of
agricultural, livestock, fishery, and gathering products, for which Mali has a strong
comparative advantage.” This was an improvement over the way the PDO was stated under the
Results Framework and Monitoring section of the PAD.

26.      The third restructuring dated March 2013 provided AF of US$20 million
equivalent and extended the project closing date by two years to June 30, 2015. In addition,
the PP for the AF made some changes to the indicators. The rationale for the AF, according to
the restructuring paper, was to help finance the costs associated with the scaling up of ACDP
activities, with a view to securing a higher-level achievement of the PDO over an additional
two-year project implementation period.

27.     The fourth restructuring dated November 27, 2013 made a minor restructuring
that extended the project second dated covenant provided in Section I.A.3 of Schedule 2
of the Financing Agreement from one month to three months after the effectiveness of the
project. The convenient was about the contracting a field-based team for which the contracting
was delayed. due to the suspension by the World Bank of the then selected operator
SOFRECO.

28.    The fifth restructuring in May 2015 made a reallocation of resources among
categories that resulted in allocating unused funds to Category 3 (matching grant) from
Category 1 (consultants, goods, services) which were earmarked to finance subprojects.

29.     In summary, based on implementation progress and assessment of the prevailing
situation, the focus of the project was adjusted. Among these, two changes were made: (a)


                                                5
the emphasis on cotton promotion was dropped due to delays in sector reforms after which the
project focused on rehabilitation of rural roads in the cotton producing zone (1,101 km
rehabilitated by the project) and (b) the project focus was reduced from 18 value chains to six
priority value chains (mango, potato, onion/shallots, papaya, fattening of livestock, and milk)
in 2009 following the recommendation made at the Midterm Review (MTR).

       2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

30.      Military coup (and the armed rebellion) and its aftermath. Following the military
coup of March 22, 2012, the Bank suspended development assistance and as a result the
activities of this project were stalled for six months. Project supervision in the northern part of
the country became impossible due to the armed rebellion in the area. Project supervision was
de facto suspended in the Mopti area, the so-called ‘red zone’. However, the task team leader
stationed in the Bamako office conducted close follow-up and monitoring by organizing
teleconference from the Bank’s Bamako office with the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) and
the regional coordinators of the project.

31.     The 2010–2011 post-electoral political crisis in Cote d’Ivoire resulted in the
shutdown of the port of Abidjan, which is the key outlet for export/import of goods accounting
for 70 percent of Mali’s trade. The project and its beneficiaries had to scramble and establish
new access ports in Togo, Ghana, and Senegal. These alternative routes were more expensive;
for example, the Ghanaian corridor was 73 percent2 more expensive than the Cote d’Ivoire
access port.

32.    The impact of the 2012 political crisis affected the project implementation pace,
as the absence of an elected government delayed the effectiveness of the AF. The project
was declared effective in October 2013, nearly seven months after the Board’s approval and
made its first disbursement in February 2014—almost a year after the Board’s approval.

2.1           Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

33.     The project clearly reflected the priorities identified in the CAS (2004–2006). The
CAS emphasized the importance of supporting competitive, broad-based growth in the rural
sector by supporting increase in agricultural productivity and production in a sustainable
manner, exploiting further the potential for irrigated agriculture, diversifying agricultural and
livestock production, and by implementing natural resource management programs. The
project was a good fit with the activities that the CAS emphasized.

34.    Project design reflected key sectoral strategies and programs of the government.
Operationally, it was the formalization of the elements of the government’s MPRD into
program activities (see PAD, p. 2 for detail). The government was committed to the project
and had established clear sectoral strategy, policy, and priorities related to agriculture and rural
development. The initial amount earmarked for the project was US$35 million credit but was
raised to US$46.4 million as Mali was rated a good performer under the IDA Country
Performance Ratings (PAD, p. 4). Thus, during project preparation, Mali was able to
demonstrate its readiness for the project.

35.    The preparation relied on pertinent studies and pilot tests, with the participation
of Malian public and private sectors. The studies included (a) an analysis of the institutional

design options; (b) a study on the mechanisms of, and access to credit; (c) environmental and
social studies; (d) economic and financial analysis of the program; (e) a study of the need for
market infrastructure and their management schemes; and (f) a study on agriculture sector
financing. In addition, the project design made use of valuable lessons and experiences from
similar operations in Mali and elsewhere.

36.     The project design identified critical risks and mitigation measures. These risks, to
a large extent, were mitigated. Delays in procurement were an issue since recruitment and,
sometimes, renewal of contracts were taking longer than was originally envisaged.

37.      However, project design has shown some elements of over-ambitiousness and an
overreach that included targeting 18 value chains. These value chains was selected based
on a study 3 conducted by an international firm and after consultation with stakeholders.
During implementation, it was found that supporting such a number of supply chains would
thinly disperse project activities that would have resulted in diluting the project outcome. With
respect to quality of the project document, there were some glaring inconsistencies. The major
one was the two versions of the PDO statement that were found across project documents and
in the financing agreement.

38.   The project was reviewed for quality of design and supervision by the then Quality
Assurance Group (QAG). The results of the QAG are discussed under the Assessment of
Bank Performance section.

2.2           Implementation

39.     Overall, the ACDP’s implementation faced four key hurdles: (a) deteriorating
political conditions, including rendering some regions inaccessible; (b) suspension of
disbursement; (c) instability in Côte d’Ivoire that is the main artery for the import and export
for Mali; and (d) delay in processes, mainly procurement related, and effectiveness delays.
These implementation impediments did have a lingering effect after they occurred.

40.     The project was approved by the Board on July 5, 2005 and became effective on
April 4, 2006 (a full 9-month delay). However, once the initial hurdles were overcome, the
project moved “off to a good start…” as noted in the Independent Evaluation Group’s CAS
Completion Report (CASCR) review dated January 17, 2008. The project also suffered from
the Bank’s suspension of funds in response to the 2012 coup and the threats from armed rebels
on the project’s personnel and assets in the north. According to the Interim Strategy Note (ISN)
for 2012–2013 (p. 8) “Agricultural output in the North has been impacted by the disruption of
farming activities, marketing channels, inputs, and financing.”

41.    Project steering guidance and oversight were provided at the national and
regional levels by a National Steering and Guidance Committee (CNPO) chaired by the
minister of Agriculture (the Ministry of Agriculture was later changed to MRD) at the national
level and the Regional Steering and Orientation Committees (CRPOs) chaired by regional
governors. The CNPO and the CRPOs were constituted by representatives of other ministries
(or their decentralized technical services) of Agriculture, Livestock, Environment and

Sanitation, and Transportation as well as of financing institutions, chambers, and actors of
targeted sectors. The CNPO and CRPOs met once a year and approved work plans and annual
budget submitted to them by the PMU and the regional coordination units, respectively. They
also analyzed and approved the financial reports. The PMU implemented the project directly
at the national level and through private operators at the regional level.

42.    During implementation the project also implemented a PHRD TF (TF-90855).
This PHRD TF for smallholders’ tree plantation project was made available for plantation of
Acacia Senegal on a 10,000 ha. The project had its separate GRM and the achievement was
reported separately with a total disbursement of US$428,722 (out of the total grant amount of
US$474,900). The Grant closed unsatisfactorily after planning 1,716 ha with Acacia Senegal.
Clearly, this grant has no relationship with the PDO but the MORD wanted to use the exiting
PCU of ACDP to manage the resource and thus it was attached to this project.

43.    The MTR 4 provided guidance and set the stage, among others, for the
restructuring that ensued. It made a recommendation for the project to focus on a limited
number of priority value chains and a shift from on-station to on-farm demonstrations.

44.      Acting on key lessons learned, the project maintained its innovative institutional
arrangement feature, which was to contract private service providers to implement project
activities for the benefit of its targeted private sector actors. The project also maintained the
second pillar of its private-led approach, which was to build the capacity of professional
organizations to take over the management of the market infrastructure and provide basic
services to beneficiaries to sustain and amplify the project’s momentum after the ACDP closed.

45.     Overall, the project faced some adverse conditions during its implementation.
However, the adjustment in project implementation was effectively used to ensure that the
project remained focused on its outcomes.

2.3           Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

M&E Design

46.     The M&E design recognized the weaknesses and the legacies of past projects’
failure in establishing a sound M&E. Therefore, the design determined that establishing an
effective M&E system was “critical to ensure a close and reactive monitoring of supply-chain
performances and project’s impacts.” The design also foresaw that the M&E system “will be
closely supervised regarding staffing, design, and data analysis and dissemination.” (PAD, p.
7).

47.    The design correctly identified the need to have a decentralized structure to report
progress and therefore, the PAD provided for contracting M&E specialists at the national
level and for each region by the regional operators. In addition, the M&E system design
ensured that it was a collaboration with other agencies such as the Rural Economy Institute of
Bamako that was in charge of carrying out the baseline study. Overall, the design of the M&E
system was appropriate to the project needs.

                                                               8
M&E Implementation

48.     The M&E system became fully functional by 2008–2009 after long delays. The
baseline data was not established at the start of the project (November 2006) but much later in
2008–2009. The QAG reported that “despite the attention given during the design phase, M&E
started slowly and [was] not performing satisfactorily, particularly as regards evaluation, four
years after effectiveness.” However, the QAG assessment noted that the monitoring aspect was
performing well and that the major weakness was with the evaluation aspect.

49.     As planned, implementation of the M&E relied on a specialist at the national level
to establish a database to manage, analyze, and disseminate data originating from
contracted operators and specialists at the regional level. Once it became operational, it
delivered strong results, including the following: (a) dynamic database of characteristics and
technico-economic results of supported subprojects; (b) technical implementation, M&E, and
annual reports; (c) three impact analysis reports; (d) environmental monitoring reports; and (e)
reports to support over 30 field supervision missions in the region.

M&E Utilization
50.     The M&E system was instrumental in project monitoring and was the basis for all
reports prepared by the PCU. Also, the M&E system provided critical data and input in
communication of project results. The M&E system reports were made available to the public
through a website (by November 26, 2015, the website registered a total of 152,251 visitors).
The M&E database provided considerable information to the general public, summarized in
tables to avoid overwhelming the general user with technical details.

51.     The Bank implementation support missions relied on progress reports prepared based
on the M&E system. The choice made to focus on selected value chains was informed by the
monitoring of the progress and the MTR evaluation. Overall the M&E evaluation was used at
different levels and for making the necessary correction in project execution.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance

52.     The project was classified as Category B and triggered three safeguards: (a) OP
4.01 - Environmental Assessment, (b) OP 4.09 - Pest Management, and (c) OP 4.12 -
Involuntary Resettlement. All safeguard instruments were prepared, consulted upon, and
disclosed before AF appraisal. At the end of the ACDP, the Environmental and Social
Management Plan prepared for the original project provided guidance on management and
mitigation measures for environmental and social impacts of the subprojects, such as road
rehabilitation and construction of processing facilities. The project did not require the
preparation of any Resettlement Action Plans as no land was acquired nor was there any loss
of economic assets/properties to trigger involuntary resettlement and/or restrictions of access
to resources and livelihoods. The environmental and social mitigation measures summarized
in the Environmental and Social Management Framework, Project Management Plan, and the
Resettlement Policy Framework, as well as the approved specific mitigation measures, were
executed, monitored, and periodically reported.




                                               9
Financial Management Compliance

53.     At early project implementation stage, the review of both FM and audits identified
shortcomings, mostly in the areas of internal controls, mastering of the accounting
software, and delay in the auditor recruitment. However, all related weaknesses were duly
and promptly addressed by the project team contributing continuously to strengthen the internal
control environment. The audit opinion and FM performance moved respectively from
qualified and moderately satisfactory to unqualified and satisfactory ratings. The strong
involvement and commitment of the project team to ensure good FM quality has contributed
to maintaining a sound internal control environment with a moderate FM risk rating during
much of the project life, until its closing.

Procurement Compliance

54.     There were a number of procurement delays in project implementation and this
has also been true during the final days of project implementation. At times there was
insufficient proactivity, unrealistic planning on the part of the actors, and insufficient
monitoring and control of the work by the Delegated Contract Managers. However, during the
final supervision mission there was no request pending.

55.     With respect to the integrity of the procurement system established under the
project, the system served the project very well. The final mission noted that efforts have
been made to improve the filing and archiving of procurement records. A dedicated room was
built and storage and conservation equipment was acquired. This room also contains the FM
records.

56.     Disbursement. Disbursement was not formally revised. Following the political
instability in the country, disbursement was suspended for six months, which resulted in 46
percent reduction in disbursement in FY12 compared to FY11. However, disbursement picked
up quickly and by FY13, it increased by 183 percent from the reduced level of FY12.

57.     Overall, the project disbursed all of its IDA credit. Out of the total US$66.4 million
equivalent made available to Mali under this project, 99.9 percent of the credit was disbursed.
This level of disbursement, while being fully satisfactory on its own, also compares positively
with the level of execution by other donors (56 percent in 2010 and 69 percent in 2011).

2.5           Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

58.    The government is fully committed to developing the agricultural sector. A
Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) 5 of 2015 (p. 13) reported that the “government has
placed the agricultural sector at the top of its development priorities for several decades.” In
2014, budget allocations to the sector increased from 11 percent to 15 percent of the total
budget. The approval of a National Strategy for Agribusiness Development demonstrates the
government’s unwavering commitment to this agenda.

59.    Encouraged by the achievement made under the ACDP and taking the lessons
learned, the government of Mali (GOM) is preparing a new operation. For this proposed
new project (Mali Support to Agroindustrial Competitiveness Project - P151449), also known

                                                               10
as the Agripole project, the draft PCN under discussion stated that, “Some value chains (fruits,
vegetables, etc.) have already demonstrated their competitiveness in domestic and international
markets, and their consolidation, expansion and move towards higher value added products
constitute the main challenges.” Thus, this proposed Agripole project will take off from where
the ACDP left off.

60.     Some products have already established a reliable market and in some cases it has
become a question of fulfilling the demand originating from abroad. The value chains
supported through the ACDP are linked to market and are on an expansionary trajectory. A
dynamic entrepreneurship standard is taking shape that will ensure further gains beyond the
current level of achievements.

61.     Overall, the continuation of the activities started remains on a very solid ground
given the government’s commitment to the policy of expanding agribusiness; the growing
interest by the private sector to invest; and donors willingness to support value chain
development.

       3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1           Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

62.           The relevance of the PDO is High.

63.     The PDO reflected the priorities of the government and responded to the
circumstances prevailing during project preparation and is also relevant to the current
situation in Mali’s agriculture sector, specifically in the agribusiness subsector. Project design
derived from the government’s policies and strategies as defined in the different documents,
including national policy and strategy documents: (a) the sector policy letter of 2001, which
provides the institutional vision of agricultural and rural sector by 2010; (b) the Master Plan
for the Rural Development Sector (SDDR) (1992) updated in 2002 for the period 2002–2010;
and (c) the Poverty Control Strategic Framework for 2002–2006. Agriculture and value chain
strengthening and expansion still remain a priority of the government as reflected in the
Government Action Plan (Plan d’Action Gouvernemental) developed in 2013 for the period
2013–2018 that reiterated the new government’s commitment; the adoption of the Agriculture
Master Law (Loi d’Orientation Agricole); and the approval of a National Strategy for
Agribusiness Development.

64.     The project’s objectives are perfectly aligned with the GOM’s current global
priorities 6 , including the GOM’s two pillars for rural development: (a) transformation of
family subsistence agriculture to market-oriented, family commercial agriculture and (b)
creation of synergies (agriculture, energy, irrigation, transport, commerce, and so on) to
promote private agricultural enterprises in agripoles.

65.     Once relative stability ensued, the mode of operation focused on post-crisis
recovery under which agriculture still featured prominently in helping the recovery. The
ISN for 2014–2015 reported that increasing the performance of the agriculture sector will be
one of the “urgent priorities to ensure the resumption of economic activity.” To this end, in the
“immediate aftermath of the conflict, the Bank quickly prepared four operations, including
                                                            
6
  According to the Impact Study, the GOM relied on the ACDP’s experience to develop its Country
Development Policy (CDP) in 2013 and National Agriculture Sector Investment Program (PNSIA) in 2015
(PACD - Rapport d’achèvement, 2015, Meimo).


                                                               11
additional financing in agriculture (IDA, US$20 million)” for the ACDP, as part of the Bank’s
response. This demonstrated that the objective remained robust under changing circumstances.

66.     The 2015 SCD7 provided a powerful justification on the importance of agriculture
and the relevance of expanding and strengthening supply chains in agriculture. The
rationale for continuing working on improving competitiveness of agricultural products was
due to the realization that “Typical labor opportunities open to the poorest are associated with
agriculture.” (SCD 2015, 33). Thus, the SCD recommended that in Mali “the development of
selected value chains are the most pressing issues.” (SCD 2015, 92).

67.      The objective of the project is also in line with the dominant current thinking on
agricultural development through the development of supply chains. A study done in
2013 8 concluded that “Agribusiness can play a critical role in jumpstarting economic
transformation through the development of agro-based industries that bring much-needed jobs
and incomes. Successful agribusiness investments in turn stimulate agricultural growth through
the provision of new markets and the development of a vibrant input supply sector.” Thus,
assessed from the prevailing sectoral and thematic angle, the objective is on firm ground and
still relevant.

Relevance in Design and Implementation

68.           The relevance of design and implementation is rated as Substantial.

69.     The project grew out of pilot activities and relied on informative lessons learned
from these interventions and on the Bank’s worldwide experience. In Mali, before the
ACDP, the Bank supported the promotion of small-scale irrigation, as well as trading and
processing of agricultural products. Critical operational guidance were developed out of these
pilot projects, which led to the design of effective approaches and programs to enhance the
development of a diversified and commercially oriented agriculture and agribusiness sector.

70.     By design the project was selective. The project design selected a limited number of
regions with high potential. Based on previous Bank experience, the design was based on the
belief that small-scale projects targeted at one or a limited number of supply chains are not
necessarily cost-efficient and have limited results and impact. This assumption, however, may
have been stretched to push the design to be ambitious in the selection of 18 value chains to be
supported under the project.

71.     The design relied on diagnosis of a given supply chain on a holistic basis, which
looks at the supply chain as a whole, from farming and production to marketing, to
identify specific constraints and bottlenecks. The project then opted for removing the
specific constraints and bottlenecks in the supply chain than a blanket support for the
development of a supply chain.

72.     The project approach is also validated by current studies and strategies. The fact
that the ISN and, most importantly, the 2015 SCD recommended further expansion of the
supply chain approach developed by the ACDP project and the fact that the government
requested for a follow-on project to scale up and include other supply chains clearly reflects
the relevance of the design.

73.     Implementation was further enhanced through the AF and reallocation of
resources to the most-effective components of the project. Reducing the focus of the project
to only 6 value chains (from 18) was instrumental for achieving the desired results. Extension
of the closing date also compensated the project for the time lost following the crisis in the
country.

74.     However, design showed some weaknesses. The design was ambitious on the number
of supply chains it identified for support under the project. As part of that, the number of
subprojects to be implemented and financed were also optimistic. However, during
implementation it was quickly learned that continuing with the number of supply chains
originally selected for the project support would have distributed the project thinly and diluted
project impact. The downward revision of the number of supply chains did make the design
more realistic.

Overall Relevance

75.   With a relevance of objectives rated as high and a relevance of design and
implementation rated as substantial, the overall relevance is rated Substantial.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Substantial

76.     The project has achieved its development objectives, as measured by the key
performance indicators and related impacts. The project was designed to directly benefit
9,000 people (a target revised upward by 29 percent from the original target of 7,000). By the
end of the project, it directly benefited 16,300 people, which is 233 percent of the revised target.

77.    Clearly, the project markedly improved the performances of supply chains
selected for support under the project. Both the targets set for volume and value were
exceeded, indicating the much improved performance of these selected supply chains. Table 2
demonstrates the improvement in the performance of the six value chain products.

78.     Performance improvement is also evident from improvement made in
productivity. The project had a major achievement in improving productivity of the value
chain products it supported. Table 3 shows results from representative beneficiary farms. The
gains in productivity in most cases are double the original amount. While the project has not
done a quality analysis of the products, it is clear that quality has also improved as a result of


                                                  13
product specification of the market that farmers have to adapt and follow. For instance, the
impact study indicated that both the quality and weight of livestock was higher post-ACDP
compared to the period before the project.

79.    This gain in productivity was successfully transferred to gains in income. The
impact study, for example, reported that the income of potato farmers increased from CFAF
157,900 to CFAF 1,262,100 (a net increase of 700 percent); of shallot/onion producers’ income
from CFAF 475,300 to CFAF 884,400 (an increase of 80 percent); and that of papaya farmers
from CFAF 460,500 to CFAF 507,000 (a modest but respectable increase of 10 percent).

80.      The project also contributed in reducing unemployment. The survey conducted as
part of the impact study, reported that out of a total of 5,248 jobs created or consolidated, 4,710
(89.7 percent) were the result of ACDP support.

81.     The project also enhanced the volume of products marketed. The project impact
study reported that the amount of mango marketed in regional and local markets registered a
net increase of 668 percent in 2014 compared to its level in 2006. The project also resulted in
improving access to foreign markets for the supply chains supported under the project. Export
of mango, for example, showed a net increase of 990 percent in 2014 compared to its level in
2006.

82.     The project significantly contributed to enhancing value added by beneficiaries.
The project was one of the new generation of projects that strived to enhance value added to
agricultural products as they transfer and move through the supply chains. The value added by


                                                      14
the ACDP beneficiaries reached CFAF 10.2 billion in 2014 from its level of CFAF 0.5 billion
in 2005.

83.     In addition to reducing post-harvest loss and allowing farmers to sell at higher
prices (CFAF 125 per kg during harvest season compared to an average of CFAF 775 per
kg after the harvest period), storage facilities allowed reserving of seeds for the planting
season. According to the SCD, in Sikasso, the coefficient of variation of producer prices is
high. Thus farmers were losing twice, when they sell during the harvest season at a time when
the price is low and when they buy seeds when the price is high. A village dealer in Tabakoto
reported that his turnover increased by close to nine fold (from an average of CFAF 1,200,000
before the project to CFAF 10,350,000 after—a 762.5 percent net increase). The project
supported storage and conservation facilities that resulted in an increase in the quantity of
shallot stocked, a decrease in the rate of shallot losses, and improvement in option in choosing
the timing for marketing and improvement in the quality of the marketed product, which jointly
resulted in improving the income of beneficiary farmers.

84.     The agricultural sector is clearly showing a new dynamism as demonstrated by
the increasing emergence of agricultural enterprises related to food processing, upstream
activities, and downstream industries. The project has ushered in a new culture that sees
agriculture as a business. The project has been transformational, by helping Mali diversify
further into fruits and vegetables and agro-processing; assisting Malian entrepreneurs to also
diversify their businesses by seizing new opportunities in food production, processing, and
export to regional and international markets; and introducing a new spirit of entrepreneurship
and innovativeness in Mali. Most importantly, in addition to the direct impact the project had
in improving the performance of selected supply chains and the agribusiness enterprises, it has
also indirectly affected the agribusiness sector through the demonstration effect and policy
improvement for the observed new dynamism created in the country. The project outreach and
communication campaign contributed to create interest and willingness by public servants to
start an agribusiness and develop it into a successful enterprise. Testimonies from new
agribusiness entrepreneurs indicate that they have been galvanized directly or have taken the
cue from the project in launching their businesses.

85.     Furthermore, the beneficiaries of the ACDP, in all categories, have improved their
human and social capital through training, study tours and exchanges, fairs, visits of the
Centers of Demonstration, Dissemination, and Delivery (CDDP), and so on. The project also
enabled the beneficiaries to secure access to factors of production such as materials and
equipment for irrigation and processing of products as well as the commercial infrastructure
and conservation/storage facilities. Professional organizations and regional bodies have been
structured and/or strengthened.

86.    The ISN (2013) recognized that in agricultural competitiveness, there was success
in the development of new crops such as mangoes and reported that farmers were
adopting the new technologies. Private operators and producers of fruit and vegetables have
been organized, which contributed to increased efficiency. Professional entities are established
for a number of products, including cotton and mangoes. The ISN also acknowledged that
supply chains and diversification were being supported by the ACDP, which was under
implementation during the preparation of the ISN.

87.     Additional impact of the project was its promotion of private investment. The
project managed to implement four private investment projects in joint venture as originally
targeted. The four are (a) a commercial mango plantation of 200 ha (50 ha were already


                                              15
developed); (b) a cardboard factory that produces packaging for agricultural products; (c) a
commercial plantation of 500 ha by the BAGOE company; and (d) the development of 1,000
ha for the production of potatoes, rice, and power by AGRIZED. This is a very important
achievement given that the public sector cannot finance all agricultural developments. Such
private sector investments would allow the GOM to focus on delivering public goods for the
efficient operation of the sector.

88.     In summary, the ICR team leaned toward rating the achievement of project
objective as High. However, the team took into account the number of years (ten) it took the
project to achieve recognizable results (granted that this was beyond the control of the project
and given by default that the AF requires an additional implementation period). Further, the
team recognized that the project achieved these results with an additional 30 percent resources.
The team also recognized that the disruptions created by the political unrest have a cost and
that the indicators were also adjusted upward. The number of value chains supported and the
fact that the management of the infrastructure developed has not been fully transferred to the
private sector weighed very strongly in reducing the rating to Substantial. The ICR recognized
the big achievements made by the project but the team also was cognizant that Mali started
from very low level that made the impact significant.

3.3    Efficiency
Rating: Substantial

89.     The PAD argued that the project will provide many sources of economic and social
benefits. Annex 5 of the PAD presented a cost-benefit analysis at the level of the whole project.
The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the whole project was 16 percent. The PAD
also performed an estimate of the EIRR for selected products and the return ranged between
64 percent for tomatoes under improved capacity for irrigation and agricultural practices and
178 percent for onions under improved storage. During the AF, the project revisited the cost-
benefit analysis and found that the EIRR was almost the same as the PAD estimate with a Net
Present Value (NPV) of CFAF 1,350 million.

90.    The ex post review conducted analyses of the NPV and the financial Internal Rate
of Return (IRR) of individual enterprises and the EIRR for the whole project. The
evaluation noted that direct comparison with the ex-ante was difficult given the changes in the
importance of products the project made during implementation. That said, the returns by
themselves are robust and demonstrate the high return the project managed to achieve.

91.     The ex post evaluation confirmed the high return of this project. The NPV for
investments at business level is approximately US$3,533 million as opposed to an actual
investment of US$59.2 million. The EIRR for the whole project is estimated at 15 percent.
These results are similar to the estimation made as part of the AF, which was 16 percent. (See
the detailed analyses under annex 3.)

92.     A sensitivity analysis was performed assuming 10 percent, 20 percent, and 30
percent increase in the costs of the project (other than those of investments at business level).
This analysis gives a profitability rate of 14.1 percent, 13.3 percent, and 12.5 percent. When
the flow of benefits is delayed by one or two years, the respective EIRRs are 13.6 percent and
12.4 percent. Thus, the results are robust and hold even under different assumptions.

93.    The analysis identified key activities for the observed high level and robust
achievements. The success emanated from project investment in improved irrigation,


                                               16
processing techniques, improved technologies, and the availability of commercial
infrastructure, which contributed to improving the quality of products, and due to the capacity
building work undertaken that allowed sector stakeholders to improve the utilization of
technologies (and techniques) made available by the project. Overall, these results can be
compared with those of the initial project and the AF as provided in table 5.

94.     The cost-benefit analyses consistently confirmed that the project showed a high rate of
return. With regard to resource utilization, the project used all of its resources by project
closing.

95.     Estimation of turnover resulting from project investment shows a high percentage
of return. Total project cost (including the contribution of the GOM, the beneficiaries and the
Bank) amounted to US$71.8 million. The total turnover generated by the beneficiaries of the
ACDP who were covered by the survey amount to US$51.5 million. Beneficiaries of the ACDP
who were covered by the survey represent half of the total number of beneficiaries. If this is
extrapolated to the total beneficiaries, the total turnover would be an estimated US$103 million,
which covers the total project cost and yields a surplus of US$31.2 million. The turnover
generated by the beneficiaries of the ACDP represents 143.5 per cent of the total cost of the
project at this point of the project without accounting for the flows that will accrue in the future.

96.      On improving efficiency, the project contributed to post-harvest reduction for
selected beneficiary farmers but the main contribution was establishing a system and
demonstrating its positive impact on income. One characteristic feature of Mali agriculture
was (and still is) high post-harvest loss. Consider the case of shallots: 50 to 70 percent of the
initial stocks were lost during the six months following a harvest. In Sikasso, the most
developed agricultural region of the country, only 30 percent of communities have a storage
facility. Thus, post-harvest loss is very significant. This is more pronounced in the case of
perishable products such as mangoes, onions, and shallots. A shallot dealer who is a resident
of Tabakoto village, close to Bandiagara, and who benefited from the ACDP cofinanced
storage and conservation facility, reported a huge reduction in post-harvest loss. Before the
ACDP, post-harvest lost stood at 67 percent of the total commercialized quantity. As a result
of the infrastructure works and the training provided, the loss reduced to a mere 8.7 percent of
the commercialized volume—which is a 667 percent reduction in loss.

97.     Efficiency also was gained in water use in irrigation due to improvement to the
system and provision of water-efficient technologies such as drip irrigation systems.
Provision of improved seeds also contributed to efficiency given that productivity has risen
significantly. Improving access roads also meant that products can be delivered on time,
especially perishable products, which again implies improvement in efficiency. All these
demonstrate that the project had a major impact in improving the efficiency of the value chains


                                                   17
it supported. Therefore, efficiency is rated Substantial.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

98.     Based on the ratings of the three items above (relevance, achievement of PDOs, and
efficiency) and cognizant of the Independent Evaluation Group’s outcome ratings guidelines,
the ICR team rates the overall project outcome as Satisfactory.

                                              Overall Outcome Rating              Satisfactory

3.5           Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Impact on Poverty
99.     The areas selected for intervention by the ACDP are geographic regions with a
high concentration of poor. Occupationally, farmers are the poorest, with a poverty rate of 57
percent to 81 percent incidence, 85 percent to 86 percent for depth and severity. Thus, the main
beneficiaries from job creation by agribusiness came from the ranks of the unemployed (or
partially employed) and therefore are poor. The project by design is pro-poor. However, the
impact of the project on poverty is not systematically captured and it is therefore difficult to
present a consolidated figure. One direct impact is the number of jobs (about 5,248 jobs)9 that
was directly created as a result of the ACDP and it was the rural poor who directly benefited
from the project.

100. Gender aspects. The project made conscious efforts to target women so that they can
benefit from the project directly. Of the 5,248 jobs created, 42 percent went to women. This is
a big achievement given that women have not fared well in the past and were passed over by
development interventions. Women constituted 34 percent out of the total project beneficiaries.
Of the 612 subprojects supported by the project, 29 percent were managed by women. The
lower business ownership compared to the 34 percent of total beneficiaries was the result of
difficulties encountered by women in mobilizing sufficient resources (such as securing loan)
to cover the cost of their cofinancing. These businesswomen were among the most dynamic of
entrepreneurs working with the project. By promoting the creation of businesses and jobs in
rural areas, the project certainly contributed to the advancement of women and their positioning
in the Malian economy and the agricultural sector.

101. Social development. The project had significant social development impact resulting
from the different core project activities. These included (a) a number of trainings (hands-on
workshops in a range of tasks from production to marketing/exporting were provided under the
ACDP); clearly an improved capacity is in operation under the value chains that were supported
under the ACDP; (b) formation and strengthening of a number of organizations, especially at
the regional level, which is an important development that the regions can build on; and (c) the

                                                            
9
    The impact analysis indicates 5,248 jobs declared but also says that about 5,500 jobs were created.


                                                                       18
project determination and focus to ensure women benefited from the project.

102. Further, in addition to strengthening of existing agribusiness operators, through
the 612 subprojects that the project cofinanced, the ACDP also mobilized women,
farmers, and private sector operators; created and improved knowledge on market access;
demonstrated working partnership among producers and processors; and the host of other
activities the project supported had significant social development impacts. Further, the fact
that the project operated at the farm level with private business operators meant its contribution
to social development was significant and that bodes very well for the sustainability of project
outcome. These subprojects benefited from improved access to financing, which the project
supported by building the capacity of financial institutions to service agribusiness investors.
These financial institutions provided a partial guarantee fund to the tune of 836 CFAF, which
was a 95 percent achievement of the revised target of 880 CFAF.

103. One important contribution of the ACDP project was reducing the drudgery of
labor at the farm level. The use of improved farm equipment and irrigation technologies
promoted by the project contributed to reduce the drudgery of labor and help increase the
productivity of producers. The impact study shows that compared to the baseline situation, the
average cultivated area per farm has increased from 0.95 ha to 3.08 ha for potatoes, 0.5 ha to 1
ha for shallot/onions and 0.3 ha to 1.5 ha for papayas that came about due to improvement in
technology that relatively reduced the level of toiling.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
104. Institutional development will remain a major hallmark of the project. Here,
institutional development will include changes in the rule of the game in addition to
organizational formation strengthening and improving policy and legal frameworks, among
others. Institutionally, the project was transformative in that it supported the private sector
actors to implement a new operating standard and established a spirit of entrepreneurship and
innovativeness as it applies to agricultural value chain development. Building the capacity of
value chain professional organizations was the cornerstone in this approach. The institutional
arrangements were designed to ensure that participating organizations become self-sufficient
and vibrant undertakings. Critical milestones in this capacity-building process have been
reached, including the creation of functional networks in the key value chains (mango, potato,
onion/shallots, papaya, and livestock). The project has strengthened the capacity of Malian
agricultural exporters to effectively compete in international markets by assisting 16 exporters
secure GlobalG.A.P. certification, training of 9 quality control auditors, and the certification of
mango export facilities (Bamako and Sikasso). Project beneficiaries have improved their skills,
either in production techniques and practices, processing, or management or in all of those.

105. A major achievement is also made in establishing functioning partnerships to
deliver project results. Before the advent of the ACDP, institutions whose activities are
complementary operated independently. The ACDP systematically built and nurtured a
significant number of partnerships. The government technical service agencies, research
institutes, research and consulting firms, and nongovernmental organizations conducted studies
and provided trainings and technical support. On the other hand, financing institutions
delivered financial services to the beneficiaries of the ACDP. These partnerships made it
possible to implement ambitious (both by geographic coverage and thematic areas covered)
and extensive work programs. For instance, these partnerships allowed financing institutions
to develop confidence in providing loans to some agricultural subprojects, which would have
been impossible without this joint work program.


                                                19
106. The project has created a remarkable set of organizations that will ensure that the
project will build on what has been achieved and will serve as a demonstration for others.
For example, the four CDDPs that are set up with the support of the ACDP serve as ‘showcases’
of five drip irrigation technologies and techniques and eight technologies and techniques for
processing shallots. In other circumstances, enough capacity has been created, allowing the
future expansion of the promising value chain achievements. Consider the case of mango
packaging in which the project created a total capacity of 5,000 tons per year. Only 36.5 percent
of this installed capacity is used, ensuring sufficient capacity for future expansion to fulfill the
increased demand for packaged mango that has been growing substantially.

107. While maintaining its private sector focus, the project also collaborated with
several public institutions to improve public support to private sector actors during
implementation and expectedly after project closing. The project collaborated with the
Institute of Rural Economy (Institut d’economie rurale, IER) to develop, and later take over,
demonstration plots and pilot project tests in food processing. It also worked with the IER’s
food laboratory to upgrade its capacity to perform food safety tests to support agribusinesses.

108. Finally, the ACDP supported the development of a number of strategies and
drafting of legislation as they relate to improving the enabling environment for
agricultural business and in facilitating the further development of value chains. The
project also financed and produced at least 65 reports ranging from technical studies and
diagnostic analyses of value chains to strategic development plans and feasibility studies that
will be the basis for future works in value chain development.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
109.          There was no unintended negative impact observed during implementation.

110. The project resulted in a positive effect on microfinance institutions (MI). With
growing confidence in the feasibility of agribusiness and seeing that the regions in which the
ACDP operated was changing toward a better economic future, the Banque Nationale de
Développement Agricole (BNDA) opened 17 branches in the areas that the ACDP was
operating.

3.6           Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

111.          No beneficiary survey was conducted.

   4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

112. The design of the project clearly provided room for sustainability of project
outcomes. From the beginning, implementation was expected to focus on the continuation of
activities initiated and demonstrated under this project after closing of the credits. The project
aimed to institutionalize the methodology developed under it. As part of this institutionalization
effort, eight Malian businesses exporting mangoes have received the prestigious GlobalG.A.P.
certification.10 There is strong evidence that the selected value chains that were targeted by the

                                                            
10
  GlobalG.A.P. is the world's leading farm assurance program, translating consumer requirements into Good
Agricultural Practice in a rapidly growing list of countries—currently more than 100. The certification helps
producers comply with Europe-wide accepted criteria for food safety, sustainable production methods, worker
and animal welfare, and responsible use of water, compound feed, and plant propagation materials. Harmonized


                                                               20
project institutionalization of agribusiness achieved a certain level of development albeit it is
still at early stage of development. A milestone was reached in building the capacity of
professional organizations; although they are not yet fully self-sufficient, they are operational,
with elected leaders and mandates.

113. Market diversification will also allow project outcomes to not falter due to loss or
lack of markets. The agribusinesses supported under the ACDP are operating in local,
national, subregional, and international markets. For example, papaya is marketed only
domestically. There is still unmet demand to fulfill; for other value chains, diversification of
markets has been pursued.

114. One important element that contributed to the success of enterprises supported
under the grant scheme was the rigors screening that subprojects have to undergo for
receiving a matching grant in addition to their direct financial contribution. The cost-
benefit analysis found out that the financial analysis made on beneficiary enterprises
investments are encouraging. Although each recommended technology has required new skills
and increased spending, financial analysis shows that these investments have contributed to a
substantial increase in revenue and gross margin of the companies, demonstrating that business
models promoted are very profitable and thus sustainable. The project made grants totalling
CFAF 3,244 million to subproject entrepreneurs, through the investment and innovation fund.
This necessitated contributions of up to CFAF 2,000 million from the beneficiaries.

115. The follow-on project will build on the achievements of the ACDP. Although this
project successfully supported agribusiness development by diversifying production and the
development of supply chain in high-value products, this is not a task to be completed by one
project and a single intervention alone. Cognizant of this fact, the government has requested
for a follow-on operation that will build on the gains made under the ACDP. In addition, other
donors are also supporting value chain development currently and have shown interest to
continue providing support.

       5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1           Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Marginally Satisfactory

116. This project was a continuation of a series of Bank interventions in the agriculture
sector and therefore the project built on the gains made in the past. Also, as a continuation
of past interventions, this project reflected lessons learned from past experience. The selection
of the regions was appropriate given the need to intentionally focus on regions that are the most
fertile area for diversification of agricultural production and with high concentration of
unemployed poor.

117. The project design embodied or was the operationalization of the Bank’s
assistance to the GOM’s implementation of the Rural Master Plan. As result, the project
focused on the results of the different diagnostic works identified and reflected the priorities of
the government. The design also provided priority to those crops for which it was shown by

                                                            
certification also meant savings for producers, as they would no longer need to undergo several audits against
different criteria every year.


                                                               21
the studies conducted that there was sufficient market demand.

118. The project design was well informed by pilot activities and experience in Mali
and other countries. Extensive consultation was conducted at different levels, including with
donors and private sector operators. The implementation arrangement included all relevant
stakeholders. It is important to note that contracting out the implementation of activities in
which the private sector has a clear comparative advantage and the know-how was the right
choice.

119.     Overall, project components reflected the support needed and were well aligned
and logically structured to support the achievement of the PDO. The soundness of the
components chosen is clearly demonstrated by the fact that they were not changed during the
different restructurings. The arrangement made for M&E, both at the national and decentralized
levels, was also right given the number of subprojects the project supported. It would have been
difficult to collect and consolidate at the national level without close monitoring and reporting
by the regional outfits.

120. The design was also able to identify a list of trainings needed—from farm level in
handling improved equipment to processing and packaging of products. Without such training,
it would have been difficult to receive certification, which mean that it would have been
difficult to penetrate the European market. In one email (in 2010) the former TTL for this
project argued that, “the two-day workshop held in December 2007 in Bamako on the strategic
profile of agricultural exports and the range of programming instruments that have been
developed (competitiveness plan, strategic action plan) are best practice region-wide…” The
point here is that the Bank team organized a number of consultations to disseminate widely and
create awareness about supply chains that was at best rudimentary before this project.

121. However, the design did have some limitations. The design was acutely aware of the
need to focus project activities on selected supply chains and made a specific statement
regarding this. However, it still ended up selecting 18 supply chains that were later found to be
unmanageable. It also appears that including cotton was a distraction, to the point that the
project initially looked like two suboperations, one focused on cotton and the other on fruits
and vegetables. Further, consistency across project documents left much to be desired.

122. The project Quality Enhancement Review (QER) was fully aware of the different
elements that the project PDOs was covering. The minutes of the QER dated November 9,
2004 noted that there are two important and interconnected objectives of increasing incomes
and diversifying economic opportunities through the development of commercial agriculture
and agricultural supply chains. The team was then advised that, “The objectives of increasing
incomes of rural households should be kept at the overarching objective of the project, while
the improvement of supply chains performance—including increases in physical outputs—
could be the more specific targets set during project duration.” Although the advice of the QER
was followed, it was not reflected across all project documents, clearly showing not a design
problem but final editing and checking.

123. The project was assessed by the QAG and a July 7, 2010 memo rated quality of
design as Satisfactory. Specifically, the QAG reported that the design exhibited many
strengths, which included the following: (a) the supply chain approach to commodities (other
than cotton) could be pursued without any further policy change; (b) the core PDO is of strong
strategic relevance; (c) once the PCU staff recruitment issue was solved, implementation
commenced promptly, reflecting thorough preparation; (d) sector and operation-specific risks


                                               22
were well documented in the PAD—both for identification and mitigation; (e) the project relied
on sound and proven technologies. It provides scope for innovation but the estimated returns
do not depend on innovations being successful; and (f) fiduciary, safeguard, and governance
aspects of the project were handled fully satisfactorily. However, the QAG also pointed out
some shortcomings in design:

       (a) The Results Framework contains a PDO which is different from the one shown in
           the PAD as well as the one shown in the Legal Agreement, leading to confusion
           about the overall objectives (as well as key indicators) of the project. (For this ICR
           this is not a design problem but rather more of diligence in ensuring consistency
           across project documents.) Management should have insisted on a uniform and
           simplified PDO and greater selectivity in the indicators.

       (b) The principles of the financial arrangements proposed for the use of project-
           financed facilities by the private sector were not clearly established at design.

       (c) Ex ante rates of return to irrigation are very high but of questionable plausibility
           without any citation of ex post returns obtained in other projects or any other
           evidence.

       (d) The calculated rate of return to the overall project investment is 16 percent, which
           is based on a series of assumptions that the panel considers to be of no value added.

124. The overall quality at entry is rated as Marginally Satisfactory. The ratings
considered that the project team got the technical design elements right, but also manifested
minor shortcomings related to documentation and follow-up of recommendations. On the
technical design the main shortcoming was the initial ambitiousness of the preparation that
revealed itself in the choice of 18 value chains. Both QAG and the 2013 ISN confirmed that
the project took off relatively quickly once contracting issues were resolved. This indicates that
the project was well prepared and ready for implementation. This is a major achievement in a
country where support to supply chain was at infancy and some of the design elements had to
be negotiated with the government—such as executing some components of the project with
contracted entities outside the government bureaucracy. The team got the design right.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

125. Supervision was result focused and made the necessary correction during
implementation. Supervision missions, in collaboration with Malian counterparts, were
fielded regularly according to recommended frequency (two per year). The supervision team
was composed of all relevant specialists and provided close support in addressing
implementation issues, restructurings, reallocating funds to boost the matching grant facility,
trimming the number of value chains supported, and revising output indicators. The project
team was also result focused. The rationale given to the AF was to scale up the results of the
project. This clearly demonstrates that staff were fully focused on results.

126. There was continuity in the Bank’s supervision team, with only two TTLs having
served on the project. The project definitely benefited from the presence of the TTL in the
country office. This allowed in informally and formally providing implementation support,
advice, and follow-up, among others. This arrangement was very critical in the continuation of
the project, specifically keeping the dialogue ongoing during disbursement suspension.


                                               23
127. Supervision missions traveled to project sites especially to visit and appraise
subprojects. This was very helpful to learn firsthand from the beneficiaries and exchange
views on how such projects operated in other areas of Mali or in other countries. The project
team also come across as credible in their appraisal of project implementation progress. They
also revised the targets upward once it became clear the project will achieve a higher result.

128. The QAG rated supervision quality as Satisfactory. In assessing the quality of Bank
supervision, the QAG panel gave more weight to the focus on development effectiveness,
which was considered to be fully satisfactory. The QAG also identified particular strengths in
supervision that included the following:

       (a) The Bank insisted that the project management team be selected according to agreed
           competitive procedures aimed at ensuring quality selection. This entailed a delay of
           six months in effectiveness to ensure the desired quality, but this delay was amply
           justified.

       (b) The Bank has been on top of problems from the outset by fielding timely missions
           and maintaining frequent contact with the implementing units.

       (c) Supervision efforts focused on the (substantial) risk of weak performance from
           contracted service providers by much hand-holding and frequent guidance and, in
           FY10, by providing for a smooth transition from the first batch of three-year
           contractors to the next.

       (d) Aide memoires contain good descriptions of problems and challenges, which are
           nicely summarized in ISRs.

       (e) FM supervision provided high-quality oversight.

       (f) Supervision skill mix needed to be broad for this multifaceted project and it was—
           at least on the one main mission each year. Skill mix on the other mission was more
           selective and this was appropriate.

129. However, on the other hand, there were some weaknesses in the supervision. The
team should have addressed the inconsistency of PDO across project documents early during
implementation. QAG also identified that there was no systematic attention to social issues
until the MTR. The QAG panel stated that it agrees that at no point should this operation have
been declared a problem project and therefore ratings reflected actual project status.

130. The MTR confirmed the relevance of the project objective and stated that the PDO
will remain, “to increase rural incomes through improvements in the performance of the value
chain for agriculture, livestock, fishing and other products for which the borrower has
comparative advantages.” This was one major drawback of the MTR since it did not resolve
the observed differences in the PDOs across project documents mainly between the PAD and
the Legal Agreement.

131. Overall quality of supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The weaknesses
observed were more on the process side and did not have substantive ramifications on the
project outcome. Supervision mission was well focused on results and outcome and they have
been proactive in addressing implementation problems timely. The fact that the Bank team was
able to convince the government to finance the project during disbursement suspension was a


                                              24
major coup for continuity of the project. Further, the Bank team has also convinced the
government to bridge the gap between the ACDP and the proposed project under preparation
(Agripole) by financing the continuation of the PCU and activities to be continued. Thus,
quality of supervision is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

132. The Bank team got the design right and worked very closely with the counterpart in
ensuring successful implementation. The fact that the TTL was stationed in the country office
was instrumental for the close support the project enjoyed. Overall, the Bank team did very
well in designing and implementing this project.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

133. The GOM, particularly the Ministry of Agriculture (and later renamed MRD) was
strongly committed to the project. All the necessary reforms to facilitate the implementation of
this project was already implemented. The government also has made a clear policy statement
in support of the project and requested an advance for preparing the project. The GOM played
a major role in stakeholders’ dialogue during project preparation. The government partnered
with the Bank team in creating wide awareness about supply chain development.

134. The government support was instrumental in facilitating project implementation.
According to the QAG, government ownership and commitment remained strong. Although
some in the ministry were initially reluctant to go along with the contracting out of the
management of components that reluctance has been overcome by success. Unlike in some
other countries, the project has not been sabotaged by ‘disempowered’ bureaucrats. Also, as
QAG observed: “as the project has begun to demonstrate success, other ministries have become
more supportive: the clash with Commerce/Industry that arises in many countries has not
happened.”

135. In addition, the government provided wide latitude to the PCU to do the real
coordination work and ensured that the PCU remain well staffed. The governance bodies of
the project, at the national and regional levels, operated as anticipated. The government has
provided the necessary budgetary support and raised its expenditure in agriculture. Also, the
government showed willingness to continue financing project activities after the project closed;
it has committed resources to finance the PCU and project activities until the end of December
2015.

136. The PCU’s leadership was put in place without much delay after project
effectiveness. The government was supportive of the need for personnel changes at the level
of the specialists; hiring of new experts (in irrigation, processing, and market infrastructure);
and promotion of M&E and communications assistants to specialist positions. The willingness
of the government allowed the PCU to adjust to changing circumstances as events evolved.
The government also played a critical role in ensuring that the project adjusted to changing
circumstances including reducing the number of value chains to manageable level.

137.   If there were weaknesses, they were mainly due to capacity limitations. The GOM,


                                               25
for example, did not take the necessary appropriate action to avoid the lengthy delay between
Board approval and effectiveness. The AF experienced a similar delay, although this delay was
due in great part to the political crisis facing the country in 2012 and was a factor outside the
control of the government. The delays in the recruitment and contract renewal of private service
providers can also be traced to inefficiencies in procurement in the Ministry of Agriculture and
not due to lack of commitment.

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

138. The PCU actively participated in Bank supervisions, provided the necessary
M&E, fiduciary, and safeguard documents for Bank review. It maintained a dynamic M&E
database and produced several communications materials to showcase and promote the project.
It provided the necessary coordination for the regular meetings of the national and regional
committees. It also monitored and evaluated the private service providers and, when their
renewal was delayed, the PCU moved to recruit contracts as replacements and even took over
their activities for a few weeks. Overall, the PCU performed satisfactorily in spite of many
difficulties.

139. Personnel changes were also made in the PCU during implementation but to a
large extent the PCU remained stable. The project relied on staff directly contracted for the
PCU and also used professional organizations in filling specific position that were not easily
available in the country. Also, the PCU quickly added specialists in infrastructure, irrigation,
and processing as the need arose during implementation. The private service providers also
performed satisfactory (when they had a standing contract). At times, cooperation and
coordination of the private sector with the PCU was difficult because of the sheer number of
entrepreneurs in the face of a limited capacity within the PCU.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower
Rating: Satisfactory

140. With the government performance rated as satisfactory and the significant work the
PCU was able to accomplish in coordinating the implementation of the project, overall the
borrower performance is rated Satisfactory.

   6. Lessons Learned

141. The following lessons were learned from the assessment of the project design,
implementation, and supervision.

142. In countries with limited capacity, it is very critical to start with a lower number
of areas for intervention (number of regions or supply chains) and scale up once the
system is found to be working. The ACDP showed its selectivity by limiting the regions of
intervention and targeting the fertile areas. However, with regard to value chains, it was
ambitious.

143. The introduction of efficient irrigation and processing technologies will not
necessarily kill jobs. In case of the ACDP, it contributed to create/consolidate jobs. During
the selection of this technology, it was stated that technologies that improve the performance
of irrigation will reduce the demand for labor. With selection of the appropriate technology,
this predication failed to materialize; instead more jobs were created. The fact that farmers


                                               26
expanded their plots also helped in creation of jobs.

144. Contracting a private service provider with experience and expertise in the sector
to implement project activities is the best approach in countries or regions with limited
capacities. This project relied on the private sector and nongovernmental organizations for
executing project activities that reduced the burden on the PCU. Hiring a single lead contractor,
charged with hiring and supervising the necessary experts for the job to be done, can bring
about the desired outcome.

145. It is necessary to include both investment and operating costs in business plans,
which provides a fuller picture of resources needed to finance proposals prepared by
beneficiaries. It helps both the project and the beneficiary determine the appropriate size of
the matching grant for a viable activity, the level of beneficiary’s own fund contribution, and
the required additional bank credit. During this project implementation, banks provided loans
thinking it was the full financing requirement for the business plans they approved. When
entrepreneurs later approached the banks for additional credit for working capital, the banks
were reluctant to provide additional loans.

146. In addition to demonstration, dissemination, and adoption of innovative
technologies, projects with support to value chains should include an incentive
mechanism, preferably with grant or technical assistance to encourage developers to
acquire and adapt innovative technologies and techniques promoted by the project. This
project promoted appropriate technologies but these projects were adopted because of the grant
mechanism the project provided.

147. An agribusiness and value chain development requires a multifaceted integrated
support both within the sector and without. These include improving compliance, support
in capacity improvement in certified processing, packaging, and preservation; establishment of
packaging facility and cold storage; training on international standards that improved quality
to meet export standards; providing logistic staging-area; and facilitating contact with buyers,
among others. Externally, providing the necessary infrastructure, such as roads, is also an
important ingredient for success. Underlying all these is support to improvement of
productivity through agricultural input support especially to small farmers.

148. The dividend from reducing post-harvest loss, improvement in conservation,
processing and packaging is very substantial that sufficient resources should be allocated
early in project design. A corollary point to this is that projects should actively promote to
the private sector the need for investing in these areas that have a huge returns.

149. Establishment of financial accounts by project beneficiaries will help and ease
access to capital and bank credits. Thus, beneficiaries should be supported to improve their
financial literacy and encouraged to establish financial accounts. It will also support the banks’
processing of loans since this will allow them to assess financial accounts spanning several
years to gauge the credit worthiness of their applicants.

150. In projects that support the development of value chains, a rigorous study of the
demand for the specific product and possibility of market penetration should inform the
choice of products and supporting activities to be financed. Products supported under
ACDP had sufficient markets that ensured successful outcome and sustainability of the
operations.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Demonstration and dissemination of intensification and value-adding
technologies

Subcomponent “demonstration and dissemination of technologies”

1.      Demonstration of new technologies was done through four CDDPs, which were
established with the support of the IER; the technical services of the MRD (Livestock
Production Directorate [DPA], National Directorate of Industrial and Livestock Production
[DNPIA], and National Directorate of Rural Engineering [DNGR]); and the regional
coordinating bodies. The CDDPs constituted ‘display cases’ for five new technologies and
techniques of drip irrigation, corrugation irrigation, and spray irrigation, as well as eight
technologies and techniques in processing shallots (slicing, straw chopper, drying furnace,
tunnel, and so on).

2.      The capitalization on the results of the use of these technologies was done through 26
(target was 21) technical and economic guides (TEGs) translated into 17 kits or practical guides
developed at the level of the CDDP with the participation of actors of the concerned value
chains, regional coordinating bodies, the IER, and the decentralized services of the MRD.
Producers and students supervised by the technical services of the MRD and staff of regional
coordinating bodies were the target audience. Their participation in demonstrations was done
through guided tours organized within these CDDPs and/or through the use of CDDPs,
including their transformation component as well as delivery of services in slicing/drying of
shallots, cutting/drying of meat, and so on.

3.      New technologies were disseminated through subprojects whose design was greatly
inspired by TEGs and kit (practical guidelines) produced within the framework of the project,
as well as placing the produced TEGs and kits at the disposal of the services of the MRD and
producers/promoters of subprojects.

Subcomponent “Inter-Professional consultation”

4.      This subcomponent helped achieve two major results. The establishment of five
sectoral inter-branch organizations: mango, potato, shallot/onion, papaya, livestock/meat on a
forecast of six and ten consultation frameworks in the four regions of intervention of the
project. These inter-branch organizations have not earned legal recognition yet, but those
mango, potato, shallot/onions, and papaya value chains have a strategic development plan for
their respective value chains.

Component 2: Improving the performance of agricultural supply chains

5. The main results of this component are (a) the organization of commercial events
(marketing test, market exploration missions, and participation in trade events); (b) the
acquisition of GlobalG.A.P. certification for 8 Malian mango-exporting companies; (c) the
skills training of 9 Malian nationals for International Register of Certificated Auditors (IRCA)
certification and 16 Malian consultants in GlobalG.A.P. to provide support services to
businesses; (d) the preparation and dissemination of 4 quality standards on mango, potato,
shallot, and meat, to actors of the value chains; and (e) facilitating of the understanding of the
value chains through the production and dissemination of various strategic documents,
including 11 strategic development plans, 9 value chains competitiveness plans, 5 priority


                                               30
action plans, and 1 business intelligence system for mango, potato, shallot, and livestock meat
value chains, with the support of inter-branch organizations. The collected commercial
information was disseminated by cellphone SMS.

6.       The combined effects of these achievements are the diversification of markets for the
exportation of Malian products (Europe, Maghreb, and Economic Commission for West
African States [ECOWAS]), the reappearance of Mali as a recognized origin in European
statistics (requires an average annual exports exceeding 10,000 tons), with Mali exporting
128,000 tons with a turnover of more than CFAF 60 billion between 2007 and 2014.

Component 3: Access to financing

Subcomponent 1: Establishing partial guarantee funds

7.      The major result achieved under this subcomponent is the establishment and
operationalization of a partial guarantee fund of an anticipated amount of CFAF 750 million
through agreements of CFAF 250 million, CFAF 150 million, and CFAF 250 million through
the BNDA, Banque Commercial Internationale (BCI), and the Budget Monitoring System,
respectively and the approval by financing institutions of 32 credit files for a total guarantee of
CFAF 836 million against a forecast of CFAF 880 million.

Subcomponent 2: Technical Assistance

8.       The following main results were achieved under this subcomponent: (a) easier access
to credits, which allowed actors in the agricultural value chains to obtain credits of more than
CFAF 983 million, which was 89.4 percent of the target of CFAF 1,100 million; (b) provision
of technical assistance that allowed the setting up of management tools with 285 subproject
promoters; (c) training for 4 experts of regional coordinating bodies and 16 Study on
Monitoring Structures (Structures d’Etudes et de Suivi, SES) to use the management tools; and
(d) training of 100 members of financial institutions on the analysis of agricultural risk.

Subcomponent 3: Promoting innovative financial instruments

9.      The following results were achieved under this subcomponent: (a) two studies on ‘new’
financial products—collateral management and leasing and (b) test transaction on collateral
management. This transaction, which related to cardboard packaging for mango exporters,
showed the limits of this financial product. Other tests are being considered for dried products
(dried shallots) or storage in cold room (potato) at the level of centralization poles. However,
the leasing product could not be tested because no participating financial institution is applying
the appropriate legislation of Central Bank of West-African States (Banque Centrale de Etats
de l’Afrique de l’Ouest, BCEAO) with regard to this product.

Subcomponent 4: Management of Innovation and Investment Fund

10.     The management of the Innovation and Investment Fund, which was initially part of
Component 1, was transferred to Component 3 following the MTR of the project. Its main
result is the financing of 610 subprojects on an initial forecast of 550 subprojects, through
partial grants. Nearly 55 percent of this support was provided between 2014 and early 2015.
The government has taken appropriate steps to provide advisory support in the setting up of
investments and management tools for one year. The ACDP gave grants totaling CFAF 3,244




                                                31
million to subproject promoters, through the Innovation and Investment Fund. This
necessitated contributions of up to CFAF 2,000 million from promoters.

Subcomponent 5: Promoting private investment

11.  Promoting private investment was initially part of Component 2. It was transferred to
Component 3 as a subcomponent following the MTR of the project.

12.     The main result achieved under this subcomponent is the ongoing implementation of
four private investment projects in a joint venture, against a target of four. These are (a) a
commercial mango plantation of 200 ha (50 ha were already developed); (b) a cardboard
factory whose financing agreement with Banque Ouest Africaine de Développement (BOAD)
was signed on September 22, 2014, for a total cost of CFAF 4.6 billion; (c) the company
BAGOE for a commercial plantation of 500 ha; and (d) the company AGRIZED for the
development of 1,000 ha in Bewani for the production of potatoes, rice, and power.

13.    The ACDP also provided support to CEDIAM (a company which specializes in the
processing of mashed mangoes) in the fight against fruit flies and the facilitation of the supply
of raw materials, ATRAFEL (a fruit and vegetable processing company), and the company
NARDONE & SONS in their efforts to find strategic partners.

Component 4: Market-oriented infrastructure

Subcomponent 1: Construction of commercial facilities

14.     The main results achieved under this subcomponent are the rehabilitation/creation of
nine commercial facilities: the cold storage and mango packaging facility of Sikasso, the shallot
and potato centralization poles of Niono and Sikasso, the Improved Logistics Perimeter in
Airport Area (PLAZA) in Bamako, the Food Technology Laboratory (LTA) of the IER,
Mandela packaging area, and three regional slaughterhouses in Sikasso, Segou, and Mopti
against a target of twenty-one. The gap between the achievement and the targets was explained
by the fact that the facilities of Konna and Bandiagara were supported by other donors and the
resources for the commercial platform, the cold room of Kati and three butcher shops, and the
commercialization facilities of Loulouni and Dara were reallocated to the additional works of
upgrading of the existing commercial facilities, Sikasso, Niono, and PLAZA.

Subcomponent 2: Rural roads

15.     The following results were achieved under this subcomponent: 1,101 km of roads were
rehabilitated and transferred to the National Directorate of Roads, against a target of 1,100 km.

Subcomponent 3: Operational management of commercial facilities

16.     The following results were achieved under this subcomponent: (a) four private
management delegation agreements were signed for the three rehabilitated slaughterhouses and
Mandela commercialization area; (b) a study was conducted to define the legal status and
management arrangements of the PLAZA; (c) a consultant was recruited to support the process
of private management of facilities; and (d) a transitional management system was set up at the
level of two packaging areas (mango pole of Sikasso, shallot/onions pole of Niono).

Component 5: Project management and Monitoring and Evaluation

Subcomponent 1: Coordination of project implementation

17.    The following results were achieved under this subcomponent:

Financial Management
18.     At the end of the initial financing on April 30, 2014, the project had reached a
disbursement rate of 99.99 percent. As of May 19, 2015, the disbursement rate on the AF credit
was 79 percent, with an implementation rate of 65 percent for a target of CFAF 10 billion. The
anticipated implementation rate for June 30, 2015 (completion date of the project) is 99 percent.
The overall combined implementation rate of the project will be 99 percent for the aggregate
allocated amounts of US$71.8 million.

External Audit
19.     The ACDP was subject to an external financial audit each year. Thus, seven financial
audits of the project were performed since the implementation of the project started. The audit
of the project’s 2014 financial statements started on April 10, 2015 and the final audit reports
were expected to be submitted to the Bank and the GOM no later than May 31, 2015. The audit
of the project’s 2015 financial statements will be performed in the second half of 2016.

Environmental and social safeguards at the level of the ACDP subprojects
20.      The following main results were achieved: (a) the relevance of the environmental and
social safeguard policies (OP 4.01 and OP 4.12 ) was confirmed; (b) the project’s classification
in Category B was confirmed; (c) the effective application of the developed safeguard measures
was confirmed (solid and liquid waste management, hygiene and sanitation, product storage
warehouse management, and so on); (d) an environmental screening of subprojects was
performed; (e) the capacities of subproject promoters were strengthened in environmental and
health risks management approaches; (f) support to the establishment of health and
environmental standards in the field of agro-industrial processing; (g) development of reliable
waste management systems for marketing, storage, preservation, packaging, and processing
facilities; (h) an environmental audit was performed at the end of the project and the results are
expected by June 30, 2015.

21.     These provisions and measures do not seem to be applied correctly by the majority of
subprojects promoters due to the lack of sufficient ownership of the approach and tools, which
is due to the low levels of awareness raising and coaching efforts.

Subcomponent 2: M&E of activities and impacts

22.     The following main results were achieved under this subcomponent: (a) an adapted and
operational M&E system with appropriate data collection tools; (b) a dynamic database on the
achievements, as well as the technical and economic results of the subprojects that were
financed; (c) 39 technical implementation reports to supplement Financial Monitoring Reports;
(d) 9 annual reports and more than 20 M&E reports; (e) 3 study reports on the assessment of
the impacts of the project, (f) 4 environmental monitoring reports of the National Directorate
of Sanitation and Control of Pollution and Nuisance (Direction de l’assainissement du Contrôle
des Pollutions, DNACPN); and (g) more than 30 internal monitoring missions conducted on
the ground. These results are interesting. However, the lack of a harmonized format for data


                                               33
collection and processing tools makes it difficult, not to say impossible, to produce a data series
and analysis. Furthermore, there was not sufficient regular monitoring (and therefore regular
data collections) about the subprojects during the eight years of implementation to avoid
systematically reconstituting data. The quality of the data from the dynamic database should
therefore be considered as relative.

Subcomponent 3: Communication

23.     The following main results were achieved under this subcomponent: (a) a
comprehensive communication strategy developed to support the implementation of the
project; (b) partnership protocols were signed with the radio stations of the areas of intervention
of the project for the airing of quarterly broadcasts; (c) more than 200 reports on television
news about the flagship activities of the project; (d) 30 press inserts; (e) more than 150 radios
broadcasts by regional coordinating bodies; (f) 10 infomercials INFO PLUS advertorials; (g)
6 video magazines of 26 minutes on the results of the project broadcasted on the national
television channel ORTM (and viewing on the website of the project); (h) the website of the
project was visited more than 150,000 times till date; (i) 12 issues of the information magazine
‘FILIERES MAG’ disseminated; (j) technical and economic guides, kits, technical guides, and
quality repositories of the value chains produced and disseminated; (k) a lot of communication
materials produced to support communication on the results of the project.

Subcomponent 4: Supervisory and control bodies

24.     The following main results were achieved under this subcomponent: 8 sessions of the
national steering and orientation committee held, against a target of 8; 32 sessions of regional
steering and orientation committee held, against a target of 32, or 8 for each regional
coordinating body; 14 joint (Bank and Malian government) supervision missions conducted;
more than 10 visits to project sites to verify and monitor the achievements of the project and
organized study tours. More than 140 reports on studies, missions, techno-economic
repositories, and practical guides.

25.    The causal linkages between components’ outputs and PDO outcomes are readily
apparent.

                     Component 1’s demonstrations of innovative irrigation and processing techniques,
                      along with the availability of the matching grant (up to 70 percent of investment
                      cost) provided strong incentives for entrepreneurs to set up about 600 subprojects
                      on commercial agriculture.11

                     Component 2 facilitated Malian producers/exporters’ access to domestic, regional
                      and international markets by conducting market studies and logistical tests; building
                      the capacity of professional organizations; assisting producer exporters to obtain
                      the critical EuroGap certification; training 10 quality control auditors; and
                      providing valuable market intelligence on destination markets. Without proper
                      coordination in the use of common market platform (for example, mango pre-
                      cooling station) by professional organizations and certified exporters, Mali could
                      not have exported fruits and vegetables to the European Union.

     Estimates used in the economic and financial analysis of the final evaluation.


                                                               34
           Component 3 assisted with access to additional credit to complete the subproject
            financing by building the capacity of financial institutions to service agribusiness
            investors, and setting up a partial guarantee fund (reaching CFAF 863 million) to
            facilitate project-supported investors’ access to bank credit (of CFAF 983 million).

           Component 4 financed the construction/rehabilitation of the market infrastructure
            that allowed the packing of fruits and vegetables for export, as well as the storage
            (of onion/shallots and potato), and the meat market terminals to supply the domestic
            market. This component also helped build 1,100 km of feeder roads to open access
            of farmers’ produce to the market

           Component 5 ensured that the implementation of the project was effectively
            coordinated and monitored; including revising it as necessary to ensure the
            achievement of the project PDO.

Annex 3: Project Economic and Financial Analysis

  I.   Executive Summary

1.      Methodology. The ACDP supported the undertaking of investments in the value chains
and the capacity building of the stakeholders involved under the initial project and AF. An ex
ante evaluation of their economic and financial effects for beneficiaries as individuals and for
the whole country was carried out. This document intends to conduct the ex post evaluation of
the project (achievements). The results of this evaluation were compared with those of the ex-
ante evaluations conducted during the formulation of the initial project and AF.

2.       During the initial project and AF, the ACDP was designed and implemented as a
‘framework’ program for the promotion of the value chains targeted, including mango,
onion/shallot, potato, papaya, and livestock/meat, with the main objective of supporting the
corresponding production for both export and the domestic/regional market. From this
perspective, the project focused on (a) the level of structural investments and capacity building
of stakeholders in value chains and (b) investments in individual production and processing
activities in enterprises (‘subprojects’) of strategic importance to the value chains. These
activities were supported through the cost-shared grant mechanism.

3.      The advantages of structural investments in value chains are quite positive but difficult
to quantify. No attempt was made to quantify these provisions under this analysis. They were
therefore not taken into account in calculating the project profitability. In terms of investments
at business level, the ACDP through the shared-cost grant, allocated grants to investors to
support investments in new technologies, conquer new markets, and facilitate access to credit
with financial institutions. The data drawn from the project database provided information on
the number of beneficiaries, the nature of the support received from the project, the nature and
costs of investments, and the benefits drawn from the activity.

4.     These data helped calculate the NPV and the financial IRR of individual enterprises
and the EIRR of the whole project.

Analysis of Investments at Business Level
5.      The results of the financial analysis of investments in enterprises are encouraging.
Although each recommended technology required new skills and increase in expenses, the
financial analysis shows that these investments significantly increased the incomes and gross
margin of enterprises, showing that the promoted business models are very profitable. Indeed,
with the grant, the IRR at production level stood at 36.6 percent for shallot, 60.7 percent for
papaya, 62.4 percent for cattle fattening, 73.5 percent for mango, and 134.4 percent for potato.
At the processing/preservation level, the IRRs were in the range of 75.4 percent for dried meat,
82.2 percent for mango processed in juice, and 84.0 percent for preserved shallot. The NPVs
for these business models with 10 percent of interest rate are CFAF 8.2 million for shallot,
CFAF 39.5 million for potato, CFAF 10.1 million for papaya, CFAF 58.5 million for mango,
CFAF 32.5 million for fattening, CFAF 13.0 million for preserved shallot, CFAF 14.9 million
for the production of mango juice, and CFAF 67.4 million for dried meat.

6.      The financial analysis also confirms the relevance of the cost-shared grant mechanism
promoted under the ACDP. In an environment where access to credit is limited, this mechanism
significantly helped to improve the cash flow of enterprises during the critical period of
financial crisis when producers set up or developed their activity. Measures to review in depth
investors’ investment proposals are economically justified. Hence the need for an Operations

Profitability of the Whole Project
7.      The economic analysis relied on the following assumptions: (a) the considered period
is 25 years corresponding to the lifetime of mango orchards considered as investment with the
longest life cycle; (b) 100 percent of the cost of Components 2 and 3 and 25 percent of the cost
of Component 1 (FII being taken into account of Component 1); (c) the cost of Components 4
and 5 was not considered; (d) 100 percent of the gross margin due to the project (financial
prices of products were considered as similar to the economic prices due to the low level of
exchanges of these products between Mali and other countries outside the West African
Economic and Monetary Union [WAEMU]); (e) the labor economic cost corresponding to 50
percent of the financial wage cost; (f) the opportunity cost of the selected long-term capital is
6 percent; and (g) the cost conversion factors of the chosen project is 85 percent.

8.      Based on these assumptions, the NPV economically for investments at the business
level is approximately US$3533 million as against an actual amount invested of US$59.2
million. When the advent of benefits is delayed by one or two years, the respective NPV is
US$30.3 million and US$25.6 million. The EIRR for the whole project is estimated at 15
percent. These results are similar to those of the initial project and AF, which were 16 percent
in each case.

9.      The sensitivity analysis was performed based on an increase of 10 percent, 20 percent,
and 30 percent of the project costs (other than those of investments at business level). This
analysis gives profitability rates of 14.1 percent, 13.3 percent, and 12.5 percent, respectively.
The sensitivity analysis was also conducted based on the margin due to the project of 10
percent, 20 percent and 30 percent compared to the gross margin of participating investors. It
gives respective profitability rates of 14.0 percent, 12.9 percent, and 11.7 percent. When the
advent of benefits is delayed by one or two years, the respective EIRR is 13.6 percent and 12.4
percent.

10.    The analysis of these data shows that the project remained economically profitable. The
EIRR can be explained by the increase in returns due to the improved irrigation and processing
techniques and technologies and the availability of commercial infrastructure, which
contributed to improving the quality of products and building the capacity of sector
stakeholders to use the disseminated technologies and techniques. Overall these results can be
compared with those of the initial project and the AF.

 II.      Beneficiaries and Benefits

       A. Beneficiaries

11.     The ACDP did the demonstration and dissemination of effective technologies and
techniques of irrigation and processing of products and the development of inter-branch
professions for priority sectors (mango, potato, shallot/onion, papaya, and livestock/meat)
(Component 1), participation in training courses, study travels, trade events (fairs, commercial
testing), access to strategic information (Component 2), adoption of effective technologies and
techniques (Component 3), and development of trade infrastructure (Component 4). To this
end, the project targeted 16,300 people including 615 promoters of subprojects or businesses.



                                               43
   B. Direct Benefits

12.    The direct benefits of the project correspond to the results achieved in each component,
notably:

13.    Component 1: Demonstration and dissemination of Irrigation, post-harvest, and
value-adding technologies

       (a) Four CDDPs set up with the support of the IER, the technical directorates of the
           MRD (Agricultural production—DPA, Industrial and Animal Productions—
           DNPIA and Rural Engineering—DNGR) and the regional coordination bodies.
           They serve as ‘showcases’ of five drip irrigation technologies and techniques—,
           aspersion and eight technologies and techniques for processing shallots (slicing),
           straw chopper, Attesta, tunnel drying kilns, and so on.

       (b) At the CDDP level, 26 technical and economic references translated into kits or
           practical guides were developed and disseminated, with the involvement of the
           stakeholders of the relevant sectors, regional coordination bodies, the IER, and
           decentralized services of the MRD.

       (c) Several guided visits organized within the CDDPs and several sector stakeholders
           used the services provided by the CDDPs, especially their processing component.

       (d) Five inter-branch professions of the sectors of mango, potato, shallot/onion, papaya,
           livestock/meat set up and ten consultation frameworks in the four interventions
           regions of the program.

       (e) Six-hundred-twelve subprojects were set up.

14.      Component 2: Improving the performance of agricultural supply chains. (a) Eight
Malian businesses exporting mangos received the GlobalG.A.P. certification; (b) nine Malian
auditors received skills training on the IRCA certification; (c) sixteen Malian consultants in
GlobalG.A.P. were trained to support businesses; (d) four quality references on mango, potato,
shallot, and butcher’s meat were developed and disseminated to sector stakeholders; (e) eleven
strategic development plans, nine sector competitiveness plans, and five priority action plans
were produced and disseminated to improve knowledge on the targeted sectors; (f) one business
intelligence system for the sectors of mango, potato, shallot, and livestock/meat was set up and
facilitated with the support of inter-branch professions; and (g) several trade events (marketing
test, prospection missions, and participation in fairs) were provided.

15.     Component 3: Access to financing. (a) One partial guarantee deposit in the amount of
CFAF 750 million, including CFAF 250 million, CFAF 150 million, and CFAF 250 million,
through the agreements signed with the BNDA, BCI, and BMS, respectively, was set up and
operationalized; (b) technical assistance in negotiating with financial institutions has been
established; (c) 285 promoters of subprojects equipped with accounting and financial
management tools; (d) four experts from the regional coordination bodies and sixteen SES
trained on the use of management tools; (e) 100 agents of financial institutions trained on
management of agricultural risks; (f) two studies on ‘new’ financial products: third-holding
and leasing and an operation test on third-holding; (g) four private investment projects entered
into in joint venture (i) a commercial mango planting on 200 ha, (ii) a carton factory, (iii)
BAGOE company for commercial planting of 500 ha, (iv) AGRIZED company for the


                                               44
development of 1,000 ha in Bewani; and (h) three companies were supported, mango puree
processing CEDIAM company for fight against fruit flies and facilitating supply of raw
materials, ATRAFEL company for processing of fruit and vegetables, and NARDONE &
SONS company to seek strategic partnerships.

16.     Component 4: Market-oriented infrastructure. (a) Nine trade infrastructure
rehabilitated or upgraded, namely the mango cooling and packaging infrastructure in Sikasso;
the shallot and potato centralization centers in Niono and Sikasso; the Developed Logistic Area
in Bamako Airport Zone (PLAZA); the Food Technology Laboratory (FTL) of IER; the
packaging area in Mandela; and three regional slaughter houses in Sikasso, Segou, and Mopti
and (b) 1,100 km of roads rehabilitated.

17.     Moreover, the ACDP contributed to the socioeconomic well-being of Malians. It
generated and offered direct socioeconomic benefits to at least 16,300 stakeholders in the
priority sectors. These benefits are the increase in productivity and agricultural production
because of the use of adapted irrigation and processing technologies, quality seeds/seedlings,
registered fertilizers and pesticides, as well as the compliance with the appropriate
technological itineraries (weeding, use of compost/droppings, and so on), and the improvement
of the access to financing (subsidy and credits) and access to markets. The financing partners
of the project accepted thirty two applications for credit for a total guarantee value of CFAF
836 million and granted to sector stakeholders credits in a total amount of over CFAF 983
million. These have also received CFAF 3,244 million in grant and contributed CFAF 2,000
million to fund 612 subprojects or businesses. Moreover, the exports of Malian products to
Europe, Maghreb, and ECOWAS totaled more than 10,000 tons per year or over 128,000 tons
between 2007 and 2014 and generated an accumulated turnover of more than CFAF 60 billion.
This led to the reappearance of Malian origin in European statistics.

18.  The project also contributed to reducing unemployment particularly among youth and
women through the creation and strengthening of over 5,500 jobs.

   C. Indirect Benefits

19.      The main indirect benefits are the following: (a) development of public-private
partnership through the establishment of trade infrastructure, the management of which is being
privatized, the support of businesses entering joint-venture contracts and the cost-share grant
with promoters of subjects; (b) strengthening state technical services and private service
providers; (c) development of business partnerships between sector stakeholders and financing
institutions; (d) improvement of product quality through training on quality, hygiene, and
standards, as well as upgrading of trade infrastructures and the establishment of environmental
safeguard measures in the subprojects; and (e) capacity building of sector stakeholders and
their organizations including inter-branch professions.

III.   Financial Analysis

   A. Methodology and Assumptions

20.     Conceptual framework. The ACDP intervened in four regions of Mali (Koulikoro and
Bamako Districts, Mopti, Segou, and Sikasso). It targeted six priority sectors (mango, potato,
shallot/onion, livestock/meat, papaya, and milk) and six secondary chains (cashew, cereals,
gum Arabic, tomato, fish, and nursery). The project intervention regions are the main
production basins of the country for six targeted priority sectors. In each of these regions, the


                                               45
project supported the activities grouped within the four technical components, through the
regional coordination units and the operators of Components 2 (C2) and 3 (C3) and the
infrastructure component of the Project Management Unit.

21.     The ACDP was designed and implemented as a ‘framework’ program for the promotion
of targeted value chains including mango, onion/shallot, potato, papaya, and livestock/meat,
with the objective of sustaining the corresponding production both for export and for the
domestic/regional market. It went through two major phases: the initial project and the AF.
Each phase was the subject of a formulation in which the economic and financial analyses ex
ante (forecast) of proposed investments were conducted to determine their economic and
financial impact on beneficiaries as individuals and the country as a whole. The ex post
evaluation (achievements) of the project is conducted as part of this document. Its results were
compared with those in the forward-looking assessments in the formulation of the initial project
(2004) and the AF (2013).

22.     This exercise was not easy since, unlike economic and financial analyses of the initial
project and the AF performed using the data respectively from sectoral parameter average of
the results achieved at national level, the financial and economic analysis of the ICR is built on
actual data on promoters supported under the project. Moreover, between 2004 and 2015 (years
in which the first and last economic and financial analyses were conducted), the project has
experienced internal and external developments. Indeed, some technologies and techniques
(hand auger, manual drainage, low-density mango orchards, and so on) have been abandoned
in favor of others (motorized auger, motorized or solar pumping, high-density mango orchards,
mango and papaya combination, drying tunnel furnace, and so on). The adoption of these
technologies has led to both a reduction of drudgery and increased labor productivity,
investment costs, and operating expenses relative to baselines (initial project, AF, pre-project
situation). The technical data (area, yield, number of laborers, performance of mobilized
technologies) and financial data (capital cost and operating costs) are not the same at the level
of these technical or expenditure positions. In the CDDP, where TEGs were produced,
cultivated areas were between 0.15 and 0.25 ha. With the changes introduced in the level of
investment to be considered, where the area is between 1 ha and 3 ha for small businesses, the
amount of calculation of the subsidy increased from CFAF 6 million to CFAF 15 million and
the subsidy rate from 50 percent to 75 percent. These changes in the funding mechanism have
been accompanied by an increase in working capital and therefore a need for promoters to
resort to credit to ensure their personal contributions.

23.     During its implementation, the project supported (a) the establishment or upgrading of
structural investments of strategic importance to the value chain and capacity building of
stakeholders and (b) investments in individual activities of production and processing at the
company level (‘subprojects’). These activities were supported through the matching grant
mechanism related to the credit for which access has been facilitated by a security deposit and
technical assistance in negotiating with financing institutions.

24.     The benefits of structural investments in value chains are quite positive, but difficult to
quantify. No attempt was made to quantify these benefits as part of this analysis. They have
therefore not been taken into account in the calculation of the profitability of the project. The
easily quantifiable benefits selected for economic and financial analysis are those generated
through investments in individual production and processing activities at the company level
(‘subprojects’). They particularly enabled the acquisition of new technologies, market
conquest, and the development of strategic partnerships. The information on these businesses
and their year of entry into the ACDP portfolio are detailed in table 3.1.

            Source: ICR based on ACDP data 2015.

            25.     Analysis of these data indicates that 59 percent of companies in the ACDP portfolio
            joined the project portfolio in 2014. Their benefits will appear only after the project. This
            situation helps limit the effects of the project.

            26.    Despite the difficulties, the mission produced an economic and financial analysis. It is
            based on the technical and financial operating data and taking the average of the data of all
            farms of the sector and subsectors considered. These data were collected by subproject owners
            with the help of the C3 operator, at their respective companies, and have established the
            operating accounts at the end of each cycle of activities (or production cycle). The actual


                                                               47
information on their activities of production and processing/storage of products or service
deliveries were sent to the project. With the help of C1 operators, subproject promotors had
produced or replenished the operating accounts of the year that preceded the conclusion of the
partnership with the ACDP. These accounts were used in the analysis as those of the situation
before the project. The analysis of the results of the circumstances prior to the project against
those in the situation with project support shows the financial benefits due to the project.

27.     In Mali, the price system is free. The market prices are determined by the law of supply
and demand. Prices used in the standard business models are those indicated by the promoters
during each crop year. During these years, there were no major policy distortions in the prices
of inputs or outputs. Therefore, financial prices and economic prices for tradable goods were
essentially identical for transfers and taxes. Trade barriers with key trading partners (Côte
d’Ivoire, Senegal, Niger, and Burkina Faso) were negligible because of their membership in
ECOWAS and WAEMU. The distortions in exchange rates are close to zero because of the
membership of these countries in the same monetary zone, the CFAF. As for the factors of
production, labor opportunity cost was used for economic analysis. This price was deemed
appropriate given the limited employment opportunities in rural Mali. The mission considered
that this price is half the cost of unskilled labor indicated in the operating accounts produced
by the developers.

28.     The project's profit reflects the difference between the benefits of the situation with
project support and the advantages of the situation without project support at the level of each
operating model. In all models, the wages of farm managers have not been recognized. Their
compensation reflects the net margin generated.

   B. Financial Results of the Business Models

29.     The business models are as follows: (a) milk production, (b) milk processing, (c) cattle
fattening, (d) beef processing, (e) grain processing, (f) shallot production, (g) shallot
conservation, (h) potato production, (i) papaya production, (j) mango production, (k) mango
processing, (l) cashew processing, (m) nursery, and (n) crafts.

30.     Without-project situation, the promoters of subprojects grow very small acreage
because watering is done using a watering can and requires going a long way to fetch water.
The resulting drudgery of work deters many to embark on this activity outside the Office du
Niger zone. In the situation with project support, developers have access to a set of performing
technologies and techniques: certified and well-preserved seeds, approved treatment products,
performing irrigation (water point, water pumping and distribution equipment) or processing
(water point, pumping equipment, processing equipment) system, and better access to finance,
training and support, and advice. This set of factors have helped improve technical
performance, financial, and commercial enterprises. Access to and adoption of these
technologies by investors resulted in an increase in crop yields of 75 percent for mango, 94
percent for papaya, 100 percent for potatoes, and 166.7 percent for shallots. The number of
animals fattened annually per farm has increased ninefold.

31.    Main financial results. These are (a) gross margin, (b) the IRR, (c) NPV at the level
of each operating model, and (d) the daily remuneration of family labor.

32.    Gross margins. The farm models ‘crafts’, ‘meat drying’, ‘milk processing’, ‘mango

profitable. These data are summarized in table 3.2 and are detailed in annex 1.

33.     Financial IRR. The results of the financial analysis of investments by the companies
are encouraging. Although each recommended technology has required new skills and
increased spending, financial analysis shows that these investments have contributed to a
substantial increase in revenue and gross margin of the companies, demonstrating that business
models promoted are very profitable. Indeed, without subsidy, the IRR at production level
stood at 36.6 percent for shallot, 60.7 percent for papaya, 62.4 percent for cattle fattening, 73.5

75.4 percent for dried meat, 82.2 percent for processed mango juice, and 84.0 percent for stored
shallot. The NPV for these business models at a 10 percent interest rate is CFAF 8.2 million
for shallot, CFAF 39.5 million for potatoes, CFAF 10.1 million for papaya, CFAF 58.5 million
for mango, CFAF 32.5 million for cattle fattening, CFAF 13.0 million for stored shallots, CFAF
14.9 million for the production of mango juice, and CFAF 67.4 million for dried meat. These
data are presented in table 3.3.

34.     The financial analysis also confirms the relevance of the matching grant mechanism
promoted under the ACDP. In an environment where access to credit is limited, this mechanism
has significantly helped improve corporate cash flow during the critical time of financial crisis
where producers/processors have installed or developed their activity. Measures aiming at
making an in-depth assessment of the investor’s investment proposals were essential to
ensuring that the selected investments were economically sound. Hence the need to have the
Operations Manual of the matching grant mechanism which best meets the needs of
entrepreneurs expressed in their business plans and in strict compliance with the procedures
outlined in this manual during the evaluation of the documents.

35.     Monthly remuneration of family labor. The permanent workforce receives a monthly
pay ranging from CFAF 12,000 to 50,000 per person, based on availability and demand. The
salary applied by each promoter was considered in farm models retained in the situation with
project support and that without project support. The casual labor is paid between CFAF 400
and 1000 per day depending on supply and demand.

36.     The business models proposed required a maximum of four months of work per year.
The estimated compensation is by far higher than that in force in the project area (see table
3.4). The project doubled at the minimum of the monthly wage of family work compared to
the without-project situation.

IV.      Economic Analysis

    A. Assumptions

37.     The economic analysis is built upon the following assumptions: (a) the period
considered is 25 years, which corresponds to the life time of mango trees considered as the
longest lifecycle investment; (b) 100 percent of the cost of Components 2 and 3 and 25 percent
of the cost of Component 1 (the FII being taken into account of Component 1); (c) the cost of
Components 4 and 5 has not been considered; (d) 100 percent of the gross margin related to
the project (financial product prices were considered to be similar to economic prices because
of the low level of trade related to these products between Mali and other countries outside the
WAEMU); (e) economic cost of labor is 50 percent of the financial wage costs; (f) the
opportunity cost of retained long-term capital is 6 percent; and (g) cost of conversion factors
for successful project is 85 percent.

    B. Results of the Economic Analysis

38.    Based on these assumptions, the NPV for investments at firm level, from an economic
point of view, is approximately US$35.3 million as against an actual amount invested of
US$59.2 million. When the advent of benefits is delayed by one or two years, the respective
NPV is US$30.3 million and US$25.6 million. The EIRR for the whole project is estimated at
15 percent. These results are similar to those of the initial project and the AF, which were 16
percent in each case.

39.     The sensitivity analysis was based on increase rates of 10 percent, 20 percent, and 30
percent in project costs (other than investments at enterprise level). This analysis yields return
rates of 14.1 percent, 13.3 percent, and 12.5 percent. The sensitivity analysis also took into


                                                      51
account the decline of 10 percent, 20 percent, and 30 percent in the project-related margin, as
compared to the gross margin of participating investors. This results in rates of return of
respectively 14.0 percent, 12.9 percent, and 11.7 percent. When the advent of benefits is
delayed by one or two years, this results in respective EIRRs of 13.6 percent and 12.4 percent.

40.    The analysis of these data shows that the project remains economically viable. The
EIRR is explained by the returns that have increased due to improved techniques and
technologies of irrigation and processing and the availability of trade facilities that contribute
to improving the quality of products and building the capacity of sector stakeholders to use
disseminated technologies and techniques.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1. Le Projet de Compétitivité et de diversification agricole (PCDA), s’est achevé le 30 juin 2015 et a clôturé
       le 31 Octobre 2015. Conformément à l’Accord de Crédit, l’Emprunteur représenté par le Ministère de
       l’Agriculture et la Banque mondiale élaborent chacun un rapport d’achèvement du PCDA. Le présent
       rapport est celui de l’Emprunteur. Il a pour objectifs de : (i) réaliser une autoévaluation de la conception
       et de l’exécution du projet par l’Emprunteur et (ii) tirer les enseignements utiles pour d’éventuelles
       interventions futures.
2. La méthodologie adoptée a reposé sur le recueil et l’exploitation des rapports fournis par l’Unité de
       Coordination du Projet (UCP), les coordinations régionales (CR) et les Opérateurs privés, le bureau
       pays de la Banque mondiale. Les informations y collectées ont été complétées, actualisées, ou validées
       par celles recueillies pendant les entretiens de la mission avec des représentants des parties prenantes
       dans la mise en œuvre du projet au niveau central et des régions couvertes. La mission s’est rendue du
       04 au 22 juin dans les Régions de Sikasso, de Mopti, de Ségou, de Koulikoro et du District de Bamako
       et a rencontré les acteurs des filières et les institutions partenaires du PCDA. A chaque entrevue et
       réunion organisée dans ce cadre, la mission a échangé et restitué les constats majeurs, les mesures
       convenues et les leçons apprises avec les représentants des parties prenantes.
3. Le PCDA est cohérent avec les stratégies et politiques nationales. Il a été conçu pour répondre à trois
       défis majeurs du Mali:
       (i) augmenter la contribution du secteur du développement rural à la croissance économique du pays ;
       (ii) intensifier et diversifier la production agricole, en vue de renforcer la sécurité alimentaire et de
            développer les exportations agricoles ;
       (iii) et améliorer les revenus et les conditions de vie des populations rurales.
4. Ces défis sont détaillés dans les documents de politiques et de stratégies nationales notamment : (i) la
       lettre de politique sectorielle de 2001 qui définit la vision institutionnelle du secteur agricole et rural à
       l’horizon 2010 ; (ii) le Schéma Directeur du secteur du Développement Rural (SDDR) (1992) actualisé
       en 2002 pour la période 2002-2010 ; (iii) le Cadre Stratégique de Lutte contre la Pauvreté (CSLP) pour
       la période 2002-2006, actualisé pour la période 2007 – 2011..
5. Le PCDA est aligné sur la stratégie d’assistance pays (CAS) 2006, de la Banque mondiale pour la
       république du Mali. Il représente l’une des contributions12 de la Banque mondiale à l’opérationnalisation
       des politiques et stratégies maliennes.
6. La zone d’intervention du projet comprend les régions de Bamako/Koulikoro, Mopti, Ségou et Sikasso,
       considérées comme principaux bassins de production des filières d’intervention : mangues,
       échalote/oignon, pomme de terre, bétail/viande (embouche bovine et lait) et papaye, filières horticoles
       prioritaires pour lesquelles le Mali dispose d’avantages comparatifs.
7. L’objectif de développement assigné au PCDA était de contribuer à la levée des contraintes critiques
       au développement d’un certain nombre de filières commerciales agricoles, d’élevage et de pêche pour
       lesquelles le Mali jouit d’un avantage comparatif et d’opportunités de marché confirmées. Plus
       spécifiquement, le projet visait à (i) améliorer les performances techniques et économiques des systèmes
       de production et de valorisation des produits agricoles ; (ii) améliorer les performances commerciales
       et économiques des filières agricoles ; (iii) faciliter l’accès au financement ; (iv) réaliser des
       infrastructures commerciales et réhabiliter des pistes rurales d’accès.




                                                            
12
     Sur la période, la Banque mondiale finançait également le PASAOP et le PACR. 


                                                               67 
8. Le PCDA s’articulait autour de cinq composantes elles-mêmes subdivisées en sous-composantes :
    Composante 1 : Démonstration et diffusion des technologies d’irrigation et de post récolte
    performantes. Elle comprend trois sous composantes (i) Démonstration et promotion des innovations
    technologiques, (ii) Renforcement des capacités des acteurs de la filière, (iii) Appui à la diffusion des
    innovations technologiques et (iv) Concertation et promotion interprofessionnelle. A la revue mi-
    parcours, le mécanisme de financement des innovations technologiques, le fonds d’innovation et
    d’investissement (FII), initialement géré par la composante 5, a été transféré à la Composante 3.
    Composante 2 : Amélioration des performances techniques et commerciales des chaines de valeur
    comportant trois sous-composantes (i) Connaissance des marchés, des filières et des opportunités, (ii)
    Promotion de l’environnement des services, de l’investissement et appui au développement des filières
    et (iii) Qualité des produits et de leur commercialisation. A la revue mi-parcours en 2009, la promotion
    des       investissements        privés     a     été     rattachée      à     la     composante       3.
     Composante 3 : Facilitation de l’accès au financement et gestion des risques comptant quatre sous
    composantes (i) Fonds de Garantie et Gestion du Fonds d’innovation et d’Investissement (FII), (ii)
    Assistance Technique ; (iii) Promotion d’instruments financiers novateurs et (iv) Promotion de
    l'investissement privé ; Composante 4 : Infrastructures             ayant deux sous composantes (i):
    Infrastructures commerciales et (ii) Pistes rurales. Composante 5 : Coordination et Gestion du projet
    composée de quatre sous composantes (i) Coordination de la mise en œuvre du programme, (ii)
    Suivi/évaluation des résultats et des impacts, (iii) Communication et (iv) Supervision et Contrôle.
9. Le PCDA, placé sous la tutelle du Ministère chargé de l’Agriculture (MA) qui en a assuré la maîtrise
    d’ouvrage générale, l’a délégué à une Unité de coordination du projet (UCP). La maîtrise déléguée des
    infrastructures commerciales et des pistes a été confié à l’AGETIER, l’AGETIPE et la Direction
    nationale des routes (DNR). Le pilotage et l’orientation du projet ont été assurés aux niveaux national
    et régional respectivement par un Comité national de pilotage et d’orientation (CNPO) présidé par le
    Ministre de l’Agriculture et des Comités régionaux de pilotage et d’orientation (CRPO) présidés par les
    gouverneurs de régions. Le CNPO et les CRPO étaient composés de représentants des Ministères (ou
    leurs services techniques déconcentrés), de l’Agriculture, de l’Elevage, de l’Environnement et
    Assainissement, des transports ainsi que des institutions de financement, des chambres consulaires et
    des acteurs des filières ciblées. Le CNPO et les CRPO se réunissaient une fois par an et approuvaient
    les plans de travail et budget annuels qui leur ont été soumis par respectivement l’UCP et les
    Coordinations régionales. Ils ont également analysé et validé les rapports financiers. La création par
    voie règlementaire du CNPO et de l’Unité de coordination du projet (UCP) financièrement autonome
    a constitué des conditions d’entrée en vigueur du crédit IDA. L’exécution des plans de travail et budget
    annuels approuvés par le CNPO était placée sous la responsabilité du Ministère de l’Agriculture qui a
    désigné le Coordinateur du projet et signé avec lui un contrat de performances évalué annuellement.
10. L’UCP comportant une équipe d’experts de haut niveau placés sous la supervision directe du
    coordinateur du projet, a exécuté les composantes 4 « Infrastructures » et 5 « Coordination et gestion
    du projet ». La composante 4 l’a été sous la maîtrise d’ouvrage déléguée de l’AGETIER et de
    l’AGETIPE. La Direction nationale des routes (DNR) a co-supervisé le volet pistes rurales de la
    composante.
11. En sa qualité de Maître d’Ouvrage Délégué, l’UCP, a au niveau des régions, mis en œuvre à travers les
    opérateurs privés, des plans d’actions annuels validés par les représentants des filières à travers les
    CRPO. Ces opérateurs privés régionaux ont après l’UCP, constitué le deuxième niveau opérationnel
    du PCDA. Véritables Maîtres d’œuvre régionaux, ils ont à la fois, exécuté la composante 1 et coordonné
    les prestataires spécialisés qu’ils ont sélectionnés et recrutés pour l’exécution des tâches qui leur ont été
    confiées. L’un des deux opérateurs a couvert les bassins de production de Bamako-Koulikoro-Sikasso
    et l’autre, celui de Ségou-Mopti. Ces opérateurs étaient aussi chargés de la coordination des activités
    régionalisées des composantes 2 et 3.
12. Les composantes 2 et 3 ont été mises en œuvre chacune par un Opérateur constitué d’une firme
    internationale et d’une firme malienne. Ces Opérateurs ont chacun signé un contrat de performance
    avec l’UCP. Leurs experts recrutés et en charge de l’exécution des activités régionalisées, ont été
    implantés dans les Coordinations Régionales (CR) mais sans liens fonctionnels avec les coordinations
    régionales.

13. Le financement global prévisionnel du projet était de 71,8 millions de $US (35,9 milliards de F CFA)
    dont 46,4 millions de $US (23,2 milliards de F CFA) pour le projet initial et 24,4 millions $US pour le
    financement additionnel. La contribution de l’IDA s’élevait respectivement à 43, 153 millions de US$
    et 20, 00 millions de US$. Le gouvernement avait apporté respectivement 1,0 million de US$ et 3,2
    millions de US$ respectivement sur le projet initial et le Financement additionnel. Les bénéficiaires ont
    apporté 4.950 millions de $US (2.050 millions de $US dans le projet initial et 2.900 millions de $US
    dans le Financement additionnel) au titre de leur contribution au financement des sous-projets.
14. L’Accord de crédit n°4094-MLI relatif au PCDA a été signé le 8 septembre 2005 entre le gouvernement
    de la République du Mali et la Banque mondiale. Il est entré en vigueur le 4 avril 2006. Le démarrage
    effectif du projet a été affecté par le retard pris dans le recrutement et l’installation des opérateurs en
    charge de sa mise en œuvre, la mobilité du personnel de l’UCP et des opérateurs. L’exécution du projet
    a été perturbée par des crises sociopolitiques intervenues en Côte-d’Ivoire (2008 – 2010) et dans le pays
    en 2012. Ces événements ont eu pour conséquences, un faible taux d’exécution et de réalisation des
    objectifs du projet, et qui subséquemment ont occasionné les deux prorogations de la durée du projet
    initial (2006 – 2013 contre 2006 – 2012 initialement prévus).
15. Le PCDA fit l’objet de trois modifications majeures, la première a eu lieu le 17 février 2011 et a
    concerné : (i) la révision des résultats intermédiaires (nombre de sous-projets, notamment), (ii) la
    réallocation des fonds de la composante 4 (infrastructures) et des non alloués vers les composantes 2,
    3 et 5 du projet ; et (iii) la prorogation de la durée du projet de 6 mois pour intégrer le retard accusé
    dans la mise en œuvre dû au recrutement des opérateurs. La deuxième modification est intervenue
    après la crise sociopolitique de mars 2012 et a porté sur la prorogation de la durée de l’exécution du
    projet afin de prendre en compte la suspension des décaissements du crédit. La troisième modification
    a porté sur la mise en œuvre du financement additionnel qui a permis d’appuyer la consolidation des
    acquis et leur mise à l’échelle.
16. Malgré ces événements qui ont ralenti ou retardé l’exécution du projet, la performance du PCDA a été
    jugée globalement satisfaisante. Ce résultat est expliqué par trois facteurs majeurs : d’une part, une
    bonne collaboration (entente) entre l’Emprunteur et la Banque mondiale qui ont dialogué
    constamment, fait dans les meilleurs délais des ajustements qui s’imposaient et suivi leur application, d’
    autre part, des équipes de l’UCP et de cinq opérateurs privés dynamiques et engagées à réaliser leurs
    objectifs contractuels respectifs et d’autre part encore, la prolongation d’une année de la durée initiale
    du projet ainsi que le financement additionnel.
17. Au 30 juin 2015, le taux de mobilisation des ressources était de 98% du financement global, 93% sur
    les ressources IDA, 100% sur la contribution du gouvernement. L’absence des allocations dans le projet
    initial n’a pas permis de calculer le taux de mobilisation des apports des bénéficiaires. Même non pris
    en compte dans le coût estimatif global, la contribution des institutions de financement (banques
    commerciales et SFD) à travers des crédits accordés aux bénéficiaires du PCDA, a été de 1 819 millions
    de F CFA, soit 3,6 millions de $US, grâce à la fois, au fonds de garantie et à la facilitation par l’assistance
    technique à la négociation avec les institutions de financement.
18. Réalisation des objectifs contractuels (cadre des résultats du projet). Le PCDA a pu réaliser quasiment
    tous les objectifs contractuels consignés dans le cade des résultats. En effet, la Composante 1 a délivré
    l’essentiel de ses résultats : 26 Référentiel Technico Economiques (RTE) sur 24 prévus et 17 KIT de
    modèles d’entreprises préparés à partir des RTE tous validés, édités et diffusés (la sous composante
    1.1), 612 sous-projets sur 550 prévus (sous composante 1.2 ) ; 05 interprofessions des filières
    prioritaires (mangue, pomme de terre, échalote/oignon, bétail/viande et papaye sur une prévision de 6
    (sous-composante 1.3), soit un taux de réalisation de 108% pour les RTE, de 109% pour les sous projets
    et de 83% pour la mise en place des Interprofessions.




                                                       69 
19. Le PCDA a touché 16300 bénéficiaires contre une prévision de 9000, soit un taux de réalisation de
    181%. Pour les filières cibles, les productions commercialisées ont, en volume comme en valeur,
    dépassé les prévisions : 389 000 contre 330 000 tonnes pour la pomme de terre ; 1 234 000 contre 1
    025 000 tonnes pour l’échalote/oignon et 128 000 contre 119 000 tonnes pour la mangue, soit une
    réalisation des objectifs contractuels respectivement de117% pour la pomme de terre, 115% pour
    l’échalote/oignon et 107% pour la mangue. Ces produits ont été commercialisés sur différents marchés
    (national, sous régional et international) et ont généré un chiffre d’affaires cumulés de 148 milliards de
    F CFA contre une prévision de 122 milliards de F CFA pour l’échalote/oignon ; 67 milliards de F CFA
    contre une prévision de 52, 5 milliards de F CFA pour la pomme de terre et 60 milliards F CFA
    contre une prévision 56 milliards de F CFA pour la mangue. Le projet a réalisé les objectifs qui lui ont
    été assignés à 128%, 121% et 107% respectivement pour la pomme de terre, l’échalote / oignon et la
    mangue.
20. Ces résultats montrent que le PCDA a eu un impact positif sur les bénéficiaires qui ont vu augmenter
    leurs revenus, le secteur agricole et l’économie malienne qui désormais sont marqués par l’émergence
    des entreprises agricoles, agroalimentaires et d’activités amont et aval des filières, l’accroissement de la
    contribution du secteur agriculture au PIB, la réduction du chômage.
21. L’atteinte de ces résultats a reposé en grande partie sur cinq principaux facteurs : (i) la mise en œuvre
    des activités par cinq opérateurs privés (firmes/ONG internationales associées aux firmes et ONG
    maliennes recrutés sur appel à la concurrence) placés sous la supervision d’une UCP résolue à réaliser
    son contrat de performances ; (ii) l’adaptation, la démonstration et la diffusion des technologies
    innovantes d’irrigation et de transformation de produits ; (iii) le mécanisme de financement (subvention
    à coût partagé et crédits) mis en place pour permettre aux promoteurs de sous-projets d’ acquérir et
    adopter les technologies et techniques innovantes adaptées promues par le projet ; (iv) les
    infrastructures commerciales participant à l’amélioration de la compétitivité des produits maliens à
    l’international ; (v) les formations et l’accompagnement des acteurs des filières pour mieux connaitre et
    maîtriser l’utilisation et la gestion de technologies nouvelles, des infrastructures et de leur exploitation
    ainsi que pour améliorer leur accès aux marchés d’approvisionnement en biens et services essentiels (y
    compris les services financiers), au développement des filières et aux marchés des produits
    (participation aux manifestations commerciales).
22. Cependant, ces résultats auraient pu être plus importants si seulement si : (i) le nombre d’opérateurs
    était moins élevé (deux au maximum) pour permettre à l’UCP d’assurer une meilleure coordination et
    gestion et de limiter les coûts liés aux opérateurs ; (ii) les interrelations et interactions entre les
    opérateurs (C1, C2, C3 et UGP volet infrastructures) étaient maîtrisées pour développer des synergies
    et complémentarités ; (iii) la mise à niveau des infrastructures commerciales était achevée et la logistique
    de transport, mieux maîtrisée pour limiter la durée de conservation des produits dans les chambres
    froides au niveau de ces infrastructures ; (iv) l’apport des promoteurs (contribution pour l’accès à la
    subvention et fond de roulement) était moins important (dans un contexte d’accès limité au crédit, le
    niveau actuel de l’apport total du promoteur en question était si lourd que sa mobilisation a retardé
    l’exécution de l’activité et/ou sa réalisation était faible (après 2 années, la Société générale d’alimentation
    par exemple avait un taux d’exploitation par rapport à la capacité installée inférieur au seuil de
    rentabilité ; (v) le montant de la subvention n’était pas unique mais plutôt adapté à la nature de l’activité,
    les besoins financiers variant d’une activité à une autre ; (vi) l’appui conseil technique, en gestion de la
    qualité et en gestion comptable et financière notamment était assuré et adapté aux besoins des acteurs
    des filières ; (vii) les ressources du financement additionnel avaient moins servi à financer les nouveaux
    sous projets mais plutôt destinées principalement à terminer les mises à niveau des infrastructures
    commerciales y compris le renforcement de leur gestion opérationnelle, à accompagner les bénéficiaires
    qui avaient de difficultés à mettre en route leurs sous projets du fait du poids important de l’apport
    personnel (pour obtenir la subvention et constituer le fonds de roulement nécessaire) ; (viii) les
    mécanismes de pérennisation mis en place avaient aboutis et opérationnels avant la clôture du projet.




                                                       70 
23. Cet ensemble des conditions pour amplifier les résultats du projet montrent que les acquis du PCDA
    restent fragiles et leur durabilité peut être rapidement hypothéquée en l’absence de mesures de
    consolidation conséquentes relatives à la pérennisation de l’accès des entrepreneurs aux services
    financiers, aux services non financiers et aux technologies innovantes. Certaines de ces mesures doivent
    être rapidement prises. Elles pourraient donc l’être dans le cadre d’une opération transitoire. D’autres
    mesures doivent être prises à moyen terme dans le cadre d’une nouvelle intervention.
24. Mesures de court terme dans le cadre d’une opération de transition. Les activités à conduire à court
    terme sont les suivantes :
     Confirmer la mise en place du PCDA de transition et lui doter de moyens requis pour mener
      cette phase de transition.
     Cibler les acquis à consolider, les activités à achever et celles à mettre en place. Pendant cette
      phase de transition, l’accent devra être plus mis sur la consolidation, l’achèvement des
      activités déjà amorcées (renforcement des interprofessions, mise à niveaux des
      infrastructures commerciales, et l’accompagnement des promoteurs qui ont bénéficié de
      peu de suivi et d’appuis conseils techniques, en gestion de la qualité, en gestion financière et
      comptable et en négociation avec les institutions de financement, les fournisseurs d’intrants
      et les acheteurs de produits. Vu la durée de la phase de transition limitée à une année, limiter
      au maximum possible l’installation de nouvelles entreprises, car elles auront besoin de
      beaucoup de temps d’accompagnement pour maîtriser les nouvelles technologies et les
      marchés d’approvisionnement et des produits. De plus, s’appuyer le plus possible sur les
      cadres et les agents qui ont participé à la mise en œuvre du projet afin de ne pas consacrer
      plus de temps à l’apprentissage de l’approche et des principes PCDA, dont auront besoin les
      personnes qui ne connaissent pas le projet.
     Mobiliser de ressources nationales additionnelles et affectation de ces moyens vers les acquis
      et les activités ciblées ; le gouvernement du Mali a démontré sa volonté de politique en
      inscrivant au budget national plus de 2 milliards de FCFA pour le PCDA de transition. La
      mise à disposition de ces ressources devra être programmée de façon à permettre au PCDA
      de transition d’élaborer un plan de travail et budget annuel.
     Poursuivre les actions relatives à la veille commerciale et la diffusion des informations qui
      en résultent afin d’armer les entrepreneurs en outils d’aide à la gestion de la variabilité des
      prix des intrants et des produits ;
     Renforcer les capacités des promoteurs et des interprofessions à améliorer leur accès aux
      services financiers et aux services non financiers, à négocier avec les fournisseurs des biens
      et services dont ils ont besoin et avec les acheteurs de leurs produits en leur assurant
      l’éducation financière de base, les formations sur la négociation, la gestion financière et
      comptable des exploitations, la rédaction et lecture des contrats, etc. ;
     Poursuivre la diversification des outils de financement (crédit bail, warrantage, alliance
      productive, assurance agricole, joint venture, etc.) tout en accélérant le rythme de formation
      des institutions de financement sur les risques agricoles et de mise en relation de ceux-ci avec
      des promoteurs des entreprises afin d’améliorer l’accès de ces derniers aux services
      financiers adapté afin d’obtenir du crédit qui leur permettront d’acquérir les technologies et
      techniques performantes ;
     Poursuivre et amplifier le renforcement des capacités des prestataires privés et publics de
      services de qualité en les impliquant davantage dans le suivi et l’accompagnement des acteurs
      des filières ciblées et/ou en les recyclant sur la conduite de ces activités, signant avec le
      Ministère de tutelle des contrats de performance avec des indicateurs précis et réalisables et



                                                    71 
      en leur versant une prime ou indemnité pour charges additionnelles aux résultats, aux fins
      du développement des entreprises et de l’amélioration de leur compétitivité ;
    Poursuivre voire même amplifier les négociations avec les partenaires au développement
     pour mobiliser les ressources pour une nouvelle intervention pour la promotion de
     l’entrepreneuriat rural.
    Définir le contenu de la nouvelle opération sur le développement des entreprises rurales.
25. Mesures de moyen terme dans le cadre d’une nouvelle opération. Les activités à conduire à moyen
   terme sont les suivantes :
    Appuyer la préparation d’une nouvelle intervention pour valoriser les acquis du PCDA. Une
     partie de ressources mobilisées par le gouvernement du Mali peuvent être allouées au
     démarrage de cette initiative ou des études préalables.
    Renforcer l’approche agropole initiée par le département de tutelle du PCDA, qui permet de
     concentrer les activités dans une zone géographique délimitée, en vue d’accroître la densité
     des entreprises à la surface, de réduire le coût d’opération, de mutualiser certains coûts et de
     développer les similitudes et complémentarités qui contribuent à l’émergence des relations
     (formelles, informelles, matérielles, immatérielles, marchandes et non marchandes)
     d’intensité plus ou moins forte induite par une proximité physique, institutionnelle, sociale,
     professionnelle, culturelle construite par les bénéficiaires eux-mêmes au niveau des filières
     et des bassins de production.
    Inciter au développement des prestataires de service privés et publics dans les zones rurales
     concernées en contribuant au financement de leur installation et /ou leur renforcement.
    Renforcer le fonds de garantie et poursuivre son utilisation, qui réduit le risque pour les
     institutions de financement et les incite à prêter au secteur agricole et d’agro-business aux
     fins (a) des investissements à moyen et long terme ; (b) des financements à court terme
     (fonds de roulement, crédit de campagne, etc.) ; et (c) du refinancement des institutions de
     micro-finance par le banques.
    Poursuivre la mise en œuvre du mécanisme de financement (subvention à coût partagé et
     crédit) mis en place dans le cadre du PCDA et relire le manuel d’opération de la subvention
     de façon que la base de son calcul ne soit plus le coût de l’investissement mais plutôt, le coût
     du plan d’affaires.
    Faciliter l’accès au crédit à travers (a) les            Partenariats productifs (‘alliances
     productives’) entre les acteurs des différents maillons des chaînes de valeurs, (b) le ‘Contract
     farming’/ noyau de production centrale avec petits producteurs organisés, qui permet par le
     biais du noyau central de production en régie, d’obtenir une production minimale pour
     assurer la rentabilité des opérations de transformation ; (c) l’Agro-entreprises leader
     capables de montrer la voie aux entreprises nouvelles en développement ; (d) le grappes ou
     réseau de proximité des acteurs qui leur permet de rentabiliser la logistique de collecte et de
     commercialisation notamment pour des animaux embouchés, le lait, les produits maraîchers.
    Déterminer le montant de subvention en fonction des maillons de filières et adapter l’appui
     conseil technique, en gestion de la qualité et en gestion comptable et financière aux besoins
     de chaque niveau de développement de l’entreprise.
    Reconduire le principe de « faire-faire » par les opérateurs privés mais composés cette fois
     d’une firme ou ONG internationale et d’une firme ou ONG malienne pour deux régions,
     recrutés sur appel à concurrence ayant une autonomie de gestion et placés sous la supervision
     de l’UCP et évaluer périodiquement leurs performances ; cet arrangement institutionnel


                                                72 
      permettra de diminuer le nombre d’interlocuteurs de l’UCP et donc des partenaires à suivre,
      de réduire les coûts, de développer les interrelations et interactions entre les parties
      prenantes, de valoriser l’expérience acquise par les Maliens qui connaissent mieux le terrain
      que certains experts internationaux recrutés.
     Renforcer les capacités des institutions de financement à adapter les produits financiers aux
      besoins des acteurs des filières agricoles, à promouvoir les nouveaux produits financiers
      (tierce détention sur les oignons/ échalotes et la pomme de terre en utilisant les pôles de
      commercialisation de Sikasso et de Niono, le Leasing /crédit-bail pour le financement des
      véhicules et engins d’entreprises de moyenne et grande taille, l’assurance agricole
      notamment l’assurance climatique couvrant les déficits pluviométriques et l’assurance
      indicielle garantissant contre certains autres risques auxquels est soumise la production
      agricole, et à réaliser des simulations économiques et financières sur les entreprises qu’elles
      envisagent de financer, le crédit long terme avec différé d’amortissement pour accompagner
      la mise en place de nouvelles plantations avec entrée en production différée de plus de deux
      années), en leur apportant une assistance technique générale pour l’accompagnement
      opérationnel des PME agricoles, en les soutenant pour la connaissance des activités
      agricoles, la gestion des risques agricole et la préparation/ évaluation des business plans des
      sous-projets agricoles reposant sur les RTE et les Kits du PCDA.
     Engager des actions de promotion de l’entreprise rurale, du métier d’entrepreneur rural et
      de ses produits. En lien avec le besoin de revaloriser ces métiers et ces produits afin de les
      rendre plus attractives, des stratégies de communication décentralisée, s’appuyant sur les
      Collectivités Territoriales et/ou les organisations professionnelles des filières, pourront être
      définies et mises en œuvre par ces organismes. Elles auront pour objectifs de valoriser les
      métiers d’entrepreneur dans des filières agro-sylvo-pastorales.
     Accroître les financements du secteur en réallouant des ressources entre les sous secteurs du
      développement rural, de façon à augmenter progressivement la part de la promotion de
      l’entreprises rurale, en mobilisant plus et /ou en orientant mieux l’allocation des ressources
      extérieures et en explorant la piste de la fiscalité ou celle de prélèvement des recettes
      spécifiques sur les flux des biens et des services dans les filières agro-sylvo-pastorales. Des
      taxes et des impôts levés ainsi que les prélèvements peuvent ensuite être reversés au
      financement des entreprises rurales.
     Appuyer la création d’une agence nationale de promotion de l’entreprise rurale. Son
      fonctionnement et ses interventions peuvent être financés à partir : (i) de recettes spécifiques
      prélevées sur les flux des biens et des services dans les filières agro-sylvo-pastorales, (ii) de
      crédits budgétaires programmés pour le développement rural dans les différents
      départements ministériels compétents (Développement rural, Environnement et
      Assainissement, Commerce et Industries). Il conviendrait à cet effet, d’aménager la
      programmation budgétaire et le plan de la promotion de l’entreprise rurale et de spécialiser
      dès la programmation du budget 2016, les crédits par destination en considérant, lorsque
      nécessaire, ceux destinés à l’entreprise rurale comme une unité fonctionnelle au budget.
      Pour des questions de flexibilité, la gestion de l’agence devra s’affranchir en partie du droit
      public et relever du droit privé. Il pourra s’agir d’une société anonyme avec pour principal
      actionnaire les chambres consulaires, éventuellement d’une société d’économie mixte ou
      d’une association sans but lucratif (ASBL).
