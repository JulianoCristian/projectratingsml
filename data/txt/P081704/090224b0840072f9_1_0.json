"Ratings for the Agriculture\n            Competitiveness and Diversification Project for Mali were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: contracting a private service\n            provider with experience and expertise in the sector to\n            implement project activities is the best approach in\n            countries or regions with limited capacities. This project\n            relied on the private sector and nongovernmental\n            organizations for executing project activities that reduced\n            the burden on the PCU. Hiring a single lead contractor,\n            charged with hiring and supervising the necessary experts\n            for the job to be done, can bring about the desired outcome.\n            It is necessary to include both investment and operating\n            costs in business plans, which provides a fuller picture of\n            resources needed to finance proposals prepared by\n            beneficiaries. In addition to demonstration, dissemination,\n            and adoption of innovative technologies, projects with\n            support to value chains should include an incentive\n            mechanism, preferably with grant or technical assistance to\n            encourage developers to acquire and adapt innovative\n            technologies and techniques promoted by the project. This\n            project promoted appropriate technologies but these projects\n            were adopted because of the grant mechanism the project\n            provided. The dividend from reducing post-harvest loss,\n            improvement in conservation, processing and packaging is\n            very substantial that sufficient resources should be\n            allocated early in project design. A corollary point to this\n            is that projects should actively promote to the private\n            sector the need for investing in these areas that have a\n            huge return."}, "docdt": "2015-12-15T01:54:01Z"}
