 Project Development Objectives

  Agricultural Competitiveness and Diversification Project (P081704)
  Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
  The project aims at fostering improvements in the performances of supply chains for a range of agricultural and livestock products, for which
  Mali has strong comparative advantage The proposed investment is expected to reinforce the competitiveness of both traditional (cotton, rice)
  and non-traditional (fruit, horticulture products, oil seeds, arabic gum, cashews, etc.) agricultural crops through targeted investment to remove
  critical constraints, improve productivity and efficiency and build organizational and institutional capacities, both private and public, along the
  supply chains. In the long run, the project should contribute to increasing and diversifying rural household incomes and economic opportunities.
  It supports the development of a vibrant and diversified commercial agriculture as a means to move away from subsistence agriculture, which is
  often synonymous to poverty for a majority of rural households.


  Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?

 Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The original project was closed on April 30, 2014 with major results reached with a disbursement rate of 99.99%.The additional Financing
 will close on June 30, 2015 with also major results reached. The disbursment rate is as today June 25, 2015 93%.
 Tthe remaining funds will be disbursed during the grace period.
 The PDO indicators are reached or surpassed :
 1.          On April 30, 2015 volume and marketed value of mango, shallots/onion, patatoes increased respectively by 113 %, 120%, 118% , and 113
             %, 120% and 128% compared to the objectives ( original+additional financing).
 2.          Five out of six targetted V/Cs (mango, shallots/oinons, patatoe, livestock, papaya) value chains are improved meaning that the crirical points
             have been adressed successfully. The Producers organization of the sixth (Banana) was set up.
 The Project components have also reached or surpassed the intermediate results :
 The component (1) : Demonstration and dissemination of irrigation, post-harvest and value adding technologies has delivered 26 RTE validated by the
 National Research Department (IER) out of 24 planned ( farm budgets) translated on 17 enterprises models non planned (KITS); 4 national
 Interprofessional Associations (IPA) and one regional IPAs are set up; (iv) 612 sub-projects linked to the selected V/Cs and relative to the prepared
 enterprises models have been funded for a total amount of FCFA 5.7 (USD 9.7 Million) and for matching grant contribution of FCFA 4,7 billion (USD 8
 Million)
 The components (2): Improvement of performances of agricultural supply chains has delivered on the improvement of the value chains thanks to the
 preparation of sector knowledge ( V/Cs Competitiveness Plans etc.), better market information and food safety quality program ( GLOBAL/Eurogap).
 These results contributed mainly to the incease of the volume and the value of marketed production.
 The component (3): Access to Financing permitted to: (i) re-inter the targeted V/Cs to the banking system thanks to the improvement of the V/Cs,
 setting up a modest guaranty fund that permit to share the risk ( FCFA 896 million of granted credits reimbursed at 96% against 90 % planned on the
 initial project and 95 % on the additional financing).
 The component (4) Market-oriented infrastructure delivered 1101 km of rural roads and 15 commercial infrastructure ( among them four modern
 export platform for mango (2), shallots/onions and potatoes) out of 18 planned because 2 infrasstructure were alreaded under construction by other
 donors and of the necessity to consolidate the main export infarstructure of Sikasso and Niono. of these among them four modern export platform for
 mango (2), shallots/onions and potatoes. Two of the no realized infrastructure was already taken in charge by other donors.The amount of the no
 realizaed infasrtructure wa used on the consolidation of the export platform of Bamako, Sikasso and Niono.
 The bid of private management of the commercial infrastructure was launched but it needs to be re-launched because of few bidders. This
 management is right now taken in charge by the interprofessions.
 The main targeted challenges on the previous ISR are reached: the impact study and the horticulture strategy are delivered; the investor forum has
 been held with successful results. This investor forum constitutes for the project a good exit door because of successful link made between the
 promoters,the private investors and the commercial banks. A technical proposal has been proposed for a follow up operation.
