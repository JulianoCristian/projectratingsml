 Project Development Objectives

  Agricultural Competitiveness and Diversification Project (P081704)
  Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
  The project aims at fostering improvements in the performances of supply chains for a range of agricultural and livestock products, for which
  Mali has strong comparative advantage The proposed investment is expected to reinforce the competitiveness of both traditional (cotton, rice)
  and non-traditional (fruit, horticulture products, oil seeds, arabic gum, cashews, etc.) agricultural crops through targeted investment to remove
  critical constraints, improve productivity and efficiency and build organizational and institutional capacities, both private and public, along the
  supply chains. In the long run, the project should contribute to increasing and diversifying rural household incomes and economic opportunities.
  It supports the development of a vibrant and diversified commercial agriculture as a means to move away from subsistence agriculture, which is
  often synonymous to poverty for a majority of rural households.


  Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?

 Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The original project is in the process of achieving its main outcomes and results: (i) the volume and value of the products marketed for the three main
 value chains (mango, shallot / onion and potato) are near achieving the project expected results (respectively 104%, 93%, 95%; and 107, 90%, 96%);
 (ii) 301 micro, small and medium size enterprises are implemented ; (iii) 4 national Interprofessional Associations (IPA) and one regional IPAs are set
 up; (iv) the 26 RTE (farm budgets) out of 25 planned are validated by the National Research Department (IER).

 This additional Financing of the project was effective on October 29, 2013. This mission is the first implementation support mission the first one of the
 Additional Financing occurring 6 months after the effectiveness of the project.
 At the time of the mission the mobilization of the project implementing operators was completed. All the dated covenants have been fulfilled and the
 notification of this fulfillment was sent to the the Bank.

 During this reviewed period the project continued implementing a minimal program thanks to the recruitment of individual consultants of the the same
 local staff working for the previous operators.
 The space of implementation of the project was rather slower than usual because of the minimal program ( insufficiency of human resources due to
 the end of the original project and the mobilization time of the operators)
 The Client and the Bank agree on the public disclosure of the project status.
