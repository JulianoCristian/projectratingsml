                         Project Development Objectives
                         Agricultural Competitiveness and Diversification Project (P081704)
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The project aims at fostering improvements in the performances of supply chains for a range of agricultural and livestock products, for which Mali has strong
                         comparative advantage The proposed investment is expected to reinforce the competitiveness of both traditional (cotton, rice) and non-traditional (fruit, horticulture
                         products, oil seeds, arabic gum, cashews, etc.) agricultural crops through targeted investment to remove critical constraints, improve productivity and efficiency and
                         build organizational and institutional capacities, both private and public, along the supply chains. In the long run, the project should contribute to increasing and
                         diversifying rural household incomes and economic opportunities. It supports the development of a vibrant and diversified commercial agriculture as a means to move
                         away from subsistence agriculture, which is often synonymous to poverty for a majority of rural households.
