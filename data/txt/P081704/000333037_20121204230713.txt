7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The project aims at fostering improvements in the performances of supply chains for a range of agricultural
and livestock products, for which Mali has strong comparative advantage The proposed investment is
expected to reinforce the competitiveness of both traditional (cotton, rice) and non-traditional (fruit,
horticulture products, oil seeds, arabic gum, cashews, etc.) agricultural crops through targeted investment
to remove critical constraints, improve productivity and efficiency and build organizational and
institutional capacities, both private and public, along the supply chains. In the long run, the project should
contribute to increasing and diversifying rural household incomes and economic opportunities. It supports
the development of a vibrant and diversified commercial agriculture as a means to move away from
subsistence agriculture, which is often synonymous to poverty for a majority of rural households.
