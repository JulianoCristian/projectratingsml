and livestock products for which Mali has\n            strong comparative advantage. The Additional Financing (AF)\n            will help finance the costs associated with the scaling up\n            of ACDP activities, with a view to securing a higher level\n            of Development Objective (DO) achievements over an\n            additional two-year project implementation period. The AF\n            will enhance the project impact by expanding its coverage to\n            a larger group of emerging market oriented to very small\n            enterprises and Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in\n            project-targeted agriculture and livestock Value Chains\n            (V/Cs). The AF focus will be on: 1) the Innovation and\n            Investment Fund (IIF), a recipient operated financial credit\n            line which, by extending additional matching grants for\n            investment subprojects, will serve to disseminate\n            innovations already demonstrated by the project; 2)\n            continued building and strengthening of V/C\n            Inter-Professional Organizations (IPOs); 3) facilitation of\n            access to funding by the very small enterprises and SMEs\n            supported by the project; and 4) completion and expansion of\n            the commercial infrastructure program."}, "docdt": "2013-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
