                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The project aims at fostering improvements in the performances of supply chains for a range of agricultural and livestock products, for which Mali has strong
                         comparative advantage The proposed investment is expected to reinforce the competitiveness of both traditional (cotton, rice) and non-traditional (fruit, horticulture
                         products, oil seeds, arabic gum, cashews, etc.) agricultural crops through targeted investment to remove critical constraints, improve productivity and efficiency and
                         build organizational and institutional capacities, both private and public, along the supply chains. In the long run, the project should contribute to increasing and
                         diversifying rural household incomes and economic opportunities. It supports the development of a vibrant and diversified commercial agriculture as a means to move
                         away from subsistence agriculture, which is often synonymous to poverty for a majority of rural households.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is in the process of achieving its main outcomes and results: (i) the volume and value of the products marketed for the three main value chains (mango, shallot / onion
                         and potato) are near achieving the project expected results (respectively 104%, 93%, 95%; and 107, 90%, 96%); (ii) 271 micro, small and medium size enterprises are implemented ;
                         (iii) 3 national Interprofessional Associations (IPA) are set up ; (iv) the 24 planned RTE (farm budgets) are validated by the National Research Department (IER).

                         Despite Financial constraints, due to the suspension of disbursement following the military coup on March 22, 2012, the project continued to implement the main activities. The
                         authorization of the Ministry of Agriculture to mobilize the guaranty fund permitted to (i) start works on the Sikasso cold infrastructure, the most important infrastructure in reaching the
                         project results; and (ii) continue preparing and implementing the sub-projects. The project was able to undertake the usual follow-up on the campaign of the main value chains
                         (mango, shallot/onion, potatoes). It finalized the sets of technical specifications of the value chains and confirmed the business intelligence findings on these value chains. Moreover,
                         the 3 South African dryers were delivered, installed and tested. This new equipment will multiply the production of dried mango and the agreement concluded with SA companies will
                         permit to introduce this dried mango in conventional market versus solidarity market.
                         It is important to notice, however, that the project activities have been reduced for 50% during the suspension period due to a lack of funds. This reduced technical programs were
                         executed between April and December 2012. The disbursement re-started on September 15, 2012.
                         The preparation of the additional financing re-started; the concept memo was approved on November 20, 2012. The AF appraisal/negotiations mission is planned for early January.
