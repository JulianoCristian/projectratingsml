Multipurpose\n            Water Project were to remove the constraints on industrial\n            and agricultural expansion in Kosovo province and also to\n            provide incidental benefits by way of quickly-available\n            reserves of hydro-power and improved supplies of water for\n            human consumption in the communities in the area. The\n            project was executed as planned, except for the irrigation\n            component which had been appraised on the basis of\n            inadequately detailed topographical information and a\n            reconnaissance soil survey. The appraisal of the project by\n            Bank staff appears to have been comprehensive and\n            painstaking, except for the irrigation component which was\n            based on inadequate topographic information, more accurate\n            data not being available. Some of the lessons learned from\n            the project included: (a) notwithstanding the large sunk\n            investment and still unused capacity represented by the\n            project, this was a worthwhile investment and will provide\n            substantial long-term benefits; (b) While some of the delays\n            and frustration in project implementation could not have\n            been foreseen, the time needed to bring in land\n            consolidation with all its socio-political problems was\n            greatly under-estimated at appraisal; and appraisal should\n            only have taken place after final design had been\n            established; and (c) institutional development has been\n            satisfactory; ILE is a well-run entity, ready to tackle the\n            follow-on Lepenac River project."}, "docdt": "1986-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
