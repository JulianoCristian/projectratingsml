PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
IBAR MULTIPURPOSE WATER PROJECT
(LOAN 777-YU)
PREFACE
This report presents the results of a performance audit of the Ibar
Multipurpose Water Project (Ln. 777-YU), for which a loan of US$45 million
was made to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, for on-lending to
the Ibar-Lepenac Enterprise (ILE) which would implement the project.   The
loan was approved in June 1971, but did not become effective until May 1972,
because of the need to obtain ratification of subsidiary agreements by the
numerous organizations concerned.
The original closing date of December 31, 1976 was postponed three
times to December 31, 1981, because of delays arising, first from *e
bankruptcy and withdrawal of contractors responsible for the water trans-
mission network, with a three year delay in rebidding, and the inordinately
long time spent in developing land consolidation for the irrigation compo-
nenm.   Final disbursement was made on January 14, 1982, though physical
construction continued until 1984.1/
This Project Performance Audit Report comprises an Evaluation
Summary and a Project Performance Audit Memorandum (PPAN), prepared by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED); and a Project Completion Report (PCR)
prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa Regional Office In May
1985, based inter alia on the findings of a project completion mission to
Yugoslavia in February 1985. OED has reviewed the PCR, the Bank files, the
legal documents, Appraisal and President's Reports and the transcripts of the
meeting of the Executive Directors when the loan was approved.   An audit
mission visited lugoslavia in January 1986 and discussed the project with
officials of ILE.
The audit finds the PCR to be comprehensive, factual and candid,
and concurs with its fitdings.
Following OED procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the
Borrower and the Ibar-Lepenac Enterprise for comments.   Comments received
from Ibar-Lepenac have been reproduced as Attachment A to the report.
1/   Completion of land consolidation will not be achieved until 1990.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
IBAR MULTIPURPOSE WATER PROJECT
(LOAN 777-YU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
I.        Loan 777-YU for US$45 million was the first attempt in Yugoslavia
to provide firaucing for comprehensive water resource development for an
entire region. The region concerned, Kosovo Province, is one of the poorest
in Yugoslavia, but could expand agricultural ead Industrial output if larger
and more assured supplies of water could be developed (PPAM, para. 1).
Project
ii.       The project, estimated to cost US$93.3 million excluding interest
during construction, was designed to harness the Ibar River by means of a dam
and storage reservoir, a hydroelectric generating station and a system of
tunnels and canals to transport the water so impounded to two major indus-
trial centers, to municipal water supply systems and to a new irrigation net-
work serving 30,000 ha of agricultuial land, together with ancillary
facilities (pumping station, feeder roads and on-farm development services,
PPAM, para. 2).   The project also  included  training for the staff of
Ibar-Lepenac Enterprise (ILE), the implementing agency, and a number of
project-related studies.
Objectives
iii.      The objectives of the project were to remove the constraints on
ind:;strial and agricultural expansion in Kosovo province and also to provide
incidental benefits by way of quickly-available reserves of hydro-power and
improved supplies of water for human consumption in the communities in the
area (PCR, para. 2.03).
Implementation and Experience
iv.       The  physical  construction  of  the  project  was  satisfactorily
executed, though with severe delays in respect of two components--the water
conveyance system, where one contractor went bankrupt and another abandoned
the job, causing a three-year delay in finalizing a new contract and complet-
ing the works; and the irrigation system, where slow execution of civil works
and the delays caused by a multitude of administrative, legal and socio-
political problems in land consolidation meant that this development will not
be fully completed until 1990 and only then for two-thirds of the area
originally planned (PCR, para. 3.08 and PPAM, para. 7). Project costs showed
an overrun of 475Z in dinars, but of 119% in US$ terms (PCR, para. 3.11).



vi -
v.        Because of the delays in completion of the irrigation component,
and the economic recession which has held up the industrial expansion that
was intended to take large quantities of water, ILE's water sales have fallen
far short of estimates, and the enterprise is having to be subsidized by the
Federal Government in payment of debt service (PCR, para. 5.05).
vi.       Subject to the financial constraints just mentioned, the physical
benefits of the project can be sustained and increased. The project has also
provided non-revenue earning benefits in the form of flood prevention and
erosion control, particularly in 1979 when flood damages would have been
catastrophic in the absence of the project (PCR, para. 8.02[b]).
Findings & Lessons
vii.      The PPAM concurs with the findingo and comments of the PCR:
(a) notwithstanding the large sunk investment and still unused capacity
represented by the project, this was a worthwhile investment and
will provide substantial long-term benefits (PCR, para. 8.1);
(b) While some of the delays and frustration in project implementation
could not have been foreseen, the time needed to bring in land
consolidation with all its socio-political problems was greatly
under-estimated at appraisal; and appraisal should only have taken
place after final design had been established (PCR, para. 9.2); and
(c) institutional development has been satisfactory; ILE is a well-run
entity, ready to tackle the foAlow-on Lepenac River project (PCR,
para. 9.1).

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
IBAR MULTIPURPOSE WATER PROJECT
(LOAN 777-YU)
I. PROJECT SUMMARY
The Project
1.        The  Ibar  Multipurpose  Water  Project  (Loan  777-YU)  signed  on
June 30, 1971, represented the first attempt in Yugoslavia to provide compre-
hensive development of water resources for an entire region.   The region
concerned, Kosovo Province, is the least developed region of Yugoslavia with
average per capita income of only about one-third of the national average
(PCR, para. 1.01).  The principal opportunities for economic development open
to the province lay in improving agricultural output and in expansion of
industries; the two main industrial centers comprised a major producer and
exporter of lead, zinc, fertilizer and chemicals, and a group of coal, gas
and thermal power plants serving the steel industry at Skopje in Macedonia.
However, expansion of both industry and agriculture was constrained by lack
of water; and a master plan was daveloped to harness the two main rivers in
Kosovo, the Ibar and the Lepenac, to provide water for industry, municipali-
ties, irrigation and hydropower generation.
2.        The project, appraised in 1970, covered the first phase of the
master plan, the Ibar scheme.  Its components included a rockfill dam a A a
350 million m3 storage reservoir, a regulatory dam, a 34 my hydroelectric
plant and 147 km of water conveyance works (canals, tunnels, syphons and
aqueducts); together with pumping stations and works to irrigate and drain
30,000 ha of agricultural land, feeder roads, on-farm development and other
ancillary works (PCR, para. 2.04). The power plant In the project, though
very small, was considered a desirable adjunct as a quickly available stand-
by and peaking reserve; for example, the gasification plant in the area might
have to shut down for two days if it suffered a cut of more than five minutes
in its normal power supply.
3.        Total cost was estimated at US$93.3 millionl/ excluding capital-
ized  interest during  construction.    Foreign  exchange  requirements  were
estimated at US$23 million (322) but the Bank agreed to finance 42% of total
cost, plus US$6.2 million interest during construction, a total of USS45
million.   The balance of cost would be financed by Ibar-Lepenac Enterprise
(ILE), the organization founded to execute the project, with the help of
local loans, its own internal cash generation, and a small contribution from
a downstream hydro enterprise.
1/   Additional works, outside the Bank-financed scheme, amounted to US$8.9
million (erosion and flood control works, etc.).



- 2 -
4.        Project preparation seems to have been comprehensive, and numerous
requirements were insisted on by the Bank by way of safeguards: revisior of
the ongoing levee construction to reflect changes in the hydrological situa-
tion because of the dam, the need for dam operating rules, future maintenance
of feeder roads, studies on irrigation charges, land classification, consoli-
dation and drainage, studies for utilization of urban water, firm contracts
for sale of power and water, and studies to prevent dowr.stream pollution by
industry were all agreed to be necessary (PCR, 2.05 and SAR).
Project Execution
5.        The project was executed as planned, except for the irrigation
component which had been appraised on the basis of inadequately detailed
topographical information and a reconnaissance soil survey (PCR, para.
3.02). The detailed land classification study carried out under the project,
however, showed that only about two-thirds of the area originally estimated
to be available for irrigation would in fact be suitable--the remainder being
ruled out by reason of urban and industrial encroachment, or unsuitable soil
conditions (PCR, para. 3.03). Even then, of this reduced area of 20,100 ha,
the Bank had doubts about an area of 5620 ha on the grounds of high pumping
cost and poor soil, but a further study justified both economic viability and
water availability (PCR, paras. 3.05-3.06). It was also found necessary, on
consideration of cost, to irrigate the entire area by sprinklers rather than
surface irrigation, as against only 30% sprinklers planned at appraisal (PCR,
paras. 4.06-4.07).
6.        The audit mission inspected the physical works and found them to be
well-designed and competently constructed.   They also appeared to be well-
maintained and efficiently operated.
Time Overruns
7.        Over and above the usual delays caused by procedural matters, and
by insufficiently advanced studies and designs for the dam and canals (PCR,
para. 3.08)2/, two major sources of delay arose, which combined to set the
project completion back by some ten years. The first was the collapse of the
contracts for construction of the tunnels and canal; one contractor went
bankrupt and the other abandoned the work, with a consequent three-year delay
in  rebidding  (PCR,  para.  3.08).    This  could not  reasonably  have  been
foreseen; but the other delay might well have been anticipated, namely the
time required to introduce land consolidation or redistribution, and to gain
acceptance by farmers. At the outset, the Provincial Government made little
progress in fulfilling its responsibilities under the Project Agreement, in
the introduction of land consolidation and agricultural extension services;
it had in fact tried to pass these responsibilities to ILE.   Continuing
delays, compounded by the lack of an overall coordinating authority, caused
the Bank finally to make presentation of the Metohija Multipurpose Project
(Ln. 1360-YU, February 1977) to the Board conditional on definite progress in
2/ Yet the SAR claimed that designs had already been completed for the dam
and multipurpose water conduits (para. 3.08).



- 3 -
this matter; approval of additional irrigation tenders was also held up
pending such progress (PCR, Annex II). Eventually, the scheme got underway,
but the first land consolidation did not take place until 1984, and irriga-
tion (apart from some trial schemes) not until 1985-ten years later than
originally forecast.   The land consolidation law is now in force for the
whole province and it is understood that farmers are well satisfied with the
results achieved by the project.
Project Costs
8.        Total project costs came out at nearly six times the appraisal
estimate (Din 8048 million, as against Din 1400 million), reflecting the very
high inflation in Yugoslavia during the long period of project implementa-
tion.   In US$, the cost overrun was 119% (US$204 million, compared with
US$93.3 million estimated at appraisal). The largest absolute increase was
on the water conveyance systems, accounting for US$108 million of the total
overrun, no doubt attributable to the costs of having to rebid the works
abandoned by the defaulting contractors. The largest relative overrun was in
respect of land acquisition (some fourteen times the appraisal estimate, PCR,
Annex 2). ILE blames this on poor estimating, which did not allow for sever-
ance compensation, loss of access and replacement of the catchbent basin;
moreover, since the irrigation network was laid before land consolidation,
compensation had to be paid to many farmers, sometimes for three years.
Institutional Performance
9.        The audit found, during its visit to ILE, no reason to disagree
with the PCRts assertion that ILK has matured into a capable antd efficient
organization (PCR, para. 3.12).
Sales and Financial Performance
10.       The appraisal report estimated that as from the first year of
operation of the project (1977) ILE would be able to earn a rate of return of
7X - 8% annually on net fixed assets in service, and these targets were
embodied in loan conditions. In the event, ILK had no revenues at all until
1981, and then only from electricity generation; sales of water did not begin
until 1983 (1985 for irrigation water), and have fallen far below the volumes
estimated.   The sales for 1985, compared with appraisal estimates for that
year were:
Appraisal Estimate      Actual /a
Agricultural Water (million m3)        95.0               8.4
Industrial Water (million m3)         278.3              70.1
Municipal Water (million m3)            6.1               8.7
Electricity (Gwh)                      95.0              50.6
/a    These statistics replace the re-estimate for 1985 in the
PCR (Annex 4).



- 4 -
11.       On this basis, though ILE's 1985 accounts are not yet available,
the operating surplus of Din 1,068 million forecast for 1985 (PCR, Annex 5)
will not have materialized.   If it had, there would have been a rate of
return of over 10% on the net fixed assets in the balance sheet (Din 9,911
million).  However, it is not clear that these have been revalued to reflect
local inflation and exchange rate movements on assets financed by foreign
loans; it is noteworthy that the Bank loan appears in ILE's projected 1985
balance sheet at the minuscule amount of Din 107 million (about US$350,000 at
present exchange rates); it is understood that this is due to a provision of
Yugoslav accounting law whereby future liabilities under foreign loans can be
written off against the surplus arising from fixed asset revaluation, until
they fall due for payment.  In any case, the Bank loan is being serviced by
the Federal Government, and it is understood that the Government is budgeting
to subsidize ILE up to the year 2000, taking into account the soaring cost of
deb,. service in currencies which have appreciated so markedly against the
dinar since the funds were disbursed.
12.       The reasons why ILE's revenues have fallen so far sbort of expecta-
tions are fairly obvious. This was a large and indivisible project, and some
70% of the capacity of the system was earmarked for industrial use,
represented by two major enterprises. Thus, in a sense, ILE is a captive of
its two biggest customers; because of the economic recession, these
industries did not embark on expansion programs planned at the time of
appraisal. It will therefore likely be several years before revenues begin
to accrue at the hoped for levels.   The Bank sought to guard against this
eventuality by requiring "take-or-pay" contracts with industry, but obviously
these are not being applied in the manner anticipated. Irrigation, likewise,
will not reach its peak until 1990.  Supplies to municipalities, on the other
hand, are exceeding expectations,2/ and helping to remedy deficiencies in
urban water systems in the area, where polluted supplies are prevalent.
Economic Evaluation
13.       While financial results have been comparatively unremunerative as
yet, the long-term benefits are likely to be substantial. In addition, the
project has produced social and economic benefits not reflected in revenues,
in particullar the damage averted from the 1979 floods, quantified at Din 875
million in 1971 prices (PCR, para. 8.2[b]).  ILE in fact contends that the
project may be said to have justified itself by this achievement alone, and
by the water afforded to farmers during the 1985 drought.  Based on projec-
tions of future sales, which may or may not prove over optimistic, the PCR
recalculates the internal economic rate of return as 13% with which the audit
agrees (compared with 15.6% at appraisal, PCR, para. 8.4); this includes the
value of the flood damage averted, without which the rate of return would be
about 8%.
3/   The Bank has also developed a municipal water supply project in Kosovo
Province (Loan 2055-YU).



-5-
Bank Performance
14.       The appraisal of the project by Bank staff appears to have been
comprehensive and painstaking, except for the irrigation component which was
based on inadequate topographic information, more accurate data not being
available (PCR, para. 3.02). No fewer than eleven persons had a part in the
appraisal,  reflecting  the  project's  complexity.    Field  supervision was
equally intensive, averaging two missions a year for ten years and reaching a
peak of four missions in 1977. From FY76 through FY81, total average annual
supervision was 16.4 staff weeks, well exceeding Bank averages. Towards the
end, however, there was some concern felt by agriculture staff that insuffi-
cient attention was being paid to the water supply and overall financial
aspects of  Lhe project.   The prcjected time schedule of five years for
project execution, even discounting unforeseeable delays, was far too
optimistic (PCR, para. 3.08).
15.       ILE staff speak highly of the advice and assistance afforded by
Bank missions, and express a wish to receive the same high standard of
assistance for the Lepenac Project (the second portion of the Master Plan for
River Basin Development).
{I. CONCLUSIONS
16.       Before loan approval, doubts were expressed about this project,
from both within and without the Bank to the effect that irrigation benefits
were overestimated, that water demand estimates were too high, that it would
never earn a profit and would consume a disproportionate share of resources.
Up to the present, some or all of these criticisms might be hard to refute.
It is also true that, notwithstanding the lengthy time overrun, the project
is still in some respects premature, and represents a very large sunk cost.
Yet once commenced, there was little option but to go on; the project could
not be scaled down or phased to any extent. No one could have foreseen the
economic depression which has curtailed industrial expansion or indeed the
problems with the tunnel contractors, or the depreciation of the dinar which
has undermined ILE's finances.   Despite the considerable unused capacity
still existing, and the large amount of capital locked up in the project, the
audit feels that this was still a worthwhile investment; 92% of the cost has
been financed by local contributions, an indication of the value placed on
the scheme by local taxpayers and investors.
17.       The objectives of the project were to develop and harness the water
resources in the Northern Kosovo plain, as a means toward accelerating
economic development of that underdeveloped region. The resources have been
effectively harnessed, achieving the first objective and lifting the
restrictions on economic development caused by limited available water,
besides providing substantial additional benefits in flood protection and
erosion control. To this extent, the project was successful; but its full
benefits will not materialize until industry in the area begins once again to
expand, and having regard to the type of industry and the lead-time required
for construction, the major expansion in water demand cannot occur in the
next several years.

IBAR MULTIPURPOSE WATER PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
Background Data
1.01      The Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo, in which the project is
located, is the least developed region of Yugoslavia in which the average per
capita income amounts to only US$600 per year or about one third of the
national average (1983). Its population growth rate of 2.82 is about double
the national rate. The main opportunities for economic growth are expansion
of mineral based industries and increased agricultural output, both of which
were constrained by the lack of an appropriate water supply. The Provincial
Government therefore initiated in the nineteen sixties engineering studies to
determine the optimum development of the available water resources. The
result of these studies was a master plan to develop the principal rivers in
the region, Ibar and Lepenac, to provide water for industry, communities,
irrigation and power generation.
The Proiect
1.02      The Ibar Multipurpose Water Project is the first phase of the
Province's water resource development plan and provides sufficient water for
industrial expansion until 1995 and for irrigating about 21,000 ha.
Additional benefits of the project include the provision of a convenient
source of potable water for several communities, improving the public health
in the region, flood protection in the Ibar valley downstream of the Gazivode
Dam and power generation. The main physical components of the project include
two dams, a 34 megawatt hydroelectric plant, 135 km of main water conduits,
two pumping stations, a 21,000 ha irrigation and drainage scheme and related
feeder roads.
Borrower and Executing Agency
1.03      The borrower was the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY)
which onlent the proceeds of the loan to the Ibar-Lepenac Enterprise (ILE).
This enterprise was created in 1967 specifically to undertake the development
of the Ibar and Lepenac river systems and has implemented the project.
Project Financing
1.04      The Bank loan of US$45.0 million has financed US$40.6 million or 202
of the project cost (US$204.0 million) and US$4.4 million for interest during
construction. The remaining financing was covered by loans from the "Federal
Fund for Underdeveloped Republics" channeled through the Braka Kosova, grants
from both the Federal and Provincial Governments, and a small grant from the
Djerap Enterprise towards the construction of the Gazivode Dam.



-8-
Bank Role in the Sector
1.05      Bank involvement in the water supply and sewerage sector in
Yugoslavia was initiated in 1971 and has continued through the execution of
nine projects. lhe Bank has actively assisted the Borrower in project
development and implementation, as well as in the establishment of new
institutions and appropriate financial strategies. Lending in the sector has
been in accordance with Bank country policy focusing on the less developed
regions and removing water supply constraints for sustained economic
development.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Project Origin
2.01      The main opportunities for economic growth in SAP Kosovo are in the
expansion of mineral-based industries and in increasing agricultural output,
both of which were constrained by a limited water supply. The Provincial
Government therefore commissioned consultants to prepare a water resource
study which resulted in a master plan for developing the major water resources
of the Kosovo plain. After the feasibility study became available, the
Federal Government requested a Bank loan of US$45.0 million to help finance
the Ibar Multipurpose Water Project, which was the first phase of the master
plan. The Bank was interested in, and encouraged the project because it was a
first attempt in Yugoslavia to resolve the problem of water resource
development for an entire region on a comprehensive basis.
Preparation and Appraisal
2.02      Following completion of the feasibility study and detailed design of
some of the Ibar project components by Yugoslav consultants a Bank
reconnaissance mission visited the Pristina area in April 1969. FAO/IBRD
cooperative program missions were in Yugoslavia in September 1969 and January
1970, to prepare the agricultural component of the project. After a
preappraisal mission of combined Bank and FAO staff in May 1970, the water
supply and irrigation components of the project were appraised in June 1970.
The power component was appraised in August 1970.
Prolect Obiective
2.03      The main objective of the project was to remove the restrictions put
on the economic development of the Kosovo province by the limited available
water supply, larticularly in the industrial and agricultural sectors, by
implementing the first phase of the long term development plan as conceived in
the master plan (para. 2.01). In particular, the project was to make 8.8
m3/s of water available to industries, 0.2 m3/s of water to communities,
and water for irrigation of 30,000 ha. In addition the project would also
generate 95 Gwh of electricity annually. Although the project was slightly
modified during implementation (see para. 3.02) and water demand has fallen



-9-
behind forecast because of a general slowdown in economic development, the
project objectives have been achieved. Substantial additional benefits of the
project are in the areas of flood protection and soil erosion control.
Pro ect Description
2.04      The main components of the project were:
(a) Gazivode rockfill dam and storage reservoir with capacity of 350
million m3;
(b) a 34 Mw hydroelectric plant;
(c) Pridvorica regulating dam, intake structure and compensation
basin;
(d) 147 km of main conduits (canals, tunnels, syphons and aqueducts)
for conveying untreated water to industries, communities and
irrigated areas;
(e) two main pumping stations;
(f) irrigation and drainage system serving 30,000 ha;
(g) feeder roads (about 91 km) and maintenance roads (about 633 km)
along irrigation canals and drains;
(h) on-farm development in the irrigated area (land-levelling, tile
drainage);
{i) soil erosion control works (hydraulic structures for training
the small torrential streams flowing intermittently as
tributaries to the Ibar River);
(j) telecommunications system for project operation;
(k) equipment for operation and maintenance of project facilities;
and
(1) training of ILE staff for project operation.
2.05      The project also included the following studies:
(a) a study for the purpose of preparing operating rules for the
storage reservoir included in the project to ensure optimum
allocation of the water stored;
(b) a land classification study of the farmland area of the project;



- 10 -
(c) a study to determine the economic viability of draining about
3500 ha of low-lying lands along the Sitnica River included in
the farmland area of the project;
(d) a study of charges for irrigation water supplied to the farmland
area of the project, taking into account the farmers' capacity
to pay; and
(e) a study of the methods of treating liquid wastes produced by two
industries, Kombinat Kosovo and Kombinat Trepca, in accordance
with river water quality standards acceptable to Kosovo.
2.06      Related project facilities not included in the Bank funded project
included:
(a) soil conservation works in the watershed above the project area,
to be undertaken by the Provincial Government;
(b) levees along the Sitnica River, to be undertaken by the
Provincial Government;
(c) transmission line from the hydroelectric station to the regional
power system, to be constructed by Kombinat Kosovo; and
(d) treatment and distribution systems to use the untreated supplies
of bulk water supplied by ILE to industries and communities in
the project area, to be undertaken by those water users.
2.07      Inputs required to ensure the realization of benefits in agriculture
included:
(a) maintenance of feeder roads;
(b) extension services;
(c) farm inputs (fertilizers, machinery services, etc.); and
(d) long-term credit for supplementary on-farm investments and
annual short-term production credit.
Loan Covenants and Conditions of Effectiveness
2.08      A Loan Agreement (Loan 777-YU) was entered into between the Bank and
SFR Yugoslavia (the Borrower), a Project Agreement between the Bank and SAP
Kosovo and the Ibar-Lepenac Enterprise (ILE), and a Lenders Agreement between
the Bank and Banka Kosova, Pristina was also signed.
2.09      The major covenants required:  (i) the Borrower to cause ILE to
execute the project; (ii) the Borrower to take all necessary measures to
enable SAP Kosovo and ILE to perform their obligations under the Project and



- 11 -
Subsidiary Loan Agreement; (iii) ILE to employ consultants for project
preparation and supervision and the carrying out of the studies included in
the project; (iv) after completion of, and agreement on the tariff study
included in the project Kosovo to guarantee ILE minimum revenue over the first
four years of operation; (v) ILE Xo cause the dams and power conduit included
in the project to be inspected every three years. (vi) Banka Kosova to provide
ILE with sufficient funds to carry out the project, including cost overruns;

to the Bank for project supervision;
(b) conclusion of purchase contracts for water between ILE and the
principal industrial consumers, Kombinat Kosovo and Kombinat
Trepca;
(c) conclusion of a contract between ILE and Kombinat Kosovo for the
construction of a power transmission line, operation of the
hydroelectric plant and purchase of power generated at Gazivode;
(d) conclusion of a loan agreement between ILE and Banka Kosova for
the provision of local funds necessary to complete the project,
including possible cost overruns;

Kosova and a Project Agreement;
(f) conclusion of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Federal
Government and ILE; and
(g) conclusion of a Grant Agreement between Djerdap and ILE.
2.11      The loan covenants were comprehensive, and adequately covered the
requirements for project implementation and subsequent operations. All
covenants were substantially complied with.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness and Start-Up
3.01 The loan became effective on May 31, 1972, almost a year after the
signing of the Loan Agreement on June 30, 1971. This delay was caused by
difficulties in obtaini-g agreement and in concluding the various subsidiary
and sales agreements (para. 2.10). This delay also affected project stUrt-up
which was also about a year late. The Loan and Project Agreements were



- 12 -
amended on April 25, 1973 to reflect changes due to the delays in
effectiveness and project start-up. Prequalification for the first contracts
for the construction of the diversion tunnel and the dams was advertised on
June 10, 1971. Actual works on the diversion tunnel started in May 1972.
Revisions
3.02 The project was basically executed as conceived except for the
irrigation component which had to be revised. At the time of appraisal, only
preliminary designs existed for the irrigation network based on preliminary
topographic information (1:50,000 and 1:10,000 maps), and a reconnaissance
soil survey carried out in 1961-1965. Using this information, the farm land
available for irrigation was estimated at 30,000 ha, and appraisal of the
irrigation component was carried out on this basis.
3.03 With the objective of verifying the size of the area suitable for
irrigation, the Loan Agreement required that a detailed land classification
study be carried out for the entire area. The study, which was conducted by
consultants, was found acceptable to the Bank in mid-1974. Subsequently,
final designs of the irrigation network were then mapped on a scale of
1:2,500, with the result that it was necessary to reduce the land area for
irrigation by 332 to 20,100 ha due to the following factors:
-i) improved topographic information, indica.ing that certain fields
would not be suitable for irrigation;
(ii) exclusion of areas on pedological grounds;
(iii) rapid and unrestricted growth of towns and villages in the project
area;
(iv) 'jajor expansion of industrial plant sites at Kosovska Mitrovica and
Obilic; and
(v) expansion of the lignite mining operations of Kombinat Kosovo near
Obilic.
3.04 In suimmary, the reduction in irrigated area was basically due to
inadequate project planning (based on very preliminary topographic and soils
information), followed by explosive and uncontrolled urban and industrial
growth in Kosovo. The revised irrigation network was subdivided into four
subsystems as follows:

Irrigated Area Subsystems

Ibar Field                     2,500                880
Kosovo Field I                20,800              6,300

Total                     30,000             20,100
1' Kosovo Fields I and II combined.
3.05     In mid-1976, the Bank raised two issues concerning the question of
irrigating or not the 5,620 ha of subsystem Drenica Field. The first involved
the possibility of inadequate water to supply users by 1985, and the second
involved the economic viability of irrigating Drenica Field given the high
cost of pumping (86 m), and the poorer soils prevailing in the area.
Consequently, the Bank recommended to ILE that no further construction proceed
on this subsystem until ILE had carefully reviewed water resource availabili'y
and the economic viability of this particular subsystem.
3.06     ILE, with the assistance of consultants, prepared revised cost
estimates and calculated returns from the project. Subsequent review and
analysis by the Bank demonstrated that Drenica Polje was economically viable
(ERR over 10X). The results of this analysis along with indication from the
project and Government authorities that the total requirement for irrigation,
amounting to 65 million m", could be considered guaranteed for the life of
the project, prompted the Bank to lift the construction embargo on this
subsystem.
3.07    The project's net cultivabie area increased 8% over the pre-project
situation (from 18,595 ha to 20,100 ha) due to reclamation of meadows and wet
areas, which previously were unsuitable for cultivation. Also, through the
process of land consolidation the overgrown borders between the small parcels
of land were eliminated and converted into useable cropland.
Implementation
3.08    The original implementation schedule grossly underestimated the time
necessary to construct the various components of the project and an eight year
implementation period as originally proposed by the Borrower would have been
more realistic than the Bank's estimate of five years. In retrospect, even
the Borrowers estimate would have been optimistic (see Construction Schedule,
Annex 1). Delays in dam and canal construction were caused by insufficiently
advanced studies and designs, late start up and unforeseen geological problems
necessitating a more complicated foundation. For construction of the canals,
the local joint venture which won the contract went bankrupt and finalizing a
new contract and subsequent implementation resulted in a three year delay in



- 14 -
completion. Delays in the implementation of the irrigation component were
mainly caused by tardy completion of civil works and a multitude of legal,
administrative and socio-political problems in the land consolidation aspect,
where many agencies had to agree on the procedures and the resulting Land
Consolidation Law was only enacted on July 22, 1976. Details are contained in
Annex 11. It was not until 1984 that the first land was fully consolidated in
a portion of the Ibar project area, comprising 1,850 ha in Drenica Field. The
schedule for completion of land consolidation is summarized in the following
table.
Phasing of Land Consolidation
1985     1986     1987     1988      1989     1990
Annual          5,608    4,747    7,345    1,100        500      800
Cumulative      5,608   10,355   17,700   18,800   19,300   20,100
For 1985, besides the 1,850 ha already consolidated in 1984, the remaining
3,758 ha of 5,608 ha total is expected to be completed for the 1985 irrigation
season (Nay-September).  Completion of revised cadastral maps of each plot,
evaluation of the plots, and final distribution of land to farmers is
progressing satisfactorily in varying stages within each subsystem.
Consequently, the above schedule appears to be realistic.
Reporting
3.09      ILE prepared comprehensive quarterly reports of a good quality which
were submitted in a timely ranner which assisted the Bank in monitoring the
project.
Procurement
3.10      All contracts were procured on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines except some very
small contracts with a total estimated value of less than 12 of project cost
which were procured directly in accordance with local regulations after Bank's
approval. All civil works contracts were won by Yugoslav contractors, while
20S of the value of equipment contracts was won by foreign contractors. The
value of all procured equipment amounted to about 72 of the project cost.



- 15 -
Prolect Cost
3.11      The total project cost amounted to Dinar 8048.0 million compared
with the appraisal estimate of Dinar 1400.0 million, or a cost overrun of
4752. Expressed in US$ the actual and estimated costs are US$204.0 million
and US$ 93.3 million or an overrun of 119%. Annex 2 gives detailed actual
costs compared to estimates, which are summarized below.

The cost overruns were mainly due to delayed implementation, insufficient
provision of physical contingencies and the very high inflation (302-60% per
annum) in Yugoslavia, particularly during the later years of project
implementation which could not have been foreseen. The foreign exchange
component was estimated at between 18 and 23% at appraisal. At completion it
was about 28X.

Performance of Consultants, Contractors and the Executing Agency
3.12      The performance of the consultants and the contractors was in
general satisfactory, except for the contractors in charge of the dam and
canal construction who, because of bankruptcy (para. 3.08), caused substantial
delays in the completion of the project. Considering that at the outset few
of its staff had any experience in executing a project of this complexity and
magnitude, ILE performed well. It has developed into a capable organization.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Water and Power Production and Sales
4.01      As a result of the delayed completion of the project, water and
power sales could not start in 1974 and 1976, respectively, as estimated at
the time of appraisal. Power was sold for the first time in 1981 and has
since been at levels forecast at the time of appraisal.
4.02      Sale of water to industry which would consume about three-fourths of
the water available in the Ibar system has been delayed. This is mainly
because the investments which the industries were to make, have been postponed
due to the overall economic situation in Yugoslavia and the resulting scarcity
of investment funds. These investments are now being made and starting in
1983 industries have begun taking about 10% of the water which they were
supposed to use. While demand will grow, water sales to industry will reach
the originally forecast level only in 1994.
4.03      Sale of water for domestic use also started only in 1983.  The water
allocated for this purpose is a very small proportion of the total and the
demand has been about 50% higher than forecasted and is expected to double in
1987, when a new water treatment plant in Titova Mitrovica is inaugurated.
Given the relatively small amounts involved, this higher demand can be
accomodated.
4.04      For irrigation, the appraisal estimated that farmers would irrigate
1,500 ha in 1974, 2,000 ha in 1975, 19,000 in 1976, and that by 1977 the total
area of 30,000 would be under irrigation. In reality, systematic use of the
irrigation network will only commence in 1985, mainly due to the delayed
completion of civil works and problems associated with land consolidation.
The following table shows the planned schedule for bringing cropland under
irrigation between 1985 and 1990.

~'   Second crops consist of maize silage and vegetables following wheat,
barley and rape seed through a system of double cropping.
4.05      By 1990, the total project area of 20,100 ha is expected to be under
irrigation, which is also expected to support 8,109 ha of second crop maize
silage and vegetables for a grand total of 28,209 ha. Prior to 1985, through
the efforts of ILE and the cooperatives, portions of the sprinkler system were
put in use on a demonstration/pilot basis (120 ha and 200 ha in 1981 and 1982,
respectively) and by farmers on an ad hoc informal basis, without any charge
for use of the water (400 ha in 1982, 1,200 ha in 1983, and 2,250 ha in 1984).
4.06      Also at the time of appraisal approximately 70S of the area proposed
for irrigation had been envisaged for surface irrigation, while 30S was
allocated to sprinklers. However, it became apparent that the entire project
area presented a conflict since land levelling, though necessary for surface
irrigation, could not be implemented due to shallow soil depths and very high
costs per hectare for moving earth. This again highlights the need for
sufficiently advanced project design prior to appraisal.
4.07      In mid-1976 at the Bank's request, ILE carried out a comparative
analysis of irrigation methods which showed higher investment costs for
surface methods of irrigation, if these were physically possible, as compared
to sprinklers. During November of the same year a supervision mission further
reviewed the situation in the field. As a result, the Bank in January 1977
approved the sprinkler method of irrigation for the entire project area of
20,100 ha.
Irrigation Water Demand, Supply and Quality
4.08      The irrigation water requirements were calculated using the USDA
modified Blaney-Criddle method based on the projected cropping pattern
consisting mainly of wheat, maize, sugarbeet, alfalfa and vegetables. The
estimated seasonal irrigation demand below reservoir was calculated to be 105
million m3 or 3,500 m3/ha, based on an irrigated area of 30,000 ha.



- 18 -
During 1976, the distribution of water allocation between industry,
agriculture and for domestic purposes was an issue. Finally, due to an upward
revision in the industrial demand and a reduction in the size of the irrigated
area to 20,100 ha, the amount allocated to agriculture was reduced to
65 million m3, with Bank's agreement after a technical review of the issue.
The Bank's concurrence was reinforced by the Government's indication that this
allocation is for the life of the project. Data on the quality of the Ibar
water indicated that the soluble salt content was very low (less than 370
mg/l) and that bicarbonate ion was dominant. The water was considered
suitable for continuous irrigation with practically no salinity or sodium
hazard.
Support Services
4.09      An essential element in support of irrigated agricultural
development in the individual sector (7,800 farmer households) was a program
of agricultural extension, which although delayed, was formally established in
mid-1978. The agricultural cooperatives have the dominant role in providing
this assistance, and by end-1984 there were 16 cooperatives in the project
area with a total of 21 graduate-level extension agents (plus about 30
technicians) to serve the needs of the farmers. This level of manpower is
sufficient to meet the requirements of the project through 1986; however, as
additional cropland comes under irrigation in later years, the number of
agents will have to increase in order to provide adequate technical assistance
(Annex 10, paras. 29-31).
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Introduction
5.01      The appraisal forecast and actual Income Statements, Cash Flow
Statements and Balance Sheets for ILE from 1971-1985 are in Annexes 5 to 7.
An analysis of ILE's financial performance follows.
Operating Results
5.02      ILE's actual operating results, as well as overall financial
performance differs substantially from appraisal estimates principally due to
two facts: (i) the project was executed between the years 1971-1984 instead
of the planned 1971-1976 period, and (ii) the inflation in Yugoslavia during
the implementation period, coupled with dramatic devaluation of the Yugoslav
Dinar during 1981-1984, could not have been anticipated. Given this
background and the fact that the major components of the project have been
completed only recently, there is litte by way of actual performance which
could form the basis of any proper assessment.
5.03      ILE was set up as an "investment" organization to become an
"operating" organization once the Ibar project was completed. It had little
or no revenues until recently and depended completely on the Government for
all its finances. The hydro-power plant started producing electricity in 1981



- 19 -
and has since provided ILE with some revenues, although lately
"Electrokosovo", the power company, has not been paying ILE on time resulting
in a high level of accounts receivable. Industries and domestic water
consumers started using water in 1983, with industries consuming much less for
the time being than originally planned. This also has a rather negative
effect on ILE's financial position since the industries presently plan to use
all the water allocated to them only by 1994. Similarly all the water
allocated for agriculture will be fully utilized only in 1990. ILE has in
the meantime agreed with the industries on a revised level of charges and has
also prepared a program for charging agricultural water using a graduated
scale whereby agricultural users will pay the full cost by the end of the
fifth year (see Annex 10, paras 22-24 for further details). ILE's present
tariffs are as follows:
Water (Industry)    -    Din 9.5/m3
Water (Irrigation)  -    Din 9.5/M3 I/
Water (Domestic)    -    Din 8.0/m3
Electricity         -    Din 3.91/Kwh
1'Farmers will initially pay 16% of the tariff and pay 1002
in the fifth year. Provincial Government will pay ILE
the difference.
Overall, ILE's financial future depends largely on its industrial consumers
since two-thirds of its revenues are expected from them. Given the difficult
overall economic situation in Yugoslavia, some slippages may be unavoidable.

Total Sources         1550.6  lnO                    11058.3  100
5.05      Overall funds requirements were about seven times higher, again due
to the extended implementation period and very high inflation. Almost 60S of
the total investments were made during 1981-1984, a period when the average
exchange rate went from US$1 = Din. 25 in 1980 to US$1 D Din. 164 in 1984.
The Bank loan was largely disbursed by 1980 (931) and the remaining costs were
financed by loans from t.e Banka Kosova.  In the absence of any substantial
revenues, the Federal Government has serviced the World Bank loan until now
and this is likely to continue in the foreseeable future until ILE's revenue
base grows. An addit.onal factor which further complicates ILE's financial
future is the dramatic decline in the value of the Dinar and its consequences
for ILE's debt servicing capacity. This is a problem which affects all
projects in Yugoslavia financed by foreign loans in the last 5 years and in
ILE's case the problem is particularly severe since the Bank loan funds were
disbursed when US$1 = Din 18 on the average, whereas the exchange rate
presently stands at US$1 = Din 250. In spite of all this, however, if ILE
could sell all the water and electricity it produces it could service all its
debts from its revenues. Until then the Federal and Provincial Governments
will continue to service ILE's debts to the extent necessary.



- 21 -
Financial Covenants
5.06      ILE was expected to achieve an annual rate of return on its net
fixed assets in operation of 7% after the first year of operation of the dams,
reservoirs and the water conveyance system and of 8S after the fifth year.
The above mentioned facilities were completed only in 1984 and therefore the
covenant would not be operative until the end of 1985. However, based on the
present status of water utilization by the various user groups, ILE will not
meet its financial covenant. This situation is likely to continue for several
years until the industries which were to have taken about three-quarters of
the water from the Ibar system complete their expansion programs and start
taking all the water allocated to them. ILE should then be able to achieve
its financial targets.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organizational Development
6.01      ILE was created in 1969 to implement the Ibar-Lepenac Project, with
the Ibar component to be constructed first. Once the Ibar project was
finished it was also to operate and maintain the facilities.
6.02      Until the end of 1984 ILE was strictly an "investment
organization". Now that the project is completed, its organizational
structure has been changed which includes the operation of the Ibar system and
the development of the Lepenac system. The organization chart is in Annex 9.
6.03      ILE started out with about 30 people and its total staff at present
is 240. As activities in irrigation increase ILE's staff is expected to grow
to about 280 by the year 1990. Also, since the establishment of the
agricultural extension service in mid-1978 through 16 cooperatives in the
project area, 21 graduate-level agents (plus about 30 technicians) currently
are serving the needs of the project farmers.
Training
6.04      The project provided for training of ILE's staff for the purpose of
operation and maintenance of the project facilities. The project financed
close to 100 man-months of training (compared to 90 planned), locally and
abroad, of ILE professionals in the fields of operation and maintenance of
irrigation systems, drainage, irrigated agriculture and farm economics. Also
the agricultural extension service operated by the cooperatives in the project
area and ILE are collaborating in organizing training programs for farmers.
The programs consist of both theoretical and practical courses and seminars
covering a wide range of subjects from sprinkler irrigation methodology to the
agronomy of irrigated crop production. Staff from the Faculty of Agriculture
of the UnJrersity of Pristina also offer lectures in many of the courses. In
addition, descriptive pamphlets prepared by ILE on such subjectb as cropping
pattern and water use are widely used and distributed. Experience has proven



- 22 -
that farmers are very receptive to the overall training effort, which not only
imparts new knowledge but also stimulates general interest among the rural
population in the Ibar project.
6.05     From the very beginning the Bank encouraged ILE to set up
demonstration areas in the various subsystems to expose farmers to sprinkler
irrigation prior to its formal introduction through the total system. In
1981, 120 ha was organized on a demonstration basis, through the effort of
cooperatives and ILE, whereby water was pumped from an adjacent river to the
sprinkler equipment which already had been procured under the project. This
demonstration was expanded to 200 ha in 1982. The demonstrations have been
effective methods of familiarizing farmers with sprinkler irrigation.
Agricultural Research
6.06     By 1971, ILE was already financing a four hectare irrigation
experimental area, run by the Agricultursl Research Institute of Agrokosovo,
on which wheat, barley, alfalfa, sunflower and maize were grown using surface
and sprinkler irrigation - the result., of which were passed on to the
extension service through seminars and printed material. More recently,
double cropping systems have been under observation on social sector farms and
because of the encouraging results, these systems will be introduced on the
individual farms in the project area as irrigation becomes available.
6.07     The Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Pristina (founded in
1974) is responsible for agricultural research in the Province through four
research institutes or departments; namely, Crop Production, Livestock
Improvement, Economics and Development, and Plant and Seed Production. The
Faculty has been active in collaborating with the extension services through
organizing special intensive courses, work shops and seminars in a variety of
subjects important to the agricultural development of Kosovo in general, and
the Ibar project in particular.
The Cooperative Movement and Individual Farmers
6.08      Between project start-up and end-1984 increasing members of farmers
have become associated with agricultural cooperatives, either as full members
or through short and/or long-term production-market contracts. By end-1984,
some 9,000 farmers had formed some type of association with the 16
cooperatives established in the project area. This development will enhance
the provision of farm inputs to individual farmers, including technical
assistance, as well as effective utilization of sprinkler irrigation.
VII. BANK PERFORMANCE
7.01     A good rapport existed between the Bank, the Federal and Provincial
Governments and ILE throughout project preparation and implementation. Bank
made many recommendations and requests for additional analysis which were
carried out by ILE. ILE considers Bank interventions to have been timely and



- 23 -
beneficial. The Bank has also played a catalytic role in the implementation
of the land consolidation program, benefits from which will not be limited to
this project alone. The fact that ILE has now requested Bank assistance to
carry out the Lepenac Project confirms the existing good relationship between
the Bank and ILE.
7.02      Bank supervised the project three to four times annually during the
early years of project implementation and once a year after construction of
major project components was underway. Missions fielded by the Bank were
balanced, provided sufficient continuity and had the necessary expertise to
provide the level of guidance and supervision necessary for the various stages
of project implementatiou. On the whole, the Bank's performance in guiding
this project has been effective.
VIII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Prolect Obiective
8.1       The main objective of the project, to remove the constraint on
industrial and agricultural development caused by an insufficient water
supply, has been achieved albeit with some delay. While the demand for
domestic water is greater than expected and electricity is being produced as
projected, the demand for industrial water has lagged because of slower than
expected industrial development caused by the general difficult economic
situation in the country. The demand in agricultural water has also lagged
because of the slow implementation of civil works and land consolidation in
the project area. The long term development in the agricultural component of
the project will be substantial. In brief, it will increase annual
agricultural production six fold over the present level of output. Details
pertaining to agricultural development are elaborated in Annex 10. Overall
progress is being made in both the industrial and agricultural areas and there
is little reason to doubt that all the potential benefits o. this project will
be fully derived by 1990 and beyond.  Indeed the Government considers this
project as one of the most imnortant carried out in Kosovo and has instructed
ILE to start preparation of the second phase which will aim at regulating the
water of the Lepenac River.
8.2       In addition  to the main benefits of permitting continued economic
development in the industrial and agricultural sector in the Kosovo Province,
the project provides a number of other benefits which are as follows:
(a) the 135 km long water conveyance system built under this project
is a convenient source of raw water for domestic water supply in
the communes in the Sitnica Valley. At appraisal it was
estimated that 6.4 million m3/year of water would be used for
this purpose.  Interest is howe".ur much greater and by 1987
about three times this amount will be used for potable water
supply. This would also generate considerable, but difficult to
quantify, health benefits.



- 26 -
(b) the flood protection aspect, which was not considered very
important at the time of appraisal, has been highly beneficial.
In an average year prior to the construction of the dam, floods
damaged agricultural land, public utilities, housing and also
disrupted economic activity in the project area with an
estimated value of Dinar 11.0 million (US$0.7 million) in 1971
prices. Furthermore, in 1979 exceptionally heavy rains in the
Ibar basin upstream of the Gazivode dam would have caused a
devastating flood, had the dam not been in place. It is
estimated that about 60S of the housing in Titova Mitrovica
would have been damaged, some completely destroyed. Floods
would have also damaged 8 kms of railway lines and 7 kms of
roads. Kombinat Trepca, the major industry in the area, would
have been severely damaged, as would other smaller industries
and handicraft establishments resulting in a minimum of one
month of lost production. In addition, public utilities would
have been affected and the entire economic life i.< the area
would have been disrupted. It has been estimated that the
damages averted by the existence of the dam amounted to Dinar
875.0 million in 1971 prices (US$58.3 million).
(c) the project has provided employment to an average of 2000
laborers/year during the construction period, and will continue
to provide employment to about 600 persons on a permanent basis
for operation and maintenance purposes. This is without
counting the additional agricultural labour force both in
production and processing which will find employment by virtue
of the project.
(d) the project also has a positive influence on the country's
balance of payments through savings on imported cereals (mainly
wheat) through the increased production in the area.
Least Cost Solutions
8.3       The chosen technical solutions were based on the least cost
solution. Further cost reductions could only have been achieved by more
expeditious project implementation.
Economic Rate of Return
8.4       At the time of appraisal the internal economic rate of return (ERR)
of the project of 15.6S was calculated based on a five year implementation
period with benefits to follow thereafter. It is understandable that because
of the much longer project implementation period (14 years) and the delayed
accrual of benefits this high rate of return could not be maintained. Revised
calculations have shown an ERR of 13X. This is satisfactory, in particular
since a number of unquantifiable benefits (health, employment.) have not been
taken in account. (Annex 8).

IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.1       The project was well conceived and represents the least cost
solution. Notwithstanding the considerable delays in project implementation
the project has been one of the most beneficial ones implemented in the Kosovo
Province with significant long-term developmental implications. All physical
project objectives have been achieved, and the institution created to
implement the project has developed into a viable, well-run entity, ready to
tackle the follow-up project of regulating the Lepanac River and expanding
irrigation to an additional 43000 ha. The Bank has been requested to consider
providing financing for the new project.
Lessons Learned
9.2       The lessons learned from this project can be summarized as follows:
(a) project appraisal should take place only after final design is
sufficiently advanced in order to provide a firm project
description and reliable cost estimates;
(b) final designs and bid documents for critical elements of the
project should be ready for tender soon after Board
presentation. This aspect has taken an added importance due to
the reduction of grace periods for Bank loans;
(c) conditions of effectiveness should be kept to a minimum and most
of them should be dealt with as part of project preparation to
the extent possible; and
(d) land consolidation presents difficult legal, technical, and
particularly social problems, which are not amenable to reliable
implementation planning and, therefore, the Bank should be more
cautious and realistic in establishing implementation schedules
where social issues are involved.

AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT UNDER
THE IBAR PROJECT
Agricultural Production
1.      Background - About 83% of the land in the revised project area is
owned by some 7,800 individual farmer households. Prior to the project, about
two-thirds of them were at the subsistence level, cultivating farms smaller
than two hectares under rainfed conditions and providing for large families
averaging 5.6 persons. Besides being small, farm holdings were fragmented
into as many as eight separate parcels.
2.      The rest of the land in the project area (17X) belongs to the social
sector. This consists of one agro-industrial enterprise, Kombinat
Kosmet-Export, and six production cooperatives. The Kombinat operates various
factories (sugarbeet, oil, animal feed, milk and meat), as well as produces
part of the raw material needs for the processing facilities on its own land.
At the time of appraisal about one quarter of the area farmed by individual
farmers obtained farm inputs and advisory services from the Kombinat and
production cooperatives by entering into contracts with these organizations
for sale of their crops. If a contract was not entered into, these services
could only be obtained by individual farmers on a cash basis, which in
actuality was next to impossible given the farmers' meager disposable income.
3.      Cereals were the most important crop prior to the project, accounting
for 70% of the cultivated land. Sugarbeet, sunflower and alfalfa were also
produced, mainly in the social sector, while in the individual sector farmers
grew some vegetables under partial irrigation using traditional water-wheels
or by pumping from the river. Although there is some evidence of modern
farming practices, many of the individual farms still practice traditional
farming methods. Livestock production was limited to the hill pastures,
complemented by grassland areas in the plain. A limited amount of beef
fattening took place during the summer in the social sector, while on the
small holdings poultry production was popular. The livestock census for 1984
is given in Table 1.
4.      Cropping Pattern and Yields with the Project - With the introduction
of irrigation, there is a shift from traditional rainfed winter-cereal farming
to greater emphasis on high value summer crops (maize, vegetables, sugarbeet
and sunflower), which are responsive to irrigation. This trend is shown in
the following summary table, and details on the cropping pattern before and
with the project are given in Tables 2 and 3.

/A Includes 8,109 ha of second crops.
As seen above, the area planted to summer crops has doubled with the project,
and their percentage in the cropping pattern has increased from 561 to 772.
Even though the cropping pattern at the present time contains 561 summer
crops, their production is usually poor due to unreliable moisture during the
summer months in the absence of irrigation.
5.      Another significant feature of the with-project cropping pattern is
the introduction of a double cropping system made possible with irrigation, in
which maize for silage (5,773 ha) and vegetables (2,336 ha) are planted
following the harvest of wheat, barley and rape seed in early summer. As a
result of this system the cropping intensity has increased to 1402.
6.      Even without the benefit of irrigation from the project, crop yields
improved between 1971 (taken as the present-situation at appraisal) and 1984
(the revised present-situation) (Table 4). For example, yielda in the
individual sector increased an average of 401 (average of 31 annually) during
this 13-year period for the four major crops of wheat, maize, alfalfa hay, and
vegetables. In the social sector the yield increase averaged about 301.
Project authorities subscribe this achievement to the application by
increasing numbers of farmers of more modern farming technology over the past
decade, and particular importance was attached to the greater availability and
use of improved quality seeds by farmers.
7.       Crop yields with the project are expected to increase substantially
as irrigation is introduced. Yield targets have been established bearing in
mind the present yield levels; results obtained in pilot areas with sprinkler
irrigation; improved agronomic practices, including expanded use of
fertilizers and improved seeds; greater and more efficient use of
mechanization made possible because of land consolidation; and better
technical services to farmers through an improved extension service (paras.
29-31). For example, in 1984, maize grain yields reached 11 t/ha in some
parcels in the pilot area, and even without irrigation some farmers have
achieved yields of 7 t/ha in years of excentionally good soil moisture by
using modern crop technology.

8.      Crop yields in both sectors, prior to the projct and at full
development, are shown in detail in Table 4, and they are summarized for the
main crops in the following table.

Vegetable             10.3             -               33.2 2
In the individual sector, average yields of the principal crops at full
development are expected to increase 1601, while those in the social sector
are estimated to increase 100X.
9.      Incremental Agricultural Production - At appraisal, full development
of agricultural production was expected in 1983, following a development
period of five years in the social sector and seven years for the individual
farmers, from the time that water first became available for irrigation in any
given area. Due to delays in bringing the cropped areas under irrigation full
development is now expected to be attained only in 1994. The period required
to reach full development of crop production on newly irrigated land has been
revised for purposes of the completion report to five years for both sectors.
10.      The project would boost agricultural production through an increase
in cropped area and more intensive and efficient utilization of land, water
and other factors of production. The build-up of crop production from 1985
(first year of irrigation) to full development in 1994 is presented in Table
5. At full development in 1994, the total annual volume of agricultural
production is expected to increase six fold over the present annual production
as seen in the following summary table and shown in more detail in Table 6.

=U=
For the future situation without the project, it was assumed at appraisal that
production would grow annually at the rate of 1.5%, but that no further
significant increases would be obtained in the social sector. For the
completion report, the annual growth rate without the project has been taken
as 2X in both sectors over a five-year period, based on the yield levels
currently obtained (1984) and on the trend over the past 13 years. Beyond a
period of about five years, it can be expected that moisture would be the
limiting factor to further production increases.
11.      Benefits of the project to agriculture are estimated as the increase
in farm-gate value of agriculture production, less production costs, comparing
the project area under irrigation with the future situation that would have
prevailed without the project. Compared with the net value of production in
1994 without the project investment of Din 839 million, the provision of water
to irrigate 20,100 ha would cause the net value of annual production in 1994
at full development to rise to Din 6,140 million, representing an annual
incremental net value of production due to irrigation of Din 5,301 million
(Table 7).
On-farm Development and Infrastructure
12.      In the context of the project, land-levelling (5,000 ha) and tile
drainage (2,000 ha) are the only aspects that are considered as on-farm
development. In a broader sense, however, on-farm development should also
include organizational aspects related to effective utilization of the
sprinkler irrigation system by farmers-a subject which will be expanded in
later paragraphs.
13.      With the decision to irrigate the entire project area by sprinklers,
it was not necessary to proceed with a program of land-levelling. During
appraisal about 3,500 ha of low-lying land along the Sitnica River (Kosovo
Fields I and II) was suspect of requiring reclamation tLrough subsurface
drainage. Consequently, the project provided for a study to determine the
economic viability of draining this area (Project Agreement, Section 2.11).

The study, which was carried out by consultants, was completed in mid-1974.
Its recommendation that only drainage by open ditches would be required was
accepted by both ILE and the Bank.
14.      By early 1980, the Bank concluded that the slow progress in
organizing on-farm development, in the broader sense, was the lack of
commitment and/or a clear understanding among the various entities in Kosovo
concerning their specific responsibilities in this regard, and particularly,
for developing cooperation among farmers for use of sprinkler irrigation. The
appraisal report specified that ILE would operate and maintain the irrigation
system, supervise the portable sprinkler equipment suppiied to farmers, and
consult with the extension service to ensure consistency between the farmers'
crop plans and the water delivery schedule.
15.      Consequently, in the fall of 1980, the Bank organized a major mission
with the objective of bringing together all participants in the Ibar project:
ILE, Secretariats of Agriculture and Water Economy, Union of Cooperatives,
Bank of Kosovo, University of Pristina, and the Executive Council of SAPK, to
seek agreement on a plan of action to accelerate on-farm development. A seven
point action plan, recommended by the Bank, was accepted and endorsed by the
Government of Kosovo. It was designed to define the responsibilities of each
organization, facilitate cooperation among them, develop work plans for ILE,
Union of Cooperatives, and the University of Pristina. Consensus was reached
that ILE would continue to be responsible for construction of civil works, and
operation and maintenance of the irrigation system, while on-farm development
in the broader sense would be entrusted to the Union of Cooperatives and the
University would provide training and carry out research. A Provincial-level
Coordination Board was formed to coordinate all activities related to on-farm
development, utilization of the sprinkler system, and agricultural production
in the Ibar project area.
16.      It was generally agreed that land consolidation was going to be an
extremely long-drawn out process and that, although desirable, it was not
necessarily a pre-requisite for the introduction of sprinkler irrigation in
the Ibar project provided farmers could agree on a common cropping pattern and
organize themselves around the sprinkler laterals and hydrants. Several
approaches to organizing farmers for the common use of a sprinkler hydrant had
been under discussion for several years with no clear-cut decision
forthcoming. The one which was finally adopted on a modest scale (400 ha) for
the 1981 irrigation season required the Union of Cooperatives to organize
about 20 farmer "units" of about eight farmers each. Each unit would be
alongside a hydrant and the local cooperative and ILE would develop a cropping
pattern with the eight farmers in that unit to irrigate approximately 20 ha
total. Unfortunately, no irrigation water became available through the system
in 1981 due to extensive repair work required on the main conduit.  However,

ANNEX 10

ILE did succeed in installing several mobile pumps along a river to introduce
sprinkler irrigation in 1981 on 120 ha for demonstration purposes with about
50 farmers. This was expanded to 200 ha in 1982. Also, in 1982 the Ibar
Field subsystem (880 ha) was operational on a trial basis. Farmers were
encouraged to avail themselves of the facilities on an informal-no charge
basis without any organized approach to agricultural production among the
farmers. It was estimated that about 400 ha were irrigated in this ad-hoc
manner in 1982. On a similar basis, 1,200 ha were irrigated in 1983 and 2,250
in 1984. Beginning with the 1985 irrigation reason, the cooperatives will
have the key role in organizing farmers along the hydrants to utilize the
sprinklers in a coordinated and harmonious marner.
17.      Concerning infrastructure, the project provided for the construction
and reconstruction of about 90 kilometers of feeder roads and the construction
of about 633 kilometers of maintenance roads along the main conduits and along
the irrigation canals and drains. By mid-1979 approximately 65% of the road
work had been completed, the remainder consisting of feeder roads, which is
gradually being done in conjunction with the land consolidation process.
18.      Project Agreement, Section 5.03 required the Government of Kosovo to
carry out erosion control and soil conservation works designed to minimize
erosion and sediment production in the watersheds in the project area and to
protect the main conduits against floods. In mid-1974 the Bank agreed to
Government's request to transfer this responsibility to ILE, provided adequate
funds were made available to ILE for this purpose. The appropriate measures,
which included afforestation and terracing, were completed by end-1978.
Land Consolidation
19.      To permit the optimum utilization of the irrigation and drainage
facilities included in the project a program of land consolidation or
adjustment of farm boundaries was considered desirable because of the
preponderance of small and fragmented land holdings. There are about 7,800
individual farmer holdings in the project area, with an average size of
2.8 ha, with each holding divided into seven or eight parcels. The Project
Agreement, Section 5.05, provides that the Government of Kosovo would begin to
carry out a program of land consolidation or boundary adjustment no later than
July 1, 1972, and that it would be completed before beginning construction of
the irrigation and drainage facilities. Since loan effectiveness had been
delayed by nearly one year, the Project Agreement was subsequently amended
thus postponing the target date from July 1, 1972 to September 1, 1973. A
suimary of the most significant events surrounding the difficult issue of land
consolidation, and the schedule for completion of land consolidation are given
in Annex 11.

Operation and Maintenance of the Irrigation System
20.      The responsibility for operation and maintenance of the system was
entrusted to ILE by the Government of Kosovo. A special section was created
in early 1979 within ILE for operation of the irrigation system and
distribution of water up to the farm hydrants. It consists of a chief
engineer, two technical engineers, two agriculturalists, six mechanics, four
skilled workers, and two supporting staff.
21.      Physical movement of the on-farm sprinkler equipment during
irrigation will be done by the farmers themselves, under the supervision and
control of the cooperatives, who are also responsible for organizing the
agricultural production in the individual sector. However, at the end of
every irrigation season, the sprinkler equipment is returned to ILE's
organization for maintenance and repairs. Plans for the use of the system are
prepared for the cooperatives by the engineers of ILE; such as, defining the
rules for water rotations, movement of sprinklers, and duties and obligations
of the farmers.
Water Charge for Irrigation
22.      The Project Agreement (Section 2.12 a) required ILE to submit an
irrigation water charge study to the Bank for review by June 30, 1973, which
was subsequently postponed with Bank concurrence on several occasions.
Several studies prepared by the project consultants were submitted in draft to
the Bank for review-the last being in May 1977, on which occasion the Bank
offered several suggestions.
23.      The Bank reiterated to ILE that water charges should not be too low
to encourage excessive use, nor so high as to discourage use by the farmers.
The subsidy, constituting the difference between the required water charges
for debt-service and maintenance and operation of the system; and the farmers'
ability to pay, during the first four years, was to be worked out jointly by
the Provincial Government and ILE, with the former transferring funds to ILE
equivalent to the shortfall.
24.      In early 1984, ILE's tariff proposal was accepted by the Provincial
Government. The water charge is based on the average annual requirement of
3,225 m3/ha at a price of 9.5 dinar/m3 (total Din 30,640/ha). During the
first four years, beginning in 1985, the Provincial Government will subsidize
the water charge on a declining scale basis as seen in the following table.

In addition to the four year Government subsidy, the social sector enterprise,
Kosovexport, has offered to pay the farmers' share of the water charge in 1985
upon negotiating a production/marketing contract, whereby the farmers would
deliver their produce to the enterprise's processing plants.
Farm Income
25.      Following the methodology of appraisal, in the evaluation of project
benefits for farms at full development, three typical farm units were
examined: (i) individual 1.5 ha farm; (ii) individual 4.5 ha farm; and
(iii) 500 ha farm in the social sector with dairy production. Farm budgets
for the typical farms at full development are presented in Tables 8, 9, and
10, using constant end-1984 local currency values (Table 11). Net farm income
per ha, after deducting an average water charge of Din 30,640 and making
allowance for family subsistence on the individual farms, is projected as
follows: Din 162,000 on 1.5 ha farms, Din 237,700 on 4.5 ha farms, and Din
52,100 in the social sector.
Markets and Marketina
26.      Incremental agricultural output from the project is to be marketed
primarily within Kosovo to help meet existing deficits. An estimated 271
population increase during the ten-year period, 1983-1993 is expected to
generate substantial incremental demand within Kosovo which, together with
current production deficits, would exceed the anticipated production increases
from the project. In 1984, Yugoslavia, as a whole, imported over one half
million tons of wheat. Per capita consumption of meat in Kosovo is low (21%
of the national average), and Kosovo imports from other parts of Yugoslavia
about 12,000 tons annually to help offset local production deficit. Kosovo's
per capita consumption of milk (77% of the national average) exceeds local
production, and Kosovo is expected to be a net importer during the next
decade. Although very little of the output is expected to be exported, much
of it would contribute indirectly to Yugoslavia's foreign exchange earnings or
savings by reducing import requirements. All sugarbeet production would be



- 43 -
ANNEX 10
Page 9 of 11
processed by an existing factory nearby in Pec, which currently is operating
below full capacity. Similarly, sunflower seed production will permit better
utilization of an existing factory adjacent to the project area. Wheat is
used mainly for human consumption and maize for animal feed. Unlike the other
produce referred to above, which is sold through social sector enterprises,
the vegetables are sold by farmers in the markets of the major towns in the
Province.
Prices
27.      A new price law became effective as of January 1985, which allows
greater autonomy to the organizations of associated labor in setting prices of
agricultural inputs and outputs. Table 11 presents financial and economic
prices for inputs and outputs in constant end-1984 terms for those commodities
where both prices were available. The distortions between the two for the
inputs of phosphate and potash are large. Part of the reason for these
distortions appears to be acute domestic shortages of particular chemicals.
These ingredients could not be imported due to foreign exchange shortages,
which in turn caused the demand and therefore prices of certain fertilizer to
escalate at the farm level. Output prices from the project followed a
somewhat similar trend. The conversion factors will need to be re-assessed
because of recent financial and economic developments affecting the exchange
rate and prices in Yugoslavia vis-a-vis the rest of the world.
Agricultural Extension
28.      The project required the Government of Kosovo to prepare a program
for the coordination and expansion of the agricultural extension services to
be provided by agricultural organizations and provincial institutions to all
farmers (including non-associated farmers) located in the project area, and
submit the program to the Bank for review by December 31, 1971, prior to its
implementation no later than July 1, 1972 (Project Agreement, Section 5.06).
Since project effectiveness had been delayed by about one year, the Bank, in
April 1973, agreed to postpone these two actions until September 30, 1973 and
January 1, 1974, respectively.
29.      An agricultural extension service was not formally put in place until
mid-1978. The main causes for delay were: (i) the Government's initial
reluctance to assume its obligation under the Project Agreement; (ii) delayed
preparation of a draft law in 1976 and reluctance of Government to proceed in
the Ibar project area without formal legislation covering the whole Province;
and (iii) delayed in the basic concept of organization of the extension
services, which finally led to a new law in 1978. Details surrounding the
afore-mentioned events are contained in Annex 12. The following table
summ rizes information concerning cooperatives, extension agents and farmer
participation in the cooperatives as of 1984. Details are contained in Annex
12, Table A.

/A The area covered by some cooperatives also includes farmland beyond the
limits of the project area.
For each university graduate-level agent there are from two to three
technican-level extension staff. Associated farmers are either full members
of farmers cooperatives or have long-term association arrangements with other
types of organized labor for farmers. Short-term members are those farmers
vho have specific production/marketing contracts from one to five years
duration with the cooperatives; consequently, the number of short-term members
varies from year to year. In view of the development of the coopeative
movement in the project area, all farmers have some degree of association with
the cooperatives, and thus, are able to obtain technical assistance.
30.      The current level of manpower in the extension service is reasonably
adequate to serve the requirements of the project through 1986, since each
agent and/or technician would cover about 90 households or a total of about
200 ha. Beginning in 1987, if the number of extension personnel is not
increased, there is danger that technical assistance for the individual farmer
may be inadequate as additional cropland comes under irrigation in the Ibar
system.
Input Supply
31.      Provision of inputs is covenanted by Section 5.07 of the Project
Agreement; whereby, the Government of Kosovo agreed to take all measures to
ensure that farmers have access to credit, inputs and farm machinery
services. The major source of farm credit for these purposes has been three
Bank supported agricultural credit projects (Loans 1129-YU, 1477-YU and
1801-YU) and the Kosovo Regional Development Project (Loan 2306-YU), which was
channeled through Kosbanka, Pristina (KBP). The first and second projects
have been completed, while the third is still in progress. Under the third
credit US$13.0 million of the loan is allocated to the individual sector in



- 45 -                       A=1
Page 11 of 11
Kosovo for on-farm development, also including some support services to
farmers. Since roughly one-tenth of the total number of farmers in the
Province are within the Ibar project area, it can be estimated that about
US$1.3 million (plus US$1.95 million in counterpart funds) would be available
as credit to farmers in the Ibar system. Under the Regional Development
Project, a total of about US$40 million is provided as on-farm development
credit to individual farmers within the Province. Although demand for credit
from the individual sector has been less than anticipated, it is expected to
increase markedly as farmers obtain irrigation water from the Ibar system.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Summary of Events Concerning Land ConsolidatioD
Early supervision missions referred to the lack of progress by the
Government of Kosovo in the implementation of commitments agreed in the
Project Agreement, particularly those concerned with land consolidation (and
the formation of agricultural extension services) as major problems. Much of
1974 was devoted to reconfirming the obligations of the Government of Kosovo
as the party legally responsible for land consolidation (and extension)--a
responsibility which it had sought to pass to ILE, despite ILE's objections.
Because of continued delays during 1975, the Bank in November of the
same year linked progress in land consolidation to two major events; namely,
as a condition to recommending the Metohija Multipurpose project to the Board,
and to approving additional tenders for irrigation networks in the Ibar
project. Finally, the Provincial Government signed a contract with a
consulting firm in March 1976 to survey, map and prepare a proposal for new
cadastral maps, for which field work began in Ibar Field (880 ha) in May
1976. With this positive development, the Bank lifted its embargo on the two
items mentioned above.
Also, 1976 was a year of active legislation, in which the Kosovo
Assembly on July 22, 1976 passed a law entitled "Field Redistribution,
Consolidation and Land Parcellstion", to permit reorientation of boundaries to
be carried out for irrigation purposes. This law supplemented two existing
laws; namely, "Kosovo Cadastre Law" and "Land Consolidation and Distribution
Law". These laws required that actual changes in the field must be
implemented by a land consolidation commission, nominated by the communes and
composed of a president, two judges, an agricultural expert and a surveyor.
Their purpose was to initiate the consolidation plans, redistribute land and
hear farmers' appeals, implementation of which was estimated to take from one
to three years after preparation of new cadastral maps. Having completed the
cadastral maps for Ibar Field in February 1976, the consultants continued
their field work in other subsystems during 1977.
During 1978, the Government appointed a Provincial-level group of
experts under the auspices of the Secretariat of Agriculture to intensify
implementation of land consolidation by establishing contact with the land
consolidation commissions in the communes. Besides the Secretariat of
Agriculture, the group comprised the Secretariat for Finance, Secretariat for



- 58-                           ANNEX 11
Page 2 of 3
Legislation and Organization, Geodetric Administration, Administration of
Property Right Affairs, and ILE. The Government also provided a fund of Din
36 million for land consolidation in the Ibar project and ILE was made
responsible for its administration. The first local land consolidation
commission was formed in July 1978 in the Commune of Titova Mitrovica for
consolidating the 880 ha in Ibar Field.
Beginning in 1979, attention focused on various schemes designed to
utilize the irrigation network irrespective of land consolidation, because it
was apparent that land consolidation would be further delayed and portions of
the system were close to becoming operational. The first was a Government
proposal in April 1979 to enforce mono-culture among farmers, consisting of a
coordinated three-year crop rotation on the area served by each sprinkler
hydrant. Since cooperative farming under conditions of mono-culture would
yield the same results as land consolidation, the Bank supported this plan as
a suitable alternative, until such time as land consolidation was achieved.
Later in November 1979, the Bank suggested a slightly more formalized plan
based on the formation of farm-level organizations (Water Users' Associations)
where the users of irrigation water would get together and develop a
coordinated cropping scheme around each water hydrant. However, local
authorities claimed that there was no legal instrument for use of irrigation
through sprinkler systems, although subsequently it was found that independent
organizations on the basis of "water economy units of interest" were permitted
by law.
During 1980, the remaining three communes in the Ibar project
established their land consolidation commissions. In October of the same year
the Government of Kosovo established a high-level Provincial Coordination
Commission for Land Consolidation comprising 29 members. Besides high ranking
authorities from all the Secretariats, the presidents of the Comunmal Land
Consolidation Commissions were also represented. The Provincial Commission
prepared land consolidation work plans and schedules, and coordinated all
related tasks, including socio-political activities. In addition, a special
working group of nine members, chaired by the Secretary of Water Economy, was
entrusted to monitor progress specifically in the Ibar project. Between 1980
and 1982 all four communes in which the project area is located passed a
referendum approving land consolidation.
During 1981, the Kosovans concentrated on implementing the land
consolidation plans and the action plan to accelerate on-farm development. A
decree was passed by the Government of Kosovo in February 1981, which requires
that parcel adjustments and redistribution be done solely through the process
of land consolidation and not through any form of boundary adjustment. This
decree had minimal repercussions for the Ibar project since efforts were
already directed towards land consolidation in the true sense aud not boundary
adjustment. However, the decree adversely affected the Metohija Multipurpose
Project (Loan 1360-YU) near Prizren, since considerable progress had already
been made towards achieving boundary adjustment when the decree was passed.

multitude of 'eks related to land consolidation, which ultimately culminated
in the first wand to be consolidated in 1984. Table A to this Annex shows the

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Summary of Events Concerning Agricultural Extension
As in the case of land consolidation, the Government of Kosovo
initiated steps to reassign its responsibility for extension work to ILE;
consequently, most of 1974 was spent in reconfirming Government!s obligation
in accordance with the Project Agreement. During 1975 and 1976, the Bank
repeatedly raised its concern over the lack of progress in preparing a plan
for agricultural extension, and each time the Government's revised target
dates were not met.
Finally, in late 1976 the Bank received a draft Law entitled "Social
Compact on the Formation of the Specialized Services for the Improvement of
Agriculture in the Private Sector". It provided for a centralized-type of
extension service. Since this draft law did not constitute a specific
proposal for an extension service in the Ibar project area, the Bank requested
the Government to submit such a proposal and expressed the belief that an
extension program for the Ibar project could be set up even before passage of
the law.
However, in late 1977 the Bank was informed that the Government had
formulated a new proposal, which would supersede the draft law, whereby, in
broad terms the expansion of exte.sion services at farm level would be through
cooperatives. At this point, the Bank mounted a major effort aimed at
accelerating progress in the establishment of an effective extension program
for the Ibar project. In order to more fully understand the current status of
agricultural extension in SAPK and the implications of the new law, which
became effective in June 1978, the Bank contracted the services of an
agricultural extension expert, who visited Kosovo in mid-1978 as part of a
supervision mission. The new law is broad based and covers all aspects of
extension activities in the Province. The agricultural cooperatives have the
dominant role in providing direct technical assistance to the individual
farmer through the formation of basic specialized services in the cooperatives
or other forms of farmer associations so that each of the 22 communes in the
Province would be covered by one such basic service. Each service would
consist of two to three specialists. The law also provides that the Union of
Cooperatives (founded in February 1977 at the Provincial Government level) be
responsible for coordinating the system through its Department for Specialized
Service. The Government advertised new positions to staff the system. At the
time of the supervision mission's review there were 40 cooperatives in the



- 62 -                           ANNEX 12
Page 2 of 2
Province and 15 new ones were planned for 1978. The special consultant
offered a number of observations on the new system, principal among which
were: (i) probably only those farmers cooperating with the social sector
would be reached; (ii) specialists could possibly be overburdened with
administrative and input supply work not related directly to extension
activities; and (iii) insufficient provision for overall coordination,
training and monitoring of the new system. The consultant recommended some
modifications to the existing system, which incorporated several features of
the "training and visit" approach. Ultimately some of the training aspects
were adopted. The Bank also suggested to Government the assignment in Kosovo
of an expatriate extension specialist to assist in the organization of the
extension service, which ultimately was never requested by Government.
Specifically within the Ibar project area, by early 1979, 11
cooperatives had been established; ten extension agents had been enrolled; and
a total of Din 50 million had been made available during 1978 for salaries,
transportation, travel allowance and printed material. It was concluded at
this stage that sufficient progress had been made in the formation of new
cooperatives and staffing them with extension agents to service the farmers in
the first subsystem, which was expected to be operational in 1980; however,
this was not achieved. The Bank also commented favorably on the dissemination
program aimed at farmers, which included specialized courses, seminars and
supporting brochures and audio-visual aids, covering subjects, such as
soil-water-plant relationships, irrigation methods and handling of sprinkler
equipment. Much of this valuable material was prepared by the staff of ILE,
although ILE was not directly responsible for extension-type activities.
After a rapid start-up in the late 1970s, the number of cooperatives
in the project area remained at 12 during the early 1980s, and ultimately
reached 16 by 1984 with a total number of 21 graduate level extension agents,
as shown in Table A.
