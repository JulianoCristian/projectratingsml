"The objectives of the Second Gas\n            Transmission Project are to promote greater sector\n            efficiency and increase the utilization of domestic natural\n            gas resources.  As such, the project will help the Petroleum\n            Authority of Thailand (PTT) to: 1) move toward a fully\n            commercial operation under the new organization, as well as\n            continue previous efforts to strengthen its institutional\n            capacity to apply safety and environmental standards and\n            conduct project analyses including investment programming\n            and 2) construct a pipeline for transporting domestic gas.\n            The project components include: 1) a comprehensive study\n            regarding PTT corporate strategy, organizational\n            effectiveness, and ownership structure; 2) institutional\n            building and training of PTT staff; 3) a 36-inch diameter,\n            425 km offshore gas transmission pipeline that extends from\n            an existing platform at the Erawan fields in the  Gulf of\n            Thailand to onshore receiving facilities at Rayong; 4) a\n            28-inch diameter, 110 km onshore pipeline that extends from\n            Rayong to an area near the EGAT power plant at Bang Pakong;\n            5) related facilities, including a compressor station,\n            metering stations, gas processing facilities, and\n            telecommunications and control systems; and 6) project\n            engineering and management consultancy services."}, "docdt": "1994-08-30T00:00:00Z"}
