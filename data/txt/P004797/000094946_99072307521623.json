"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Overall, the project was satisfactory.\n            Substantial objectives were met, with considerable\n            under-runs, namely due to a highly competitive environment,\n            in particular, the offshore pipeline. Although the lessons\n            learned from this project, are no different than many other\n            projects, in that government commitment and ownership is\n            paramount for success, risk mitigation should be pursued,\n            and, efficient and consistent teams are advantageous during\n            project cycle, some major lessons are brought under\n            consideration: 1) Despite the existing rule for\n            pre-qualification of bidders, it is important to reiterate\n            the Bank's Procurement Guidelines, even when financing\n            is provided through non-Bank funds. This would ensure\n            governments of the soundness of the various prospective\n            contractors. 2) The outcome of projects is particularly\n            based on the quality and firmness of supervision, which\n            pursues compliance with covenants. It was this persistence\n            which successfully brought to conclusion a delayed\n            Corporatization/Privatization study, a basic document in the\n            far reaching organizational and strategic reform of the\n            Petroleum Authority of Thailand. 3) The pace of reforms\n            should largely be left to the borrower's judgement, for\n            it is the incremental, sequential, and steady approaches\n            which provide a sustainable likelihood. Much of the project\n            success was due to mutual trust between the Bank and the Borrower."}, "docdt": "1999-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
