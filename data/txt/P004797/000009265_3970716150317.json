The project consists of supply and construction\n            of a gas transmission system including related ancillary\n            facilities.  The potential soil erosion and terrestrial\n            ecology impact can be mitigated by a minimization of the\n            clearing area and backfilling and replacement of groundcover\n            after pipeline burial.  The marine water quality and the\n            aquatic biology may be affected by sea bottom disturbance,\n            waste disposal, chemical discharge from the hydrostatic\n            test, and gas leakage from the pipeline.  These can be\n            mitigated by the selection of spoil areas for trenching,\n            placing gravel at spans, prohibition of waste dumping,\n            provision of onboard waste receptacles, the use of proper\n            hydrostatic test chemicals, and the installation of on-line\n            gas leakage and pressure change detection systems.  The\n            public health/safety impacts during construction come from\n            possible health problems and accidents, living conditions in\n            the construction camps, and possible gas leakage.  These are\n            mitigated by the provision of proper health and\n            environmental sanitation, adequate safety devices, and\n            stringent regulations combined with comprehensive training\n            programs.  The anticipated impacts are mostly short term and\n            relatively minor.  Furthermore, the mitigation measures\n            proposed will reduce the impacts to acceptable levels."}, "docdt": "1993-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
