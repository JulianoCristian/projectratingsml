"The Fourth (Namang and Taegu) Water\n            Supply Project consists of two water supply components: the\n            NRS, for 13 municipalities in the Kyeongnam Province and the\n            TWS for the city of Taegu. The project will improve water\n            services to about 2 million persons and provide water to\n            520,000 additional persons by 1991. The NRS includes a water\n            intake and about 80 kms of transmission pipelines with a\n            capacity of 115,000 metric tons per day (tpd), a treatment\n            plant with first stage capacity of 75,000 tpd, and storage\n            reservoirs of 12,000 tons capacity. Complementary\n            distribution networks in the two main project cities are\n            being cofinanced by the Asian Development Bank. The TWS\n            includes water intake and transmission facilities from the\n            Nakdong river, a 400,000 tpd water treatment plant, about\n            80,000 ton capacity reservoirs, the expansion of\n            distribution networks, the rehabilitation of existing\n            networks and a study for improving the organization of water\n            and sewerage services."}, "docdt": "1985-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
