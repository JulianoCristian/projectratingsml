                           Creditand ProgramSummary


Borrower:      The Republic o fBenin.

Amount:        SDR 19.9 million (US$30 million equivalent).

Terms:         Standard IDA terms; 40-year maturity with 10-year grace period.

Description:   The proposed operation constitutes the second o f a series o f Poverty
               Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs) designed to assist the Govemment in
               implementing its Poverty Reduction Strategy, launched in December 2002.
               PRSC series are an integral part o f the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
               (CAS), approved by the Board o f Executive Directors on July 3,2003.
               PRSC-1 (US$20 million equivalent, approved on March 18, 2004) aimed to:
               (a) develop and improve service delivery in core sectors (health, rural water,
               and basic education); (b) improve and strengthen public procurement; (c)
               establish a performance-based management and accountability framework;
               (d) set up an     incentive system that supports transparent, performance-
               focused management, supplemented by a modern and effective management
               control system; (e) develop a modern human resource management system,
               including continuous professional development for civil servants; (0 design a
               comprehensive participatory mechanism for monitoring, evaluation, and
               redress.
               As a follow-on to PRSC-1, PRSC-2 (US$30 million equivalent) would
               support: (a) key policy measures aimed at bolstering the medium-term
               macroeconomic      framework;   (b) the cross-cutting public expenditure
               management reform, civil service reform, and decentralization programs; (c)
               improved service delivery, good governance, and institutional capacity in the
               new sectors (i.e,, Rural Transport, Agriculture, and Justice); and (d)
               continued implementation o f the Health, the Education, the Rural, the
               Environment and Urban Sanitation and the Forest Management programs,
               including appropriate funding, execution, and monitoring.


Benefits:      The proposed PRSC-2 would help improve poverty reduction efforts by
               strengthening public expenditure management and the effectiveness o f
               service delivery. The line ministries are expected to become more
               responsible and efficient inbudget formulation and execution.


Risks:         The main risk i s the economy's vulnerability to a further drop in cotton
               prices and/or cotton production. Ongoing discussions with the Government
               and the other donors to accelerate reform o f the cotton sector should reduce
               this risk and make the sector more sustainable. Other main risks are: (a)
               vulnerability to economic and political developments inNigeria, which could
               damage Benin's development and poverty reduction efforts; (b) the

                   presidential campaign and election, which could create the political
                    conditions and institutional dynamics to increase fiduciary risk and slow the
                   pace o f reform; (c) inadequate institutional capacity, already strained by the
                   progressive expansion o f the PRSC program, which could slow the pace o f
                    improvements in public service delivery and the implementation o f core
                   reforms.
Estimated
Disbursements:      SDR 19.9 million (US$30 million equivalent) will be disbursed upon Credit

1 INTRODUCTION

1.      The Government of Benin has achieved remarkable progress in sustaining robust growth
while building a pluralist democracy over the past decade. Growth has generally exceeded that o f
other economies in the region,' and productivity gains have allowed per capita income to rise
despite high demographic growth rates. The Government's development program has been
successful in establishing steady fiscal discipline, opening up the economy, privatizing most public
enterprises, and improving the business environment.               Most social indicators progressively
improved throughout the 199Os, particularly ineducation and health. However, as noted inBenin's
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), Benin remains a poor country with a per-capita income
o f only US$440 in 2003. This reflects the country's low levels o f human and physical capital
(including insufficient health, education, transport, electricity, water and sanitation assets). In
addition, Benin remains highly dependent on cotton and re-exports to Nigeria and hence highly
vulnerable to cotton market conditions, and cyclical and policy shocks in Nigeria. As noted in the
Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) progress on poverty reduction needs to be
accelerated.
2.       The PRSP, approved in January 2003 and the result o f broad-based consultations with a
wide variety o f stockholders, reiterates the Government's commitment to sustaining reforms and
deepening its policies and programs in areas critical for growth and poverty reduction over the next
15 years. The PRSP indicates that the Government's poverty reduction strategy i s based on four
pillars: (a) bolstering the macroeconomic framework over the medium term; (b) strengthening
human development and environmental management, including improving access by the poor to
quality basic services (basic education, primary health care, water and sanitation, food security and
nutrition, adequate habitat, and rural roads); (c) improving governance and completing institutional
reforms in the areas o f decentralization, public administration, and the legal and judicial systems;
and (d) improving employment and income-generating opportunities for the poor, and
strengthening their capacity to participate indecision-making and production.
3.       In accordance with the PRSP, the PRSCs during the 2005-07 period will support the
Government's efforts to reduce poverty through a three-pronged approach: (a) implementation o f
policies designed to maintain macroeconomic stability and accelerate economic growth, with a
focus on completing the privatization program, creating a sound regulatory framework in
liberalized sectors, improving in the investment climate, and promoting good agriculture sector
management; (b) improvement o f basic services delivery; and (c) promotion o f good governance,
by implementing a comprehensive public sector management reform and strengthening the legal
and judicial systems. The Benin authorities also intend to: (d) address deficiencies in the existing
budget management system, by: (i)        transferring spending authority from the finance and planning
ministriesto decentralized levels o f government, within a stronger fiduciary framework; and (ii)
moving toward performance-based budgeting, under which progress would be monitored on the
basis o f explicit quantified indicators.
4.       Implementation of the PRSC-1 has been satisfactory, and the triggers spelled out in the
PRSC-1 document have been largely met. Inthe areas where they have been only partially met, or
where implementationhas been delayed (as inthe civil service reform programs), the medium-term


     Growth performance in Benin averaged 4.6 percent during the 1990s and rose to 5.6 percent during 2000-2002,
     comparedwith 2.3 for sub-SaharanAfrica and 3.6 for low-incomecountries during 2000s

program has been modified, infull agreement with the Bank and others donors, to reflect a credible
new roadmap to accelerate the reform. The overall satisfactory implementation and progress o f
PRSC-1 warrant the move to PRSC-2.


2     RECENTECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

2.1    GROWTH MACROECONOMIC
                   AND                     DEVELOPMENTS

5.       Macroeconomic performance inBenin has been broadly satisfactory duringthe last decade
since the devaluation o f the CFA franc in 1994. Most importantly, per capita income growth rose
from about one percent during 1990-95 to three percent in2003, and real GDP growth accelerated
from 4 percent during 1990-95 to more than five percent on average since 1996. In addition, the
prudent regional monetary policy conducted by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1iZfrique de
1'Ouest (BCEAO) has helped to keep inflation low. With the exception o f the two years following
the devaluation in January 1994, inflation averaged 3 percent over 1996-2003, which was in line
with that o fthe euro, the currency to which the CFA franc is pegged. Moreover, Benin contributed
positively to the net foreign assets o f the regional central bank, and its extemal account deficit
(excluding official grants) was around 8 percent o f GDP. Together with other West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries, Benin has maintained a liberal trade and
payment system, and i s considered a strong performer in trade liberalization. Import licensing
requirements have been abolished, non-tariffbarriers eliminated, and the regional common external
tariff (CET) has been implemented, including simplified tariff rates and a progressive elimination
o ftariffs within the WAEMU area.
6.       Performance during 2004, however, has been affected by Benin's two main vulnerabilities.
First,the disruptionincottonproductionin2003-04 (caused by the introductiono f a parallel circuit
for inputprovision and commercialization) may have worsened in 2004-05. Inaddition, as a result
o f the sharp decline in the world price for cotton, export revenue will be significantly lower than
projected. Given the importance o f the cotton sector, such disruptions are likely to affect growth
and living standards, especially in rural areas, where most o f the poor are located. Second, since
the beginning o f 2004, Nigeria has imposed new restrictions on Benin's re-exports. This measure
has already affected growth and custom revenues (notably, in the first quarter o f 2004, import
duties collected on re-exports to Nigeria were about 9 percent, or CFAF 4 billion lower than
projected. In addition, Benin's competitiveness has declined, as persistent weaknesses in the
management o f the Port o f Cotonou resulted in a loss o f transit traffic to the Port o f LomC (Togo),
and overall, as the euro has appreciated against the dollar. As a result o f all these factors, economic
activity i s estimated to have slumped in2004 to 2.7 percent, more than 2 percent below the average
performance for 2000-2003 (Table 1).
7.       The decline in economic growth and the cotton price shock has resulted in significant
stress to Benin's fiscal accounts in 2004. In particular, fiscal revenues in 2004 dropped by 1.4
percent o f GDP, or CFAF 30.4 billion below the estimated target. This was exacerbated by the
lack o f control over fiscal exemptions, and by the weak performance o f customs and the tax
administration. In view of the revenue shortfall, the Government proactively decided to cut total
public expenditure by CFAF 30 billion in 2004 (6.5 percent o f the total budget, excluding public
debt) while protecting priority sectors to the extent possible, and especially PRSC sectors and
programs. The authorities also took steps to improve customs and tax administration in 2004,
avoiding further revenue shortfalls. With these measures, overall, the increase in the fiscal deficit
was moderate, from 4.6 percent in2003 to 4.8 percent in2004.

8,       The volatility o f international cotton prices i s likely to continue to put stress on both
internal and external balances in2005. Given the impact o f the low world prices on income for the
rural households, the Government decided to provide a subsidy (0.8 percent o f the GDP) to the
cotton producers in order to keep the producers prices at the level o f the 2003/2004 campaign
(200CFAFkg). Wage concessions made early in 2005 to end a prolonged teachers' strike (0.4
percent o f GDP) coupled with forthcoming election spending will raise total public expenditure to
23.2 percent o f the GDP. A decline in cotton prices and additional spending including wages
concessions would lead to a fiscal deficit o f 5.7 percent o f the GDP without grants and a current
account balance around -9.7 percent o fthe GDP.
9.       For Benin to resume a sustainable growth trend above five percent starting in 2006, the
Govemment needs to continue implement the cotton sector reform program, strengthen fiscal
management, and improve the climate for private sector investment. With regard to the latter, the
private sector climate will benefit from regulatory, legal and judicial reforms and well-targeted
infrastructure investments. The Government i s preparing such a program with the support o f PRSC
2 as described below. Redressing the fiscal situation and ensuring stability will require swift
improvement in the performance o f customs and the fiscal administration, as well as expenditure
management and control. The Govemment has already taken important steps in this direction. The
forthcoming IMF PRGF agreement will help the Government identify a strong fiscal program,
including appropriate targets and further measures.


2.2     RECENT BUDGET       PERFORMANCE

10.      The budget performance over the period 2000-03 has been generally satisfactory, with the
overall fiscal deficit (payment order basis, excluding grants) averaging 4 percent o f GDP. This has



                                                      3

reflected a steady increase in tax revenues (from 14.6 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 16.6 percent in
2003), coupledwith a moderate increase intotal expenditures (by 1.4 percent o f GDP).
11,      Regarding the PRSP priorities, the Government has gradually increased the budgetary
allocation for basic services. The share of total budget allocated to rural water, health, and basic
education has increased from 19.5 percent in2000 to 21.3 percent in2003. Primary expenditures in
the three sectors were CFAF 101.4 billion in 2003, corresponding to an increase o f 6 percent
compared to the previous year, while total primary expenditures increased by only 2 percent. The
sectors included in the PRSC program accounted for 53.1 percent o f the total budget (current and
capital) in2003, 54.8 percent in2004, and will account for 56 percent in2005.
12.      These increased budget allocations have not, however, translated into an increased
executionrate inthe social sectors. Total payments (current and capital) in2003 show an execution
rate o f 84 percent, with lower rates in the health, water and energy ministries,respectively (78 and
58 percent). On average over the 2001-03 period, the end-of-year budget execution rates tended to
be lower for social sectors than for other sectors, and insufficient progress has been made in
reducing this gap. To raise the level and quality o f social expenditures, the Government will need
to pursue the overall reforms inpublic expenditure management, making a special effort to address
the lower absorptive capacity o f the social ministries.


2.3    POVERTY,VULNERABILITY, AND STANDARD OFLIVING

13,      Despite Benin's satisfactory economic performance, poverty remains widespread. On the
basis of the poverty lines calculated from 2003 Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire (CWIQ)
survey data, 22 percent o f the population (1.5 million) can be considered extremely poor and 39
percent (2.6 million) can be considered poor in monetary terms. Monetary poverty i s more
widespread and deeper in rural areas. Almost half o f all rural dwellers (47 percent) have
expenditures below the poverty line, as compared to 29 percent o f people living in urban areas.
Thus, about three quarters o f the poor (74 percent) and of the extremely poor (76 percent) live in
the countryside, although rural people comprise only 61.1 percent o f the population. The recent
development on the international market with respect to the cotton sector will have a negative
impact on the welfare o f the rural population and particularly those involved in the cotton
production ifthe Government let the actual lower price pass through to cotton producers.
14.      According to the results o f the 2002 census, socioeconomic indicators inBenin also remain
very low. The lack o f progress in controlling population growth (3.2 percent) due to high fertility
rates (which i s estimated at 5.5) continues to limit the impact o f income growth on poverty
indicators. Malnutrition i s still high, with almost one third o f children under five being stunted (11
percent severely so), including nearly two fifths (38 percent) o f children aged 12-59 months.
Wasting i s apparent in 7.5 percent o f children (1.6 percent i s severe), and almost one child in four
(23 percent) has low weight. Anemia i s very common: 8 children out o f 10 are anemic (including
light, moderate, and severe forms o f anemia), as are 60 percent o f women o f reproductive age.
Moreover, although the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) indicator (underweight
malnutrition) is improving, chronic malnutrition or stunting (considered a better indicator of
poverty) increased from 25 percent in 1996 to 30.7 percent in 2001 according to the Demographic
and Health Surveys (DHS) o f 1996 and 200l(Annex 1).
15.      Health indicators follow a pattern similar to those o f nutrition. Despite dramatic
improvements in immunization coverage, DTP3 rose from 17 percent in 1985 to 73 percent in
2001, and child mortality rate stands at 146 per thousand - far above the MDG target o f 60 per
thousand by 2015. The MDG target for maternal mortality rate also seems to be out o f reach,
because it i s decreasing very slowly, from 498 per 100,000 live births in 1996 to 474 in 2002.

                                                    4

Malaria i s the most common and most deadly disease in Benin. In 1999, the incidence o f declared
cases in health centers was 120 per 1,000 within the general population, 219 per 1,000 among
children under 5, and 437 per 1,000 among infants (0-11 months). During the past decade, the
prevalence o f HIV/AIDS grew from 0.3 percent to 4.1percent.
16.      In the area of education, poor quality and efficiency remain important concems. In
addition, the net primary enrollment rate, estimated at 51.3 percent, i s low and shows important
disparities by gender and region (dipartement). Throughout the country, girls' net enrollment
remains 11.6 percentage points below that o f boys, and gender differences in adult literacy remain
high(25 percent for women, 48 percent for men). Both repeater and dropout rates are high, and
more than halfthe children who start school (54 percent) never finishprimary school.
17.      Although there has been progress in water and sanitation over the past'decade, effective
potable water coverage i s only 40 percent because o f inadequate maintenance, drying out o f wells,
and insufficient back-up systems. Access to hygienic disposal o f fecal matter remains low inurban
areas (63 percent) and extremely low inrural areas (15 percent).
18.      Duringthe 199Os, the implementation o f the broad development strategy was successful
overall, in terms o f both economic growth and improved social indicators. However, a sharp
acceleration o f current trends i s needed for Benin to reach its development goals (see Annex 1:
Progress Toward the MDGs). There i s a widely shared perception o f unrealized potential and
unmet expectations, due at least inpart to the insufficient depth o f some o f the reforms, especially
those linked to sectoral policies and institutional reforms.


2.4    MEDIUM-TERMPROSPECTSANDEXTERNAL                   FINANCING REQUIREMENTS

19.      Macroeconomic projections for 2005-07 have been revised, due to recent revision o f the
growth rate (3.6 percent) in 2005 and additional pressures on public expenditures. Total spending
inthe budget was limitedto 21percent, butnew factors would increasethis amount to 23.2 percent
including the cotton subsidy and wage concessions to civil servants. According to the new
projections, economic growth could gradually recover to 5 percent in 2006, in line with the 2000-
2003 period, provided that the Govemment takes strong action to: (a) ensure that the 2004-05 and
future cotton campaigns are managed according to the newly established framework; (b) improve
management o f the Port o f Cotonou; and (c) improve the private sector environment. Even so, if
restrictions on Benin's re-export to Nigeria are maintained, the Government's revenue to GDP ratio
would remain at 16.5 percent, below the target o f 17 percent. Inorder to keep the fiscal deficit at
around 5.7 percent percent, total government expenditure needs to be reduced by 1.5 percent o f
GDP in 2005 compared to initial projections. The Ministry o f Finance and Economy (MFE) has
revised downward the indicative sector budget envelopes for 2005-07. Nevertheless, the revised
budget i s in line with the PRSP's objectives, and sectoral allocations reflect the Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF).
20.      Debt Sustainability.InMarch 2003, Benin reached its completion point inthe context o f
the HIPC Initiative. Benin's updatednet present value (NPV) o f debt-to-exports ratio at end-2003,
after full delivery o f enhanced HIPC assistance and additional bilateral debt relief, i s estimated to
be 196 percent. This represents an increase o f 41 percentage points comparedto the ratio estimated
at end-2001 - the reference date for the Completion Point Document. The updated debt figures
follow the same declining trend as the completion point projections, but remain above the threshold
over the complete period o f analysis (2004-10). Benin's debt sustainability situation, therefore, has
to be monitored closely. The updated debt service ratio also shows a declining trend, averaging 6
percent over the medium term. The depreciation o f the U.S. dollar against major intemational
currencies, and the decline in discount rates from end-2001 to end-2003 are the main factors

                                                     5

leading to the increase in the dollar value o f the NPV o f debt relative to completion point
projections. The effect o f new disbursements since the completion point on the NPV o f debt-to-
exports ratio i s almost offset by increased exports earnings.

21.      Benin has a very good track record o f servicing its debt obligations. Combined with
satisfactory implementation o f refoms and continued macroeconomic stability, Benin i s expected
to discharge its future obligations in a timely manner. The authorities established a national debt
committee, chaired by the Minister o f Finance and Economy, which became operational in
December 2003, The committee monitors Benin's extemal debt situation, reviews proposals for
new external loans, and makes recommendations for altemative financing sources in light o f the
Government's objective o f keeping the debt at a sustainable level.
22,      FinancingRequirements. After taking into account new macroeconomic developments,
including the shortfall o f govemment revenue, recent developments in the cotton sector such as the
decline o f the price and the ensuing subsidy to cotton farmers, revised data indicate that Benin's
external financing requirements for 2005 will be around US$159 million, including grants and
loans (Table 2.3). Based on the Government's projections and staff estimates, the expected


                                                       6

financing gap for 2005 i s about U S 6 8 million. The proposed Credit o f US$30 million would
constitute part o f IDA'S contribution to filling the external financing gap. Based on the last
information available on identified external sources, the AfDB, EU, Denmark, the Netherlands and
Switzerland - would contribute up to US$25 million. The Government i s seelung additional
resources to fill the residual gap (US$13 million).

3      BENIN'SPOVERTYREDUCTIONSTRATEGY

23.       The Government has approved in January 2003 a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP), which was the result from broad-based consultations o f all stakeholders. The PRSP
outlines and prioritizes the Government's poverty reduction strategy based on four pillars: (a)
bolstering the medium-term macroeconomic framework; (b) strengthening human development and
environmental management, including improving the access o f the poor to quality basic services
(basic education, primary health care, water and sanitation, food security and nutrition, adequate
habitat, and rural roads);            (c) improving governance and institutional reforms, such as
decentralization, public administration reform, and the strengthening o f the legal and judicial

                                                             7

system; and (d) improving employment or income-generating opportunities for the poor and
strengthening their capacity to participate indecision making and production.
24.      Benin's PRSP was discussed at the Bank and Fund Boards in March 2003. The PRSP
provides a framework for aligning donor assistance programs, including those o f the Bank and the
Fund, with the country's poverty reductionefforts.
25.      The Government has prepared a first annual progress report and has organized a joint
Government/donors annual review inFebruary 2005. A draft was discussed within the Government
as well as with civil society and the private sector, both at the central and regionalAoca1levels. The
consultation program was designed to reach the same stakeholders as those who were consulted
duringthe preparation o fthe PRSP.


4     WORLD BANK STRATEGYFOR SUPPORTINGTHE PRSP

4.1    PRSCFRAMEWORK           RATIONALE

26.      The proposed series o f credits (PRSC-2 in2005, and then PRSC-3 in2006), are intended to
provide core support to implement the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy as envisioned in
the PRSP and the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, approved by the Board inJuly
2003). It i s consistent with the Government's explicit call in the PRSP for donors to move
progressively toward programmatic lending and budget support. It i s also consistent with the
strategic option elaborated in the CAS for FY04-07 (Report NO 26054-BEN) to pursue a transition
toward consolidated programmatic lending through a series of PRSCs, which would aim at
replicating, at the sector level, the good performance and implementationrecord that Benin has had
at the macro level. These credits would provide selective support for the measures envisaged inthe
PRSP, focusing on key policy interventions and institutional reforms inpriority areas under three
o f the four pillars o f the PRSP.
27.      The proposed Credit i s the second inthis series o f PRSCs, and the rationale for continuing
Bank support to the PRSP through PRSCs remains valid. The move toward a policy and results-
based dialogue (initiated under the Public Expenditure Reform Adjustment Credit (PERAC) in
2001) has gained momentum over the past twelve months, leading to improved dialogue and
interactions between the Ministry o f Finance and Economy and line ministries, and to increasing
Government leadership inprogrampreparationand implementation and donor coordination.

4.2     PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND SEQUENCING

28.      Program Objectives. The overarching objectives o f the proposed PRSCs are hence to
support implementationo f Benin's PRSP inline with the CAS, and to strengthen the Government's
capacity to design and carry out its own development and poverty reduction programs. The PRSC
series has been designed to include both sectoral and crosscutting reform programs that are critical
for progress toward the PRSP goals and the MDGs.
29. PRSC-1 helped to create the basis for private sector-led economic growth by supporting: (a)
the Government's macroeconomic program and measures to improve the investment climate; (b)
the the Government's reform agenda and expenditure program in key sectors (rural water, health,
basic education, environment and sanitation, and forestry); and (c) implementation o f a public
expenditure management reform program with the view to increasing the poverty impact o f
expenditures.
30.      The proposed PRSC-2 will aim at enhancing and consolidating results achieved under
PRSC-1, while laying the foundation for a set o f new reforms that are essential for achieving and

                                                   8

sustaining the PRSP goals. The second Credit proposes to deepen the content o f reformprograms
inlight of lessons learned from PSRC-1, and progressively expands coverage to three new sectors
(agriculture, rural transportation, and justice). At the core o f PRSC-2 are a number o f reforms to
improve governance, enhance the private sector environment, and improve public service delivery,
Implementations of PRSC-1 and MTEF have encouraged the Government to develop a framework
for public service that focuses on targets and results. PRSC-2 would expand this framework to new
sectors, and support the expansion with complementary reforms in the civil service regime. The
budget system reforms would be enhanced by complementary initiatives in monitoring and
evaluation, decentralization, and service delivery, especially in the social sectors and in rural
development and transport.
31.      Sectoral Coverage and Reform Programs. The authorities have decided to expand the
coverage o f the PRSC to provide further incentives for improvements in sector policy and
management in critical sectors. Inthis regard, PRSC-1 covered three sectors in "emphasis mode"
(rural water, health, and basic education), two others in "maintenance mode"' (environment and
forestry), and the public expenditure management reform as a core segment. PRSC-2 proposes to
include three new sectors essential to achieve PRSP objectives (agriculture, rural transport and
justice).   The inclusion o f these new sectors reflects the fact that the Government has made
significant progress in developing sectoral strategies, and a credible agenda o f public expenditure
reforms for each o f those sectors. However, the Government has not yet developed, for those
sectors, either: (a) full-fledged, results-based operational programs; (b) baseline data; or a complete
set of measurable results/outcome indicators to monitor progress toward achieving the objectives o f
the PRSP.
 32.     In the new sectors, the PRSC-2 would support the critical measures necessary for each
 sector to be able to: (a) formulate a results-based operational program, including measurable
results/outcome targets; (b) strengthen sector management; and (c) put in place the instruments
needed to ensure effective implementation o f the PRSC-2 program. Financing needs for the
program would be carefully assessedthrough the overall review o f MTEF 2005-07, with a view to
 limiting pressure on public spending, while laying the groundwork for the sectors to fully
participate inthe reformprocess. These sectors would be lightly coveredinthe policy matrix at this
 stage, and would be subject to selected policy-based prior actions and benchmarks. The following
 Chart 1 summarizes the proposed evolution o f the PRSC program over time, and the current focus
 o f PRSC-2.




      These two subsector programshave achievedimpressive resultsunderPERAC, and no substantialpolicy issues are
      expected. Support under the PRSCs would ensure that that these programs are properly funded, executed, and
      monitored.

33,      Cross-CuttingReformPrograms. Inaddition to the macroeconomic framework, PRSC-2
would support the Government's efforts to formulate a sound and comprehensive private sector
development strategy by November 2005. Such a strategy would represent a major element o f the
reform program to be supported under PRSC-3. Inaddition, PRSC-2 would continue to focus on
selective crosscutting themes that are critical to improving service delivery. These will include:
     -    The civil service reform by helping the Government formulate through a participatory
          approach a meaningful and feasible reform action plan while building on going
          experiences at the sector levels and addressing some o f the issues identified in the short-
          term.
     -    The consolidation o f the public expenditure management reform along with the
          decentralization process.
34.      The matrix o f policies and actions supported by the PRSCs (Schedule 2) reflects the
agreements reached with the Government and i s structured around the three pillars o f the PRSP: (a)
accelerating sustainable economic growth; (b) improving basic services and environmental
protection; and (c) ensuring good governance. It reflects also recent agreements reached with the
Government and the donors who are providing budget support to use a unique policy matrix as the
basis to monitor implementation o f main structural and sectoral reforms. However, building on
lessons learned from PRSC-1 and recommendations received from reviewers, a simplified version
o f the unique matrix was proposed and agreed on with all parties.

5     OVERALLPROGRESSOF REFORM SINCEPRSC-1

35.      Overall, progress in achieving the PRSP objectives has been satisfactory during the past
12-18 months. Implementation has shown broad areas o f strength, such as public expenditure
management and service delivery, but some delays in other areas. Achievements under the three
PRSP pillars are presentedinthe paragraphs below.
36.      Since PRSC-2 prior actions are completed and compensatory actions have been taken, it is
proposed to proceed with the presentation o f the proposed PRSC-2 to the Board. Table 4 lists the
PRSC-2 prior actions as presented in the PRSC-1 Board document, together with the currently
agreed prior actions if different, building on lessons learned and focusing on the most critical
actions to move the reforms in important areas forward. Slippages are observed especially in the
areas o f civil service reform and internal fiduciary controls, and to a lesser extent the management
o f village-based water points. Annex 2 presents also a detailed account o f implementation o f
measures and actions contained inthe PRSC-1 policy matrix.

5.1     PILLAR 1-ACCELERATE         SUSTAINABLE     ECONOMIC    GROWTH

37.      The Government has been successful in maintaining macroeconomic stability, and has
taken the necessary steps to mitigate the effects o f lower fiscal revenues on public expenditure
management, as well as on program objectives. Spending on priority sectors and investments to
enhance the efficiency o f service delivery has been maintained.            Further, tax and customs
administrationwere improved. However, the recent deterioration o f economic activity described in
section 2.1 ledto a stagnation o f GDP per capita in2004.
38.      The privatization o f SONAPRA's ginning plants i s being completed, and a regulatory
framework for cotton has been developed and agreed upon by all the actors in the sector. These
achievements join with Government's withdrawal from virtually all commercial activities and will
establish a privately functioning cotton sector.        It is expected that with the privatization o f
SONAPRA, competition will increase, and the benefits o f liberalizing the sector will result inclear
signals to private operators. Progress in implementing other structural reforms has been more
modest especially with respect to privatization o f utilities. However, the preparation for
privatizationo f the electricity utilityi s proceeding on schedule.

5.2     PILLAR 2-IMPROVE       SERVICE     DELIVERY

39.       Significant progress has been made in implementing sectoral reforms, as well as in
expandingbasic services delivery inall the main PRSC sectors, with gradual improvements inmost
outcome and output indicators. Improvingthe quality o f services remains the key challenge.
40.      Rural Water. The Government has continued to make significant progress, increasing
access to potable water by the rural population to 36 percent in 2003, up from 31percent in 2001.
Preliminary data indicate that execution o f the 2004 program has been satisfactory. It i s estimated
that some 1,200 new water points have been delivered by the end o f the calendar year (against the
annual objective o f 700), which will provide safe water to approximately 300,000 additional
people. This performance i s due to: (a) significant improvements inprograming activities focused
on the MDGtarget o f 1,350 water points per year up to 2015; (b) fewer delays inprocurement; (c)
strong and high quality support to the Directorate o f Water from other donors, in particular
DANIDA and GTZKfW; and (d) an increase intotal financing from donors through stand-alone
water projects. Progress has also beenrecorded in the following specific areas:
     -   First,in October 2004, the Government updatedand validated the RWSS strategy inorder
         to: (a) take into account the new context o f the decentralization. The Ministry o f Water has


                                                     11

        been decentralized since early 2004, and eleven departments in different areas o f the
        country now have fully operational water units; (b) improve its focus on gender issues, and
        effectively boost women's participation in all mobilization activities and their
        responsibilities in water point management; and (c) address the need to increase the
        sector's delivery capacity andthe sustainability o f services.
    -   Second, in response to the high priority given to potable water supply in the PRSP, the
        Government has substantially increased domestic funding for sector activities. It i s
        estimated that the total expenditures for the water sector in 2004 have reached CFAF 11.7
        billion, against CFAF 7.6 in 2003. Internal resources have accounted for about 28 percent
        o f this spending, against an average o f 13 percent over 1997-2002.
    -   Third, there has been progress in improving the monitoring and evaluation system,
        through: (a) the completion o f an exhaustive field water points census in 2004; (b) the
        implementation o f a nationwide computerized database for water facilities and water
        resources management (which i s expected to directly issue the main sector performance
        indicators in2005); and (c) the development o f specific procedures for data collection and
        reporting.
41.     However, the realization o f the prior action on rural water has been delayed due to the
limited capacity in the Directorate o f Rural Water under its increased work program. The Bank
team and the sector donors have also deemed it necessary to refine the prior action in light o f a
broader proposal to establish partnerships between the public and private sector inmanaging water
points in secondary towns which will be completed by November 2005 (see triggers for PRSC-3 in
section 7.2). Furthermore, a compensatory prior action for PRSC-2 has been identified and agreed
on to replace the former, and has actually been fully met (table 4).
42.     Health. The Government has made progress interms o f health outcomes even though the
performance o f the sector continues to be mixed. The Demographic and Health Survey o f 2001
indicates that modem contraceptive use increased to 7 percent o f the population, as compared to 3
percent in 1996. Furthermore, MOH statistics show that the proportion o f attended deliveries rose
from 56 percent in 2000 to 76 percent in2003, and the immunization coverage (DTP3) o f children
below one year o f age increased from 73 percent to more than 80 percent during the same period.
The country i s doing well with regard to vaccine independence. In addition, the number o f well-
functioning health districts rose from 4 in 2000 to 13 in 2003, and implementation o f the new
monitoring and evaluation mechanismagreed upon with donors (including the Bank) i s inprogress.
A M&E unit has been put in place within the Directorate o f Planning and Prospective (DPP), and
MOHhas updatedthe core health statistics to include private sector health center activities.
43,     Progress has been made inimplementing the plannedreforms inthe following key areas:       .
    -   First, to address the human resources-related constraints in the sector, the Government
        adopted a human resource management strategy in M a y 2004, and i s preparing an
        implementation action plan. This plan, which needs to be compatible with the civil service
        statute and available financing, will include the identification o f incentives to encourage
        deployment o f needed staff to remote areas. Such incentives will be implemented on a pilot
        basis inselected districts duringPRSC-3.
    -   Second, through execution o f the 2004 program budget, and in line with the
        decentralization process, the Government began to transfer funds in 2004 to the 34 health
        district management teams to cover their operating costs.
    -   Third, with support from the Bank, an informal Country Health Status Report was finalized
        in June 2004 as an entry point for the Marginal Budgeting for Bottlenecks (MBB)
        approach.

                                                   12

     -   Fourth, the 2005 program-budget preparation has taken into consideration poverty and
         performance criteria, which has led to a significant increase o f the share o f allocated credits
         to health districts.
44.      The two prior actions have been satisfactorily completed, even though the one related to
the community outreach program has been slightly re-formulated to reflect some delays observed
indefining this package (see table 4). As mentionedinAnnex 2, weak capacity inMOHhas ledto
a slow execution o f preparatory work for implementing planned innovations in the areas such as
the setting contracts between ministry and hospitals and the decentralized health districts.
45.      Education. The education sector remains a key priority of the Government, as evidenced
by the increased access to education at all levels, and to basic education inparticular. Duringthe
past few years, public spending on education averaged 3.7 percent o f GDP, and reached 23 percent
o f the national budget (excluding debt service) in2004. Gross enrollment inprimary education has
increased from 84 percent3 in 2002-03 to 86 percent in 2003-04. Education completion rates have
slightly increased, but remain low due to continued weak school retention. The primary education
completion rate increased from 46 percent in 2001-02 to 50 percent in 2003-04, according to
preliminary figures (against 53 percent projected); but the repetition rate remains high, as does the
drop-out rate, reflecting the persistence o f both demand and supply issues (schooling costs,
schooling discontinuity, etc). Progress inreducing gender and geographic disparities as well as in
improving quality o f education has been modest and constitutes a key challenge.
46.      Over the past months the Government has made progress in implementing important
measures aiming at improving education indicators. These include the following:
     -   First, it has conducted an external evaluation o fthe implementationo f educational reforms
         launched in 1998 and adopted a detailed action plan to address identified weaknesses and
         shortfalls. Concrete steps have been taken during the 2003-04 school year to implement
         this plan, which includes: (a) targeted in-service training to teachers and school principals;
         (b) a streamlined curriculum ingrades 1and 2, and streamlined teaching guides for grades
         1 to 4; and (c) class restructuring. Furthermore, textbooks have become more available
         with the purchase and distribution o f about 500,000 textbooks under the 2004 budget.
         Finally, a PASEC learning evaluation study was launched in October 2004 to monitor
         student-learning achievements and preliminary results are expectedby early 2006.
     -   Second, the Government has adopted an action plan to progressively increase retention in
         primary education. Repetition o f Grade 1 has been abolished, and targeted interventions
         have been launched (girl's education programs in 25 targeted districts, school meal
         services in additional 60 schools, etc) to promote schooling demands as well as to reduce
         the drop-out rate inunderserved areas.
     -   Third, 1183 new contractual teachers have been recruited through a decentralized process,
         which has made more teachers available in poor areas and helped slightly reduce the
         disparity in teacher allocations among regions. The studentheacher ratio in public schools
         has decreased slightly (from 55.7 to 53.2). This i s because enrollment has increased faster
         than new teachers have been added, and repetition has not declined as expected. The
         process aimed at providing subsidies to communities to pay the salaries o f about 3,500
         community teachers (who constitute the bulk o f teachers in underserved areas) has started
         slowly and became fully operational when the new school year became effective inJanuary
         2005.
47.      Implementation of the two education sector-related prior actions has been satisfactory,
even though some slight adjustments were discussed and agreed on to reflect the fact that (a)

     The utilization of the 2002 census data has led to a revisiondownward of the Gross Enrollment Rate series.

                                                              13

expenditure cuts have not permit the execution o f the targeted program as planed (82 percent has
been achieved base on commitments), (b) budget constraints again have led to a more modest
target for the school discontinuity program for 2005, and (c) the preparation o f the multi-grade
teaching program has faced clear resistance from some key stakeholders. The new minister i s
demonstrating strong leadership on this latter point and a workshop i s scheduled for end May 2005
to reach a consensus on the existing draft program. With regardto the preparation o f the integrated
sectoral strategy and a ten-year program, policy framework finalized with the technical support o f
the sector donors has been approved by the Government in March 2005. The on-going positive
dynamics have recently led to the decision made by the EFA-FTIsecretariat to invite the country to
join this initiative in2005.
48.     Environment and Forestry. The review o f budget execution for the last quarter o f 2004
has shown that MEHUachieved commendable results, despite the problems observed inthe public
expenditure management chain during the first quarter o f 2004. The Ministry has taken concrete
steps toward ensuring that line ministries comply with national regulations on environmental
impact assessments and audits. The Ministry has also commissioned an evaluation study on the
functioning o f the sectoral environmental units, helping the line ministries to establish more
effective internal enforcement and compliance mechanisms for environmental assessment.
Delivery o f urban sanitation and sewerage services has increasedin several cities.
49.      Significant progress has been recorded,with respect to the forestry management. These
include the following actions and measures:
    -    First,the Govemment has launched studies onthe main sector performance. These include:
         taxation o f fuel wood, timber pricing, and an export ban on unprocessedteak wood.
    -    Second, preparatory studies for privatization o f the timber parastatal, ONAB, have been
         completed and served as the basis for the selection o f the "reprenew" o f the industrial
         branch o f ONAB (SACLO). On the institutional side, the Government has continued to
         implement the staffing program, but with some delay and the reporting and M&E systems
         have also improved,
    -    Third, despite a delay in budget execution, great progress has also been achieved in the
         field. A sensitization campaign was launched at the national level to increase awareness o f
         the benefits o fparticipatory management o f forest resources. The equipment purchased in
         2003 has yielded improvements in the control o f forestry activities, and generated CFAF
         312 million in taxes and fines, which i s three times higher that the amount collected in
         2001.

5.3    PILLAR3 -IMPROVING GOVERNANCE             AND PUBLIC SECTORMANAGEMENT

50.      Public Expenditure Management Reforms. In 2001, the Government launched a major
reform to enhance public expenditure management as a basis for improving governance and
transparency,     and for moving toward programmatic lending (such operations included
IDARERAC, AfDBPARE3,France/PAAFIE, EUPUM). While addressing major deficiencies in
the existing budget management system, the reform focused on two fimdamental changes: (a)
delegation o f spending authority from the finance and planning ministries to line agencies, and
eventually to decentralized levels o f government within a stronger fiduciary framework; and (b) a
move toward performance-based budgeting through well-defined program budgets formulated
within a medium-term expenditure framework, under which progress would be monitored on the
basis o f explicit quantified indicators.
51.      Implementation o f these reforms has stayed on track, despite their broad scope. Results-
based budgeting has progressively been put in place in line ministries, along with efforts to

                                                   14

improve their monitoring and evaluation capacity. While reforms in the fields o f budget execution,
fiduciary management, and auditing systems have generally progressed well, some shortcomings
have been noted with respect to the utilization o f exceptional budget execution procedures. The
Government and the Bank have agreed on a set o f measures to address these issues inthe short and
medium terms as described below.
52.      Budget execution and accounting.           The Government has continued its efforts to
decentralize the computerized expenditure management system (SIGFIP) to line ministries, with a
view to reducing budget execution delays. As o f end 2004, external debt and only a small portion
o f the externally financed investment projects have been fully covered by the system, and the
External Debt Management Agency has started capturing donor-financed expenditures in SIGFIP.
Current and investment expenditures have been integrated into the budget, although execution i s
still fragmented and the budget reporting system needs to be strengthened. MOF has made
significant efforts to clear the backlog in its budget execution accounting, including the
development o f ASTER, a public accounting system, in August 2004. The coherence between the
closing and the opening balance o f accounts has improved significantly. Moreover, some line
ministries have improved the recording, follow-up, and clearing o f suppliers' arrears. The 2005
budget has been prepared in terms o f program authorizations and payment appropriations.
However, progress in putting in place performance-based programs has been slow due to a low
level o f institutional capacity, in particular within the Ministry o f Finance. It was thus agreed to
pilot the experience in a limited number o f line ministries. The capacity o f the Technical Unit in
charge o f the Reform (ETARB) i s being strengthened through the recruitment o f additional
qualified staff so as to improve its ability to provide technical support to line ministries and oversee
the implementation o f this reform.
53.      The Chamber o f Accounts has regularly produced reports on budget execution, as well as
performance audits for selected ministries. It has carried out performance audits up to 2001 for the
ministries first involved in PERAC. Due to the yet limited capacity o f the institution, the 2002 and
2003 audits will be completed by end July 2005. The Chamber o f Accounts i s also catching up on
the verification o f government accounts: the accounts for 2001 and 2002 will be completed by end
September 2005, and those for 2003 and 2004 will be completed by November 2005. Its findings
and recommendations are leading to progressive improvements o f the preparation and execution o f
programbudgets by the concerned ministries.
 54.     In the area of internal control system, the General Inspectorate for Finance has started
implementing the action plan agreed upon during PRSC-1, including training o f staff to carry out
performance audits and elaborating a manual o f procedures. Draft texts to clarify the overall
control systems have been prepared, but their adoption (one o f the initial prior action) i s behind
 schedule. These draft texts have led to consultations among various institutions currently involved
in the control system. Building consensus among stakeholders about whether ex-ante financial
control (carried out by the contr6lefinancier) and the ex-post controls (IGF and DIVI) should be
under the same layer has required the development o f some buy-in strategies to ensure effective
implementation of the reform program. The authorities plan to validate and adopt the new decrees
on the internal control by September 2005, buildingon technical assistance providedby the EU.
 55.     Public procurement.       A new law was adopted by the National Assembly in 2004,
amending the institutional framework o f the Procurement Code, and creating and defining the
attribute of: (a) the National Regulatory Agency for Procurement (CNRMP); (b) the National
Executing Agency for Public Procurement (DNMP); and (c) procurement units inall ministries and
 eventually in the regional administrations and local governments (CMP). In addition, the legal




                                                    15

texts4 accompanying the law amending the framework o f the procurement code were adopted by
the Council o f Ministers. Progress i s being made in setting up the above entities, and the technical
secretariat o f the CNCS (the Steering Committee) i s temporarily in charge to follow up on the
reform until the creation o f CNRMP. The delays encountered by the Government in setting up the
institutional framework have left little time for the implementation o f the series o f subsequent
operational activities programmed for 2004 related to modernizing procurement procedures,
buildingcapacity, controlling the system (through audits and complaint mechanisms), or reducing
corruption inpublic procurement. These have now been programmed for 2005 with the agreement
o f the Government.
56.       Civil Service and Decentralization. Overall, progress in civil service reform has been
delayed.    Preparation o f the comprehensive public administration reform (one o f the triggers
identified in PRSC-1) has been delayed due to limited capacity and lack o f consensus among key
stakeholders on the objectives and means o f the reform.                       Implementation o f the new
decentralization framework and process has also been slow. However, a number o f important
initiatives have been taken in the Ministry in charge o f Public Administration and Civil Service
Reform (MEFTRA) and at the sector level that should facilitate the development o f a more
comprehensive reformprogram and increase the responsibility o f line ministries for managing their
human resources. These actions include: (a) the regionalizedrecruitment o f contracted teachers in
primary education; (b) the transfer o f education fundingto the school level; (c) the development o f
a human resources program in the health sector, along with an incentive scheme to facilitate
personnel deployment; (d) the empowerment o f communities in the management o f social
facilities; and (e) the transfer o f responsibility o f managing urban projects and maintaining urban
infrastructures and communal services to local communes/governments (collectivitds locales). The
Government has also delegated MPTRA's responsibility for managing teachers' careers to the
three ministries in charge of the education sector.
57.       The importance o f advancing these reforms, which are all essential for improving service
delivery over the medium-term, has been intensively discussed with the Government and other
interested donors during the past months. This has improved the Government's vision and
ownership o f the reform agenda, and has helped to define a roadmap (including consultations with
all stakeholders) for puttingback on track the preparation and adoption o f reform action plans by
November 2005 (see Section 5.3.4).
58.       Building on the above overall assessment o f program implementation in 2003-04, the
multi-donors' mission in September 2004 discussed with the Government their proposed program
for 2005-07, to accelerate critical reforms that would help restore higher economic growth and
enhance service delivery and efficiency. Particular attention has been given to the capacity issue
that has limited performance in advancing the reform agenda in some areas. In this respect, line
ministries were advised to systematically prepare and include in their program-budget a minimum
set o f activities to address the identified capacity gaps, in particular in the areas related to
monitoring and evaluation. Support will be also provided by some sector donors under TA and/or
investment operations along with IDA (through the PHRD grant).

6     THE PROPOSEDPRSC-2 REFORMPROGRAM (2005-2006)

6.1     PRSP PILLARI ACCELERATESUSTAINABLE
                            -                               ECONOMICGROWTH

6.1.1    Private Sector-Led Growth
59.      Background and Key Issues. Major impediments to private sector growth still remain to
be addressed, Microeconomic reforms undertaken by the Government during the past decade
(banking system reform, partial privatization, trade liberalization) have not been sufficient to lift
private investment above its persistent sluggishlevel o f 11percent o f GDP, or to bring FDIlevels
above an average o f US$50 million a year. This partly explains why GDP per capita growth
remains stuck at around 2 percent per annum, which i s insufficient to significantly reduce poverty.
There is, however, the potential for much stronger private sector-led growth. Cotton production
could rebound by 50 percent over the next few years. Food products, in particular palm oil,
anarcade, manioc, corn, pineapple, karate, shrimps, and fish also have strong export potential. The
AGOA (Africa Growth Opportunity Act) treaty opens up opportunities in garments. Tourism also
offers some promise, especially the development o f the Atlantic Ocean shore for Nigerian tourists.
Benin could also become the major trading post between UEMOA (Union Economique et
Monitaire de I'Afrique de I'Ouest) and Nigeria. Some domestically oriented manufacturing sectors
such as food processing and construction materials (i.e., fresh and bulky products) should
eventually be competitive against imports. Finally, there i s very large growth potential in the
underdeveloped domestic services, such as retail, housing construction, retail banking, utilities, and
social services.
60.       There seem to be five main barriers to the development of the private sector.
     -    First, land market issues (Le., lack o f clear title) affects the development o f formal
          agriculture/food processing value chains, as well as tourism, retail, access to credit and
          housingconstruction.
     -    Second, contract enforcement issues or lack thereof scare away bankers and investors in
          most sectors, which, combined with the land market issues, make secured lending by the
          banks very difficult because of lack of secured property rights.Investors are concerned that
          the poor state of the legal and judiciary system will compromise the security o f their


                                                     19

        investments against: theft, non payments, poor delivery o f products and services,
        expropriation (i.e. following privatization or purchase o f land), abuse by parts o f the
        government administration andor unequal enforcement o f regulations and taxes by some
        civil servants, in particular in key regulated sectors such as cotton, utilities, the port and
        banking.
    -   Third, relatively hightax and tariff rates, combined with enforcement issues, affect export
        competitiveness and fuel a large but inefficient informal economy, which grows at the
        expense o f the small productive formal sector. The informal economy in 2000 accounted
        for 45 percent o f GDP, up from 40 percent in 1990.
    -   Fourth, sector-specific policy and enforcement issues (i,e., telecom interconnection rules
        and certification o f standards for food exports) constrain investment, competition, and
        productivity inmost sectors.
    -   Fifth,governance issues inkey companies controlledby the state (Le., port, utilities) result
        in serious bottlenecks. Other important issues may include labor market regulations and
        administrative barriers. Several diagnostic studies are under way to provide a
        comprehensive view o fthe main sources o f andbarriers to growth.
61.     New Options to Achieve the Objectives of the PrivatizationProgram. Implementation
of the privatizationprogram, and establishment o f the appropriate legal and regulatory Erameworks
in the privatized sectors, has both gone slowly, and need to pick up speed to achieve the PRSP
objectives. Actions related to the privatization program are being supported under several sector
projects funded mostly by IDA, and constituted triggers for 2003 CAS lending scenario. However,
given the importance o f the PRSC program for Benin's growth prospects and poverty reduction,
the PRSC-1 policy matrix identified critical benchmarks inthese areas. Inparticular:
    -   Cotton Sector. Progress has been made in putting in place private sector-based
        institutions for managing the reformed cotton (see section 6.1-3). The privatization o f
        SONAPRA's industrial and commercial activities i s being finalized.
    -   Electricity. The Govemment continues to be fully committedto privatizing the water and
        electricity distribution company, the former SBEE (Socidtd Bdninoise d 'Electricite` et
        d'Eau). The first step consisted in the separation o f the power and water distribution
        activities. For Power distribution a new SBEE (which now stands for Socie`td Bdninoise
        d'Energie Electrique) has been created, and Government has retained the services o f a
        consulting consortium to assist with the privatization, the finalization o f bidding
        documents i s expected by November 2005. Concurrently the new Electricity Code, a key
        milestone o fthe Power sector reform, has been submitted to the parliament for adoption.
    -   Water. For water distribution, the Government has created, by decree, a new water
        company, SONEB (Socidtd Nationale des Eaun: du Bdnin), which has been operating since
        January 2004. The Govemment i s still considering several options for the company's
        future including public private partnerships.
        Telecommunications. Very little progress has been made on privatization inthe telecom
        sector since 2002, following the liberalization o f the telecom sector in 1999 and the
        adoption o f the Telecom sector laws in2002. The Government has recently taken action to
        remove some o f the constraints to the process (i.e,, decree to separate telecommunications
        and postal activities; removal o f some constraining contractual obligations from the
        incumbent public operator). However, several important tasks remain to be completed to
        create an attractive commercial telecommunications entity. A credible and detailed action
        plan i s expected from the Government by end June 2005. However, the scope o f the work



                                                  20

         to provide a proper institutional and legal framework to make the sector attractive to
         private investor i s such the transaction i s not likely to be completed in2005.
     -   Port Management. While the Government has agreed on a strategy to open port
         management to the private sector, the second phase o f the required study has not yet been
         launched. The necessary infrastructure investments and governance improvements couldbe
         achieved through a Public Private Partnership (PPP), as opposed to outright privatization,
         which seems politically difficult. At this juncture, the Government has decided to
         accelerate computerization o f the Port in order to accelerate transactions and will pursue
         the dialogue with unions in order to reach a consensus on the way o f launching the second
         phase o f the study. This second phase will include an update o f the option already adopted
         by the Government for the involvement o f the private sector in the port management in
         order to take into account the new environment and context of the Port two years after the
         choice o f this option.
62.      PromotingPrivateSector-led Growth. Beyond PPPs, the PRSC program would support
the first generation o f structural reforms, aimed at increasing private sector investment and thus
enhancing its contribution to economic growth. In particular, the PRSC would focus on: (a)
strengthening the legal andjudicial systems (under PRSC-2 as well as subsequent PRSCs); and (b)
improving the private sector environment (under PRSC-3 and subsequent PRSCs). For the former,
the government has already engaged in a large-scale ten-year reform program o f the legal and
judiciary systems. It i s a very broad program, which, without beingtailored to meet specific needs
of the private sector, would lay the foundations for legal and judiciary reforms favorable to the
private sector. As such, it would eventually address many of the investor concerns mentioned in
para. 61. Inaddition to this legal andjudiciary reform program, the government should explore the
opportunity o f taking specific actions in the near future that may help address these investor
concerns. Such initiatives could include: (a) recruitmenthpecialization o f a number o f judges on

deal with these PSD issues - i.e. court dealing exclusively on land disputes, small claims courts
some o f the above mentioned PSD issues; (b) creation o f specialized chambers inexisting courts to

with procedures that expedite processing o f such claims; (c) revised arbitration laws to further
facilitate/encourage arbitration; (d) government support to the creation o f an arbitration center
under the auspices of the Chamber o f Commerce.
63.      To improve the private sector environment, preparatory work would take place under
PRSC-2 in three steps: (a) carry out a thorough assessment o f impediments to private sector
development (most studies have already been launched and should be completedby June 2005); (b)
based on this diagnostic, develop a realistic private sector-led growth strategy, and a medium-term,
results-based implementation program, both in close consultation with the private sector; and (c)
develop a public-private partnership to implement this strategy (for more details on this program
and its status, see Annex 2, Section 1). In addition, the government should also identify specific
indicators, which would enable them to measure progress on the PSD related legal issues listed
 above.
 64.     Expected Outcome within the Next Three Years. These initiatives would help the
Government formulate a comprehensive private sector development (PSD) strategy, to be
implemented under PRSC-3, that would increase private investment beyond the current 11 percent
 o f GDP, with a marked increase in foreign direct investments. Inaddition, cottonproduction should
rebound within the next couple o f years, as a result o f the Bank-sponsored cotton sector reform
 (which includes the privatization o f SONAPRA) and bank lending should increase with land
market and judicial reforms. There should also be a pipeline o f large-scale projects in tourism,
retail, and housing construction as a result o f land market reforms. Exports o f food processing and
 light manufacturing products should increase due to reforms in certification procedures, utilities,
 and the port. The revised Government PSD strategy i s expected to include measures and policies

                                                       21

that would be more conducive to private investments and improve the business environment. As a
result, private investment should increase in the utility and port sectors, and the informal economy
should start to decrease.
6.1.2    Agricultural Development
65.      Sector Background. The agriculture sector accounts for about 40 percent o f GDP, 90
percent o f exports, 15 percent o f Government revenue, and 70 percent o f the country's workforce.
In spite o f agriculture's overwhelming importance as a source o f food, exports, employment, and
Government revenue, the sector faces the double challenge of: (a) realizing its full potential as a
dynamic engine o f growth for the national economy; and (b) lifting out o f poverty the majority o f
the poor, who rely on subsistence farming for their livelihoods. The sector has the resources to
meet this challenge by exploiting as yet untapped production possibilities (only 20 percent o f
arable land i s farmed every year). Compared to its neighbors, the quality and quantity o f land, ago-
climatic conditions, and to some extent, the market infrastructure, give Benin the potential to
develop a wide range o f agricultural products.
66.      The performance o f the sector, including the cotton subsector, has remained low over the
last decade, and has declined inrecent years. While food security seems assured for much o f the
country's population, there are areas where access to adequate food seems to be a persistent
problem, and low purchasingpower means food insecurity for some socio-economic groups living
in supposedly food-secure areas. Malnutrition is seen as a major issue for most o f the population,
especially for the poor and children. The intake o f animal protein remains low compared to other
West African coastal countries, despite a great production potential for livestock and fisheries.
67.      In order to modernize the agriculture sector and transform the rural economy, the
Government prepared and approved a Rural DevelopmentPolicy Paper (RDPP) in 1991. Following
national consultations on the rural sector held in 1995, the RDPP was revised in 1999 and paved
the way for the formulation and adoption o f the Rural Development Strategy (RDS) and the Rural
Development Master Plan (RDMP) inthe year 2000. The strategic operational plan adopted inJuly
2001is the translation o f the rural development plan into fifteen national thematic plans. So far, the
implementationo f these plans has been slow and inefficient.
68.      Key Issues. The sector's weak performance reflects the following issues:
    -     Weak productivity. Given the relative factor endowment o f the country, crop yields are
          still low, with increased production in recent years resulting from the expansion o f
          cultivated areas, not from more efficient production. The low level o f productivity i s due
          to the absence of suitable support for producers (training, extension, information), and to
          the lack o f incentives inthe trading and land tenure systems.
          Weak sectoral policy, expenditure management framework, and capacity. It was only
          last year that a serious attempt was made to translate the strategic operational plan for
          agriculture and rural development into a coherent set o f public interventions. Until that
          time, public investments in agriculture have consisted o f a large number o f donor- and
          national budget-funded projects that were only loosely linked to the overall mission and
          objectives o f the sector. In addition, the Ministry o f Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries
          (MAEP) lacks capacity at both the national and regional levels in core areas such as
         planning, financial resources management, and monitoring and evaluation.
    -     Incomplete sector reforms. The policy environment needed to support entrepreneurial
          activity in agribusiness development i s still weak. Areas o f concern for both producer
          organizations and private sector actors include licensing, contract, enforcement, control o f
         market concentration, trading rules, and trade agreements.



                                                    22

69.     Planned Reforms.          The 2002 PRSP endorsed the broad Agricultural and Rural
Development Master Plan, even though it did not fully address a number o f issues involved in
reversing the sector's poor performance and generating the surplus needed to sustain broad-based
economic growth. To address those issues, the PRSP focused on five strategic objectives: (a)
increasing crop yields and overall agricultural productivity; (b) building rural infrastructure; (c)
improving access to markets; (d) strengthening sector management; and (e) protecting natural
resources.
70.     Inthe context of preparing the PRSC, donors have agreed to assist the Government in
building its capacity to effectively implement the Master Plan, by focusing over the next three
years on two o f the PRSP's objectives. The first set o f reforms, starting with PRSC2, would aim at
increasing productivity and access to markets by deepening the liberalization o f the sector (i.e.,
factor and product markets), and by enhancing the regulatory framework and governance
mechanisms. These reforms would stimulate growth through both short-term efficiency gains (due
to reduced transaction costs), and medium to long-term gains due to increased private sector
investment.
71.     The first set o f reforms would assist the Ministry o f Agriculture in moving away from a
decade o f fragmented and uncoordinated donor-driven projects, and toward core reforms and
priority interventions aimed at improving public expenditure management. These measures would
enable the sector to provide the better services and infrastructure demanded by farmers and other
private agents, The first set o f reforms would also strengthen the link between public expenditure
programs (MTEF) and the Government's strategic objectives for the sector.
72.     To this end, the Ministry o f Agriculture team has launched the preparation o f the ARDS
implementation plan, which will serve as a basis for preparing a full-fledged medium-termprogram
budget. The plan focuses on: (a) five among the fifteen national plans that cover the PRSP's
priority cross-cutting themes (sector management, agricultural productivity, diversification,
investment promotion, access to market and natural resources protection); (b) an institutional
reform consolidating all Ministry o f Agriculture activities into thirteen core functions; and (c)
national action plans to develop specific subsectors (maize, cotton, livestock, etc.). The
implementation o f this plan would be carried out within a new framework inwhich responsibilities,
rules, and procedures are clearly defined for different actors. To strengthen its implementation
capacity at the regional level, the Government i s creating six Regional Centers for Agricultural
Promotion (CERPA or Centres Rdgionaux de Promotion Agricole), which would replace the failing
regional Ministry o f Agriculture structures known as CARDER. Ultimately, this decentralization
would result inregional centers that are autonomous and able to contract service delivery with the
private sector, communes, and professional associations.
73.      Focus of PRSC-2. The program would provide technical assistance, along with other
sector donors, to develop a results-based implementation program; and would support
implementation of the sector strategy, focusing on four main objectives:
    -    Enhancing the effectivenessof regulatory mechanisms that support market transactions
         for agricultural commodities, inparticular inthe cotton sector (see below);
    -    Improvingsector and public expenditure management. PRSC-2 would assist MAEP in
         progressively improving the quality o f the existing strategic framework, while buildingthe
         foundation for sectoral expenditure programs. Support would also be provided to MAEP
         to: (a) improve the efficiency of core Ministry functions at the national and regional levels,
         by strengthening data collection and analysis, policymaking, strategic planning, monitoring
         and evaluation, and financial and human resources management; and (b) create the
         conditions necessary for the effective participation o f producer organizations in sector
         management, at both the regional and national levels.

                                                  23

    -   Improvingagriculturalservices including for the cotton sector. Incollaboration with
        the community development driven program (CDD) approved by the Board in October
        2004, PRSC-2 would support the development o f decentralized, demand-driven, and
        integrated agricultural services, including: (a) management analysis and advice at the
        household farm level; (b) technical assistance in agricultural, livestock, and fishery; (c)
        organizational support; (d) support for gaiqing improved market access (the goal would be
        a 10 percent increase inaccess intwo years); and (e) assistance for adaptive research.
74.     ExpectedOutcomes and Impacts. Implementationof the reformprogram is expected, in
the medium and long term, to: (a) increase the income o f producers, particularly the poor; (b)
increase access by the poor and rural population to agricultural consumption products; and (c)
enhance protection o f the environment. During the coming years, the Government would define
quantitative indicators and build up the monitoring and evaluation system (see the proposed road
map in Annex 4). Jn 2005, priority should be given to data collection, and to defining core
performance indicators and baselines.
6.1.3   Cotton Sector Reforms
75.     Background andIssues.Followingthe liberalizationo f inputimportation and distribution
and cotton ginning in the 199Os, the Government embarked on the last stage o f its cotton sector
reform program around the year 2000 when it lifted SONAPRA's monopoly in marketing seed
cotton and agreed to set up an institutional mechanism to ensure the continued operation o f the
sector as an integratedfili6re. All ginners (private and SONAPRA), producers, and input importers
and distributors came together to form an Inter-professional Cotton Association (AIC). This group
in turn created CSPR (Centrale de Sdcurization des Paiements et de Rdcupdration) as the
mechanism responsible for organizing primary marketing and recovering input credits.
Organization o f inputprocurement was turned over to CAGIA, an input cooperative created by the
main farmers' union, FUPRO. CAGIA i s charged with organizing an annual competitive bidding
process for selecting input importers and distributors, based on a bidding document agreed to by a
commission that includes representatives o f the input distributors, Government researchers,
producer organizations, and ginners.
76.     The Government has decided, as part o f the reform process and in the context o f its HIPC
program, to complete the liberalization and privatization o f the sector by privatizing the factories
and other industrial equipment o f SONAPRA. A strategy for privatizing SONAPRA has been
agreed on and adopted by Government as part o f the measures to reach the HIPC completion point
in March 2003. However, delays have marked the implementation of the privatization of
SONAPRA, which to date remains a key player inthefiliire. The privatization o f three out o f the
four SONAPRA ginning lots has advanced significantly and negotiations on the contracts with the
new operators are well underway. The privatization schedule o f the fourth lot will depend on the
outcome o fthe on-going litigation betweenthe Government and a thirdparty.
77.     When the cotton sector reform program began in the 199Os, SONAPRA handled most o f
the sector's critical functions, including primary marketing and input credit recovery (even for the
private ginners and input distributors), improved seed production and distribution, finding o f
research, and maintenance o f rural roads. The complete privatization o f input distribution, the large
number of private cotton ginners, the elimination o f the SONAPRA monopoly, and the start o f the
process to privatize its industrial setup, meant that new mechanisms had to be put inplace to cover
those critical functions. While some attempt was made to create the appropriate institutional
framework with the support o f the Bank-financed Cotton Sector Reform Project (effective since
September 2002), a number o f issues remained that threaten to completely derail the reforms.
These issues include:



                                                   24

     -  The absence o f a clear protocol bemeen Government and the inter-profession as to: (a) the
        Government's role in setting poiicy; (b) the exact nature o f its relationship with the inter-
        profession; and (c) the authority o f the inter-profession to regulate theJilidre and discipline
        those who disrupt its activities. This has led to parallel systems being set up outside o f the
        AIC and CSPR framework, with the complicity o f some high-level Governmentofficials.
     -  Major disorder inthe inputimportation and distribution system, with distributors who have
        not been successful in the CAGIA bidding processes setting up parallel distribution
        mechanisms to supply dissident producer organizations.
     -  The use o f SONAPRA to bypass the existing system and support dissidents who may be
        subverting the rules.
     -  Chaos and dissidence within the professional organizations, resulting in the break-up o f
        many producer organizations, ginners associations, and input distributor groups.

78.     These unresolved issues have resulted inweaknesses inthe importation and distribution o f
inputs, and inthe primary marketing o f cotton. Because o f these disruptions, cotton production is
currently falling (while it i s increasing inneighboring countries); and more serious risks are arising.
These risks include: (a) a break down o f the integratedJilidre system if order i s not restored soon;
(b) collapse o fthe inputrecovery mechanism, which wouldjeopardize the continuedavailability o f
inputs on credit; and (c) collapse o f the inter-professional system, which would mean that the
critical functions o f improved seed production and distribution, research, and rural road
maintenance would not be funded or performed. The continued existence o f SONAPRA also
increases the risk o f continued interference by influential actors in input distribution, marketing,
and ginning, through parallel systems that undermine the existing mechanisms and hence the
reform. There have been recent calls from some' dissident groups (including dissident producers
and ginners) to reverse the SONAPRA privatization or assign to the agency left after the
privatization the responsibility for the critical functions, which would essentially negate the
objective o f the privatizatiodliberalization process.
79.      However, the Government has made recent efforts to consolidate the functioning o f the
Jilidre and restore a well-functioning system o f importation and distribution o f inputs, and o f the
primary marketing o f cotton, by establishing incentives for producers to boost production. Despite
the time needed to build consensus among all stakeholders, the Government and key actors inthe
Jilidre have taken measures to protect the 2004-05 harvesting season and lay the foundation for
better sector operations in the future. In particular, a single seed cotton marketing arrangement for
the 2004-05 campaign using existing structures and operating under the supervision o f a multi-
stakeholder committee (ginners, farmers, traders, and the Government) has been adopted.
Moreover, a mechanism for the importation and distribution o f inputs has been created. More
recently, a new regulatory framework for the cotton sector has been agreed upon and signed by the
relevant Ministers, and passed by the Council o f Ministers for signature by the President.
80.      A new source of threat with far-reaching potential adverse effects to the performance o fthe
cotton sub-sector has emerged. Indeed, the low level o f the current international price for cotton
coupled with a depreciating dollar i s puttingpressure on domestic cotton prices. As planned inthe
reform, the ginners and producers met in December 2004 to determine a farm-gate producer price
for the 2004-2005 campaign, but failed to reach an agreement. This led the Government to set the
producer price at the level o f the nominal producer'priceo f the previous campaign (CFAF 19OiKg),
with the contributions to the financing o f the critical functions fixed at 10 CFAFkg. The potential
adverse economic and social impacts o f this situation prompted the Government to initiate
discussions with the major stakeholders of the cotton filikre in order to find the better way to
mitigate such impacts. This intervention o f the Government implicitly means that the authorities


                                                   25

have made the determination to subsidize the cotton sector at a level representing 0.8 percent o f the
GDP.
81.     While the perceived need on the part o f the Government to subsidize the cotton sub-sector
poses some threats to the stability o f the macro-economic framework, the collapse inthe producer
prices would have even greater short and medium term negative impacts in the absence o f any
subsidy. In addition to creating disincentives that would impede the smooth and effective
completion o f the full liberalization o f the cotton sub-sector, the collapse in producer prices will
have short and medium-term deleterious effects on the macro-economic framework (as discussed
above).    A collapse in producer prices would also have serious negative effects on poverty
reduction by reducing disposable income and employment inrural areas where poverty incidence i s
twice as high as in urban areas, and where many cotton producers tend to be especially vulnerable
(an analysis o f the impact o f producer prices on poverty i s provided in Annex 9). Hence, the
collapse in producer prices would likely result in a serious deterioration o f the living standards o f
the most vulnerable section o f the rural poor.
82.     However, it i s important to emphasize the importance o f controlling tightly the use o f a
subsidy inthe 2004-2005 campaign in order to avoid sending the wrong signal to the key actors o f
the sub-sector, in particular, the ginners and the producers. The fact that the recourse to a subsidy
i s a one-time intervention limited to the 2004-2005 campaign should also be stressed.               In
collaboration with other sector donors, the Bank will assist the Government in the design o f a
private sector-based mechanism aimed at mitigating the adverse outcome o f future decline in the
international price for cotton.      The adoption o f such a mechanism that should be financially
sustainable i s a trigger for PRSC-3. Furthermore, the Bank would assist the Government inputting
inplace a safety net system that would help to protectcottonproducers (or cottonproducingareas)
against inadvertent reduction o f income due to the decline inthe international price.
83.      PlannedReforms.While a number o f the measures needed to restore order and ensure the
efficient operation o f theJiliBre would depend on the different actors and professions involved, the
Government has an important role to play in defining clear rules o f the game for all actors in the
sector. The following measures are needed:
      - The French Development Agency (AFD) had agreed to finance a new study to review the
         input distribution system with the objective o f setting up a single mechanism for the
         importation and distribution o f inputs, with clear penalties for those who do not respect the
         mechanism. The regulatory framework put forward in December and adopted by the
         Government needs to be implemented without further delay. An important function o f this
         regulatory framework would be to promote competition in both input distribution and
         ginning. With the implementation o f this regulatory framework, the existing single
         mechanism for the primary marketing o f cotton would be reinforced, with clear rules on:
         (a) how cotton i s allocated or sold to ginners; (b) who has the responsibility for paying
         producers and when; (c) means for assuring input credit recovery, and for collecting and
         paying for the critical functions; and (d) clear sanctions for anyone breaking the rules set
         up under the mechanism. All key sector stakeholders have agreed in November 2004 in
         principle on how to organize the 2004-05 cotton campaign and the 2005-06 input
         campaign. They have also agreed that the State should carry out more active supervision
         o f the sector, to ensure the fair application and implementation o f the regulatory framework
         and thus enhance competition.
    -     Reorganization o f the inter-profession to facilitate internal debate, and adoption o f a
          framework that clearly defines and makes legally binding the relationship between the
          inter-profession (a single inter-professional group) and the Government, and among the
          different professional groups.


                                                     26

    -    Agreement among the different professional organizations (producers, input distributors,
         ginners, and any other professional group wanting to be part o f the inter-profession) on
         their internalregulations and how they would operate within the rules o f the reform.
84.     PRSC-2 Focus. In 2005, building on the recent achievements, a major task for the
Government i s now to ensure that those measures are actually being implemented and that the
Government takes the necessary steps to consolidate the mainreform agenda, notably by:
    -    Ensuring and enforcing the implementationo f the regulatory framework for the sector by
         all actors, which would foster competition inthejX8re.
    -    Completing the privatization o f all SONAPRA ginning lots, and eventually dismantling
         the parastatal company.
    -    Carrying out the planned study on setting up o f a privately-operated cotton price
         stabilization mechanism.
    -    Reviewing regulations regarding the Inter-Professional Association, and revising the AIC
         and CSPR articles o f association inconsultation with all sector shareholders.
    -    Completing a new study on cotton inputssupply and marketing arrangements.
    -    Validate conclusions andrecommendations o f the above study with all actors;
85.     Expected Outcomes. Implementation o f these measures should help ensure that the
marketing season for cotton proceeds normally, and in particular, that: (a) input distributions are
made through the agreed-upon mechanism; (b) there i s no parallel marketing circuit; (c) cotton
producers are paid on time; (d) input credits are recovered entirely and the AIC i s paid at 100
percent for the critical functions it performs; (e) the new operators o f SONAPRA are in place and
operating; and (0the establishedrules are respectedby all actors and enforced by the State.
6.1.4   RuralTransport
86.      Backgroundand Key Issues.The transport sector inBenin contributes about 8 percent o f
GDP, and provides around 80,000 permanent jobs in transport services and 15,000 indirect jobs
through civil works contracts. However, the impact o f transport goes well beyond its share in the
economy, since it i s an intermediary service for all sectors critical to economic growth,
productivity, and competitiveness. The sector also contributes to growth by opening up untapped
production potential (rural, in particular), through an enlarged and better-maintained road network
and improved transport services. In 1993-94, Benin developed and adopted a transport sector
strategy (TSS) that has aimed at making transport more efficient in supporting economic growth
and poverty reduction by reducing costs, increasing affordability and accessibility, and improving
quality, reliability, and safety.
87.      In 1996-2000, the implementation of the related transport sector investment program
(TSIP) with the support o f the donor community including IDA resultedinvisible improvements in
Benin's transport system. Better road conditions and levels o f service, resulting from the reduction
o f road rehabilitation and maintenance backlogs and the establishment o f a sustainable road
management system, translated into large transport cost savings and increased accessibility for all
segments of the population. As part o f the TSIP, a community-based Rural Transport Strategy was
piloted, and the results will be useful in designing a national rural transport strategy and preparing a
rural priority investment program.
88.      The rural transport strategy needs to address issues raised during implementation o f the
National Rural Roads Strategy (NRRS) in 1997-2000, the deficiencies o f which revealed the need
for NRRS to be upgraded to a National Rural Transport Strategy. N R S S implementation issues
included:

                                                   27

    -   Social intermediation has a high cost. The costs o f NGO involvement in community
        mobilization for selecting the road to be rehabilitated are relatively high and must be
        reduced to lay the foundation for sustainable growth o f the sector. Community
        mobilization and training also need to be improved.
    -   The cost-sharing arrangement limits accessibility for the poorest.             Mobilization o f
        local counterpart funding for rural road rehabilitation i s difficult in the poorest areas, even
        ifthe locallabor contributionis taken into account.
    -   Infrastructure is not adjusted to demand. In its design o f infrastructure, NRRS took
        into account only four-wheel vehicles as a basic means o f transport. However, to reach the
        MDGs in terms o f basic services and accessibility to rural areas, intermediary means o f
        transport (motorcycles, bicycles, etc.) need to be considered in rural areas. The rural road
        rehabilitation standard must be consistent with transport needs inrural areas;.
    -   Sector management and coordination i s weak. Despite the existence o f the National
        Council for Rural Roads (NCRR), created in 1998 to coordinate all rural road programs,
        the Ministry o f Planning, which holds the vice presidency o fNDRR, has continued to plan
        and execute rural roads programs without NCRR's agreement. In addition, the National
        Rural Transport Strategy needs to take into account the decentralization context in Benin,
        as well as the lack o f a monitoring and evaluation system to assess progress in improving
        the accessibility o fruralpopulations to basic economic and social services.
89.     Planned Reforms. The PRSC-2/PRSC-3 would support the development                             and
implementation o f a National Rural Transport Strategy, as a mean to increase the transport sector's
contribution to economic growth. This strategy would aim at improving the accessibility o f rural
population to basic economic and social services, while supporting local development and
achieving the Government's poverty reduction goals. The PRSC would also support an investment
program focusing on two objectives: (a) improving the access o f rural communities to basic social
services, and the access o f traders to remote production areas, through cost-effective and demand-
driven infrastructure services; and (b) strengthening the management o f the rural transport sector.
Key measures to reach these objectives would include: (a) implementing a multi-year rural road
investment program targeted to the poorest and most underserved areas, based on clear criteria for
selecting optimal levels o f service; (b) establishing appropriate institutional arrangements for
managing and financing local rural roads, in the context o f decentralization; (c) providing
incentives to promote transport services:inrural areas; (d) improving the financial and management
capacity o f local governments and communities, which would maintain the roads; (e) strengthening
national, regional and local coordination mechanisms; (f) strengthening the capacity o f the Rural
Road Directorate at the central level, and regional rural road administrations, to implement the
program; and (g) establishing an appropriate programmonitoring and evaluationsystem.
90.     PRSC-2 Focus. PRSC-2, in coordination with main sector donors, would provide support
to the Government to progressively implement the reforms designed as part o f the Rural Transport
Strategy (RTS) pilot (now being updated), and its priority rural roads investment and maintenance
program. PRSC-2 support would also provide the opportunity to improve management o f the rural
transport sector, and to carry out an action plan promoting intermediary forms o f rural transport.
Specifically, PRSC-2 would help to:
    -   Increase access of rural communities to basic social services and production areas.
        Based on the RTS approach, support would be provided for implementation o f priority
        rural roads investment and maintenance program consistent with a cost-effective and
        demand-driven infrastructure services. The program will target the poorest and most under-
        served areas based on participative method and clear criteria for selecting specific rural
        roads and optimal level o f service.

                                                 28

    -   Improvingmanagement in the rural transport sector. Support would be provided for:
        (a) an action plan to implementation new institutional arrangements for managing and
        financing rural roads in the context o f decentralization. This new arrangement would
        replace the former NCRR and its regional branches; (b) strengthening management
        capacity at the central level (Rural Roads Directorate within the Ministry o f Public Works
        and Transport) and in local communities, vis-his their new responsibilities in managing
        and coordinating the rural roads network. The support would comprise training and
        elaboration o f guidelines for planning and programming process, and for the development
        o f an appropriate monitoring and evaluation system.
    -   Assistingthe Governmentto design an actionplanfor promotingintermediarymeans
        of rural transportation. Moving from a Rural Roads Strategy to a Rural Transport
        Strategy requires that the Government improves transport services in rural areas and
        promotes intermediary means for rural transportation, in order to lower the cost o f
        transport and infkastructure. To this end, the Government assesses existing means o f rural
        transportation, with a view to identifying intermediary means that could be promoted. The
        Government will also prepare a realistic action plan to implement pilot operations in
        selected rural areas.
91,     Expected Results and/or Outcome. Under PRSCs implementation, the country expects
to achieve the following results:
    -   Improved general conditions on about 950 km o f rural roads through treatment o f their
        black spots.
    -   Improved transport sector management, in particular by adopting new institutional
        arrangements at the central and local levels for coordinating and managing rural transport
        programs.
    -   Enhanced capacity for monitoring and evaluation.
6.2    PRSPPILLAR11 IMPROVE-            SERVICE DELIVERY
6.2.1   ImprovingAccess to SafeWater inRuralareas
92.     Backgroundand Main Issues. Over the past few years, the Government has developed a
sector-wide approach, in partnership with donors and other stakeholders, based on: (a) a sound
national strategy for rural and sanitation services (RWSS), including demand-driven approaches
and community participation; (b) a sector MTEF; and (c) highly effective donor coordination,
including joint annual sector reviews and joint funding o f technical support to the Directorate o f
Water. However, within this positive context, the prospects for sector development in particular,
the possibility o f achieving the MDGs for the sector - remain constrained by the following set o f
i ssues:
     -   Over the past years, sector investments have depended largely on irregular and
        unpredictable external resources, and have been insufficient to overcome rapid
         demographic growth. In 2003, 36 percent o f the population has had access to potable
         water. Nonetheless, 3.8 million out o f 6 million rural residents still do not have access to a
         functional potable water point. In 2003, 607 water points were added, providing 150,000
         additional people with safe water; but the rural population increased over the same period
        by 180,000.
     -   The sustainability o f service remains an area o f concern. N o progress has been recorded in
         2003 and 2004 in improving the functionality o f water points. More than 20 percent o f the
         country's 11,100 rural water systems remain non-functional, despite the availability o f
         financial resources to tackle this problem. This calls for an improved strategy for

                                                  29

         rehabilitating old water points and for retraining their management committees, as well as
          for well field monitoring activities.
    -    The current institutional framework for managing water resources i s no longer useful, and
         needs to be revised to clarify the roles and responsibilities o f each stakeholder, taking into
         account both the decentralization process as it affects the communes, and the integrated
         water resources management (IWRM) concept.
93.      Focusof PRSC-2. PRSC-2, inclose collaborationwith other donors, would strengthenthe
sector-wide approach and the program budget designed by the Directorate o f Water. The strategy
arising from the RWSS sector reform process i s to hrther increase access to services, and the
reliability, affordability, and sustainability o f provision. To meet these challenges, the water sector
will need to increase its absorptive capacity, make public expenditures more efficient, improve
transparency, attract more private financing, ensure the long-term sustainability o f newly
constructed facilities, and improve its strategic vision regarding decentralization and coverage o f
small towns. The sector also needs a coherent framework for water resources management.
94.      Specifically, PRSC-2 would:
         Increase sector delivery capacity and scale up rural water sector infrastructure, by: (a)
         improving procurement planning, the process for responding to community demands for a
         water point, and intermediation activities, especially in districts with lower coverage; (b)
         utilizing program authorization and multi-annual payment credits to launch larger
         contracts, allow more competition, improve economies o f scale, and reduce procurement
         delays; and (c) launching a special Small Towns Water Initiative in 2005 to significantly
         increase access to potable water in about 500 semi-urban localities with population o f
         2,000 to55,OOO inhabitants, representing a total o f about 2 million people.
         Contribute to enhancing the sustainability o f rural water systems, by: (a) implementing the
         long-term maintenance strategy adopted in 2003, including the backstopping activities for
         communities and monitoring of private maintenance operators (local repairers and spare
         parts outlets), for which the Directorate o f Water has received substantial additional
         fundingsince 2002; (b) scaling up the replacement o f old pumps as part o f the water point
         rehabilitation program, which would reduce the number o f non-functional water points;
         and (c) adopting an action plan to replace poorly performing community-based
         management bodies that currently run small piped water systems, with professional
         community management and/or small-scale private operators.
    -     Support the development o f an integrated approach to water resources management,
         including the Government's preparationo f an action plan, and the creation o f a council for
         the coordination o f IWRM under the leadership o f the Directorate General o f Water o f a
         Council, both in 2005. Preparation o f a new Water Code i s also envisaged for 2005, and a
         national framework for water resources management would be inplace by 2006.
95.      ExpectedResults and/or Outcome. Over the course of the PRSCs program period, the
Government expects to accomplishthe following:
    -    Effective access to safe water in rural areas would increase from 36 percent in 2003 to 45
         percent o f the populationin2007, through; (a) the construction and rehabilitation o f at least
         3,500 water points; (b) an increase inthe rate o f functioning hand pumps from 75 in 2003
         to at least 83 percent in 2007; (c) a clear operational framework for the management by
         private operators o f existing pipedwater systems;




                                                     30

     -   a significant increase by 2007 in the number o f piped water systems constructed in semi-
         urban localities (2,000 to 55,000 population) and directly managed by small-scale private
         operators.
6.2.2    ImprovingAccess to QualityHealthServices
96.      Background and Key Issues. Benin has made significant progress in health indicators
over the last three decades (i-e., a reduction o f child mortality from 270 in 1960 to 146 in 2002),
but the pace o f improvement is slowing. Although overall geographical coverage o f basic services
i s very good (86 percent), major disparities exist among regions and between rich and poor. The
main issues are as follows:
97.      Weak Sector Management. The poor performance ofbasic health services and programs
(with the exception o f the ExpandedProgram o f Immunization, EPI), reflects the lack o f capacity
o f the Ministry o f Health to plan, implement, and monitor its overall health sector strategy. Poor
quality also results from insufficient decentralization and a lack o f focus on outcome, as most
decisions still take place in the central ministry, and a large part of the health budget i s still
centrally managed.
98.      InsufficientResources. In 2002, public spending on health represented 1.7 percent o f
GDP, or US$7 per capita. The June 2004 Country Health Status Report (CHSR) estimates that, in
order to reach MDG targets, Benin would need to spend US$10 per capita by 2010 and U S 2 0 by
2020. However, due to the difficult economic situation inthe country, the MOHbudget in2004 has
been reduced by 7 percent, or CFAF 3.2 billion and this will likely have a negative impact on
sector achievements. The problem o f insufficient resources i s compounded by:
     -   Serious equity issues, as illustrated by high disparities among geographic regions and
         economic groups, inefficient use o f resources, and inadequate cost-recovery schemes, all o f
         which limit financial access to services, particularly for the poor. The poverty assessment,
         conducted in September 2003, underscores that although public health centers have
         become more accessible physically, their reliance on client payments to cover operating
         costs may make modem health care unaffordable to the poor. Inaddition, the fixed strategy
         cannot be the answer for many o f these remote locations.
     -   Inadequate distribution of human resources. If one considers WHO standards o f
         population per health staff, Benin i s doing quite well. However, there are shortages of
         surgeons, obstetricians, pediatricians, and other specialties, and therefore poor quality o f
         services, particularly in poor and remote areas, such as the Atacora, Donga, Borgou, and
         Alibori regions. While 74 percent o f the population has access to health services in
         Borgou, 92 percent have access inthe richer area o fAtlantique.
     -   Poor quality and access of services for the poor. The low quality o f services contributes
         to low utilization o f available services. Even with the significant increase in geographical
         coverage o f the population by the health care network, the number o f new curative visits
         remains low (0.36 per inhabitant per year). The cost recovery program, as implemented,
         plays an important role inlimitingaccess to services.
99.      PRSC-2 Focus. In close collaboration with other donors, PRSC-2 would strengthen the
main interventions initiated under PRSC-1. The focus for 2005-07 would be on improving overall
sector management and improving equitable access to basic quality services, with the particular
aim o freducing child and matemal mortality. More specifically, PRSC-2 would focus on:
     -                     $

         Improving overall sector management. Assistance would be provided to MOH to
         strengthen its capacity to plan, budget, implement, monitor, and evaluate its overall sector
         strategy. PRSC-2 would assist MOH in implementing its 2005 program budget by: (a)

        puttinginplace mechanisms and procedures for ensuring efficient and equitable allocation
         o f resources among regions and different levels of care; (b) elaborating a health map, to
        rationalize health sector investments; (c) ensuring efficient development, allocation, and
         utilization o f health staff; and (d) empowering communities through co-management o f
        health facilities (COGES). Implementation o f the program budgets would require an
         increase o f 37.8 percent in the MOH budget (from CFAF 42.6 billion currently to CFAF
         58.7 billion) by 2007. It i s also anticipated that by 2007, 60 percent of the recurrent budget
         (excluding salaries) would be allocated to the districts.
    -    Improvingaccess to and quality of basic services, by: (a) strengthening the capacity o f
         health districts to manage, implement, and monitor their priority health programs,
         especially those for reproductive health and for control o f malaria, tuberculosis,
         HN/AIDS,and diseases that can be controlledthrough immunization; (b) endowing public
         hospitals with autonomous management; (c) improving mechanisms for resource transfer
         from the center to the regional and district levels; and (d) improving efficiency and
         accountability by using performance-based contracts in selected districts as a basis for
        resource transfers.
    -   Reducinginequity and improving financial access of the population to quality health
         services. PRSC-2 would support the adoption o f more equitable mechanisms for financing
         the sector. This would require the establishment, within cost recovery schemes, o f
         mechanisms aimed at protecting the poorest people. Such mechanisms would be
         implemented on a pilot basis in 10 health districts, and then, after evaluation, would be
         scaled up nationwide. The pilot experience would support the provision o f a minimum
         package o f services consistent with child and maternal health, including impregnated bed
         nets for pregnant women and children under five, as well as contraceptive drugs and
         condoms.
100.     Expected Results and/or Outcome. During the three-year PRSC program Benin is
expected to achieve results and/or the outcome shown inAnnex 4.
6.2.3    ImprovingAccess to QualityBasicEducation
101,     Key Issues. The sector performance indicators for basic education remain generally low,
despite significant increases in school enrollment over the past decades. Long-term expansion o f
the education sector remains constrained by a number o f factors, which will make it difficult to
attain the MDGsinthis sector by 2015:
    -    The quality and efficiency of the education services are low, while disparities remain
         high. Literacy and numeric achievements lag behind expectations at most grades,
         contributing to a lowering o f schooling returns. Repetition and dropout rates are high,
         resulting in low retention. While more than 90 percent o f school-age children have access
         to first grade, only 50 percent o f any age group completes primary education, with girls'
         completion rate inrural areas being even lower, at only 29 percent, in2002-03.
    -    Weaknesses in resource allocation and management have led to ineffective spending,
         and to additional pressuresin sector financing. Despite recent improvements, teacher-
         per-school allocations remain unbalanced and inequitable within geographic areas.
         Ensuringthe adequate and timely availability o f key learning materials at the school level
         remains a key challenge.
    -    Resource distributionamong various levels of the education sector is becoming less
         effective. The absence o f a sound framework for sector wide development policy has ledto
         inadequate intra-sectoral allocations o f available resources. About 23 percent o f the sector
         budget went to higher education in 2004, while 40 percent went to primary education

                                                     32

        (excluding administration costs). The 2005-2007 sector MTEF, recently prepared by the
        Government, shows some positive trends, especially with regard to the declining share o f
        higher education inthe sector budget.
102.    PRSC-2 Focus. PRSC-2 would support the implementation and enhancement of core
reforms initiated under PRSC-1, in close coordination with main sector donors. The program for
2005-07 would focus on basic education, particularly on increasing enrollment and the completion
of basic education programs of reasonably good quality. PRSC-2 would also help to enhance and
expand ongoing initiatives to empower communities in school management, based on lessons
learned from experience and inline with the overall decentralization process. More specifically, the
focus would continue to be on the following actions in2005:
    -   Increasing access, completion, and quality in basic education programs. Continued
        support would be provided to two action plans adopted by the Government in 2003, which
        aim at: (a) improving implementation o f educational reforms; (b) reducing repetition and
        schooling discontinuity; (c) stimulating schooling demands in targeted areas; and (d)
        promoting girl's education. Measures would be taken to increase the availability o f
        textbooks in classrooms and ensure greater cost-effectiveness in copyright management.
        Pre-service teacher training would be progressively rebuilt, based on preliminary results of
        the ongoing study on teacher training strategy, and Government intends to reopen at least
        one teacher training center duringthe 2004-05 school year. Building on the results o f the
        education sector review, support would be provided, in close coordination with bilateral
        donors (notably Switzerland), to assist the Government in progressively designing and
        implementing the delivery o f quality functional literacy programs to poor populations, and
        particularly to women.
    -   Improving efficiencyin delivery and managementof basic education services. Support
        would be provided to help improve teacher allocations and deployment, through a
        decentralized process to recruit about 1,000 additional contractual teachers in primary
        education, targeting underserved areas. PRSC-2 would also help reduce schooling costs for
        households by providing subsidies to pay the salaries o f 1,000 existing community teachers
        in targeted areas (bringing the total number of subsidized community teachers to about
        4,500). Further, in synergy with other donor interventions, PRSC-2 would assist the
        Government in defining and progressively implementing an effective teacher recruitment
        policy, based on the results o f the ongoing study. Efforts would also be made to improve
        the quality o f public spending and empower communities in school management,
        consistent with the overall decentralization process and the community development
        strategy framework recently approved by the Government in the context o f the IDA-
        financed CDD operation. Support would be provided to implement core recommendations
        o f the ongoing study o f resource transfers at the school level (expected to be completed by
        July 2005), as well as those o f the Public Expenditure Review (July 2004), with a view to
        improving equity in allocating these transfers. Overall, the implementation o f the program
        budgets would require an increase o f about 34 percent o f the Ministry o f Primary and
        Secondary Education (MEPS) budget (from CFAF 75 billion currently to CFAF 100
    -   billion by 2007.
        Assisting the Government to sharpen the sectoral vision. Building on the increased
        sector coordination and the momentum created by the recent sector review, as well as
        opportunities created by the possible selection o f the country for the EFA-FTI, assistance
        would be provided to advance preparation o f an integrated policy and strategic
        development framework and a long-term development program for the entire sector.

103.     Expected Results and/or Outcome. During the three-year PRSC program, Benin is
expected to achieve the outcomes and results that are presented indetail inAnnex 4.
6.2.4    ContinuingSupport to EnvironmentalandNaturalResourceManagement
104.     Background and Key Issues. The Ministry o f Environment, Housing, and Urban
Development (MEHU) were one o f the best performing ministries inthe public expenditure reform
program supported by the PERAC. These reforms helped to strengthen the policy framework and
the implementation capacity o f the ministry.Under the pilot, the Ministry (a) updated the National
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) in 2001; (b) developed a Medium-Term Strategic Action Plan
covering the 2002-06 period; (c) formulated a National Environmental Management Program; (d)
developed a system for monitoring the performance o f its expenditure programs; and (e) completed
a well-planned and efficient organizational realignment that reduced the size o f the technical
directorates and deconcentrated technical staff from the central department to the regions. These
satisfactory results helped to increase the effectiveness o f MEW'Sspending programs, and put the
Ministry on a strong footing to tackle the remaining environmental management challenges in
Benin.
105.     While some work still remains to be done to improve the effectiveness o f the institutional
framework, efforts are now largely oriented toward investments aimed at controlling major
environmental threats and reducing the burden o f disease related to poor environmental conditions
in certain urban and semi-urban areas. The environmental agenda, as described in the National
Environmental Management Program, includes: (a) development o f environmental compliance and
enforcement tools; (b) coastal resource management and control o f coastal erosion; (c) control o f
urban transport pollution; (d) urban drainage and sanitation infrastructure; and (e) integrated solid
waste management inthree cities (Cotonou, Port0Novo and Parakou).
106.     PRSC-2 Focus. There are no major \sectoral reforms envisaged under PRSC-2. This
second credit o f the first PRSC series will continue to build on MEHU's achievements in
implementing the public expenditure reform agenda, while maintaining a strong focus on the
strategic investments that PRSC-1 supported. These include the re-enforcement o f environmental
management tools, urban sanitation, and air pollution control in Cotonou. More specifically,
PRSC-2 would support implementation o f MEHU's 2005-07 medium-term program budget,
through (a) re-enforcement o f environmental management tools, including the oversight
environmental impact assessment processes; (b) adoption o f a new urban sanitation strategy; and
(c) increasedinvestment to address urban sanitation and urban air pollution.
107.     ExpectedResultsand/or Outcome.The following results are expected inthe areas o f the
sector budget-program supported by PRSC-2:
     -   Air pollution control: (a) at least 50 percent o fall motor vehicles comply with emission
         standards; (b) national air quality standards are developed; and (c) regulations about air
         pollution are prepared.
     -   Urban sanitation: (a) 18 kmo f urbanroads are rehabilitated; (b) 40 kmo f sewerage and
         drainage channels are built; and (c) 2 kmo f pavedroads are built.
6.2.5    ImprovingForest andAdjacent LandManagement
108.     Background and Key Issues. According to the Government estimates, the formal timber
industrycontributes 2.8 percent of GDP (not including forest products usedfor home consumption,
and those sold at local markets). This valuable natural capital i s degrading rapidly due to a number
o f factors, including: (a) growing demand for, and non-sustainable practices o f firewood and
charcoal production; (b) uncontrolled bushfires; (c) widespread encroachment on forests by
farmers; (d) over-exploitation of grazing lands; and (e) perverse incentives and market distortions


                                                    34

inthe industry.Efforts by the Government to reduce the rate of deforestationhavebeen hampered
by fast-growing demand for forest products, vested interests in the forest industry, and property
rightsissues.
109.     Acknowledging the limited success o fpast public policies, the Government initiated, inthe
mid-1990s, a new approach to sustainably managing forest resources. This approach emphasizes
co-management in partnership with local populations, and has been supported by IDA through the
Natural Resource Management Project. To create an enabling framework for local communities to
engage in co-management schemes with the forestry administration, as part o f that project a new
forestry policy has been formulated, new forestry laws and regulations adopted, and a reform o f
forestry administrationhas been launched.
110.     While these measures helped to improve the performance o f the forestry sector during the
last years, inherent limitations in the policy framework, as well as corruption and market
distortions, continue to impede the development o f the sector's full economic potential, in terms o f
both its contribution to economic growth and the welfare o f local populations. The Government's
new Rural Development Strategy aims at revitalizing the forestry sector.
111.     Focus of PRSC-2. PRSC-2 would build on progress made under PRSC-1 and continue to
support reforms in the forestry sector, as well as participatory management o f forests and adjacent
lands. On the basis o f studies completed under PRSC-1, PRSC-2 would seek to improve policy
framework through:
    -    Draft decrees, submitted to the council o f ministers by the Forestry Administration, to
         introduce higher stumpage fees and forestry taxes that would reflect the actual value o f
         timber and fuelwood inBenin; and to remove the export o f teak wood.
    -    Complete the privatizationo f the production and industrial branches o f ONAB.

112.     At the field level, PRSC-2 would continue to support the preparation, revision, and
implementation o f forest management plans for gazetted forests and adjacent lands, while
enhancing the value o f the byproducts o f exploitation and promoting environmental benefits
resulting from sylvicultural activities. Cartography and inventories o f six o f the concerned forests
would be pursued. A program for protecting against forest fires would be implemented for the
gazetted forests. The promotion o f alternative sources o f income for forest neighboring
communities would continue, and special attention would be paid to the creation o f rural markets
(about 20) for charcoal and fuel wood harvested inforests covered by the program.
 113.    PRSC-2 would also support the strengthening o f the technical, financial, and institutional
capacity o f the forestry administration, at both the central and local levels, through: (a)
implementation o f the staffing program and purchasing o f minimum equipment; (b) training
programs based on a participatory approach to natural resources management; (c) finalizing a data
collection system that would capture operational performance and environmental impacts.
 114.    Expected Results and/or Outcome. During the three-year PRSC program, Benin is
expected to achieve among other things, the following outcome:
    -    A 5 percent decrease inillegal exports o fteakwood between FY05 to FY06.
    -    An increase ingazetted forests with a participatory management plan from 6 inFY04 to 16
         inFY0.5.

6.3     PRSPPILLARIII-IMPROVING            GOVERNANCE TRANSPARENCY
                                                           AND
 115.    Lessons from experience under PRSC-1 indicate that significant progress has been
achieved inministriesthat have effective leadership, staff with strong capacity, and a performance-
focused management culture. However, Benin's overall public administration requires significant

                                                  35

change to establish a results-basedpublic expenditure management system. Improving governance,
transparency, and service delivery are particularly important inthe areas o f financial management,
administrative reform, and decentralization.
116.     A comprehensive approach is needed to: (a) develop an overall administrative reform
strategy; (b) establish a performance-based management and accountability framework; (c) set up a
formal incentive system that supports transparent, performance-focused management, and i s
supplemented by a modem and effective management control system; (d) develop a modem human
resource management system that i s competency-based and includes continuous professional
development for civil servants; (e) design a citizen's charter o f rights to quality public services, and
participatory mechanisms for monitoring, evaluation, and redress; and (f)                         strengthen the
effectiveness, efficiency, and accessibility o f the justice system. Such a program would require
sustained technical assistance competent inmodern public management.
6.3.1    Transitiontoward Results-BasedBudgeting
117.     Background and Key Issues. Four activities have been central to the reform effort': (a)
program budgets for the preparation and presentation o f the consolidated budget; (b)
mainstreaming o f monitoring and evaluation into budget management; (c) preparation o f program
budget implementation reports; and (d) performance audit o f these implementation reports by the
Chamber o f Accounts6.
118.     These activities have been carried out to varying degrees in different ministries. However,
two challenges remain: the first, and least problematic, i s to improve technical quality inpreparing
program budgets, measuring the extent to which intended results are achieved, and reporting in
reliable and timely fashion. The second, and more difficult challenge, is to move from developing
the skills needed for performance-related activities such as program budgets and performance
measurement, to actually using the performance information generated by these activities for
management and accountability, i.e., to effect change inadministrative behavior.
119.     The former continues to be the focus o f capacity-building efforts through training and
technical assistance, while the latter requires some fundamental changes in management models
and practices, particularly with regard to management autonomy over operational budgets,
accountability for performance, and incentives. Both these aspects were assessed in detail during
the preparation o f the PRSC-1, and the proposedactions under the PRSC-2 are designed to address
them both.
120.     Related actions to be taken by the Government over 2004-06 are described in a
Memorandum o f Understandingapproved by the Ministryo f Finance in2003. They include:
     -   Development and implementation o f a realistic roadmap for gradually transitioning toward
         results-based management in the public sector, including an overall reform strategy and an
         operational plan to implement this strategy.
     -   Strengthening the capacity o f the Chamber o f Accounts to carry out performanceaudits.
     -   Strengthening the capacity o f line ministries to prepare program budgets, carry out
         program monitoring and evaluation, and prepare performance reports on budget program
         implementation.


     The five pilot ministries in 2001 were Public Health; NationalEducationand Scientific Research(MENRS); Public
     Works and Transportation; Environment, Housing, and Urban Development; and Rural Development. In 2001,
     MENRSwas divided into three ministries: Primary and SecondaryEducation,Technical EducationandProfessional
    Training, and Higher Educationand Scientific Research.
     With the Chamber's submission of the 2001 performance audit reports to the National Assembly in 2003, the first
    programbudgetingcyclewas successfullycompleted.

                                                           36

    -    Streamlining, strengthening, and restructuring the internal audit function.
121.    Focus of PRSC-2. The Minister o fFinance will define and communicate on behalf o f the
Government: (a) a meaningful vision o f what the reform will achieve; and (b) an operational plan
for its implementation. In 2005, five ministries should undertake to create the conditions for
results-based management for selected programs or sub-programs. Additional programs or sub-
programs would be included in2006 based on lessons learned from the pilot phase.
122.     Expected Results and/or Outcome. The Government is expected to: (a) finalize and
adopt an overall strategy to implement the reformand move toward results-basedmanagement; and
(b) select the programs or sub-programs that will implement results-based management during
2005, and take all the preparatory measures to allow for this management.
6.3.2    ImprovingBudgetExecution
123.     Background and Key Issues. Budget procedures have been streamlined and
computerized, which has considerably reduced budget execution delays and improved the amount
o f commitments. However, the execution rate in 2004 has been lower than for the same period in
2003.
124.     Inresponseto the slower economic growthexperiencedinearly 2004, the Government has
attempted to keep the country's fiscal stance on track by cutting the budget allocation o f line
ministries and public agencies. As part o f this effort, each ministry was required to review its
budget and postpone domestically financed projects until the next budget cycle. Inadopting this
budget review process, which was endorsedby the line ministries, the Ministry o f Finance was able
to protect the priority sectors. Total line ministry and public agency expenditures were cut by an
average o f 7.4 percent, with Health losing 7.1 percent, Primary Education losing 3.6 percent, and
Infrastructure losing 12 percent except for Public Works and Transport, which were cut by 7.5
percent.
125.     The reallocation has also induced a reduction o f the total investment program, which has
translated into delays and a low amount o f commitment comparedto 2003. As o f December 2004,
the rate o f total budget execution on a commitment basis (current and capital) was 45.6 percent,
compared to 66.6 percent in August 2003. Based on the revised level o f the budget, the execution
rate would have been 48.3 percent, ifimplementationo f the budget hadnot been delayed.
 126.    An integratedcomputerized expenditure budget management system, SIGFIP, has been in
place since January 2001. Over 2002-03, SIGFIP has been decentralized to pilot ministries, which
are now connected to the central system, located at the Ministry o f Finance, and can process
expenditure commitments, issue payment orders, and perform ex-ante controls from their own
sites. Starting with FY03, the Finance Bill submitted to the National Assembly did not include a
separate Public Investment Program. Rather, each ministry budget covers both current and
investment expenditure, domestically and externally-financed. However, a significant share o f
expenditure i s executed according to exceptional spending procedures, in particular through cash
advance accounts and spending without prior authorization. The Ministry o f Finance evaluated the
use o f cash advance accounts in 2002, and the decision was made to limit their use to specific
authorized circumstances. As a first step in that direction, 300 accounts were closed in 2003 and
additional 27 in2004.
 127.    PRSC-2 Focus. In2005, the Government would be expected to take action to: (a) improve
implementation o f medium-term program budgets through multi-year management o f investment
expenditure; (b) further strengthen and improve spending procedures, and ensure the full
functionality of SIGFIP, and particularly the full integration o f all public expenditures into the
system; (c) improve SIGFIP's capacity to generate more and better financial information on budget
execution; and (d) decentralize SIGFIP to the regional level. To be able to reach PRSC-2

                                                  37

benchmarks relatedto budget management, the Govemment would be expected to prepare the 2005
Budget Law interms o f multi-year program authorizations and annual payment appropriations, and
adjust computerized budget preparation and budget execution programs accordingly. Corrective
measures which were agreed upon with the Govemment in July 2004, and have been fully
implemented before appraisal o f PRSC-2. These actions would include: (a) reduction o f the
percentage o f exceptional procedures; (b) assessment o f exceptional spending expenses and
procedures, and drafting o f an action plan to regularize pending amounts; and (c) integration into
SIGFIP o f expenses financed by external sources.
128.    Expected Results and/or Outcome. Under PRSC-2, the Government is committed to
completing the following actions to improve implementationo f MTEFand budget execution:
    -   Present the 2005 budget interms o f program authorizations and payment appropriations, as
        specified inthe Budget Law (prior action);
    -   Align the commitment procedure fqr expenditures with public procurement legal
        framework;
    -   Ensure that SIGFIP i s fully functional and extend it to all ministries;
    -   Prepare an action plan for the expansion o f the SIGFIP at the regional level;
    -   Eliminate the use o f cash advance accounts except for the payment o f small expenses.
6.3.3   ImprovingGovernmentAccounting
129.    Background and Key Issues. There have been a number o f revisions to the legal
framework for government accounting since 1999. These measures include: (a) implementation o f
the WAEMU government accounting plan; (b) computerization o f the govemment accounting
function, enabling Treasury to regularly calculate the balance o f accounts; (c) clarification o f the
accumulated imbalances in Treasury accounts, with the approval o f the National Assembly; (d)
resumed production o f annual accounting reports (comptes de gestion), which are submitted to the
Chamber o f Accounts for audit; (e) installation o f software to monitor payment orders and
operations and processing delays; and (f) transfer o f civil service pay management from the Budget
Directorateto Treasury. In addition, the Govemment agreed to a short-term action plan for October
2003 to June 2004 to reform the budget and accounting management. However, critical measures
have not been implemented within the projected period 2003-2004: (a) the closure o f the cash
advance accounts never became effective, and spending without prior authorization has increased
substantially (by 39 percent from December 2003 to M a y 2004); (b) the Government's
administrative accounts for 2002 are still pending, and end-of-year closing transactions have not
been included; and (c) accounting o f donor-financed transactions i s not effective. During the
follow-up mission in June/July 2004, prior actions were agreed upon with the Government, and
their implementationwill be assessedduringthe appraisal mission ofPRSC-2.
 130.   PRSC-2 Focus. PRSC-2 would support the following reforms: (a) installation o f a new
computerized accounting system (ASTER), first at the central level, Le., in Treasury, and then at
the regional level; (b) creation o f an automatic interface between Treasury's computerized accounts
(ASTER) and the computerized expenditure management system (SIGFIP), to ensure consistency
between administrative accounting and general Treasury accounting; and (c) improvements in the
Treasury account statement to comprehensively reflect fiscal operations. In addition, a number o f
shortcomings have been identified in budget management and govemment accounting. As o f
March 2005,, tangible progress has been assessed in the following areas: (a) reduction o f
exceptional procedures (b) arrears o f payments to suppliers, (c) integration into SIGFIP o f
expenditures financed by external resources; (d) justification o f cash advances by beneficiaries
before replenishment; and (e) launching o f ASTER and the interface between ASTER and SIGFIP.


                                                   38

131.     Expected Results and/or Outcome. Under PRSC-2, the Government will complete,
among other things, the installation of ASTER at the central level; and make operational the
interface between SIGFIP and ASTER at the central level.
6.3.4    StreamliningandModernizingInternalControlandAudit
132.     Background. The internalcontrol systeminBeninisbased onthe French system, wherein
a number of entities may carry out internal controls; namely, (a) the Office o f the Financial
Controller; (b) the General Inspectorate for Finance (IGF); (c) the Directorates o f Internal
Inspection and Verification (DNI); (d) public accountants; and (e) General Inspectorates for the
Customs, Tax, and Treasury departments. Ex-ante controls were streamlined and decentralized to
line ministries in 2001. Inthe context o f PERAC, IGF has been strengthened, with 17 new internal
auditors having been appointed and trained in 2000, and two more in 2001-02. Budget resources
for IGF have also been increased. However, the internal control function i s poorly coordinated and
has become more fragmented with the creation o f new institutions in 2000 at the External Debt
Management Agency, CAA, and the Ministry o f Planning (to monitor projects under the Public
Investment Program). More recently, an additional unit in charge o f controlling government
investment projects has been set up in the Office o f the President. However, the overall reform o f
the internal control function that had been proposed during preparation o f PERAC has not been
implemented. Thus, the various internal control mechanisms do not provide reasonable assurance
that public resources are appropriately managed.
133.     PRSC-2 Focus. In 2005, and in collaboration with other donors (EU in particular), the
Government i s expected to plan and implement an overall reform o f its internal control function,
which would simplify and strengthen its internal audit capacity inline with the shift toward results-
based public expenditure management.. The organization and attributions o f internal audit both at
the level o f line ministries and inthe overall government would be clarified and professional norms
and standards would be defined to ensure an effective control function consistent with results-based
management. The scope o f the control function should be improved, as financial controls and IGF
controls would be expected to encompass exceptional procedures and the cash accounts. Ensuring
that internal audit findings are followed up by appropriate actions remains a central challenge o f
the reform, The IGF recommendations would be submitted to the MOF, which would be
responsible for taking appropriate action inresponse to its control findings.
 134.    Expected Results and/or Outcome. The IGF, which is in charge o f preparing and
managing the internal control reform under the supervision o f a Steering Committee, i s expected
to: (a) finalize the reform program; (b) draft a legal text revising the organization and attributions
o f internal audit at the level o f line ministries (DIVI) and the overall government; (c) define
professional norms and standards; and (d) mobilize relevant technical assistance to implement the
reform.
6.3.5    EnhancingExternalOversight
 135.    Background and Key Issues.For the first time since independence, government accounts
for the 1998 budget were prepared and audited by the Chamber o f Accounts and for the same fiscal
year, a budgeting reporting law (Lois de rgglement) has been approved by the National Assembly
in 2002. Also during this period, the Chamber of Accounts was strengthened, particularly inthe
areas o f human and financial resources (the staff doubled) and training activities. This has enabled
the institution to extend its auditing activities to performance audits o f budget execution in pilot
ministries.However, the status o fthe Chamber o fAccounts is not incompliancewith the WAEMU
recommendation for the Chamber o f Accounts to be transformed into an independent Court o f
Auditors (Cow des comptes), which would bringautonomy and independence to the supreme audit
institution. Moreover, the scope o f the Chamber o f Accounts still does not cover government
accountants (comptables publics) and local governments (communes); and the impact o f the

                                                   39

Chamber i s constrained by ineffective sanctions, limited capacity, and lack o f resources and
leadership to follow up on recommendations.
136.     Annual performance reports on program budget implementation were prepared in priority
sectors for 2000 and 2001, and submitted to the Chamber o f Accounts for its first pilot performance
audits. While constrained by the weaknesses o f the program budget implementation as revealed in
the report o f 2000, the audit provided useful comments and identified shortcomings that were
addressed in the 2001 report. A series o f formal performance audits on budget execution was also
completed in2001, and the reports transmitted to the Government and Parliament.
137.     Although the transformation o f the Chamber o f Accounts into a Court o f Auditors, in
accordance with WAEMU directives, remains a priority, a constitutional change i s required. In the
current context o f upcoming presidential election, the riskposed by a constitutional debate suggests
that this will not occur untilafter the election.
138.     PRSC-2 Focus and Results. PRSC-2 will focus on fixther strengthening the capacity of
the Chamber o f Accounts to carry out performance audit reports on program budget
implementation for pilot ministries included in the PRSC dialogue and also to draft a Budget
Reporting Law (Lois de rkglement) to be submitted to the National Assembly.
6.3.6    Reforming and StrengtheningPublicProcurement
139,     Background and Key Issues. In 1999, a Country Procurement Assessment Report
(CPAR) prepared by the Bank concluded that the procurement system in Benin had a significant
number of deficiencies linked to legal and institutional weaknesses, political interference, lack o f
accountability, and non-compliance with existing procurement procedures. Non-compliance was
attributed to the fact that rules and regulations were not widely known, mechanisms were misused,
and/or local entities lacked the capacity to handle procurement in an efficient manner. Key
measures proposed by the CPAR were supported by PERAC.
140.     Inlate 2002, the Ministry of Finance organized a three-day workshop to disseminate the
results of the 1999 CPAR and launchthe process to design and implement an action plan for public
procurement reform. Then, in February 2003, the Ministry o f Finance launched a specialized bi-
weekly report publishingall calls for bidding, evaluation o f bids, and biddingresults. InJune 2003,
the Government established a reform steering committee (CNCS) comprisingrepresentatives from
the public and private sectors and civil society. This committee has recently finalized a detailed
three-year action plan for procurement reform to be supported under the PRSCs. The action plan
takes into account the recommendations o f the 1999 CPAR, which were based on the five pillars o f
a sound public procurement system.
141.     PRSC-2 Focus. Under PRSC-2, the Government will begin to: (a) modernize the
Procurement Code and procedures; (b) buildcapacity, and in particular develop training plans for
target groups and provide adequate human and material resources to the national regulatory
agency, DNMP, and the CMPs; (c) carry out technical audits and handle bidders' complaints; and
(d) adopt measures to reduce corruption in public procurement, such as strengthening anti-
corruption provisions in the Code o f Ethics, defining sanctions, and implementing measures
pertainingto those who commit fraudulent acts.
142.     ExpectedResultsand/or Outcome. Implementation o fthe plannedreforms and activities
over the coming years would lead to: (a) an independent system for periodic auditing and
functional appeal procedures; (b) improved transparency and effectiveness in procurement and
contract management; and (c) legislation enabling the effective enforcement o f sanctions.

6.3.7    ImprovingAdministration and CivilService
143.     Background and Key Issues. Beninhas been engaged inpublic administrative and civil
service reform since the mid-1960s. Through a series o f structural adjustment operations (1989-
1995), the main results were: (a) a freeze on recruitment, which allowed the country to contain
wages bill at less than 5 percent o f GDP; and (b) a reduction in the number o f govemment
employees from 47,000 in 1989 to 30,000 in 2003. Inturn, these measures have progressively led
to the ageing o f staff and a lack o f certain critical skills, which has hampered public service
performance. In 1990, the National Conference (Confdrence desforces vives de la nation), broadly
attended by decision makers from various level o f civil society and the public administration, was
launched to define a national program o f reforms, including administrative reforms. Long and
substantive consultations and negotiations with stakeholders,' in particular with labor unions, led
the Government to adopt an administrative reform action plan in June 2000. By this time, with the
focus o f economic reforms on poverty reduction, there was a shift in priorities toward public
finance management reforms to increase efficiency and accountability, through rational human
resource management and revived civil service reforms. A draft Law was transmitted to the
Parliament, establishing a new civil service statute with a performance-based evaluation system.
However, opposition from trade unions has prevented the new Law from being adopted.* Nor are
institutional arrangements inplace due to a lack o fpolitical commitment to the reforms.
144.     Inaddition to opposition by the unions, the delay encountered inthe civil service reform
was also due to weak capacity in the ministry in charge of the reform effort. This has led to an
important shortcoming with respect to CASDRSC triggers, as discussed above (Para. 27).
Discussions with high-level Ministry staff and other key stakeholders; including donors (notably
UNDP and CIDA) have underscored the needto: (a) set up a participatory approach to reformwith
other ministries, within a well-defined institutional framework; and (b) build on experience at the
sector level in increasing the effectiveness of service delivery. The latter includes the introduction
of program budgets with monitoring indicators in several sectors; development o f a human
resource policy in the health sector, with an incentive scheme to facilitate personnel deployment;
and the decentralized recruitment o f contractual teachers inprimary education. Inthis respect, with
the support o f IDA and other donors, the Government has identified measures to be implemented in
the short term; and has set up a detailed work program to prepare, in 2005: (a) a comprehensive
reform action plan, including a strategy to increase staffing within a sustainable macroeconomic
framework, and (b) a new civil servant statute. Inparticular, MFPTRA has recently: (a) delegated
personnel management responsibilities to the three ministries incharge o f the education sector; and
 (b) set up an operational coordination mechanism to manage public sector reforms. It is expected
that the Govemment will evaluate the latter experience so as to provide the basis for extending the
 delegation o f personnel management responsibilities to other ministries The Government i s
committed to developing an agreement with unions on these reforms, and to serving sector and
local interests inraising the effectiveness o fpublic service.
 145.    ExpectedResults and/or Outcome. The Govemment is expected to lay out a clear vision
 for public sector policy and management, and adopt key measures to:
     -   Simplify and implement an acceptable performance-based remuneration and promotion
         system for the civil service.


 '   The many consultations included a National Consultation on Public Administration in 1994, a workshop on the
 *   National Strategyfor Administrative Reform in 1998, and validation ofthe strategy document in 1999.
     The Bill amending the civil servants' status (Law no. 98-035) was passedby the National Assembly on September
     15, 1998. However, the Supreme Court requested amendments. The modified Bill has been pending in the National
     Assembly since 2000.

    -    Decentralize wage management as part o f the budget delegation to line ministries and
         regional directorates.
    -    Delegate management of.personne1 to local governments (communes), in line with the
         transfer o f competencies scheduled inthe devolution law.
6.3.8    Improve the Deconcentration and Decentralization Process
146.     Background and Key issues. In addition to strengthening results-based financial
management, the laws on decentralization adopted in 1999 have made some significant changes to
the existing territorial admini~tration.~The key points include the following: (a) the ddpartments
retain their entire complement, while local organizations are restructured; and the former six
departments are increasedto twelve; and (b) the structure o f this new entity and its decentralization
at the level o f the commune are laid out. With support o f some donors (including IDA), the
Govemment has strengthened the capacity o f local governments to manage delivery and sustain
key communal and public services in preparation for the challenges they would face following
greater political decentralization. Notwithstanding the adoption o f this legal arsenal and these
achievements, implementation o f the decentralization process and policy has been slow due to
many postponements of local elections (which finally took place in December 2002), the lack o f
operational modalities for the mandated transfers, and an unclear implementation institutional
framework.
147.     Despite some achievements, however, neither the central nor the local administrations are
currently implementing the changes defined by the decentralization laws. The core issues are: (a)
lack of a concrete action plan for achieving better public service delivery through effective
deconcentration; (b) lack o f results-oriented management; and (c) lack o f an official mechanismto
guide the relationship between DepartmentDirectors and users or civil servants.
148.     Despite these shortcomings in implementing the new decentralization framework, there
have been attempts in some sectors to progressively decentralize service delivery. These include
budget transfers to the school level for the purchase of basic pedagogical inputs and/or to recruit
teachers locally; increasing management autonomy o f the health districts; and the empowerment o f
communities to manage facilities inthe social sectors.
149.     Over the past two years, some donors (EU, the Netherlands, and Switzerland) have actively
provided support to the Government to im rove implementation o f the decentralization process.
Two IDA-financed projects (CDD and 2" Decentralized City Management) will also provide
                                                       g
assistance. Core benchmarks agreed upon with these donors include: (a) preparation and adoption
by the Government o f a strategic vision and plan to implement the decentralization and
deconcentration process; (b) the design o f mechanisms for cooperation between deconcentrated
services and prdfets, on the one hand, and mayors on the other; and (c) the timely availability o f
financial resources to the communes. It i s proposed that the subsequent PRSCs build on such
renewed and well-coordinated efforts and provide support to both the budget and fiscal
decentralization process.
150.     Expected Results and/or Outcome. These will include measures such as: (a) automatic
delegation o f current appropriations (as detailed in the Budget Law), beginning day one o f the
fiscal year; (b) delegation o f all recurrent costs to the regional level, including wages o f contract

fiscal framework between the central and local governments; (b) a capacity-building program to
improve budget management by local governments; and (c) an action plan to decentralize spending
authority from the central government to decentralize offices.
6.3.9     Strengtheningthe Legal andJudicial Sector
151.      Background and Key Issues. The GOB has recognized that strong legal and judiciary
systems are indispensable for a sustainable development o f the country's economy and inparticular
o f its private sector. A strong, effective and efficient judicial and legal system, with a transparent
dispute resolution system, provides the private sector with the security needed to invest and thereby
support economic growth. The GOB has therefore, with the Bank's support, prepared a ten-year
Integrated Program for the development and modemization o f Benin's legal and judiciary systems
(named the "Program" hereafter). The Programhas been adopted by the GOB in2001and has been
acknowledged by the European Union, French Cooperation and other donors. It focuses on
strengthening a number o f areas in the legal and judiciary system, namely the Ministry o f Justice,
Legislation and Human Rights (MOJ),            the Courts and the penitentiary system and the
dissemination andpromotion o f human rights.
152.      More than ever, the administration of justice i s a responsibility, which the Govemment
shares with the private sector and civil society. The Government, the people o f Benin, the donors
and civil society have all expressed their willingness to support the reform o f the justice sector. For
the reform to be successful, all concerned parties will need to support it for a sufficiently long
period o f time. The Program's components are all interdependent and they must be approached ina
balanced manner. Moreover, in order to achieve sustainable reform, it i s important to realize a
critical mass o f actions supportingmodernizationfor the entire justice sector.
 153.     The justice system i s performing poorly but its performance can be improved significantly.
The Program will address the most important weaknesses o f the MOJ, the courts, the penitentiary
system and the legal framework. It i s essential that the Program is kept together and not
disintegrated into separate programs. The MOJ, at present, has problems spending its budget. The
service delivery o f the courts i s threatened by a dwindling o f the number o f staff and other
resources. It will, therefore, be vital to supply the courts with more magistrates and clerks (who at
the same time will have to be trained better), as well as with necessary equipment. Legislation to
improve the status and remuneration of magistrates (making the judiciary more attractive to
qualified candidates), has been adopted and implementation has started. A first group o f
magistrates has been recruited and i s undergoing training. At the same time, a first group o f clerks
has been recruited. The competition for the recruitment o f additional magistrates and clerks has
taken place on September 11, 2004. As a result, court performance should improve visibly by a
much speedier handling o f cases. At present, the lack o f baseline data makes it difficult to identify
key values for the indicators with which to evaluate the implementation and results o f the Program.
Collecting this baseline data will therefore be a top priority. The new legislation concerning the
status and remuneration o f the magistrates i s a great step forward in improving the judiciary's
independence. However, in the longer term, more reform will be needed to make the judiciary a
more independent and self-goveming organization,                meeting international standards o f
independence and impartiality.
 154.     Planned Reforms. The MOJ has prepared an Implementation Plan o f the Program for
2005-07 that aims to strengthen the effectiveness, efficiency, and accessibility o f the justice system
by:
      -   Improvingthe capacity of MOJto carry out the reforms byrecruiting additional staff and
          providing adequate equipment and in-service training to staff.

                                                    43

    -   Improvingservice delivery of the courts by rehabilitating existing court buildings and
        constructing new court building (such rehabilitations and constructions being financed by
        the EU), adopting new regulations applicable to all legal professions, reforming the
        chancellery ("greffe" or court clerk's office) and through better training and equipment for
        the courts, as well as improved initial and in-service training for all legalprofessions.
    -   Modernizing the penitentiary system by instituting alternative sanctions, improving
        infrastructure o f the prison system and training facilities in prisons, and providing support
        for social integrationo f inmates.
    -   More effective legal and human rights protection, particularly o f minorities, women,
        children, and youth, by modernizing the national legal framework, and by building
        awareness among the population o f their legal and human rights as well as the existence o f
        the Program.
155.    While providing broad support to the implementation o f MOJ's program duringthe 2005-
2007 period, the PRSCs would focus on the two first axis as presented above, i.e. improving the
capacity o f M O J to carry out the reforms and to improving service delivery o f the courts. With
regard to the latter axis, the specific activities to be supported would be adjusted over time as
needed. This will reflect the initiatives that would be taken by the Govemment inthe context o f its
strategy to promote the private sector development as presented in paragraph 63, and whose
implementationwould be under the responsibility o f MOJ.
156.    PRSC-2 Focus. In2005, support will be specifically provided to (a) puttinginplace the
prerequisites for reform, including an information system to generate data on the sector's essential
indicators, (bi) carrying out an institutional audit o f MOJ, (c) putting in place a monitoring and
evaluation system at MOJ, (d) designing and starting to implement an in-service training program
(which in particular would cover OHADA legislation) for M O J staff and magistrates, and (e)
providing equipment for MOJ and courts. PRSC-2 would also support (a) the preparation o f
modernized regulations applicable to all legal professions, (b) the establishment o f a Legal and
Judiciary Information Center, and (c) the efforts o f NGOs to inform people o f their legal and
human rights.
157.    Expected Results and Outcome. Justice is a new sector in PRSC-2. Baseline and target
values will be derived from information to be obtained as part o f the 2005-2007 Implementation
Plan. The expected results include:
     -  Proper execution o f the program budget for the MOJ, including improving using rate o f
        funds in the budget (without taking into account personnel expenditures) from 70 percent
        in2004to 80percent in2005 and 85 percent in2006.
     -  Significant improvement inthe yearly disposal rate o f court cases (from around 20 to more
        than 30 percent by 2005 and more than 50 percent by 2006).
158.    The above outcome would be adjusted as needed under subsequent PRSCs as the justice-
related aspects o f the private sector development strategy under the responsibility o f M O J are
developed and implemented.
6.3.10 ImprovingPublicCommunicationandTransparency
 159.   Background.With the recent launcho fthe PRSP dissemination andthe implementationo f
a set of outreach activities on this topic, the Government has created a momentum for building a
broader dialogue on its poverty reduction strategy and its reforms. Inaddition, the Government has
publicly recognized corruption and lack of transparency as a problem and has committed to tackle
these challenges.



                                                   44

160.     As part of its effort to reach the completion point under the HIPC initiative, the
Government adopted, in July 2002, a comprehensive anti-corruption strategy to increase
transparency and accountability. The strategy encourages the adoption o f specific anti-corruption
laws, the strengthening of the institutional capacity o f the judiciary, the introduction o f
administrative procedure manuals for Government departments to ensure transparency, and the
strengthening o f government audit agencies. In addition to the anti-conuption strategy, a
comprehensive public expenditure reform program addressing corruption practices was put inplace
to improve the fiduciary framework.
161.     To coordinate the anti-corruption efforts, the GOB established an anti-corruption agency
(Cellule de la Moralisation de la ViePublique CMVP) in 1996. This agency oversees the actions
                                                 -
of a number of bodies, including the Chamber o f Accounts (La Chambre de Comptes), the General
Inspectorate o f Finance (L'Inspection Gdndrale des Finances), the General Inspectorate o f Judicial
Services (L'Inspection Gdndrale des Services Judiciaires), and the General Inspectorate o f State
(L'Inspection Gdndrale de IEtat). The agency i s also engaged in a wide variety o f outreach
activities to promote communication, and to raise awareness and inform citizens o f their rights and
obligations. Moreover, the agency investigates cases and reports its findings to the judiciary or
competent administration for appropriate action. Financial fraud cases detected through audits and
other means since 1996 have been listed, and the Government has established a national
commission to examine these cases. In several instances, the responsible individuals have been
prosecuted and sentenced.
162.     Key Issues. There i s a real need for the country still to reinforce its capacity to organize a
policy-based public debate on key issues such as poverty reduction, good governance, and public
sector reform. The Government also needs to reinforce its institutionalized public communication
and consultation mechanisms for working with civil society, the private sector, the media, and
other stakeholders. The country has little experience with participatory monitoring mechanisms
that would enable citizens to hold the Government accountable for its performance.
 163.    To begin addressing some o f these issues, the GOB has committed to a participatory and
transparent governance diagnostic effort. This effort - Benin's first Governance and Corruption
Diagnostic Surveys - i s underway and expected to be completed by mid-2005. It comprises three
separate surveys o f public officials, business people, and citizens. The Steering Committee
responsible for the diagnostic surveys, led by the General Inspectorate o f the Ministry o f Finance
(IGF) has completed the work associated with the launch o f the surveys, in coordination with the
international donor community, and launched the field work in October 2004. Inparallel, the IGF
has led the efforts to establish an Observatory for the Fightagainst Corruption, an inter-institutional
body with investigative functions.
 164.    The diagnostic survey will provide the analytical underpinnings for governance reforms,
by collecting detailed information on the mechanisms and extent o f corruption, the quality o f
governance and services delivered by public agencies. In addition, the surveys will provide
information on the three core cross-cutting functions o f government - personnel, financial, and
procurement management. This information will strengthen policy makers' ability to prioritize
reforms, and enable citizens to monitor govemment's efforts and the quality o f public service by
providing detailed benchmarks. Combined with the results o f other analytical studies o f the public
 sector, such as the PER o f 2004, this information will provide a framework for determining the
extent o f corruption.
 165.    PlannedActions. It is proposed that the following initiatives be supported by PRSC-2, to
enhance information disclosure, improve Government communication and reduce the incidence o f
corruption:



                                                  45

     -    Analyze the regulatory framework on Government information, and assess the perceptions
          and attitudes of relevant stakeholders, including legislators, regarding the issues o f
          transparency and disclosure o f information.
     -    Review and enhance the existing public information and communication systems o f the
          line ministries, as well as the inter- and intra-ministerial communication systems and
         mechanisms (i.e., cellules de communication).
     -    Introduce participatory monitoring mechanisms to allow stakeholders to monitor the
         quality o f key public service delivery. These mechanisms could include selected modules
          from the governance diagnostics. The results o f such monitoring exercises could be
         regularly published and used by civil society to monitor the Government's progress with
         reforms.
     -   Complete the diagnostic surveys and produce a report summarizing the main results and
         priorities for reform, disseminate the report throughout the country and within the public
         administration, revise the Strategic Anti-Corruption Plan, including target dates for
         implementation and a budget for eachmeasure set out inthe Plan.
     -   Coordinate the anti-corruption initiatives with the comprehensive public administration
         reform, which has been postponed until 2005, to enhance the effectiveness o f its reform
         efforts. The postponement offers an opportunity for the Government to use the results o f
         the Governance and Anti-Corruption Diagnostic Surveys and the PER as inputs for such
         reforms.
166.     Based on this analysis and other opinion researchinthe country, it i s suggested to continue
the efforts in disseminating the PRSP, and develop a comprehensive national information and
communication strategy for the government's poverty reduction strategy and its reform agenda.
167.     PRSC-2 Focus. PRSC-2 will build on best practices in good governance and
communication mechanisms in other countries. In particular, PRSC-2 will support the
Government's efforts to: (a) promote a culture o f transparency, accountability and stakeholder
participation in the decision-making process (b) integrate its anti-corruption efforts into broader
.public expenditure management reforms; and (c) update and finalize the Strategic Anti-Comption
Plan, As a key input to promote participation and increase accountability, PRSC-2 would support
the strengthening o f existing accountability mechanisms and institutional capacity in Government
agencies. The proposed actions will enable civil society groups, the media, and local communities
to pro-actively influence policies and monitor their progress.
 168.    Expected Results andor Outcome. The proposed actions will: (a) facilitate access to
government information by the general population; (b) improve capacity at the government level to
carry out communication activities, with an adequate communication system in place; (c) generate
a continual two-way dialogue between the Government and national constituents; (d) define an
integrated approach to communications, transparency, and monitoring, taking into account existing
public sector reporting and monitoring mechanisms for each o f the three key functions; and (e)
coordinate the public administration reformefforts with the Anti-Corruption Strategy.

7.1     REFORMMEASURESAND ACTIONS TAKEN PRIOR TO BOARDPRESENTATION

169.     As part of the reformto be supported by the PRSC, the Government has already completed
or i s in the process to do so for most o f the actions presented in the Policy Matrix (Schedule 2),
which are largely in line with the agreements reached under PRSC-1. The following prior actions
for PRSC-2 have been selected because they are important inpaving the road for structural, cross-

                                                   46

cutting andor sectoral reform implementation and are judged essential for achieving the overall
program objectives:

        inpublic schools, andhas improvedteacher distribution withinandacross districts;
    -   Two action plans adopted in2003 have been implemented to improve school retention and
        the execution o f educational reforms, including the following measures:

        (i)     preparationo f an implementationreport regarding the abolishment o frepetition in
                Grade 1;

        (ii)    preparationo f a construction program o f at least fifty (50) classrooms to be hnded
                under the 2005 budget to reduce discontinuity intargeted geographical areas;

7.3   COORDINATION WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS

7.3.1   Coordination with the InternationalMonetaryFund
170.    The IMF completed a sixthand final review, under a three-year arrangement and under the
Poverty Reductionand Growth Facility (PRGF), on March 29,2004. Recent discussions held at the
IMF Board of Directors (inOctober 2004) inthe context o f Article IV consultationwith Benin, led
to the agreement to pursue the program with the country under a PRGF arrangement with low
access. The preparation mission o f this program took place inMarch 2005 and the negotiations are
expected to be completed by midM a y 2005. The two institutionshave agreed to coordinate closely


                                                   49

the preparation of the PRSC and the PRGF. The IMF will continue to concentrate on
macroeconomic issues in Benin, focusing specifically on short and medium-term macroeconomic
stability and incentives. As before, IDA will closely collaborate and coordinate activities with the
IMF. Inparticular, the staff o f both institutions will continue to conduct joint PRSP missions and
prepare joint staff advisory note (JSAN) o f the PRSP on an annual basis. Staff will also conduct
joint reviews o f public expenditure management, inparticular inthe context o f the Assessment and
Action Plan (AAP)for HIPC countries.
7.3.2    Coordinationwith the African Development Bank
 171.    Consistent with the Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) between the African
Development Bank (AfDB) and the World Bank, the staff o f both organizations increasingly
conduct joint missions, share information and documents more systematically, and coordinate their
respective activities inBenin. Joint supervision missions, which also include bilateral donors, have
been conducted in the          health,   water,   and    education  sectors.  As   foreseen   in its
2002-04 Country Strategy Paper for Benin, the AfDB has prepared, in collaboration with the
Government and donors, a policy-based loan that i s consistent with and supports aspects o f the
PRSC. In addition, the project modality, particularly at the sector level, i s likely to remain an
important vehicle that the AfDB will use to channel financial aid to Benin inthe short and medium
term.
 172.    For 2004-05, the AfDB has prepared a program loan in close coordination with IDA. This
program loan, equivalent to US$33.5 million, together with a grant equivalent to US$1.44 million,
was approved on December 10, 2003 to finance the first Poverty Reduction Strategy Support
Program (PRSSP) in Benin. This program loan became effective on August 9, 2004. The content
and conditionalities o f this program loan are aligned with the PRSP and coordinated with PRSC
triggers. On public procurement reform, the AfDB and IDA teams are coordinating their technical
advice and have agreed on a joint set o f conditionalities and triggers. The two teams will also
continue to work closely on public expenditure management reform, public procurement reform,
and capacity building.
7.3.3    Coordinationwith Other Multilateral and Bilateral Donors
 173.    As initiatedunder PERAC and reaffirmed inthe 2003 CAS, the Bank is taking the lead in
coordinating donors' programmatic lending activities through the PRSC. Discussions with donors
that are preparing budget support operations (AfDB, EU, Denmark, the Netherlands, and
 Switzerland) are leading to improved alignment o f support to Benin's PRSPiMTEF. The main
objectives o f this coordination are to: (a) support the implementation o f Benin's PRSP through the
Government budget cycle, while moving toward a common assessment framework; (b) reduce
transaction costs; (c) enhance the predictability o f resource flows; and (d) conduct joint reviews at
both the macro and sectoral levels (Annex 6).
 174.    Significant progress has been made in these areas during the past twelve months. First, at
the sectoral level, joint Government-donors reviews were camed out in the core sectors o f rural
water, health, and education in May/June 2004, and led to concrete recommendations and
agreements aimed at sharpening the existing strategic framework and increasing the effectiveness
o f service delivery inthese sectors. Discussions are underway to expand this promising experience
to other sectors, such as agriculture and transport. Second, the recent pre-appraisal mission o f the
PRSC-2 (in September 2004) was carried out in the context o f the first joint mission o f the main
 donors that are providing budget support for PRSP implementation. The mission outcomes have
clearly laid the groundwork for improved donor coordination around PRSP implementation.
 Specific results o f the mission included: (a) an agreement by the donors and the Government on
usinga common policy matrix, while the Government gradually improves the quality o f the PRSP
policy matrix; (b) an agreement by the donors to align and consolidate the performance indicators

                                                   50

that will be used to measure progress in the main sectors. The need to accelerate the pace o f
harmonization was also discussed and agreed upon by all stakeholders. A consensus was reached
on maintaining active consultations during the coming months under the leadership o f the
Government, as the M o U governing the process.
175.     Although the AfDB team was not able to join the mission because o f time constraints
related to the effectiveness o f the ongoing budget support operation, it has nonetheless fully based
its latest supervision and identification mission on the results o f the multi-donor mission.

7.4     PRSPmRSCMONITORINGEVALUATION  AND                 SYSTEM
176.     The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for the PRSC will be based on the M&E
system developed earlier for the PRSP. Although it needs strengthening, significant progress has
been made inthe past few years to buildthe capacity o f organizations tasked with the responsibility
o f collecting, analyzing and disseminating data and other information. Inparticular, detailed results
o f the 2002 census provide u s e h l new information for improving poverty diagnosis and
strengthening poverty analysis while monitoring and evaluation units established in line ministries
have begun to play progressively their role. Duringthe appraisal mission it became clear that the
evaluation culture i s taking root around the PRSP implementation but that the existing capacity
varies. The M&E readiness assessment o f ministries showed that three ministries/institutions,
namely Health, Environment and OCS (the central agency for monitoring PRSP indicators), meet
the criteria o f readiness and that they have a highcapacity to carry out M&Ework. Education and
Transport ministries have medium capacity while the other ministries have a low capacity (see
details in Annex 4). It was agreed that these ministries with l o w capacity will require support
through adequate training and staffing.
 177.     Significant steps have been recently taken by the Government in liaison with the donors to
address discrepancies between the Ministry o f Finance and Economy and the Ministry o f Planning
with respect to demarcation o f responsibilities for M&E, which should lead to vastly improving
their capacity for coordinating the PRSP M&E system as well as for data collection, analysis and
reporting. Relevant texts have been signed in November 2004 leading to a smoother and more
effective collaboration between the two main technical arms o f the system, i.e. the permanent
Secretariat o f the National Committee for Development and the Fight Against Poverty (ST-
CNDLP) located in the Ministry o f Finance and Economy and the Observatory o f Social
Conditions (OCS) under the Ministry o f Planning. The priority now i s to assist these two bodies to
revise and improve the existing monitoring and evaluation guide and to prepare a three-year work
program, which should include the capacity building needs. It was agreed that the donors would
closely coordinate their efforts in providing technical support to the implementation o f this
program.
 178.     Progress has been also made inthe area o f monitoring householdliving conditions and the
incidence o f income poverty. A joint Government/donors methodological workshop was held in
March2004 to discuss ways to remedy the methodological weaknesses identified inpast household
 surveys. The program would include an annual CWIQ, and a nationwide integrated household
 survey every three to five year. Proposals prepared jointly by OCS and the National Statictics
 Office (INSAE) are expected to be submitted shortly for review to donors involved inthis area. A s
was the case for PRSC-1, monitoring an evaluation o fthe PRSC-2 supported program will continue
to be fully embedded in the PRSP M&E system. The Government has agreed that reviews o f the
PRSP, PRSC, and other donor budget-support operations will be based on the common policy
 matrix along with sectoral performance indicators and targets set in the program budgets. Inthis
 context, a core set of indicators, as presented in Annex 4, has been retained to evaluate progress
under the PRSCs. The set includes some high-level outcome indicators (mostly linked to the
MDGs) that aim at keeping the attention and the momentum o f all parties involved on these

                                                   51

important big goals. Recognizing that the realization o f some o f these outcomes actually should be
put into medium and longer-term perspectives, it was agreed that the related indicators will only
serve as a basis to assess the trends inachieving these long-term goals. Furthermore, accountability
inthe annual reviews willbe basedona weighed appreciation ofthe short-term identifiedresults as
well as the demonstrated commitment by the Government inimplementing the policy reforms.
179.     With the CWIQ available and the first GACS becoming available soon, and by conducting
some pilot Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys, Benin would improve the PRSC results
framework and track the performance and poverty impact o f the Government's health and
education policies. This would expand the annual audit o f HIPC expenditure (mostly budget
transfers to health centers and local schools) to all budget resources allocated to health centers and
local schools." Also, progress on the PRSC would be the object o f specific outreach and
dissemination efforts to the media and the general public, aimed at raising awareness o f the
country's main govemance challenges, and encouraging the use o f participatory monitoring
mechanisms to generate pressure for better service delivery.

7.5   REVIEW INSTRUMENTS

180.     Joint PRSP Reviews, and Joint Budget and Appraisal Missions. To ensure timely
feedback into the policymaking and budget processes, preparation o f the first Annual Progress
Report i s being coordinated with the budget preparation timetable, and with preparationo f donors'
budget support operations. A Progress Report has been prepared, and served as the basis for ajoint
Govemment/donor review, which was held early February 2005.
181.     Sector Reviews. The Government has agreed that reviews o f the PRSP, PRSC, and other
budget support operations will be based on the sectoral performance indicators and targets set out
in sector program budgets. Moreover, in an effort to more closely monitor poverty-reducing
expenditure, the Government has agreed with the IMF and IDA to monitor implementation o f key
programs defined in sectoral program budgets. Joint Govemment/donor reviews o f PRSC sector
programs (rural water, health, and education) were carried out in May/June 2004 and during the
pre-appraisal mission. The results o f these sector reviews fed into the preparation o f the first
Annual Progress Report, and into the 2005 budget that has been sent to the Parliament.

7.6   INCENTIVEFRAMEWORKTHE PRSC      OF
182.     Annual PRSC disbursement amounts can be modulated based on the team's judgment
regardingprogress in:
    -    Meeting CAS triggers to move from the base case lending scenario to the highcase.
    -    Implementingpolicies and reforms agreed upon under PRSC-2.
183.     In addition, the Bank would monitor progress inreaching targets set for indicators under
PRSC-2 (see Annex 4 on the PRSC sectoral monitoring framework). However, contrary to the EU,
which rewards progress on indicators, progress in reaching these targets will not be used to adjust
PRSC annual amounts.




lo  The Government has prepared a comprehensive audit and impact assessment of HIPC expenditures in 2000 and
    2001 It shows that money spent on HIPC-supportedprograms is: (a) properlymanaged accordingto specifiedrules
         I

    and procedures; (b) receivedby the intendedrecipients; and (c) effectively used to benefit the targeted population
    and for the intendedobjectives.

7.7    CREDITADMINISTRATION
7.7.1   Alignmentwith PRSP andBudget Cycle
184.    As with PRSC-1, PRSC-2 is aligned with the Government budget cycle; even though its
disbursement would not take place early 2005, as initially planned. The second Annual Progress
Report, on PRSP, should be prepared during the first semester o f 2005, with the annual
Govemment/donor PRSP progress review held in June 2005. This would allow the results o f the
previous fiscal year to inform: (a) the Annual Progress Review; (b) preparation o f the budget for
the following fiscal year (update o f the macro-framework), the MTEF, and medium-term sector
program budgets; and (c) the design o f DBS operations. In parallel, the Government plans to
launch shortly the preparation o fthe second PRSP, which would be completed by June 2006.
7.7.2   In-Country Coordinationwith Donors
185.    As mentioned above, the preparation of PRSC-2 has been characterized by increasing
collaboration among the Bank and other donors that are providing budget support to Benin,
including the African Development Bank, the European Union, Netherlands, Denmark, and
Switzerland. The first joint mission took place in Cotonou during September 2004. This
collaboration will be progressively strengthened through joint Govemment/donor                sector
performance reviews involving all donors supporting the sectors either financially or technically.
Through the PRSP donor coordination, sector and thematic technical groups have been set up, with
different donors taking the lead in sector program and policy dialogue. For example, Denmark i s
taking the lead inrural water, the European Union inhealth, and USAID ineducation.

7.8    ENVIRONMENTAL      ASSESSMENT
186.     The PRSC Working Group has recommended that this PRSC be classified, as a S E C K
and that OP 4.01, necessitating an environmental assessment will be required. An Integrated
Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS) recommending categorization as a B was prepared. This ISDS
documents the main safeguards issues o f the planned investments, as well as the measures
proposed to mitigate any adverse environmental and social impacts that may result. Following the
approval of the IntegratedSafeguards Data Sheet (ISDS), and the B categorization by the Regional
Safeguard Unit, an Environmental Assessment Annex was prepared. When this Annex i s cleared
by the Regional Safeguard Unit, it has been disclosed through the World Bank InfoShop. Its
Frenchversion has been disclosed inBeninprior to the appraisal o f the credit.

7.9    BENEFITS AND RISKS
 187.    Benefits. The proposed PRSC-2 would assist the Government in implementing the PRSP
and reducing poverty by improving public expenditure management and making service delivery
more effective. Also, line ministries are expected to become more responsible and efficient in
budget formulation and execution. The Government will be able to consolidate progress in the
management o f spending on economic and social development and poverty alleviation through
improved services delivery. While a decline of the world price for cotton will reduce the welfare o f
farmers, a subsidy to cotton producers will ensure that rural population affected by the cotton shock
are not left back. A subsidy o f 0.7% o f the GDP would help to compensate the loss inducedby the
shortfall incotton marketing season o f 2004/2005.
 188.    Risks and Mitigation. The main risk is the economy's vulnerability to a further drop in
cotton prices and/or cotton production. Given the economic importance o f the cotton sector, a
significant drop ininternational cotton prices or a disruption o fproduction would affect growth and
living standards. There are ongoing discussions with the Government and other donors about
accelerating completion o f the reform agenda in the sector, in order to reduce its vulnerability and


                                                  53

improve sustainability. Progress in diversifying the overall economy will be critical to mitigating
thisriskinthe longrun.Furtherpreparationwork for the PRSCswill give attention to these issues.
189.    Vulnerabilityto Economic and PoliticalDevelopmentsin Nigeria. The vulnerability is
directly link to the volatility o f the world price o f the cotton. Inorder to protect the cotton farmers
from the decline o f the international price, the Government i s resolved to continue with the reform
in the sector, to complete the privatization of SONAPRA and the provision of the subsidy to
farmers i s a transitory process. Inthe absence o f safety nets, the Government in collaborationwith
the stakeholders has set out a simple and enforceable mechanism agreed by all actors, for the
distribution of inputs, the preparation o f the harvesting season. A study on private-based
stabilization of the cotton price stabilization will be completed in 2005. This risk related to trade
with Nigeria has started to materialize in 2004 (see section on macroeconomic developments).
Mitigation strategies should continue to focus on making Benina more efficient trade platform, by:
(a) ensuring that the customs system operates fairly and efficiently; (b) encouraging WAEMU to
adopt even more liberal and open trading policies; and (c) ensuring that infrastructure services are
delivered at lowest cost (especially port and transport operations).
190.    Slippages in Key Reforms and Program Implementation.The presidential campaign
and upcoming election could result in political conditions and institutional dynamics that might
increase fiduciary risk (especially with respect to direct budgetary support), and slow the pace o f
reform and program implementation. This risk i s controlled under the CAS triggers, since it could
have important setback effects on the Govemment's ability to maintain a stable macroeconomic
environment, A careful assessment of the situation would be done during PRSC-3 preparation, and
taken into account in finalizing the program, with the view to retaining what could be realistically
delivered.
191.    Weak InstitutionalCapacity. Despite some slight improvements in public expenditure
management, weak institutional capacity remains an important risk, since it could slow the pace o f
improvements in public service delivery and the implementation o f core reforms. The expanding
scope o f the program adds to the pressures on institutional capacity. Although increased ownership
by the Government and other local stakeholders promises to create national capacity in the long
run, various approaches would be used in the shorter term to build capacity as part of program
implementation. These include: (a) outsourcing services when appropriate, through an active
partnership with private providers; and (b) implementing tailored capacity building activities,
funded under the national budget and/or by donors.

7.10 ANALYTICALWORK PROGRAM
192.    The PRSC-2 program would be based on analytical work that i s currently underway or has
recently been completed by the Bank or other donors. The latter work include the results o f the
2002 national census, published inFebruary 2004; the Poverty Assessment and Household Survey,
based on CWIQ methodology; the Country Health Status Report; the Public Expenditure Review o f
the water, health, and education sectors; and the Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) o f

                                                New Sectors

Agriculture
Presently the existing monitoring and evaluation system i s rather weak and fragmented. The basic
data are not completed; their analyses are punctual and weakly disseminated among the
stakeholder. The definition and structure o f existingtools remain fragile and hardly applicable to
some extents.
The Objective i s to assist the Government progressively build up along with the program
implementationa sound and functional sectoral monitoring and evaluation system so as to be able
to measure sector performance with respect to the main set o f objectives, notably:
   -    to increase income o f producers and inparticular the poorer;
    -   to reduce malnutrition and to increase access o f the population to agricultural products
        for consumption;
    -   to improve the agriculturalproduct exportations; and
    -   to protect the environment.
Inthis respect, the MinistryofAgriculture inliaisonwith itspartners (agricultural professional
organizations, private sector, local and national representatives o f elected bodies) should prepare
and execute a work program that aims at:
    -   providing basic information on the status and/or situation o f each key elements o f the
        sectoral program;
    -   finalizing the performance indicatorsto measure progress;
    -   enhancing the existing capacity (qualified personnel, training provision, equipments);
    -   institutionalizing and to include in the budget partnerships or outsourcing o f tasks to
        qualified institutions.
IftheMinistryofAgriculturehasthefinalresponsibilityfortheannualproductionofrequired
reports and indicators, it does not mean that it should actually execute all the tasks involved. The
greatest part o f this work i s or could be actually camed out by others (Statistical Institute,
Research Institute, Chamber o f Commerce, etc.). Appropriate outsourcing strategies along with
required supervision and accountability should be set up and implemented.
The objective i s that a full-fledged sectoral monitoring framework along with key indicators be in
place by PRSC-4. To that end, the following sequence o f actions i s being considered:
    -   PRSC-2: (a) Setting up the system o f statistics and information to feed the technical and
        financial monitoring and evaluation systems; (b) Definition o f performance indicators for
        the sector; (c) Definition o f methodology and criteria for analyzing the poverty- focus o f
        the agricultural investment programs; (d) Definition and setting up the pilot monitoring
        and evaluation o f the sector; (e) Selection and signing contract with partners o f
        datacollection and processing. At the end o f PRSC-2, the complete device i s inplace with
        human resources, key tools and the means o f operations.
    -   PRSC-3: (a) Data collection and first analyses; (b) finalization and production o f the
        baselines; (c) definition o f the program-budget for PRSC-4 based on these analyses.

Rural Road
The Ministry in charge o f the Public Works and Transportation (MTPT) has started collecting
only a few technical data on Rural Roads. These data are o f very poor quality and do not help in
the assessment o f the rural road implementation program impact, a measure o f satisfaction and
accessibility to rural and production areas or to community services. In addition, performance
indicators on global transportation are not provided well enough as to establish the base line
values. Inorder to fill the gap o f information and to develop sound strategy in providing data to
monitor the MDGs,the MTPT i s planningto carry out some studies and surveys which include:
     -   A Study to help identify and formulate performance indicators and to establish also their
         base line values. This study i s financed by the EU and will not cover all the data needed
         to assess the accessibility to rural and production areas and to community services;
     -   Incoordination with the ministries incharge of health, education and agriculture and
         with local communities, the MTPT will conduct a survey to identify and locate the
         situation o f the basic community services (health and education centers etc.) and the
         production areas in term o f distance to any road in fair condition. Such surveys would
         help establish sound benchmarks for developing a real strategy for meeting the objective
         o f accessibility and sound framework for the monitoring o f the rural transport program.
         These surveys will also integrate the result from the survey undertaken by the Ministry
         o f Health in2001 and 2004.
The MTPT has planned getting conclusiono f the EU study by the end of year 2005 or early 2006.
This would providethe Ministrywith sound and well formulatedperformance indicators and their
base line values. However, setting up a monitoring framework for the rural transport would need
little more than three (3) years because o f the delay inconductingthe surveys described above.

Justice
The Ministry o f Justice, Legislation and Human Rights ("MOJ") has produced very few baseline
data so far. Establishing a sound information and management system o f legal andjudiciary data
within the MOJ i s a key part o f the 2005-2007 Implementation Plan o f the o f the Government's
ten-year Integrated Program for the Development and Modernization o f Benin's Legal and
Judiciary Systems. In2005, the M O J i s planning to carry out some key studies whose results will
help better define the roadmap for developing a full fledge monitoring framework for the sector.
These include:
     -   a study regarding data management tools needed at the M O J and implementation o f the
        recommendations o f such study; and
     -   a study regardingbaseline values for the performance indicators.
The MOJ envisages gathering the first essential baseline data by November 2005 (number o f
cases handledby each court; number o f people detained awaiting judgment inpercentage of the
total number o f people convicted; and number o f appealed decisions). In2006, baseline data for
main sector indicators will have to be determined. Establishing a sound information and
management system o f legal andjudiciary data will take three years.

Improving Private Sector Development Climate

Background. Major microeconomic reforms have been undertaken by the Government during
the past decade and contributed to changing the incentives for private sector growth. The State
had withdrawn from virtually all commercial activities, has initiated the privatization o f key
energy and telecommunicationinfrastructures and i s implementing a broad liberalization program
in the cotton sector. Financial intermediary services improved as the result of an in-depth
restructuring effort o f the existing banking system which actually led to a fully privately-owned
banking system. Benin's trade regime i s open with tariffs among the lowest inthe region. Despite
these favorable policies, the private investment ratio has stagnated at a relatively low level even
by SSA or WAEMU standards, since the mid-9O's (11percent on average since 1996).

Issues. Main constraints to private sector development already identified include: (a) the
governance and capacity weakness o f the judicial system making any private investment very
risky; (c) the lack of titled land (together with weak judicial system) which makes access to land
very problematic and limits access to credit (no land collateral); (d) the unfair competition from

infrastructurehtility bottlenecks and high costs; and (e) sector specific regulatory issues - i.e.,
informal players - especially with respect to taxes and import tariffs evasion; (iv) the

telecommunicationlicensing and certification o f quality standards for food export products. Other
constraints may include labor market issues (Le. skills and regulations) as well as administrative
barriers. The PRSP identifies several o f the many obstacles faced by the private sector in
expanding its activities and investing. These constraints include weaknesses in the judicial
system, low financial intermediation, high transaction costs owing to inadequate infrastructure,
and an insufficient supply o f skilled workers. The PRSP stresses the importance o f completing
the privatization program and implementing the comprehensive ten-year program for reforming
and strengthening the legal andjudicial system. The private sector development strategy has to be
expanded to address the other issues listed above.

Planned Reforms. The PRSC-supported program would aim at enhancing first generation
 structural reforms to increase private sector investment and thus enhance its contribution to
economic growth. Under the PRSC, emphasis will be placed on performance-based actions which
 could contribute to the enhancement o f the country's investment climate and competitiveness
with targets established for such objectives as: (a) reduction in the time and cost o f registering a
business, (b) cost improvements along value chain o f selected sectorshub-sectors and; (c)
efficiency gains inprovision o f selected infrastructure services such as the supply chain, the port
and airport operations efficiency and the transportation costs. Inthe case o f infrastructure services
and wherever public sector funding i s deployed in support o f private sector led, managed- or
owned-initiatives, particular attention will be paid to ensure agreed upon transparency, result
 accountability and exit strategies are inplace.

PreparatorySteps. Preparatory work include three steps to: (a) carry out a thorough diagnostic
 of impediments to private sector development (2004); (b) based on this diagnostic, develop a
realistic private sector led growth strategy and a medium-term results-based implementation
program inclose consultation with the private sector; and (c) develop a public-private partnership
 to implement this strategy. In2004, diagnostic work would be conducted to identify constraints

and impediments to further develop the private sector, particularly those which currently limit
foreign direct investment in the country. The diagnostic work include: an Investment Climate
Assessment (ICA), a trade integration diagnostic study, a FIAS study on land market issues, a
Competitiveness study to identify the main sources o f growth, sector specific studies on the main
sources o f growth (including studies o f the tourism and agro business sectors to be conducted by
the CNUCED). These studies are underway or about to start, and most o f the results should be
available during the first quarter o f 2005. Support will be provided to prepare and create
conditions for holding successful discussions on the strategy such as investment roundtables.

InstitutionalIssues and Prerequisitesfor Banksupport to PrivateSector Development.The
Government i s currently engaged in various initiatives that aim at promoting private sector-led
growth (PRSP improvement, IDA private sector development project, (Trade) Integrated
Framework, other donor-driven private sector development projects). Although pursuingthe same
objectives, each initiative is developed within a different institutional framework, conducted by a
different ministry, and has set-up different ad-hoc publidprivate sector consultative mechanisms.
It is critical for the Government and donors, to reaffirm that the reference framework for
intervention i s the PRSP. Priority should therefore be given to ensure prerequisites for PRSC
support are met: (i)  set-up a unique institutional framework regardingprivate sector development
both at the political and technical levels; (ii)      set-up a unique consultative publidprivate sector
mechanism; and (iii)   strengthenthe government private sector development strategy.

Improving Public SectorManagement

Administratiodcivilservice reform

Background.Public service inBeninhas been characterizedby:
    -    A structural adjustment phase (1989 - 1995) with: (a) voluntary (early) retirement, (b) a
         freeze on recruitment and automatic salary increases (resulting from automatic
         promotion). These measures allowed the country to control wages (less than 5% o f GDP),
         and to reduce the number o f government employees - from 47,000 in 1989 to 30,000. At
         the same time, these measures have also led progressively to ageing staff and a short-
         comings incertain skill-sets.
         A progressive end to this structural adjustment strategy (1996 - 2004): (a) resuming
         recruitment o f civil servants (one civil servant recruited per three retired civil servants,
         progressively evolving to one civil servant recruited per retired civil servant), (b)
         introducing a process to match real salaries with salary scale (according to
         functiodlevel), (c) raising the salary base point, (d) introducing technical management
         tools and measures (through the creation o f a single reference file system between the
         Ministryo f Finance and the Ministryo f Civil Service, butthe computerized system does
         not yet provide automatic links between the two databases), (e) a draft law was
         transmitted to the Parliament, establishing a new civil service statute which introduces a
         performance-based management system. Nevertheless, the adoption o f the law has been
         stalled, due to opposition by unions'*.


'*  The Bill amending the civil servants' status (Law no 98-035) has been passed on September 15, 1998 by the
    National Assembly. However, the Supreme Court requested amendments. The Bill was modified, but is still
    pendingwith the NationalAssembly since2000.

                                                      88

                                                                                                        Page 3 of 13

    -   At the same time, Benin, which has been engaged in public administration and civil
        service reform since the mid-l960s, called for a Sovereign National C~nference'~                           in
        1990. This Conference was attended by about six hundred opinion leaders from all key
        tiers o f society, where a national program o f reforms aimed at defining the framework for
        the political outlook (establishing Benin as a liberal democracy and a market economy)
        and where State organizations were agreed upon. However, a long process o f substantive
        consultations and negotiations with stakeholder^'^' inparticular with the labor unions, has
        been necessary before the GOB adopted an administration reform action plan in June
        2000.

The action plan for the period from 1999 to 2004 aims at addressing six main strategic objectives:
(a) clarifying the role o f the State; (bi) rationalizing and reengineering public administration
directorates, for instance by adopting new organizational charts; (c) promoting the NTIC (New
Technologies o f Information and Communication), specifically the payroll and civil servants

moving toward a performance-based system; (e) promoting good governance; and (0 completing
database (FUR - Fichier Unique de Rdfdrence); (d) improving human resource management,

the decentralization and devolution process. The Ministry o f Civil Service, Work and
Administration Reform (MFPTRA), assisted by the National Commission for Administrative
Reform (CNRA)" with a Permanent Secretariat, a Directorate, and sector-base structures, was
established to manage the reform process. A donor's consultation meeting was held in 2000,
which confirmed the support by key donors'6. However, as a result o f a weak political
commitment duringthe middle term and a lack o f continuity, the CNRA, which i s characterized
by a complex andnon-efficient structure which render itnon-operational, has providedno support
to the reform process.". While some progress has been made, major achievements have failed,
such as the civil service reform and a certain "reform fatigue" has settled in for the
implementationo f the overall reformagenda.

The civil service in Benin i s not based on an incentives system. Appointments to management
positions are often political (some progress had been achieved with the mandate o f General
Secretaries as the head o f financial and humanresource management inministries for five years),
and regional balance principles seem to play a key role. Generally, civil servants are poorly
qualified and do not receive adequate on-the-job training. Because a hiring freeze has been used
under structural adjustment to control the wage bill, ad hoc hiring o f contractual employees has
been used since 1996 to cope with the rising demands for new staff, especially within health and
education. The contractual employee relationship i s progressively being organized into a parallel
system for the hiring o f regular, long-term and civil servants. However, it i s characterized by
more flexibility, better alignment betweenneeds and postings, lower wage cost and a higher level
o f accountability. Unfortunately, the future o f this initiative, which gives managers at the
frontline a higher authority over their personnel, i s uncertain since it i s under attack by civil
servants' unions and an increasing number o f contractual employees applying for the entrance
exam to become regular civil servants.

    reform; 1999: validation o f the strategy document; 2000: development stakeholders consultative meeting.

    seven working groups.

However, duringthe recent period two important measures have been taken:
     -    First, the GOB has started putting in place mechanisms to manage the civil service
          reforms: (a) the establishment o f an ad hoc committee (comprising representatives from
          the Ministry o f Finance, Ministry o f Administration and Civil Servant, and Union
          Associations) that has started to re-examine the stalled law on career and payment
          systems for civil service, and i s expected to propose a revised statute for both civil
          servant and fixed-term contract government employees in the coming months; (b) a
          decree has been adopted to set up an operational coordination mechanism and structure
          for effective integration and implementation o f public sector management reforms (a
          committee o f General Secretaries has been established and a review o f the National
          Council for Administrative Reform i s about to take place in order to render the
          organization more efficient); (c) the ministries in charges o f civil service have started a
          process to delegate personnel management issues to relevant line ministries, which allows
          the MFPTRA to focus on providing support to the line ministries and for line ministries
          to develop more comprehensive and results-based strategies and policies (which are in
          line with on-going reform on public finance).18
     -    Second, MFPTRA has drafted road-maps for two priority areas which will pave the way
          for the development o f a comprehensive action-plan for the reforminthe following areas:
          (a) reform o f statutes for the civil service and fixed-term contractors; (c) forward-looking
          management of human resources in coordination with the Ministry o f Finance and line
          ministries (the adoption o fprocedures that will address staffing needs and lack o f skills in
          a sustainable framework). Appropriate technical assistance will be provided by the World
          Bank, incoordination with UNDP and the Canadian Assistance Cooperation.

Issues. The promotion o f growth and poverty reduction will rely on a governance framework that
i s characterized by a full-fledged results-based public resources (financial and human)
management system and an inclusive and decentralized state process. While Benin has made
some progress in the area o f expenditure management, there is considerable work ahead in order
to develop and implement a comprehensive administrative reform system,                           including
improvements to civil service management and deepening o f the devolution process.

The lack of strong political leadership and the absence of an operational system to
coordinatethe key players and to manage the reforms:

Disconnected cross-cutting reforms. The CNRA failed as a public sector policy integration
framework and the MFPTRA lacks a reform vision (its staff has inadequate skills and part o f its
limited human capacity i s mobilized on employment and social security issues). As a result, there
i s no cost and impact estimation on human resources for implementation o f the ongoing public
sector     management       reforms     (public    finance     reform,     administration     reform     and
decentralizatioddevolution)      ,




'*   Head of State has made the decision and a decree has been adopted which transfers the responsibility for
     managingteachers' careers from MFPTRA to the Ministry of primary and secondaryeducation (MEPS). This will
     increase MEPS's accountabilityinmanagingavailablehumanresources.

While the MFPTRA i s focusing on technical and legal aspects o f the reforms (such as the
definition o f State missions or the job descriptions), it has not yet developed a comprehensive
approach to appropriately sequence the human resource aspects o f the public sector reforms. The
budget management reform i s supported only by the MFE (the MFPTRA has not provided
support to line-ministries in implementing the pilot sector-programs in FY05), and the
decentralization process i s only supported by the Ministry o f the Interior and its attached
structures. The MFPTRAhas not established guidelines for humanresources management to line-
ministries, nor developed a concrete action plan to support the decentralization reform, despite
significant pressure from municipalities in accelerating the devolution process (strengthening
public institutions structures at local government levels).

The efforts of the line ministries are impeded and there are insufficient (qualitative and

ministries in Benin are on the front line o f reforms - the Ministry o f Environment (MEW),
quantitative) human resource and management procedures to achieve PRSP targets. Few

however, appears to be a champion by actively pursuinga large range o f tools which are funding
result-based management, a comprehensive decentralization action plan, etc. Other ministries,
like the Ministry o f Agriculture, have difficulties coping with inflexible structures and
shortcomings among staff. This means that the conditions for administrative reforms are being set
at different speeds.

Level and allocation of donors are not as efficient as they could be. Donor engagement i s
becoming more focused, concentrating on specific actions such as the elaboration o f
organizational charts (organigrams), or job descriptions. Due to weak capacity and the lack o f an
overall strategy, these organizational charts and job descriptions risk being outdated. At the
decentralized level, this lack o f an overall strategy has led to responsibilities being distributed
based on geographical criteria (i.e. department) or structures, such as the prefectures (State
Representatives) or the Maison des CollectivitCs Locales (English translation) (training). As a
result, the MFPTRA and the Ministry o f Interior (MISD) in charge o f the prefectures are
extremely challenged inhow they deal with and coordinate development partners and how to play
a key role inexecuting these tasks.

Improvements in civil service and the broad human resource management system are
critical issues in order to improve service delivery in the priority sectors (making service
delivery more efficient), as identified as one of the major objectives of the PRSP. Issues
include:
    -    critical staffing and skill gaps inherited from a decade o f structural adjustment reforms;
    -    political interference and patronage resulting in gaps between qualification and position,
         and intrade union's mistrustinthe fairness o fthe individual evaluation system;
    -    delay in implementing a performance-based system leading to a lack o f incentives and a
         disconnect inthe on going results-basedpublic financial reform;
    -    inconsistencies inthe dual public employment policy;
    -    riskofpressure to increasewages.

PlannedReforms

To address issues identifiedabove, the objectives o f the proposedPRSC-2 will be to assist the
GOB:
   -    establish an appropriate and reliable framework for the reformby:

       (i)    assisting the GOB in setting up an operational coordination mechanism and
              structure for effective integration, implementation, and monitoring o f public sector
              management reforms, through a) identifying political leadership, b) establishing an
              inter-ministerial task force (proposals have been made inthe identification mission
              aide-memoir o f the Bank), c) setting up a progressive, realistic, and concrete action
              plan;

       (ii)   strengthening cross-cutting ministries, and specifically the ministry in charge o f
              civil service, to support the line ministries to assume human resource management,
              by delegating competencies inhuman resource management from MFPTRAto the
              line ministries (starting with the ministries in charge o f education and extending
              this delegationto the Ministries o fAgriculture, Finance, andHealth).
   -    develop a comprehensive action plan, including:

       (i) settingupmechanismsandprocedurestoaddressstaffingneedsandthelackof
                skills ina sustainable framework;
       (ii) reformingstatutesforthecivilserviceandfixed-termcontractors, inrekindling
                the stalled civil service reform in the context o f a broader approach addressing
                the critical issues described and consistent with a) the move toward performance-
                basedbudgeting, which will increasethe responsibility o f programmanagers, and
                b) the decentralizatioddevolution process. The proposed performance-based
                remuneration and promotion system will be revised as part of a comprehensive
                plan to improve civil service performance. The reform plan to be finalized aims
                to achieve the following: a) a modem human resource management system, b) a
                sustainable medium-term recruitment and employment policy, and c) a career
                management system and professional development policy (through training)
                consistent with performance-based budgeting reforms and the decentralization
                policy. Human resource management, including decision-making capacity,
                should be progressively decentralized     -  first at ministry level, then extended to
                the decentralized level.
The PRSC-2 will provide support to prepare the following reforms:
   -   help the GOB define a clear vision o f its needs in terms o f human resource management
       (profiles, skills,   etc.) and public sector structure (political appointees, contract
       appointments, career civil service or non-career officials, for instance for cleaners or food
       caterers);
   -   simplify and implement an acceptable performance-based remuneration and promotion
       systemfor the civil service;
   -   decentralize personnel management to line ministries and then to regional directorates;
   -   decentralize wage management as part of the budget delegation to line ministries and
       regional directorates;

    -   delegate management o f personnel to local governments (communes) in line with the
        transfer o f competencies scheduled inthe devolution law.

Preparatory Steps

As proposed by the Bank, the MFPTRAand the Ministryo fFinance have - inajoint task force -
prepared the terms o f reference o f an inter-ministerial committee (including the General
Secretaries o f cross-cutting ministries), which will be responsible for coordinating, integrating,
and monitoring the PS reforms (public finances, administration and decentralization reforms). In
order to strengthen the capacity o f the MFPTRA, so that the ministry i s prepared to play a key
role in PS reforms, the Bank i s assisting the MFPTRA to develop a comprehensive vision o f its
missions in supporting the public sector reforms with strategic planning. Technical assistance will
be provided to support the strategic planningprocess through the PHRD trust fund.

Appropriate technical assistance will be provided by the World Bank (through the PHRD trust
fund) in coordination with UNDP and the Canadian Assistance Cooperation to support the
development of a comprehensive, realistic and well-sequenced action plan (with performance
indicators and a defined monitoring and evaluation process to measure progress over time),
including: (i)reform o f the statutes for civil service and fixed-term contractors, with a modern
human resource management system based on performance; (ii)           development o f a sustainable
recruitment and employment policy and procedures coordinated with the Ministry o f Finance and
line ministries. In2005, the Ministry o f Agriculture (which i s currently faced with serious staffing
challenges) i s expected to take on the role o f a pilot ministry in the development and testing o f
new recruitment and employment policies and procedures.

Devolution

Background. A comprehensive devolution reformwas called for inthe 1990 Sovereign National
Conference, with the main objective to strengthen democracy and political participation as to
ensure civil society's involvement at the local level in the development process. It was only in
1999 that the legal basis for devolution was formalized through enactment o f five key laws
regulating the functioning o f Benin's local government system and transforming its territorial
administration.

Notwithstanding the adoption o f this legal arsenal, the devolution policy has been slow in
implementation, mainly due to the many postponements o f local elections. The municipal
elections finally took place in December 2002 paving the way for implementation o f the
devolution reform. The reform transfers six new areas o f responsibility to local governments
(municipalities) from the Prefectures. These new responsibilities cover the major aspects o f local
development:
    -   localdevelopment, planning, housing and urban development:within the areas under
        their jurisdiction, the communes have full authority to prepare local development plans,
        including development o f urban master plans and town planning schemes, economic and
        social development plans, to provide building permits, and to develop and enforce
        construction codes;




                                                  93

                                                                                          Page 8 o f 13

    -   infrastructures, equipment and transport: communes are now responsible for i)
        planning, building and operating public transport, infrastructure and services, as well as
        streets lighting; ii)constructions and maintaining bus stations and other similar
        equipment (taxi stands, public parking, etc.); iii)constructing and maintaining hydraulic
        infrastructure, and local telecommunication lines, and iv) regulating local power and
        infrastructure;
    -   sanitation and environment: communes are responsible for i)water supply and
        distribution, ii)water collection and management, iii)drainage systems, iv) public health
        and safety, and v) maintenance o f cemeteries and public areas;
    -   education: primary responsibilities o f the communes in this sector are limited to
        construction, operation and maintenance o f nursery and elementary schools;
    -   health, social and cultural sectors: transferred responsibilities include construction
        operation and maintenance o f public heath, cultural and social promotion centers, as well
        as youth and sports centers and social assistance to the poor within the commune;
    -   economic and commercial services: in this sector, communes are specifically
        responsible for the construction, equipment and maintenance o f local markets and
        slaughterhouses, however they have broader powers to initiate any activities and
        investments that promote local development and tourism.

Recently, the Ministry o f Plan requested all line ministries to prepare an action plan for transfer
o f competencies to local governments in their respective area. The document was finalized in
May but has not been validated at the political level.

Issues,Neither the central nor local administrations are currently geared to fulfilling their future
role as definedby the 1999 law inthe decentralization process:
    -   while decentralization i s seen as an essential instrument for implementing the poverty
        reduction strategy, there i s not yet a detailed and concrete action plan for achieving better
        public service delivery through effective fiscal decentralization. GOB should expand
        current fiscal decentralization and design a detailed implementation action plan over the
        medium-term period (including cost o f the transfer o f competencies and human resources
        needs    evaluation    and realistic    implementation agenda),       while    ensuring that
        decentralization does not raise issues in expenditure executionand tracking;
    -   the reformrepresents a broad transfer o f responsibilities to the local level o f government
        and puts the new local government incharge o f almost all economic and social activities
        in their territories. They will therefore need to develop .adequate management and
        financial capacity to meet their new responsibilities. Adequacy o f the planned transfer o f
        resources from the central government to the communes, appropriate support to
        collection o f local tax incomes at the local level, and strengthen capacity buildingo f the
        communes are other important issues;




                                                  94

                                                                                         Page 9 of 13

    -    while transfers o f powers to communes are broad in scope and include basic education
         and health, many competencies will still be shared between the commune and the central
         government - via its decentralized directorates. As government administration i s
         characterized by over-centralization, that i s reflected in the fact that most activities o f
        planning, budgeting (specially investments) as well as standard and policy-making are
         conducted by the center, in most sectors, even though some progress towards more
         autonomy has been achieved in health, rural water, and to a lesser extent in education.
         Local offices are mere satellites o f central ministries,poorly staffed and poorly endowed
         with resources, and most o f their resources - financial, assets or human - are directly
        managed from Cotonou. Regional government offices o f central government are to be
         strengthened in order to, in compliance with devolution laws i)provide communes with
         technical support, and ii)be the prime locus o f interaction between central State and
         communes;
    -    challenges include establishing efficient coordination mechanisms between regional
         government offices and local government via the effectiveness o f the Prefet
         competencies, and reforming decentralized offices since most o f their theoretical
         responsibilities are about to be transferred to the communes.

Planned Reforms.Given the ambitious reformprogram set by the devolution process, it will be
realistic to consider a long transition period, at least until 2008, by which time communes should
have reached full autonomy and capacity according to the current GOB agenda. Ultimately, the
PRSC would support both the budget decentralization process (from central government to its
local offices) and fiscal devolution (from central government to the communes). As far as the
fiscal devolution i s concerned, additional work i s needed to define a sustainable fiscal framework
that can be implemented. In the meantime, core reforms o f budget and human resources
management systems require deepening and extension to all tiers o f government, inorder to avoid
exporting current gridlocks and rigidities to the communes.

A first  phase to be supported by PRSC-3 will aim to attain an effective synergy between
decentralization and devolution: i)revision o f the budget preparation process to lead to a
preparationat the regional level and effective sectoral policies integration by the Prefet, ii)inputs
from sub-national levels, resulting from the demand, constituting the basis o f national program-
budget, iii)national unified budget regionalization (i.e. specify budget appropriation by the
department including currently donor-funded investments operations), and iv) preparation for an
effective coordination between the national program-budget and commune local development
plans.

Future PRSC support could apply to: i)automatic delegation o f current appropriations (as
detailed inbudget law) beginning day one o f fiscal year, ii)delegation of all recurrent costs at the
regional level, including contract employees wages, iii)delegation o f investment appropriations,
and iv) strengthen internal and external audit o fregional levels.

Preparatory Steps. The first step will be to assist the GOB in designing a fiscal framework
between the central government and local government in order to enhance the delivery,
efficiency, equity, and coverage o f public services to the poor. This framework should ensure the
necessary financial resources on a sustainable basis for local governments both by strengthening
their own revenue resources and by central government transfers. The second step would be to
design a capacity buildingprogram to improve budget management at the local government level,


                                                   95

Thirdis to support the GOB in designing an action plan to decentralize spending authority from
central govemment to its branch offices. Three studies will be carried out in 2005 to design: i)a
fiscal framework between central and local governments, ii)a capacity building program to
improve budget management o f local governments, and iii)an action plan to decentralize
spending authority from central govemment to decentralized offices.

The Dutch cooperation shares the Bank's diagnostic and would fully support this approach
through ajoint contribution to its implementation.

Malnutrition Issues

Although the MDG indicator (underweight malnutrition) i s improving, the poverty indicator,
chronic malnutrition or stunting worsened between 1996 and 2001 (DHS). The improvement in
underweight malnutrition is largely due to the decrease in acute malnutrition which i s seasonal.
Chronic malnutrition i s a better indicator for progress and to raise attention. Children who are
chronically malnourishedor stunted in their first two years of life rarely meet their potential for
growth and are permanently stunted as adults (Ruel, et al., 1995). This has a number o f
consequences including reduced levels o f productivity and eamed income in short adults (Haddad
& Bouis, 1990). Stunted children are often not sent to school on time and have less frequent
attendance at school than their taller counterparts. Girls who were stunted inchildhood grow into
stunted adults. Short stature i s associated with increased risk o f pelvic disproportion and the need
for assisted delivery (Le., C-sections), and increased risk o f maternal mortality (Krasovec &
Anderson, 1991).

Malnutrition i s particularly high in the rural areas (34 percent), among the poorest in the rural
areas (38 percent), and among very young children inBenin. Chronic malnutrition almost triples
between 12 and 23 months o f age, from 15 to 39 percent. Also micronutrient deficiencies, in
particular iron deficiency anemia remain an enormous development problem inBenin; 82 percent
o f children under 5 and 64 percent of women in reproductive age suffer from anemia (DHS
2001). Poor feeding practices, coupled with poverty, food insecurity, frequent infectious disease
and lack o f access to health care are explanatory factors o f malnutrition inBenin.

The increase inchronic malnutrition may be explained inpart by less than adequate feeding
practices. Where a childresides puts them at higher riskofbeing malnourished, malnutrition i s
more prevalent inthe rural than inthe urban areas.

                                                   96

While malnutrition it i s often attributed to lack o f food due to inadequate production, this i s not
always the major cause. UNICEF estimates that about 50 percent o f malnutrition in children i s
due to poor feeding practices and not lack o f food. Poverty, poor feeding practices, lack o f access
to health services and water and sanitation, and lack o f access to suficient and good quality food
are all major constraints to improving nutrition. Furthermore, lack o f attention and sustained
commitment at the higher political levels, as well as persistent under-funding, are important
underlying causes to slow progress inreducing malnutrition rates.

Poverty is an importantunderlying determinants of malnutritionin Benin.Beninremains a
very poor country (GDP o f US$440) despite strong economic growth since 1994. 22 Percent o f
the population i s extreme poor, 39 percent i s poor, and poverty i s increasing in the rural areas,
according to the most recent Poverty Asse~sment'~.Being poor in Benin are perceived by those
who suffer from it as nutritional insecurity. Inaddition, the poor see themselves obliged to reduce
food intake even further intimes o f shocks, exacerbating the nutrition problem, especially among
the vulnerable, children, pregnant and lactating women. Agricultural policies focused on cotton
production and although diversification o f food-cash crops was promoted and the ago-climate i s
favorable, the emphasis was on cottonproduction. Lack o f land i s another major constraint for the
poor to access to sufficient and quality food. Health indicators are worst in the rural areas, with
the poor being able to afford at the most 2 visits a year to a health clinic. This i s largely
insufficient for regular pre-natal visits, vaccination and child growth monitoring check ups, which
help prevent childhood malnutrition.

Thus, not surprising, the lower the income quintile the higher malnutrition as shown in table
below. Stunting only really decreases inthe richest two quintiles, and even among the rich almost
1 in five children is chronically malnourished. This confirms earlier speculation that feeding
practices, rather than food alone are direct causes. Between 1996 and 2001, stunting increased
across the quintiles, while underweight decreases. As mentioned earlier, this i s largely due to the
decrease in wasting or acute malnutrition. The largest decrease occurs in the richest quintiles,
where underweight malnutrition almost halved in five years. Anemia rates among young children
are unacceptably highinall income quintiles, with the richest only doing slightly better.




Poor feeding practicesare the maincause for malnutritionamongchildrenunder the age of
two. The analysis o f the period during which most children become malnourished suggests
feeding practices to be (for a large part) explanatory for the very highmalnutrition rates (see table
below). Over 90 percent o f children are born well-nourished and almost all are breastfed, which
reduces morbidity and mortality risks. At six months children start faltering growth and between

six and 23 months almost 40 become stunted. Less than 40 percent i s breastfed exclusively for the
recommended six months and weaning practices are less than adequate. Widely promoted feeding
practices2' that improve nutritional status and prevent malnutrition include exclusive
breastfeeding for six months; maintained breastfeeding up to two years; responsive feeding as
assisting young children to eat sufficient quantities; stimulate regular frequent meals; and active
feeding during and after illness among others.

Micronutrientdeficiencies,especiallyirondeficiency are a major developmentproblem.The
latest data from the 2001 DHS shows 83 percent o f children under five and 63 percent o f
pregnant women are anemic. Iron deficiency anemia has serious health consequences and i s
preventable by supplementing children and women in reproductive age with iron tablets,
fortification o f a staple food with iron, and appropriate feeding practices. There i s no data
available on prevalence o f goiter caused by Iodine deficiency or vitamin A deficiency, both
serious disorders that can also be prevented by supplementation and fortification. Currently 73
percent o f households use iodized salt. Especially the provinces at the Atlantic coast have low
consumption rates, but may be using sea salt. Vitamin A is systematically provided through the
health system, but only 20 percent o f childrenreceive the recommended doses twice a year.

Lack of political commitment and weak capacity has been at the root of the failure to
address malnutrition effectively in Benin. The current PRSP does mention nutrition as a
development problem, but there is no prioritization, follow up or indication of action taking inthe
policy or action chapters. The Benin Poverty Assessment flags malnutrition as a major
development problem that deserves more attention. And despite interest, the successful, but small
scale, nutrition interventions that were supported under IDA'Sfood security project (PILSA) have
not been scaled up. There i s no clear nutition strategy or policy. However, a recent fact finding
field mission noted that: (i) i s a political will and commitment to strengthen the nutrition
                                  there
agenda; and (ii)     although weak, the food and nutrition security Directorate (DANA)located at the
ministryo fagriculture could constitute a good champion

Planned reforms. The priority should be given to: (a) strengthening DANA'Scapacity (funding
and staffing) and provide it with higher priority/visibility on the agenda o f the Ministry o f
Agriculture; (b) setting-up a strong and formalized coordination mechanisms between the three
key-ministries involved in nutrition, the Ministry o f Agriculture, the Ministry o f Health, and the
Ministry of Family and Social Protection; and (c) designate either DANA or the coordinating
body to coordinate donor interventions/projects and provide oversight over the nutrition agenda.

Preparatorysteps.For the nutrition agenda to be supportedby PRSC-3, the Government should,
by early September 2005 have: (a) prepared a clear plan and program, including budget for
implementation and scaling up and improving quality o f current community nutrition
interventions. Mainstreaming them in key-ministries and harmonizing approaches currently
carried out by different partners without clear coordination; and (b) drawn up a plan to strengthen
the existing M&E system; and (c) prepared a communicationstrategy.

Introduction

The size o f donor involvement and the quality of coordination vary among the six main sectors
covered by the PRSC-2 (rural water, health, basic education, agriculture rural transport and
justice). The nature o f financial instruments i s currently a mix o f consolidated programmatic
support and investment projects, with the exception o f the three new sectors where no donor i s
transferring resources through budgetary support. In the context o f the PRSP implementation,
there has been an increased demand from both the Government's and the donor's side to improve
the sectoral coordination as a way o f increasing synergy and effectiveness. The example o f the
rural water sector constitutes a very promising experience in that respect and i s generating
positive effects on other sectors.

RuralWater

Donors are supporting the implementation o f the sector strategy that has been developed over the
past decade under the PADEAR (Assistance Program for the Development o f the Water Supply
and Sanitation Sector in Rural Areas). The policy on rural water supply i s implemented by the
Directorate o f Water through its regional offices, relying extensively on collaborationwith a wide
range o f stakeholders. The main donors are: Japan, France, the Islamic Development Bank, the
European Union, the Economic Community o f West African States, Denmark, the Netherlands,
Germany, Africa Development Bank and IDA. Furthermore, the directors o f both the Water
Works and the Hygiene and Sanitation Departments are members o f the Board o f the national
branch o f the Regional Center for Low-Cost Water Supply and Sanitation (CREPA).

Inline with the firstjoint Government-DonorRWSS sector review which was held inJune 2003,
the second review took place inM a y 2004 and assessedthe Directorate o f Water's 2003 program-
budget implementation and discussed the new sector strategy and donor contribution to the
financing o f a 2005-07 RWSS program-budget. All the donors involved in the sector (IDA,
UNICEF, DANIDA, the Netherlands, AfDB, GTZ/KFW, Belgium Cooperation and AFD)
participated and agreed to support the implementation o f the sector strategy and program. Other
participating structures included representatives from the Ministry o f Finances and the Ministry
o f Health. The Directorate o f Water (DH) took this opportunity to present the results o f the
assessment o f its 2003 program-budget and the progress made on the revision o f the RWSS
strategy. Various strategic papers were discussed, in particular, the management o f small piped
networks, the sector monitoring and evaluation system, the backstopping activities towards the
communities and their maintenance system as well as public/private partnership in managing
water point systems in secondary towns. The reviewers made recommendations to continue to
increase the quality o f the program-budget as well as effectiveness inits implementation. Most o f
these have been taken into account infinalizing the 2005-2007 program-budgets.

Health Sector

Over the past five past years a mechanism o f collaboration and coordination has been set up
under the leadership of the European Union. Regular meetings are held every semester between
donors or the MOH depending on the agenda. A great step has been reached in 2004 with the
organization of the first joint Government-donors sector review (inJune 2004). The mainpartners
involved in the sector (IDA, European Union, WHO, Swiss Cooperation, French Cooperation,
Belgian Cooperation, USAID, UNICEF, UNFPA) participated as well as representatives from
other relevant ministries including the ministries in charge o f Planning (vice-chair o f the joint
review meeting) and Finances, plus the stakeholders o f civil society. The Senior Health Advisor
to the President also attended the two-day review. Several presentations were made, inparticular:
recent studies conducted inthe sector including the health CSR and the human resource strategy,
the 2003 execution report o f the program budget as well as the trend for 2004 first trimester and
the priorities for 2005-2007 program budgets. A joint aide-memoire was prepared, highlighting
the main conclusions and recommendations o f the review. The latter have fed the process o f
finalizing the 2005-2007 program-budgets.

Education Sector

Over the past two years an informal coordination mechanism has been put inplace whereby the
core donors (Le. USAID, French Cooperation, UNICEFand IDA) meet regularly (at least once a
month) to share information and to discuss and formulate common views on issues. This donor
group has become a credible interlocutor o f the Government as the coordination process
organized around the preparation o f the EFA action plan and the preparation o f the Ten-year
program showed. These two processes have provided the opportunity to improve coordination
and set up a more formal fi-amework o f active consultations between the Government and all the
donors involved, with USAID playing the role o f lead agency.

In2004, the sector coordinationhas actually gained a clear momentum withthe organizationof
the first Government-donors sector review (inJune 2004) which ledto a memorandum signed by
the Minister o f Primary and Secondary Education on behalf o f the three ministries in charge o f
the education sector and by the USAID representative. The review has provided the forum for the
Government to discuss with the main sector donors (USAID, France, Denmark, Netherlands and
 Swiss Corporation, UNICEF, UNFPA and IDA) its vision and main sectoral objectives and
strategies, as well as key issues actually having a limiting effect on the sector performance. In
particular, the objective to move towards a more sectoral and programmatic approach as well as
the need to increase harmonization o f procedures were shared and welcomed by all participants
(both budget and non-budget supporters). The signed memorandum has laid out policy and
operational recommendations as well as an agreed road map for implementing some key reforms.
Preparatory work and outcome of the review were instrumental in beefing up the quality o f the
sector coordination, and the decision to organize such a review once a year (May/June)
constitutes a key achievement. Preparation and finalization o f the 2005-2007 program-budgets
have built on the outcome o f this review.

Agriculture sector

Many donors actually provide support to the Government to implement the Rural Development
Strategy (RDS) and the Rural Development Master Plan (RDMP) which was adopted in 2001.
These include the AfDB, France, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, FAO, FDA, IDB and IDA.
However, until recently, this support has consisted o f a large number o f projects with a limited
link to the overall mission and objectives of the sector. In2003, actions were initiated to move
towards translating the strategic operational plan into a coherent set o f public interventions. This
led to a sizeable consolidation o f the number o f investment projects but more work remains to be
done in this respect, along with an increased effort to improve sector donor coordination. Inthe
context o f the PRSC preparation, donors agreed to assist the Government in enhancing its
capacity and effectiveness to implement the agreed sectoral strategy, moving away progressively
from a decade o f fragmented and uncoordinated donor-driven projects and starting with core
reforms and priority interventions. To this end, the Ministry o f Agriculture's team has launched,
with technical support from the main sector donors, the preparation o f the ARDS implementation
plan that will serve as a basis for preparinga full-fledgedmedium-term program-budget.

Transport sector

In 1996-2000, the implementation of the transport sector strategy and investment program was
carried out along with exemplary and dynamic donor coordination mechanisms. Main donors are
EU, AfDB, BOAD, France, Kuwaiti Fund, Islamic Development Bank, the Netherlands,
Denmark and IDA. Although the donor coordinationhas been weakened by the formal closing o f
the SWAP a couple o f years ago, there is clear interest and commitment from both sides (donors
and Government) to revitalize these mechanisms duringthe coming months inthe overall context
o f the PRSP implementation. Inthis regard, the outcome o f the recent joint multi-donor mission
(September 2004) was promising.

The coordination o f the rural transport sub-sector (focus o f PRSC-2) i s actually a greater
challenge given the actual poor quality o f the local coordination institutional framework,
therefore particular attention i s being paid to this issue under the PRSC-2.

Justice Sector

With technical support from IDA, the Government has prepared and adopted in2001 a ten-year
integrated program for the development and modernization o f Benin's legal andjudiciary system.
Even though this program was endorsed by many donors inrecognition o f its importance for the
overall long-term development o f the country, a few o f them are actually supporting its
implementation. The EU i s actually the main donor in the sector and assists the Government
rehabilitate and construct tribunals and strengthens the offices o f clerks o f courts. The PRSC team
has coordinatedthe work with the EUteam as much as possible.

Introduction

This document is an analysis o f the potential environmental and social impacts associated with
the second Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-2) for Benin. In addition to providing
guidance for the compliance o f Bank environmental and social safeguards during the
implementation o f PRSC-2, this analysis also summarizes the progress under PRSC-1 and sets
the stage for the environmental assessment (EA) o f envisaged PRSC-3, and the subsequent ones.
The present document will be annexed to the ProgramDocument o f PRSC-2.

OperationalContext

The overarching objectives o f the proposed PRSC series are to support the implementation o f
Benin's Poverty Reduction Strategy and to strengthen the Government's capacity to design and
carry out its own development and poverty reduction programs. PRSCs will focus on policies and
reforms that have the highest poverty impact, and on areas where IDA has a comparative
advantage. Given the comprehensiveness o f the PRSP and the amount o f resources needed for its
implementation, PRSCs will be designed to assist the Government in establishing priorities and
implementing a rolling reformprogram focused on these priorities.

More specifically, the objectives o f the PRSCs during the 2004-2006 period are to support the
Government o f Benin in its efforts to reduce poverty through the implementation o f policies
designed to: (a) maintain macroeconomic stability and accelerate economic growth (Le,, setting
of a sound regulatory framework inliberalized sectors inorder to create the enabling environment
for private sector investment), and (b) improve the delivery, quality, and coverage o f basic
services while improving expenditure efficiency.

To that end, the series o f PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 will continue to:
    -   help create the basis for private sector-led economic growth by supporting the
        Government's macroeconomic program and improving investment climate;
    -   support the Government's public expenditure management reform with the view to
        increase the poverty impact of public expenditures, along with the strengthening o f public
        finance management and institutional capacity; and
    -   support the reform agenda and help finance the Government's expenditure program in
        key sectors, focusing on the delivery o f quality basic services tailored to the needs o f the
        poor.
Overall, progress inachieving the PRSP objectives has been mixed duringthe past 12-18 months.
Implementation has been rather slow despite broad areas o f strength, such as public expenditure
management and service delivery. Achievements under the three PRSP pillars are summarized
below.




                                                 103

The recent deterioration o f economic activities led to a stagnation o f GDP per capita in 2004.
However, the Government has been successful in maintaining macroeconomic stability, and has
taken the necessary steps to mitigate the effects o f lower fiscal revenues on public expenditure
management, as well as on program objectives.

Significant progress has been made in implementing sectoral reforms, as well as in expanding
basic services delivery, although improving the effectiveness o f the reforms and the quality o f
services remains a key challenge.

Implementation of the public expenditure management reforms has stayed on track. Results-based
budgeting has progressively been put in place in line ministries, along with efforts to improve
their monitoring and evaluation capacity. While reforms in the fields of budget execution,
fiduciary management, and auditing systems have generally progressed well, some shortcomings
have been noted with respect to the utilization o f exceptional budget execution procedures. The
Government and the Bank have agreed on a set o f measures to address these issues in the short
and mediumterms (see para 137).

DescriptionofProjectObjectives

The proposed PRSC-2 i s designed to help implement Benin's December 2002 Poverty Reduction
Strategy. It will support key policy measures aiming at (a) bolstering the medium-term
macroeconomic framework, (b) improving service delivery, (c) enhancing governance and
institutional capacity, and (d) promoting employment and income-generating activities for the
poor. PRSC-2 will focus on selective cross-cutting themes (i.e., public expenditure management
reform, civil service reform, justice) that are critical to the quality o f service delivery. PRSC-2
will focus on five sectors: health, basic education, and rural water, rural transport and agriculture.
Inaddition to these five sectors, PRSC-2 will support the urban environmental management, as
well as the forest management programs. This support will ensure that these two programs are
properly funded, implemented and monitored.

Inparticular, PRSC-2 will support the implementation of Government policies and programs in
the following areas:
    -    Public expenditure and budget management: (a) design and implement a transition
         strategy from project to program-based budgeting in transportation and agriculture in
         different sectors, (b) develop a technical guide including quality standards for content and
         documentation for the preparation o f program budgets, (c) develop and implement a
         stronger performance monitoring and M&E capacity building program, and (d) extend
         the coverage o f the integrated public expenditure management system to all extemally
         funded projects;
    -    Access to quality health services: (a) develop appropriate indicators needed for the
         monitoring and evaluation o f the performance o f the MOH, and the progress made
         towards achievement o f MDGs, (b) support and implement the health sector
         decentralization process by strengthening the capacity o f health districts to implement
         and monitor priority health programs, and improving the mechanisms for resource
         transfer from the center to districts, (c) provide adequate support to priority health
         programs, particularly to reproductive health, malaria control, HIV/AIDS,                and
         immunization;

importation and distribution o f inputs and cotton primary marketing with clear indication
o f penalties for those who do not respect the mechanism, (b) review the rules for the
inter-profession, reorganize it to facilitate internal debate, but accept only a single inter-
professional group with a clear definition o f the relationship betweenthe inter-profession
and the Government and between the different professional groups; adopt a framework
that would clearly define these relationships and make them legally binding; (c) get the
different professional organizations (producers, input distributors, ginners) to agree on
their intemal regulations and how they will operate within the rules o f the reform; (d)

        M&E system, and (d) review and update offorestry legislation.

Environmental classificationand Safeguard Policy

The PRSC Working Group has recommended that this PRSC be classified as a SECAL and that
OP 4.01, necessitating an environmental assessment will be required. An Integrated Safeguards
Data Sheet (ISDS) recommending categorization as a B was prepared. This ISDS documents the
main safeguards issues o f the planned investments, as well as the measures proposed to mitigate
any adverse environmental and social impacts that may result. Following the approval o f the
Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS), and the B categorization by the Regional Safeguard
Unit, an Environmental Assessment Annex was prepared. When this Annex is cleared by the
Regional Safeguard Unit, it will be disclosed inthe World Bank Infoshop. Its Frenchversion will
be disclosed inBeninprior to the appraisal o fthe credit.

Key Safeguard Issues

The potential adverse environmental and social effects associated with the proposed PRSC-2 are
associated mainly with the ruralhemi-urban water supply activities, the health sector
interventions, the investment in rural roads, the implementation of the forest management
schemes, and the intensification o f agricultural production, including cotton production.

While the drilling o f wells may only have minimal adverse impact on the physical environment,
the use o f the water sources and the maintenance of their surroundings could generate
environmental effects stemming from the lack o f adequate hygiene and the spread o f water-borne
disease (Le,, diarrhea caused by wastewater, mosquitoes, etc.). Such effects may create public
health concems. In addition to these concems, the site and the drilling o f wells could take away
land from uses that support the livelihood o f specific members of local communities. The
mismanagement and inadequate disposal o f medical and biomedical wastes (body tissues, blood
or body fluids and pathogens, sharp instruments, pharmaceutical compounds and packaging, etc.)
are also the source o f substantial public health risks.

The construction or rehabilitation o f roads can result in several types o f adverse environmental
and social impacts. Earthworks, right-of-way preparation, drainage works, quarries and borrow
pits, vehicle and equipment servicing and fueling, etc. can cause damage to (i)non-living
environment (physical features, soils, water resources, air), (ii) living environment (flora, fauna),
and (iii) to the human environment (impairment o f economic activities, human settlements, and
public health and safety, etc). The intensification o f agriculture and especially cotton production
will likely require an increased use o fpesticides. The misuse ofpesticides has the potential for

                                                   106

serious adverse environmental (surface and groundwater, fauna, flora), public health and safety
impacts. To sum up, the activities supportedthrough o f the Ministry o f Agriculture and Livestock
that are supported by PRCS-2 may raise potential pest management issues. As a result, the Bank
safeguards policy related to pest management (i.e., OP 4.09) i s triggered. Finally, while the
development and implementation o f community-based forest management schemes will yield
significant positive effects on the resource base, the restriction o f certain types and level o f uses
o f forests and forest products may impose hardship, or at least reduce the access to livelihood
means on some segments of the local communities. Such effects will adequately treated as
requiredby the resettlement operational policy (OP 4.12).

Most o f the environmental and social impacts associated with these investment programs
supported by PRSC-2 are expected to be modest, and would be reversible through appropriate
mitigation actions. PRSC-2 will finance the measures needed in order to eliminate or at least
minimize the negative environmental and social impacts described above. The Environmental
and Social Management Plan o f the PRSC-2 will identify the responsible institutions that are
responsible for implementing and monitoring the mitigation measures associated with each
category o f sectoral investments. The Benin Environmental Agency will be responsibility for
overseeing the execution o f the ESMP o f PRSC-2. An appropriate reporting mechanismwill also
be put inplace to ensure that sectoral partners as well as external partners are kept abreast o f the
implementation performance.

BORROWERREADINESSFORADDRESSING SAFEGUARDISSUES

Regulatory and InstitutionalFramework

Institutions for environmental management have developed slowly but steadily inBenin since the
creation o f the Ministry o f Environment in 1992. The country adopted an overarching
environmental law (loi cadre sur I 'environnement) in 1999 that places environmental impact
assessment at the core o f the Government efforts towards achieving the goals o f the sustainable
development. Following the creation o f the Benin Environmental Agency in 1995, the country
benefited from the Bank's support from 1996-2001 in the implementation o f the Environmental
Management Project that focused on the creation o f the basic institutional and technical capacity
for environmental management. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was one o f the key
areas o f emphasis o f the capacity building efforts. These capacity building efforts consisted o f
three mai,n types of activities including (i)enacting a framework environmental law with specific
requirements for E M (and preparing and adopting implementation decrees for EIA law), (ii)
developing sectoral guidelines for EM, and (iii)   holding several training workshops for the staff
inline ministries, inconsulting firms, and a few NGOs.These training workshops startedin2000
and have had several rounds with differing thematic focus and complexity.

In addition to the training of staff from the line ministries, the Environmental Agency helped
create EIA cells in the following ministries: (i)    economy and finance, (ii) health, (iii)
                                                                                   public
national defense, (iv) basic education, (v) public works and transport, (vi) agriculture, livestock
and fisheries,    (vii) mining, energy and water resources,            (viii) interior,  security and
decentralization, (ix) industry, commerce and employment, (x) information, communication and
new technologies. Of these ministries, seven have enacted an "arr2te` ministeriel that establishes
                                                                                     "
the legal foundation for the operations o f these cells. The main role o f these units i s to undertake

the screening o f the public investment projects included in the budget o f each year, and
recommend appropriate actions (under the guidance o f the Environmental Agency) aiming to
mitigate any residual negative environmental or social impacts. Based on the sectoral guidelines
prepared by the Agency, they provide guidance and supervision o f EIA studies, and mitigation
plans. All the expenditure programs supported by PRSC-2 (health, education, water supply, rural
roads, agriculture, urban environment, forestry) are located in line ministries where sectoral
environmental impact assessment cells have been created. The Ministry o f Environment,
Housing, and Urban Developmentwill continue to provide the BeninEnvironmental Agency with
the budgetary resources that will allow the agency to continue the upgrading o f its operational
and technical capacity, particularly in strategic environmental assessment. These new skills will
help the agency in order to provide the best possible oversight to the sectoral EIA units in the
implementation o ftheir respective ESMPs.

During the implementation o f the Environmental Management Project (1996-2001), the Benin
Environmental Agency helped establish Municipal Associations for Environmental Management
(AMAE). These associations (NGO status) also benefited from training in environmental
assessment, and in local investment planning in the area of environmental management.
Following the formal creation o f the communes and the first municipal elections in 2002, the
AMAE are collaboratingwiththe municipalities inthe area oflocal environmental management.

EnvironmentalPolicyImplementation

In addition to the NEAP (updated in 2001), the Ministry of Environment, Housing, and Urban
Development (MEHU) has adopted in 2002 a Medium-Term Strategic Plan (2002-2006) that
highlights the main objectives o f the country in the area o f environmental management, housing,
and urban development. The Environment Directorate and the Benin Environmental Agency
share the responsibility and objectives o f the Ministry's mandate in area o f environmental
management. This mandate that focuses on the control o f the country's major environmental
threats evolves around the following activities (a) strengthening and deepening the regulatory
framework, (b) developing environmental compliance and enforcement tools, (c) protecting
coastal resources and controlling costal erosion, (d) controlling urban transport pollution, and (e)
increasing access to urban sanitation and drainage services.

These activities are fully reflected in the Ministry's 2005 budget, and medium-term expenditure
framework supported by PRSC-2. The Ministry has also developed an effective expenditure
tracking, and activity/performance monitoring system that i s now followed by other ministries. It
i s the progress toward strategic planning and effective performance monitoring, especially in the
area o f environmental management that led to the inclusion o f the Environment Program (of
MEHU)inPRSC-2. PRSC-1 will ensure that this Program is properly funded and implemented.
The integration o f environmental impact assessment (big items that clearly require attention in
terms o f environmental impacts) in the appraisal and planning o f at least 50 percent o f 2004
public investments i s one o f the two indicators included in the PRSC-1 monitoring matrix (see
PRSC-1 Program Document).

 Arrangements for Borrower to Address SafeguardIssues

 Based on the above, it i s fair to state that Benin would has the institutional, regulatory, and
 technical capacity required to support the implementation o f the measures needed to ensure
 compliance with its own EA law as well as Bank safeguard policies. In addition to the general
 framework for applying due diligence and compliance with the country's environmental
 legislation, a review o f the implementation o f PRSC-1 specific environmental assessment
 measures used in each o f the ministries supported by PRSC-2 was conducted. The result o f this
 review and the lessons learned from the implementation o f the environmental and social
 management plan o f PRSC-1 will help identify the most effective ways to ensure compliance
 with the Bank safeguardpolicies duringthe implementationo fPRSC-2.

 Arrangements for dealingwith environmentaland social safeguardsin sectoralministries

 (i)      InvestmentsinRuralWater Supply

 The Ministry o f Energy and Water Resources, i s among the departments that acknowledged most
 the importance o f these EIA cells by giving them a legal mandate (Le., adopted an ``ardtte`
 ministerial" that clarifies the role o f the sectoral EL4 unit). The environmental safeguards
 adopted by the Ministry inthe area o f rural water supply and water resource management include
 the following:
     -    Mandatory full EIA for dam;
     -    Avoid unsanitary sites (cemeteries, near dump sites, cattle pens and sites that served this
          purpose inthe past);
     -    Control o f wastewater and mudaround wells;
     -    Sensitization o f users on hygiene; and
     -    Imposingrestrictions on the distance between wells and latines (at least 15 meters).

,These measures will continue to be enforced duringthe implementation o f the rural water supply
 investment o f the proposed Credit. The Government i s not directly involved in the process o f
 designating the location where the wells are drilled. This process i s completed by the requesting
 community through a consultation process facilitatedby NGOs.The drilling starts only when the
 community reaches an agreement on the selection o f the site. This agreement must be based on a
 donationtitle signed by the commune. This process has worked well so far.

 (ii)MedicalWasteManagement

 Environmental safeguards for the Ministry o f Health have to do mainly with the treatment and
 disposal o f medical wastes. In 1998, the Ministry o f Health and the Ministry o f Environment,
 Housing, and Urban Development jointly prepared and adopted a National Sanitation Action
 Plan. This Action Plan includes a component on health care waste management that has three
 categories o f expenditures, namely, training, acquisition o f health care equipment, and
 incinerators. The lack o f sufficient financing (total cost in 1998 was U S $ l-1million) has impeded
 the implementation o f this Action Plan.




                                                   109

                                                                                        Page 8 o f 11

Fortunately, the implementation o f the Environmental Management Plan o f the Multi-Sectoral
HIV/AIDS Project provided the opportunity to implement the most urgent and cost-effective
actions o f the health care waste management component o f the National Action Plan. In fact, a
waste management plan (covering the whole country) prepared by the borrower was cleared by
ASPEN in early 2002. Consequently, there i s no needto prepare another plan. The project i s now
under implementation along with the waste management plan. PRSC-2will use the same plan and
rely on the existing implementationmechanisms to meet the safeguardrequirements inthe area o f
health service provision.

(iii) ForestManagementActivities

Although no reliable data on changes in forest area i s available, it i s a common knowledge that
the forest resource base o f Benin has been decreasing at an accelerated rate over the last years.
Efforts by the Government to reduce the rate o f deforestation have been hampered by fast
growing demand for forest products, vested interests in the forest industry, and property rights
issues. The Program for the Management o f Forests and Adjacent Lands aims at developing new
and more effective ways to reducing the rate o f deforestation through the implementation o f four
set o f activities: (a) restructuring o f the forestry administration, (b) providing technical and
organizational assistance to local communities for sustainable forest resource management, (c)
stimulating private investment inforest-based enterprises and in altemative sources o f income for
the rural communities living near gazetted forests, and (d) promoting sustainable agricultural
practices in order to reduce encroachment o f forest lands. This Program i s co-financed by the
GEF,

GEF will support activities aiming at managing the forests and adjacent lands in an integrated
way so as to reduce encroachment onto the remaining forest lands, and protect the forest resource
base. In addition to yielding benefits to the local populations (reduced degradation o f forest and
land resources leads to increased agricultural outputs and forest products), the implementation o f
integrated forest and adjacent land management plans will produce multiple global benefit
including: (a) enhanced carbon sequestration, (b) increased and more effective protection o f
biological diversity, and (c) protection o f water resources and watersheds. The planned activities
are organized into three components, including: (a) technical and managerial capacity
strengthening o f the central and regional forestry administration units, (b) development and
implementation o f participatory forest and adjacent land management plans, and (c) sustainable
production o f fuel wood. Although the GEF component i s still under preparation, the Government
has started the implementation o f the program since 2002. It i s important to mention that local
populations and communities living around the forests selected for co-management were fully
involved in the preparatory activities. This involvement resulted in the formulation o f a sub-
component titled "Sustainable use and community development" aiming to provide community
members who might lose economic opportunities with altemative livelihood means.

Overall, the proposed activities are not expected to generate noticeable environmental and social
damage. Except for forest enrichment activities, little or no physical or structural investments are
planned within the forest areas. However, the co-management plans could result in reduced
access to the resources by the neighboring communities as a way to ensure the sustainable use o f
the forest resources. As part o f the preparation o f the GEF component, an environmental and
social assessment o f the full program i s being prepared, and will be completed by the time the


                                                 110

PRSC-2 i s effective. This assessment will develop an environmental and social management plan
that will propose mitigation measures for any adverse biophysical and social effects that might
result from the implementation of the proposed activities. Inparticular, the study will identify
clearly and account for the various categories of resource users affected by the planned activities,
and prepare a resettlement process framework that seeks to balance the opportunity costs to the
local populations with agreeable compensation measures.

(iv)     UrbanSanitation

Urban sanitation services have improved steadily in the two major cities o f the country (Cotonou
and Porto-Novo) since the mid 1990s. However, the concerns for unhealthy sanitation and
environmental conditions are growing inlow-income neighborhoods o f Cotonou and Porto-Novo,
and in secondary cities. The improvement o f sanitation infrastructure in low-income urban areas,
especially in Cotonou and Porto-Novo could generate noticeable environmental and social
impacts. Such impacts are lmown to a great extent because the existing master sanitation plan
prepared in 1998 included an environmental impact assessment study that proposed an
environmental and social management plan. PRSC-2 will help update the 1998 master sanitation
planby selecting highpriority low-income areas where urgent improvement o f sanitation services
i s needed in order to reduce the burden o f environment-related diseases. Investment in terms of
earth work and construction o f drains will not start until 2005 because (a) the 2004 sanitation
budget i s allocated primarily to the completion o f on-going sanitation work inother areas, and (b)
the need to complete area-specific technical studies.        As part o f these studies, the 1998
environmental and social study will be updated to meet the specific needs of the targeted areas. In
addition, the Government i s preparing a resettlement policy framework (RPF) as part o f the
preparation o f the second decentralized city management project. The RPF will be completed by
February 2005. These studies will be completed by the time the preparation o f the 2005 budget
starts (May 2004).

(v)      Pestmanagementinagricultureand cotton sub-sector development

Inconformity with the Bank safeguards policies, the government prepared an environmental
management plan (EMP) as part o f the cotton sector reform program started in 2002. This EMP
consisted o f two major parts: (a) the environmental audit o f the ginning plants that were eligible
for privatization, and (b) the pest management plan. The environmental audit provided
recommendations related to workers' safety, pollution control within the plants and outside inthe
neighboring communities, and road safety. In compliance with the pest management safeguard
policy, the pest management plan (PMP) i s designed to minimize potential negative impacts on
human health and the environment, and to promote alternative ways o fpest control. The plan also
helped to screen pest control products for better efficiency and safety o f the use o f such
pesticides. Finally, the plan includes a capacity building component (training, targeted research,
and awareness raising). This plan that has been i s use since 2002 will continue to guide the work
on environmental and social safeguards in the agricultural expenditure programs supported by
PRSC-2.

(vi)    Ruralroads and safeguards

In 1996, the Ministry of Transport and public works has undertaken a series of studies in the
context o f the preparation o f the Sector transport project and adopted an operational directive for
environment. Then, the Ministry implement an institutional framework by 1999 after the adoption
o f the NEAP (updated in2001).

The institutional framework in the sector have been developed, thanks to the donor projects and
to the overarching environmental law: (a) an environmental unit with objectives to undertake
different studies was created on September 14, 1999 with the support o f DANIDA to ensure the
implementation o f the directives concerning the road projects, integrating an efficient
management of the environmental issues in all the projects; (b) on February 20, 2001, an
environmental cell was created to undertake the integration o f environmental dimensions in the
policies, plans, program's and projects o f the transport sector.

Since 2001, the environmental unit in o f environmental issues inside the MEHU (Ministry o f
Environment, Housing, and Urban Development) has been involved in the entire activity in the
sector including the rural roads in collaboration with ABE (Benin Environmental Agency). By
2002, 238 km of rural roads have been executed in the Zou regional division with the support o f
DANIDA. This work has received a clearance from MEHU through its environmental unit.
Reports and follow-up documents are available and can be obtained upon request. The GOB,
ABE and DANIDAhave agreedto undertake areview and update the operational directives.

ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTALAND SOCIAL
SAFEGUARDSUNDER PRSC-2

Measuresproposedunder'PRSC-2

The appraisal mission discussed with the sectoral ministries the best way to help them implement
successfully the above mitigation actions and comply with both national and Bank safeguard
policies. The agreed measures rely heavily on the sectoral ministriesthemselves, and stress the
link between these ministries, inparticular, their environmental assessment cells with the Benin
Environmental Agency (ABE). During the mission, the EA specialist o f the PRSC-1 task team
held meetings with (a) the Directorate o f Planning and Prospective Studies and the
representatives o f the EA cell o f each sectoral ministry, (b) the Bank sectoral TTL (i.e., health,
water supply, and urban sanitation, forest management), and (c) the head o f the environmental
impact assessment unit o f the ABE.
These meetings examined the potential environmental and social impacts associated with the
planned investments in the respective sectors, and agreed on the nature, and scope of the
measures needed to mitigate these impacts. Drawing lessons from the implementation o f the
ESMP o f PRSC-1, the teams adopted an action plan and division o f labor that will improve the
monitoring and reporting o f the implementation o f the adopted mitigation measures.               In
particular, the task team agreed with the Government that the Benin Environmental Agency will
play a greater role in leading and providing direct assistance to the line ministries involved in
PRSC-2. The Agency will also monitor the implementation o f the safeguard measures o f on-
going programs/projects on which PRSC-2 depends for its compliance with OP 4.01. This
increased involvement o f the Environmental Agency will be supported by earmarked budgetary
resources. The agreed division o f labor i s as follows:

   -    The Directorate o f Planning and Prospective Studies of each sectoral ministry will
        prepare an environmental and social management plan (ESMP) and its implementation
        duringPRSC-2,
   -    The EA cell of each sectoral ministry will prepare an implementation progress report o f
        their ESMP under the supervision o f the Benin Environmental Agency,
   -    The Benin Environmental Agency will monitor the implementation of the ESMPs, and
        assist the environmentalcells inthe preparation of the sectoral progress reports,
   -    The Benin Environmental Agency will prepare an integrated progress report that
        provides a synthesis of the implementationo f the ESMPs duringPRSC-2, and
   -    The sectoral TTLs o f the PRSC-2 team are accountable for making sure that the agreed
        actions included in the ESMPs are implemented timely for the issuance o f the progress
        reports and the final report.

The final report to be prepared by the Benin Environmental Agency will be used as the basis for
preparing the EA work for PRSC-3. The report should be available by the time PRSC-3 i s
appraised.

                         Poverty of Alternative Cotton Producer Prices


This annex provides estimations of the potential impact o f different cotton producer prices on
poverty both among cotton producers and inthe population as a whole. The analysis i s carried in
a very simple way: we measure the income obtained from cotton production by households,
assess the difference in income that would follow alternative producer prices, and assume that
this difference in income translates into an equivalent difference in the consumption per
equivalent adult of households used to measure poverty. More sophisticated methods could be
used to measure the "general equilibrium" effect o f a drop in cotton producer prices, but such
simulations require a much larger number o f assumptions which are subjected o f debate. The
estimations given in this annex provide "first round" likely poverty effects from lower producer
prices paid to households due to the drop inworld cotton prices, assuming that households can't
compensate their cotton income loss through other activities, at least in the short run (work on
BurkinaFaso has suggested that the ability o f farmers to compensate for such losses i s limited).
The simulations are carried usingthe CWIQ survey for 2003. The extreme poverty line i s set at
half the mean yearly consumption per equivalent adult (130 380 CFAF). The moderate poverty
line i s set at 173 840 CFAF, corresponding to two thirds o f that mean. Using these poverty lines,
we find that in rural areas, a quarter o f the population (26.4%) lives in extreme poverty, about
twice the level observed inurban areas (13.4%). At the national level, the population share living
inpoverty is 21.7%. For total poverty usingthe moderate poverty line, the share ofthe population
inpoverty at the national level is 39.9%. Inrural areas, the share is 46.5%, about 18percentage
points above the share o f the populationinpoverty inurban areas.
Key results from the simulations are provided in table 1 at the national level. The headcount
index of poverty i s simply the share o f the population with a level o f consumption per equivalent
adult below the moderate poverty line. The poverty gap takes into account the distance separating
the poor from the poverty line. The squared poverty gap takes into account the square o f that
distance (and thereby the inequality among the poor).     Similar definitions apply to the measures
of extreme poverty, which are based on the extreme poverty line mentioned above.
To interpret the data in table 1, it i s important to note that in 2003, households were receiving
around 180 CFAFkg according to the survey. Today, due to a sharp drop inworld cotton prices,
the prices that the market could in principle bear i s rather at or even below 130 CFAFkg (a
higher price could probably be paid to producers by at least some ginners due to forward sales o f
cotton when world cotton prices were higher). If the producers were to absorb the full shock o f
the drop inworld cotton prices, i.e. if the price paid to them were to drop to, say, 130 CFAFkg,
the headcount index o f poverty at the national level would increase by 1.3 percentage points,
from 39.9% to 41.2% (as discussed below, the total cotton production in the survey i s below the
actual production in the country, hence the survey may have under-represented producers, or at
least the quantity produced, which would explain the relatively limited impact on national
poverty).
The headcount index of poverty among cotton producers would increase much more, from an
already higher base level of 53.6% to 61.1%. Increases are also observed for the poverty gap and
the squared poverty gap, but with these measures o f poverty which take better into account the
impact o f price shocks on poorer producers, the proportional increase in poverty i s much larger

than with the headcount index. Overall, this increase in poverty i s fairly large, and it would be
even larger if on average producers were not able to diversify their income and subsistence
sources.   Cotton revenues typically represent about a third o f total consumption due to the
availability o f other income sources and production o f food stuff for auto-consumption. Yet for
poorer producers, who tend to be less diversified, the negative impact o f reduced prices would be
larger, and the resulting increase in poverty would almost certainly in turn have strong negative
impacts for other indicators o f well-being interms o f education and health-related MDGs.

194.     Under the assumptions used for the simulations, the impacts shown in table 1 could be
underestimated. As shown intable 2, which provides basic data on cotton productionby decile o f
consumption per equivalent adult in the 2003 CWIQ survey, the total production o f cotton
observed in the survey i s at 267,741 ton, or 76.5 percent o f the projectedproduction for 2004-05
(at 350,000 tons). This implies that the impacts on poverty intable 1capture only three fourths o f
the potential revenue loss for producers. There may also be negative multiplier effects at work
from lower cotton prices, as the drop in income among producers would probably imply lower
purchases by producers and thus income losses for other population groups inthe local economy.
At the macroeconomic level as well, instability inthe cotton sector would also be detrimental.

Who would benefit from a one-time subsidy to be provided by the Government to producers? In
table 2, cotton production i s relatively evenly divided among the first 8 deciles (the bottom 80
percent o f the population in terms o f consumption per equivalent adult), where the share o f total
production accruing to each o f the deciles fluctuates between 9.4% and 13.1%. Production shares
are lower for the richest two deciles, at 6.0% and 4.9%. This implies that the bottom eight deciles
would receive the bulk o f any subsidy implemented by the Government for protecting producers
from the drop in world cotton prices (and the negative impact on prices o f changes in the
exchange rate over the last year). Ifwe consider as poor only the first four deciles, the poor would
benefit from close to 45 percent o f the subsidy. This share compares favorably with the
corresponding shares o f public spending that reach the poor in other sectors (such as education
and health), but it would o f course still be better in the future to consider ways to better target
subsidies, or rather to find better ways to protect poor producers from cotton price shocks, so that
an even larger share o f the measures implemented for such protection would benefit the poor.
As the Government will support cotton producers for the 2004-05 campaign, it will be essential to
emphasize the fact that this cannot be repeated from year to year to avoid providing wrong
incentives to ginners and producers, at highbudgetary costs for the country. Ifworld cotton prices
were to remain depressed, incentives would have to be given to producers to progressively shift to
other crops or activities. But in the more likely outcome o f fluctuating, but not necessarily low
long-term cotton prices, the focus should be on designing appropriate mitigating and coping
strategies for dealing with price shocks. To this end, the Government and private stakeholders
should work toward designing a private sector-based mechanism to enable producers to cope with
future shocks. Such a mechanism would almost necessarily entail sacrifices in the short run (as
producers and ginners would need to set aside resources to provide funding for the mechanism),
but it would help to avoid much larger negative consequences when shocks occur. Inaddition,
the Government should consider putting in place safety nets that could help producers (or more
generally households in cotton producing areas) in times o f hardship. Technical assistance would
have to be provided by the World Bank and other donor to set up these mechanisms and safety-
nets, to monitor their performance and to evaluate their impact.

Public Information Notices (PINS) are issued, (i) the request o f a member country, following the
                                                         at

public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies o f member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment o f these policies; and (ii)    following policy
discussions inthe Executive Board at the decision o f the Board.

OnOctober 6 2004, the ExecutiveBoard o fthe InternationalMonetary Fund(IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Benin.*l

Background

Benin's economic performance over the period 2001-03 was strong. Real GDP growth averaged
5.3 percent, driven by growth in the cotton and services sectors. Inflation was low, averaging 2.6
percent per year. The external current deficit, which increased in 2002 owing to the unexpected
drop inthe world price o f cotton, narrowed in 2003 as terms o f trade improved. The real effective
exchange rate, however, appreciated about 4 percent on average per year since end-2000, owing
mainly to the decline o f the U.S. dollar against the euro, to which the CFA franc is pegged.

Overall fiscal performance over the period was satisfactory. Revenue collection strengthened,
mostly reflecting improvement in tax administration, although weaknesses in customs
administration remained. Expenditures were kept in check; however, spending for health and
education, as well as government investment, remained broadly below targets. Efforts were made
to strengthen public expenditure management, particularly by putting in place an integrated
computerized expenditure management system and a mechanism for tracking poverty-reducing
expenditure.

A prudentmonetarypolicy, conducted at the regional level by the Central Bank for West African
States (BCEAO), helped maintain confidence in the currency and keep inflation low during the
period. Following a strong expansion during 1998-2001, broad money contracted in 2002 and
remained stable in2003, largely reflecting developments in the balance o f payments. Inresponse
to the rapid expansion o f bank credit to the private sector in 2002-03, the BCEAO increased the
reserve requirement in February 2004 from 9 to 13 percent. The financial health o f the banking
sector has continuedto be sound.



'I  Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussionswith members, usually
    every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with
    officials the country'seconomic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff preparesareport,
    which forms the basis for discussionby the ExecutiveBoard. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing
    Director, as Chairmanof the Board, summarizesthe views of ExecutiveDirectors, andthis summary is transmitted
    to the country's authorities.

Progress in the structural area was mixed. The liberalization o f the cotton sector was pursued,
mainly by undertaking the privatization o f the cotton parastatal, SONAPRA, and assisting sector
stakeholders establish an autonomous agency (CSPR) for managing the commercialization o f
seed cotton and settling input credit. However, the privatization o f SONAPRA incurred delays
and was not completed by mid-June 2004 as scheduled. Furthermore, the CSPR experienced cash
flow problems, stemming from the sales o f inputs conducted outside the legal framework
established under the reform o f the sector. Progress inother areas was also slow. Inparticular, the
implementation of the divestiture program o f public utilities and the Port o f Cotonou did not
progress significantly, and the civil service reform stalled due to strong opposition from trade
unions and the parliament.

Benin's sound macroeconomic policies over the period helped it reach the completion point under
the enhanced HIPC Initiative inMarch 2003, Debt relief obtained under the initiative was critical
in reducing the debt-to-export ratio to 157.5 percent at the completion point; the debt ratio is
expected to decline further to below the threshold o f 150 percent from 2005 onward.

Sustained economic growth over the last ten years allowed Benin's per capita income to rise and
most social indicators to improve steadily. However, as indicated in the poverty reduction
strategy paper (PRSP) completed by the authorities in December 2002, these achievements did
not translate into significant progress in poverty reduction. Against this background, the PRSP
presents the authorities' objectives and priority measures for consolidating macroeconomic
stability, reducing poverty, and making progress towards reaching the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs).

Macroeconomic performance since the beginning o f 2004 has suffered from a poor cotton crop
and the tightening o f import restrictions by Nigeria. Inthe circumstances, the target for economic
growth this year has been reduced from 6 percent in the original PRSP to 3 percent. The external
current account deficit i s expected to widen by %percentage points o f GDP, owing mostly to
lower-than-expected export o f cotton and re export to Nigeria. To compensate for the shortfall in
government revenue arising from weaker-than-envisaged activity in 2004, the authorities decided
to strengthen tax and customs administrations and cut total expenditure by 1.4 percent o f GDP,
while protectingpriority spending to the extent possible.

As part o f the Article IV consultation, an assessment o f the Fund's longer-term program
engagement in Benin was prepared by the staff and discussed with the authorities.22
The assessment concludes that, since 1993, Benin has made major progress in macroeconomic
stabilization. It highlights that the diversification o f the economy from cotton production has
remained elusive. It underscores the need for Benin to increase the share o f poverty-reducing
expenditures in government spending, to accelerate structural reforms to raise productivity and
improve service delivery, and to strengthen the judiciary system.




22  Such assessments are required for members with longer-term program engagement, Benin has had arrangements
    with the Fund almost continuously since 1989, including a Structural Adjustment Facility arrangement (1989-92),
    two Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility arrangements (1993-96 and 1996-99), and a Poverty Reduction
    Growth Facility arrangement (2000-03).

ExecutiveBoardAssessment

Executive Directors commended Benin's considerable progress toward macroeconomic
stabilization over the past decade, which has helped sustain robust economic growth and placed
Benin among the better-performing countries o f the West African Economic and Monetary
Union. Directors noted that Benin's strong economic growth and low inflation during 2001-03
continued to be underpinned by a broadly appropriate stance o f macroeconomic policies.
Directors stressed, however, that greater efforts are needed to reverse the decline in Benin's
external competitiveness and to lower the economy's vulnerability to external shocks. In this
connection, they called for more determined implementationo f structural reforms, especially with
respect to the cotton sector, privatization and private sector development, the civil service, and
governance.

Directors noted that economic performance in2004 has been adversely affected by a poor cotton
crop and an intensification o f import restrictions from a major trading partner, which has
contributed to a revenue shortfall. They commended the planned introduction o f revenue and
expenditure measures aimed at limitingthe deterioration o f the fiscal position, while emphasizing
that further measures may be necessary if weaknesses in revenue collection were to continue.
Directors also encouraged the authorities to push ahead with their plans to strengthen the
institutions in charge o f seed cotton and input commercialization, and to pursue discussions with
Nigeria to resolve outstanding trade issues.

Directors endorsed the authorities' revised medium-term macroeconomic targets, which they
found to be in line with the PRSP's overall objective o f raising economic growth in order to
reduce poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals. They stressed that achievement
o f this objective will require an acceleration o f structural reforms and the continuation o f prudent
macroeconomic policies. Directors commended the authorities' efforts to strengthen the PRSP,
and encouraged rapid completion o f the first annual progress report on the implementation o f the
poverty reduction strategy. Directors welcomed the regular policy dialogue that the authorities
have initiated with the donor community, which i s an important step toward increased donor
harmonization. While calling for the continued involvement o f the donor community in Benin's
development effort-including       through the provision o f appropriate technical assistance-
Directors emphasized that the authorities need to address the weak implementation capacity that
hampers the execution o f social expenditures and undermines the potential benefits that could
accrue to Beninfrom higher aid inflows.

Directors called for continued efforts inthe mediumterm to boost revenue collection and increase
the level and quality o f poverty-reducing spending, while curbing non-priority expenditure. In
this regard, they urgedthe authorities to step upthe implementationo fthe actionplans to improve
tax and customs administrations. They also underscored the need to ensure that budgetary
allocations reflect PRSP priorities, to refiain from granting further wage increases before the
introduction o f a new compensation system, and to limit wasteful spending on public utilities.
Directors stressed that public expenditure management should be strengthened so as to improve
the monitoring o f budget execution, streamline budget procedures, and enhance transparency and
the tracking o f poverty-reducing outlays. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue and
deepen the decentralization process, while ensuring that it does not weaken central government
accounts and that expenditure management at the local level i s strengthened.

Directors emphasized the importance o f accelerating structural reforms to make the economy
more competitive and improve the delivery o f services to the population. They urged the
authorities to establish a credible agenda for the divestiture o f public utilities, to adopt and
implement a new administrative and civil service management reform, and to rapidly involve the
private sector inthe management o f the Port o f Cotonou. They also encouraged the authorities to
start preparing the next steps o f the cotton sector reform to ensure a transparent and successful
transition to a fully competitive system. Directors also stressed the need to improve the business
environment through determined implementation o f the strategy to fight corruption, the
strengthening of the judiciary system, and the enhancement o f governance and transparency at the
customs department. They emphasized that these reforms are essential to improve Benin's
competitiveness inthe context o f the fixed exchange rate.

Directors noted Benin's high dependence on cotton exports and on trade with Nigeria, and
encouraged the authorities to intensify their efforts to promote export diversification while
maintaining a liberal trade and exchange system. At the same time, it was noted that Benin's
poverty reduction efforts would benefit greatly from increased access to industrial countries'
markets. Directors welcomed the conclusion o f the debt sustainability analysis that Benin's
extefnal debt remains sustainable, and urged the authorities to take the necessary action to keep
the external debt on a sustainable path, including by pursuinga prudent debt-management policy.

Directors welcomed Benin's commitment to strengthening the financial sector. They encouraged
the continued efforts to ensure compliance with the regional banking commission's prudential
ratios and to deepen financial intermediation, including through the strengthening o f the legal and
judicial system and addressing land titling issues.

Directors also welcomed the authorities' support for the rehabilitation o f microfinance institutions
and their commitment to intensifyingthe supervision o f this sector.

Directors welcomed the candid exchange o f views between Fund staff and the authorities
regarding the ex post assessment (EPA) o f Benin's longer-term engagement with the Fund. They
concurred that the EPAprovides useful lessons for fiture program design and implementation.
Directors agreed that Benin's prolonged use o f Fund resources reflected the extensive and
complex nature of the reforms required to reinforce the foundations for sustained private-sector-
led growth and poverty reduction. They considered that Fund-supported programs since 1993 had
appropriately focused on economic and financial stabilization, and on structural reforms essential
to liberalize the economy and raise growth. Directors agreed that the Fund's involvement has
helped the authorities buildcapacity, particularly intax administration, and mobilize concessional
resources from the international community. They expressed concern, however, that there has not
been significant progress in poverty reduction. They also noted that while initial efforts to
liberalize the economy and reduce government intervention were successful, firther reforms,
including the divestiture program for public utilities and the civil, service reform, incurred
protracted delays.

Directors concurred that the main challenge for Benin i s to achieve sustained higher growth and
reduce poverty, while preserving macroeconomic stability and reducing the economy's
vulnerability to external shocks. They stressed that reaching these objectives will require
continuation o f fiscal consolidation, while increasing the level and quality of poverty-reducing
outlays, and enhanced efforts to implement the reform agenda.

Directors agreed that a further PRGF arrangement with low access would help Benin to continue
to address the remaining challenges that lie ahead, including through securing the necessary
concessional financial support, and would provide a framework for a sound policy response in
case o f external shocks. Directors stressed that the program supported by any such arrangement
should incorporate the lessons learnt from the EPA, should set out clear objectives on the
structural front, and should integrate the PRSP into a sound multi-year macroeconomic
framework. A broader aim would be for Benin eventually to exit from the use o f Fundresources.

Dear Mr.Wolfensohn:

INTRODUCTION

1.      The Letter o f Development Policy hereafter describes the reform program under the
second poverty reduction support credit (PRSC-2), which aims at implementing Benin's poverty
reduction strategy as described in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), adopted by the
Government inDecember 2002, and puts forward a perspective for the 2005-2007 period.

2.      This letter, which is a follow up of that o f 23 February 2004, presents the medium-term
measures that Government intends to cany out in order to implement its poverty reduction
strategy. It focuses on measures that will increase the effectiveness and impact of public
expenditure and improve public services especially for the poor. Ihave also attached the updated
PRSC policy matrix that has been prepared in collaboration with the IDA team and other
development partners and summarizes the content o f this letter. A table o f the PSRC program
monitoring indicators i s also attached.

3.      Efforts in designing the policy matrix have focused on defining priorities while taking
into account budgetary constraints identified within the Medium-term expenditure framework for
2005-2007 as well as institutional constraints which affect administration's absorption capacity.
Executing the actions and achieving results indicatedinbold characters inthe matrix are regarded
as essential for the success o f this reform program. Therefore Iagree that actions and results in
bold in the matrix must be achieved prior to PRSC-2. Other actions and results represent Benin's
vision o f the reform implementation process for 2006.

1.      Context and Recent Progress

4.      Assessment o f over a decade o f structural adjustment in Benin with support by the
Bretton Woods institutions and the international financial Community has shown that in spite o f
restoring macro-economic stability and a sustained and accelerated economic growth, poverty has
not been significantly reduced.

5.      It is against this background that the Benin Government drew and adopted inDecember
2002, a broad poverty reduction strategy aimed at ensuring that economic growth translates into a
substantial improvement o f the standards o f living o f households and a significant reduction o f
poverty. The Poverty reduction strategy was based on structural reforms and sector strategies
designed and implemented during the 80s. These strategies and programs have been further
refined duringthe PRSP preparation to strengthen the poverty reduction focus, particularly inthe
social sectors. The PRSP preparation has coincided with the preparation o f the Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) which, translates in budgetary terms the sector policies and
reform programs. The MTEF includes the medium-term sector program-budget which identifies
expenditures related to the implementation o f specific and clearly defined programs and policies,
Together the MTEF and the PRSP express Government's priorities and commitment to the
medium and long term poverty reductioninBenin.

6.      As indicated inthe PRSP, Government wishes to gradually obtain the involvement o f all
external development partners in providing budgetary support. To achieve this, Government
intends to improve the effectiveness and the pro-poor focus o f basic public services. These two
objectives require a significant improvement in public expenditure management at the local and
national levels, and a greater accountability o f project managers for concrete results, transparency
and good financial management.

                                                  131

7.      For this reason the Government has solicited and obtained a first poverty reduction
assistance credit (PRSC) to support its reform program in these areas and contribute to the
funding o fits poverty reductionstrategy.

8.      The PRSC-1 assessment recommended that a PRSC-2 be prepared. In this letter, the
Government i s therefore asking that the second Poverty Reduction Support Credit be granted as it
i s needed to continue its reformprogram and inturnto achieve the PSRP objectives.

2.      ReformProgram(2005-2007)

9.      The PRSP i s basedon four pillars:

     0  Strengthening the medium-term macro-economic framework;
     0  Developing human capital and environmental management;
     0  Promoting good governance and institutional capacity;
     0  Promoting sustainable employment and building capacity o f the poor to enhance their
        participationinthe production and decision-making process.

10.     The PRSC-supported program as described below is based on the same strategic pillars.
Furthermore the measures aimed at strengthening the macroeconomic framework and achieving
the poverty reduction objectives (especially those linked to the social indicators) will require a
clear and strong commitment on the part o f Government to implement a result oriented
management system and to improve economic efficiency and programs effectiveness. Likewise,
the National Assembly has passed the 2005 budget law with pluri-annual and annual budget in
line with the 2005-2007 MediumTerm Expenditure Framework for and PRSP priorities including
detailed program-budget for water supply inrural areas, health, basic education, environment and
urban sanitation, forest management and transport. It should be noted that most o f the targets set
out inthe 2004 program-budget for these sectors have by and large been achieved.

 11.     The first year of the program focuses on improving: (i) to drinking water inrural
                                                                   access
areas, (ii)the performance o f the national health system; (iii) quality o f basic education; and
                                                                 the
(iv) environmental and forest management. On the other hand, emphasis has been placed on (i)
public expenditure reforms and reinforcement o f the fiscal framework; (ii)     continuation o f the
fight   against corruption;     and (iii)reinforcement      o f the poverty reduction strategy
monitoring/evaluation.

 12.     Once progress made towards the implementation o f an acceptable framework for
performance budget and relevant sector strategies will have been assessed, the scope of the PRSC
(PRSC-2) will be extended during its second year to cover the justice, agriculture, and rural
transport sectors. During its third year, the scope o f the PRSC will be further extended to cover
private sector development and related improvement in the business environment. Likewise, a
short and medium term administrative / public service reforms action plan will be included inline
with public expenditure reform.

Pillar 1of the PRSC: Acceleratedand SustainableGrowth

 13.     The Macro-economic objective o f Benin's program i s to achieve an accelerated growth,

                                                                           ,




private investment. The initial goal was to reach an average economic growth o f 7 percent by
2006, should reach.

14.     This goal will however have to be reviewed inlight o f a slowdown in economic activity
in 2004 during the first year of the PRSC, including (i) barriers on Benin's export by
                                                             trade
Nigeria which extended the list o f banned imports from 21to 44; (ii) increasing competition from
the Lome port following a persistent lack of performance o f the Port o f Cotonou; (iii)
                                                                                       lower than
planned cotton production due to a poor organization o f cotton and inputs marketing; and (iv)
appreciation o f the Euro against the US dollar which has burdened economic activity, especially
the industry.

15.     Inthis context, where a 2.7 percent provisional growth estimate for 2004 contrasts with
the 4.2 percent average for the two previous years and a PSRP target of 6.8 to 7 percent,
economic growth objectives are 3.6 percent for 2005, 5.0 percent for 2006 and 5.5 percent for
2007. The Government's main objective i s to support private initiative especially in the agro-
industry,tourism and hotels, new information and communication technology and transit sectors
to promote economic growth. Itwill primarily require improving the business climate by reducing
costs of transaction and reinforcing the legal framework inorder to secure private investments.

16.      To support the poverty reduction and growth strategy and considering the time frame
needed to achieve results in the private sector development, the Government expects to raise
public investment rate from 7.1 percept o f GDP in 2000-2004 to 7.6 percent o f GDP between
2005-2007 while private investment which was around 12.4 percent o f GDP over the 2000-2004
period would be increased to 13 percent in 2005-2007. Thus, the total investment rate will
increase by 1.1percentage point to 20.6 percent o f GDP in2005-2007.

17.      Inspite of the estimated growth rates, the rate of inflation would be maintainedbelow 3
percent in line with WAEMU convergence criteria, while the current balance o f external deficit
would be maintained at a relatively highlevel due to highimports needed to accelerate growth.

 18.     The Government believes that accelerated growth and poverty reduction will primarily
require an increase in public expenditure on basic economic infrastructure and social sectors.
Consequently, the country's total expenditure should account for an average 21.8 percent o f GDP
over the 2005-2007 period as against 20.3 percent in 2000-2004. This increase in the public
expenditure, particularly on education, health and water, would be partially covered by an
increase in total public revenue which i s estimated at 17.0 percent o f GDP in 2005-2007
stemming from increased efficiency in tax recovery and further efforts in seeking alternative
sources o f revenue. Ultimately, the total deficit excluding grants should be maintained at an
average 6.0 percent over the 2005-2007 period.

 19.     The impact on the budget of the 2004 economic slowdown and its effect in2005 has been
worsened by difficulties incotton production as well as by public to subsidies to cotton producers
and losses-incurred by SONAPRA. Consequently, 2005 budget policy will need to be tightened
in.The Government intends to bridge an 81.3 billion CFAF financing gap in2005 by usingthree
complementary methods.

20.      The first method should bring the financing gap down to 47.5 billion CFAF. It includes:
(i)increasingpublic revenue by 14.5 billion CFAF through further financial tightening; (ii)
seeking domestic bank financing o f 13.3 billion CFAF including a 1.3 billion CFAF financial
support from the IMF; and (iii)   selling three lots o f SONAPRA's industrial equipment. The sale
could bring an about 6 billion CFAF o f additional financing after taking into account associated

                                                  133

costs o f liquidation, such as the social plan and the full repayment o f the remainder o f
SONAPRA'S bridge loanwhich the State will also take charge of. The fourth lot will also be sold
as soon as the dispute between the Government and a thirdparty will have been resolved.

21.     The second method i s to reduce budget expenditure by 35.0 billion CFAF which in turn
would bring the financing gap down to 12.5 billion CFAF. Prior to implementing this measure,
the Government will: (i) thejustification and amount of additionalexpenditures; (ii)
                            review                                                            check
with its development partners the feasibility o f reducing these expenditures in view o f its
obligations and commitments within the poverty reduction framework.

22.     The third method aims at securing residual funding o f about 12.5 billion CFAF from the
international community after efforts would have been made to curtail the budget. To that end, the
Government will contact the European Union, France and the AfDB which i s expected to release
a new installment o f 8.0 billion CFAF to Beninin2005.

23.     Based on revenue and expenditure estimates as well as the expected external debt relief
under the HIPC initiative for 2006 and 2007, the gap will be financed by budget support from the
African Development Bank (AfDB), the European Union (EU), Denmark, the Netherlands and
Switzerland which have signed a joint agreement with the Benin Government, as well as from
IDA.Benin will therefore solicit the help of its major donors to finance any residual gap.

24.     Accelerated and sustainable economic growth implies significant development inBenin's
private sector which translates into an increased private investment and improvement in the
private sector's competitiveness. Based on lessons learned from the implementation o f the PRSC-
1, achieving such objectives will require reinforcing the private/public sector dialogue; (ii)
improving the business environment and finally (iii)strengthening the private-public sector
partnership for infiastructural development.

25.     Inaddition to enhancing the current public / private sector dialogue, the Government
intends to organize a highlevel investor forum following the examples o f Ghana, Mali, Senegal
and Tanzania with support fkom the World Bank, to demonstrate its increased commitment to
private sector development.

26.     Moreover, in view o f the difficulties encountered in implementing the various
privatization operations which remain essential to achieve Benin's poverty reduction strategy, the
Government i s fully aware o f the need to strengthen private-public sector partnership to improve
transparency. With help from its development partners, the Government plans to focus the public-
private partnership on four sectors including telecommunication, energy, water and port
management. Its objective i s to create an environment where private operators and investors can
fully participate in the development o f priority sectors in different ways (privatization,
concession, and lease).

27.     Inanycase, theGovernmentintendstopursuetheon-goingprivatization. Inthatregardit
will: (i)improve the legal and institutional framework o f privatization; (ii) the sector policy
                                                                             adopt
for electricity; (iii)
                     adopt the regulatory framework and create a regulatory body for the water and
electricity sectors; (iv) finalize and launch the tender for the privatization o f the SBEE; and (v)
restart discussions with the social partners as soon as possible on the continuation o f a feasibility
study on the private sector involvement in managing the port while taking the sector's progress
into consideration.



                                                 134

28.      With respect to accelerating growth, the cotton sector continues to play a major role
(cotton exports account for about 80 percent o f exports on the average excluding re-exports). For
this reason the sector reform (including the privatization o f SONAPRA'S ginning facilities) that
aims at increasing producers' share o f the sector revenue will be pursued during the period. (See
details below).

Agriculture Sector

Overall Sector Management

29.      The priorities set in the various rural sector development strategy documents are
consistent with the projections o f the poverty reduction strategy and therefore constitute a sound
agricultural sector development framework which all the development partners are committed to
support. Government also acknowledges that the technical and financial support given to sector
institutions i s inadequate to support the implementation o f these strategies. Consequently, the
programbudgets o fthe next three years will support the implementation o f these strategies.

30.      To improve sector management, Government has reorganized sector institutions to
restore agriculture as a major engine o f growth. A special program budget has therefore been
drawn with support from the FA0 / NEPAD for fisheries, livestock and rural engineering
departments in the participatory preparation and decentralization o f three priority investment
programs, to more effectively target public expenditure, to promote private initiative and to
implement the PRSP priorities.

31.      MAEP's management i s now focusing on 13 main functions instead o f managing more
than 60 projects. Such greater focus will facilitate the implementation o f the medium term
expenditure framework. The 2005 program-budget will primarily aim at consolidating and
rationalizing sector management at central and regional levels. This approach will specifically
finalize the programs and budgets o f the Financial Control Directorate, the Human Resource
Directorate and the Debt Directorate together with the new Monitoring / Evaluation Service for
the Agricultural statistical service, the establishment o f Regional Agriculture Promotion Centers
(CERPA) and their local agencies at the commune level.

32.      Government i s convinced that agriculture sector management will rely o f four closely-
linked partners-namely: the Government, through the Ministry o f Agriculture, Livestock and
Fisheries, the private sector, the elected local, regional and Government officials as well as
agriculture Producers Organizations (POs). A special program budget i s targeting POs,
historically the weakest link, to improve management and representativity. Local staff and
managers in MAEP's regional agencies have been appointed. Government intends to pursue
privatizationinthe cotton sector, including the privatization o f SONAPRA's industrial equipment
which will be sold as 4 lots, as indicatedinPara. 20 above.

The Cotton sub-sector

33.      The Government's primary objective i s to restore cotton as a sustainable integrated sub
sector through private management. Consequently the State has (i)        implemented a 2005-2006
mandatory mechanism for stakeholders to enable them to import and distribute inputsto the rural
areas; (ii)adopted a single seed cotton marketing mechanism for the 2004-2005 period where the
existing structures including those o f ginners, producers, distributors and the State are used; (iii)
adopted a new regulatory framework to govern sector operations; and (iv) implemented a new set
ofregulations to promote sector competition.

                                                  135

34.       The Government also intends to promote the preparation and adoption by all sector
professionals of a transparent and automatic incentive mechanism based on productivity and price
for ginners and producers while ensuring flexible prices. The existence o f such mechanism will
be a prerequisite to sector support. It would include possible payments to a sector support fund if
world prices increase beyond a certain threshold or transfers from the support fund ifworld prices
fall below an agreed threshold.

35.       Within the context o f its disengagement from SONAF'U, Government is committed to
resuming the process o f selling the ginneries soon after the 2004-2005 cotton campaign. To this
end, it will resume talks with the (provisional) successful bidders for three lots, by M a y 16, 2005,
notice o f which will be sent to the technical and financial partners o f the sector. Government will
also confirm transfer o f the lots to the successful bidders by an official letter while the bidders
will be expected to confirm their commitment towards the lots within a week o f reception o f the
said letter. Transfer o f the lots will be carried out latest by October 31, 2005 after negotiations
with the bidders (including an agreement on a social plan) and payment. The Government will
however restart the privatization process inconsultation with its technical partners and donors ifit
does not receive any positive response from one or several bidders. With regard to the last lot (lot
3), the Government will take the necessary steps to ensure its sale by November 30,2005, without
prejudice to any intended legal action by the provisional successful bidder. Inany case the sale o f
the last lot will take place after the intended legal actions by the provisional bidder on the lot.

36.      Furthermore, as a major source o f growth, the Govemment (after reorganizing the
agricultural sector) i s expected to (i) conduct a participatory discussion and adoption o f a national
agricultural services structure; and (ii)finalize in collaboration with the private sector a
development support program for three (3) new sub sectors: cashew nut, shear butter and
fisheries.

37.      Government i s therefore convinced that only the implementation o f an integrated private
sector program can create a environment conducive to development and i s therefore committed to
(i)  concluding a study on the competitiveness o f Benin's economy and a survey on the current
integrated trade; (ii) launching in the near future a survey on the investment climate and a study
on other growth sectors (tourism, ago-industry, and transit o f goods); and (iii)        implementing
findings from all studies with a special attention to land titling reforms and drawing up a new
strategy for each o f the sectors.

Rural Transport

38.      The Government aims at improving rural transport in order to improve access o f rural
communities to basic social services, markets and production areas. The strategy document
recently concluded by the Ministry o f Transport will serve as the reference framework for the
2005 rural transport program. The objective for this year i s to rehabilitate 950 km o f rural roads
by 2005. The beneficiaryrural communities have been identified on the basis of accessibility and
level o f poverty. Thus the sector will, in the mediumterm, have an STR to be concluded in 2005,
a pluri-annual rural road investment and maintenance program, and an institutional framework for
the implementationo f this strategy for the preparationo f a program-budget fkom 2006.

39.      Starting 2006, the Government will consequently (i)       adopt the STR, a pluri-annual rural
road investment and maintenance program; (ii)      prepare new documents to define the institutional
framework for the implementation o f the STR, and (iii)       carry out studies on intermediate means
o f transport.

                                                   136

Pillar 11of the PSRP: Improving Basic Sewices and the Sustainable Management of Natural
Resources

40.      Without human capital development and a sustainable natural resource management,
accelerated and sustainable growth and poverty reduction would be hard to achieve. Thus, poor
access to drinking water, primary health care, basic education and literacy, have contributed
immensely to Benin's deepening poverty. Such difficulties have therefore become the main focus
for the next three years. Improving the supply, use and quality o f these services and, more
importantly, the fight against HIV/AJDSand malaria are the main objectives o f this aspect o f the
poverty reduction strategy.

Improving Access to Drinking Water in Rural Areas

41.      Implementation of the PADEAR strategy over the last decade has yielded substantial
results in the improvement o f sanitation and access to water in the rural areas. However in view
o f major obstacles to development such as (i)  the lack o f viable service, (ii)
                                                                               inadequate domestic
funding, and (iii)inadequate monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, the Government has
adopted recommendations included in the annual joint review with all the sector partners for the
preparation o f the 2005-2007 program-budget for the Water Directorate.

42.      The review o f the 2004 program implementation has raised hopes o f attaining the
Millennium Development Goal (MDG), which untilrecently had seemed unlikely for the Water
sector. The sector i s therefore expected to double its water well construction capacity between
2002 and 2004. For the first time, the annual water well construction target o f about 1200 will be
exceeded, thanks to a good performance in 2004. Improvement inplanning and budget execution
combined with the will to achieve the Millennium Development Goal coupled with increased
substantial assistance from the donors, have created opportunity to assess and improve the
sector's performance.

43.      The 2005-2007 program-budget focuses on (i)      the creation o f new waterworks and the
rehabilitation o f water wells; (ii)
                                   the renovation o f manual water pumps, (iii) logistical support
                                                                               the
for the "deconcentration" o f departmental services o f the Ministry o f Mines, Energy and Water.
In the course of 2005, (i) new water code will be adopted, (ii) agency in charge of
                               the                                          the
coordinating the integrated management o f water resources will be created; and (iii)     the GIRE
(Integrated Water Resource Management) action plan will be finalized.

44.      In this context, program objective for this sub-sector is to increase access to drinking
water from 38 percent in 2004 to 43 percent in 2006 and 45 percent in 2007 which will create
access to about 2950 new water sources and rehabilitate 630 existing ones over the 20005-2007
period. At least 80 percent o f the water wells will be inuse by 2006.

45.      Inorder to better address water management, aruralwater supply strategywas discussed
during a workshop and adopted by the Council o f Ministers. The strategy includes
professionalizing village level water management through private-public sector partnership as
well as rehabilitating and maintaining 2000 broken down pumps.

Health

46.      The quality o f Programs in this sector i s gradually improving. There i s greater focus on
the PRSP, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the national social and health

                                                 137

development Policies and strategies for 2002-2006. Efforts are particularly focused on reducing
infant and maternal mortality, and fighting against major diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis
and HN. Many initiatives have been taken to improve poor people's access to quality health
services.

47.      Government's key challenges are: (i)    identification and implementation o f already agreed
actions for the poorest as indicated in preliminary action plan; (ii)  recurring issues regarding the
quality and quantity o f human resources as well as their adequate distribution across the country
and staff motivation; (iii)sustainability o f sector achievements including the effective functioning
of the COGES; (iv) the fight against major diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV-AIDS and
malnutrition particularly for children from 0 to 5 years; (v) the implementation o f infant and
maternalhealth program; and (vi) quality healthcare and adequate use o f health services.

48.      To this end, a resource allocation methodology was designed in2004 among other things
on the basis o f poverty criteria and the performance o f health services and used as a basis for the
preparation o f the 2005 program-budget. Also, a wide range o f health services has been identified
and will be provided to families in ten targeted health districts during the first year o f the
program. Successive efforts will be made in order to improve the accessibility and the quality o f
programs in 2005, including the effective implementation o f recently adopted mechanisms o f
fundingservices for the poor inthe targetedareas.

Basic Education

49.      Progress i s being made in improving the access to basic education, even though
improving the quality and reducing o f disparities will remain huge challenges in the coming
years. The Govemment i s committed to pursuingpolicies started in2004 to improve accessibility,
learning and the quality o f basic education and to reinforce effective service provision and
management o f basic education. To this end, the following important objectives will be
undertaken by 2006: (i)   increasing girls' school completion rate from 34 percent in2001/02 to 41
percent; (ii) reducing the average repetition rate at the primary level from 20 percent in 2001/02
to 15 percent in2005/2006; (iii)   the textbook availability ratio (mathematics and reading) to reach
one book per pupil; and (iv) the percentage o f school drop-out i s reducedfrom 10.5 percent to 5.5
percent over the same period.

50.      Achieving these objectives will depend on progress made in 2004 especially in terms o f
(i)implementingtwo actionplans adoptedin2003 to enhance the execution ofa curriculum
reform and to improve retention o f pupils in schools, including preparing a report on the
reduction o f repetitions in the first grade o f primary school. The preparation o f a program
financed by the 2005 budget to construct at least fifty classrooms with the aim o f reducing school
drop-out rate in target areas; (ii) the recruitment o f 1183 contractual teachers and deployment o f
personnel which helped improve the regional distribution o f teachers; and (iii)     the reduction o f
the cost o f schooling for poor children. In addition, at least 70 percent o f the planned programs
were carried out and the list o f beneficiary schools from the probams has beenprepared.

51,      Strategic efforts will be focused on the two agreed pillars for 2004 : (i)implementation o f
the girl enrollment program in 19 target communities where girls enrolment are low (less than 60
percent) and; protection o f girls with full participation o f NGOs and other associations; (ii)
strengthened execution o f the curriculum reform action plan which includes the definition and
gradual implementation o f a new teaching method for primary school teachers; (iii)     strengthening
o f an action plan aimed at improving internal effectiveness and system sustainability by focusing
on class repeaters and school drop-outs; (iv) continuation o f a decentralized recruitment by post

                                                  138

o f additional teaching personnel (about 1000 in 2004/2005) and the redeployment o f personnel;
and (v) pursuingthe subsidizing o f communities on a pilot basis to help them pay the salaries o f
community teachers.

52.      Government also plans to finalize the on-going preparation o f an integrated sector policy
byNovember 2005 as well as the preparation o fa ten-year sector development program.

Environment and Sanitation in Rural Areas

53.      Remarkable progress has been achieved in the implementation o f the national
environmental management program (PNGE) started since 2002. This progress confirms the
program's key role in the implementation o f the 2002-2006 medium term strategic plan o f the
ministryo f environment, housing and urbanization, and also demonstrates Government's political
will to support it. Pro-poor and sustainable development oriented investments are in line with
PRSP objectives and the millennium development goals. The current programming of PNGE
investment involves three main areas: (i)environmental management tools; (ii)urban
environmental management; and (iii)activities on the implementation o f international
conventions on the environment.

54.      Similar progress has been achieved in urban support activities. Globally, program
execution i s in line with the performance contracts (resources, target activities) between program
managers and supervisors. Resources allocation under the 2006 budget will be based on
performance with reference to performance contracts adopted in2005.

Forestry and SurroundingLand Management

55.      The Government i s convinced that sustainable management o f forest resources and
surrounding lands i s an important aspect o f the poverty reduction strategy. Improved management
o f natural resources will help reverse the degradation o f national forests which are an importance
resource for rural populations. The option that has been retained i s the implementation o f
mechanisms which aim at increased empowerment of grassroots communities and promotion o f
alternative activities to prevent an indiscriminate exploitation o f forest resources. The Rivers and
forests management program aims primarily at the sustainable management o f 22 forests
including three main components such as (i)institutional support and capacity building; (ii)
participatory management o f forests and river bodies; and (iii) sustainable management o f fire
                                                                 the
wood and its environmental impact.

56.      The program aims at implementing the following action plan: (i)         implementation o f a
taxation system that i s favorable to charcoal and firewood from managed forests, (ii)   privatization
o f the industrial branch o f the national forestry agency (0");      and (iii)pursuingparticipatory
forestry management. The program will also extend the community management o f forest
resources to seven protected forests and two river bodies as well as to the improvement o f forest
exploitation, production techniques and promoting alternative income generating activities (a total
of 12 forests will be protected by 2005).

Pillar III of the PRSP: Improving and Strengthening Good Governance as well as
InstitutionalCapacity Building

Legal Sector

57.      One o f the PRSP's fundamental goals i s to ensure effective functioning and access to the
legal and legislative system. Thus, Benin's integrated legal and legislative system reinforcement
program approved by its donors, and officially adopted by the Government in 2001, will drive its
legal and legislative reformprogram for the next decade.

58.      In 2004, the Government has prepared the 2005-2007 implementation plan o f the
integrated program and a corresponding Program budget for the Ministry o f Justice, Legislation
and Human Rights with its associated monitoring mechanism. The plan has been approved by the
National IntegratedProgram Steering Committee.

59.      To ensure a most conducive environment to the integrated program implementation in
2005, the Government has undertaken to recruit 28 magistrates and 29 extra court clerks.
Similarly the Government has since September 2004 enforced some o f the April 6, 2004 decrees
regarding the remuneration o f magistrates as follows: (i)  accommodation allowance; (ii)     research
allowance; and (iii) legal and qualification bonus.

60.      Government intends to achieve all the planned actions for 2005 in the implementation
plan and program budget o f the Ministry o f Justice, Legislation and Human Rights. The
Government will ensure effective implementation o f the Ministry o f Justice, capacity building
activities which will improve performance. The following actions will be taken in 2005: (i)
ensuring appropriate execution of the integrated reform program, including the implementation o f
an information collection and processing system for the legal sector; (ii)  auditing the Ministry o f
Justice; (iii)establishing an efficient evaluation and monitoring system in the Ministry o f Justice;
(iv) preparingand launching an education program (covering inparticular OHADA's harmonized
procedures) targeting magistrates and Ministry o f Justice staff; (v) acquisition o f equipment for
the Ministry o f Justice and for the courts and tribunal;, and (iv) effective creation o f a Legal and
Judiciary Information Center. The Government also plans to integrally enforce, the April 6, 2004,
decrees on the remunerationo f the magistrates.

BudgetReform

61.      To ensure effective and efficient expenditure management, the Government i s determined
to deepen its budget reforms aimed at: (i)introducing performance-based budget management
through program-budget consistent with the medium term expenditure framework; (ii)the
delegating public expenditure management, currently the sole responsibility o f the Ministry o f
Finance and Economy to sector Ministries and finally to decentralize Administrations within a
reinforced fiduciary framework, (sound budgetary management); and (iii)rationalize and
computerize the expenditure subsystem.

62.      Remarkable progress has been sustained since the beginning o f the budget reform with
regards to budget planning, execution and reporting due to key institutional reforms and intense
capacity building efforts supported by the development partners including the World Bank
through its PERAC and PRSC programs. Steps have also been taken to make budget execution
more reliable in (i) reducing the use of the exceptional procedures, (ii)  speeding up regularization
o f advance payments, (iii)avoiding incurring new debts with public contracts, (iv) ensuring
legality o f commitments, and (v) updating the accounts.

                                                  140

63.     The Government i s expected to pursue its public expenditure reforms in 2005-2007 by:
(i)implementinganactionplanrecommendedbytheindependentevaluationofnonregularized
expenditures and o f the quality o f expenditure accounts; (ii)organizing services to regularize and
monthly integration in the budget o f payments without prior commitments; (iii)        pursuing the
settlement o f treasury accounts; (iv) granting budget advances to credit managers only in strict
compliance o f regulations and after proper justification and payment order o f the previous
advance; (v) searching for solution together with control bodies, to audit old treasury accounts
and to settle the accounts; (vi) updating SIGFP with legal, not-yet-recorded commitments
includingbills lacking appropriate commitment due to a lack o f credit or due to an annual limit on
expenditure placed on a Government entity; (vii) reinforcing controls on commitments from the
Ministry o f Public Works or other Ministries potentially generating important arrears; (viii)
buildingthe capacity o f the treasury (quality o fhuman andmaterial resource and o f conditions o f
service) and implementing specific measures aiming at centralizing resources at the treasury
without compromising the execution o f projects.

Result- Based Management

64.      The Government will pursue the implementation o f program budgets, account
performance monitoring and the assessment o f programs in order to gradually achieve the
objectives o f implementing a result oriented public administration. To implement these
management practices at the Ministries, the Government has: (i)         prepared a specific letter o f
development policy for a result-oriented management reform and an operational plan for its
implementation; (ii)   launched requisite actions to ensure result-oriented management in a number
o f sub-programs in2005 infive Ministries (MFE, MMEH,MEPS, MSP, and MEW).

65.      The Government has affirmed its political will to achieve this objective and to support
efforts to equip the technical team through a commitment protocol that the Minister o f Finance
and Economy has signed with each sector minister regarding each sub-program for the 2005-2007
period. This agreement i s in line with the 2005 budget and allocates fungible operations and
investment credits as well as expenditure to the manager in charge o f the sub-program. The
approval ad execution o f the 2007 budget will depend on results achieved in2005.

66.      Within this context, the support extended to the implementation o f a long term multi-
sector technical assistance for ministries involved in budget reform as well as timely technical
assistance have proven to be indispensable inview o f challenges encountered by the ministries in
their implementation o f a performance monitoring system.

Public Procurement Reform

67.      A s part o f improvements inthe fiduciary framework, Government's procurement reforms
have resulted in a new institutional framework to: (i)  improve the transparency and effectiveness
o f procurement; (ii)  modernize procurement procedures; (iii) in place an independent control
                                                                 put
mechanism to reduce corruption in procurement. The previous measures aimed at implementing
the new national procurementregulatory commission have been effective.

68.      Although late, the new institutional framework i s gradually being put in place. Thus the
Governmenthas drawn-up a program o f specific activities in2005 and 2006 including the budget
 for operations and equipment o f the main structures o f the institutional framework such as the
CNFWP, the DNMP and the CPMPs o f ten (10) pilot ministries. The objective for 2005 will be to


                                                  141

improve the operation o f the new mechanism, to implement the program o f activities and to
accelerate the overhaul procurement code.

Reformand Rationalizationo f Control and InternalAudit

69.      The current budget reform, and more importantly, the implementationo f a result-oriented
management will result in a transformation o f internal control operations within public
administration. Insuch a context the internal control operations must adapt their organization and
methods to support the performance o f Government programs by acting in such a way as to
reduce the risk o f mismanagement. If overall the reform, under IGF's leadership i s on track,
progress i s uneven across individual reforms o f which some have encounteredmajor setbacks.

70.     Within this context, in addition to the institutional support sought by Government from
its development partners for public control agencies, technical support will be solicited from the
Finance Control Directorate to conduct such a key reform parting the context o f result-based
management    I




71.      For this reason the Government i s firmly envisaging to (i)  organize a control and internal
audit training program in 2005 for controllers; (ii)  adopt in the Council o f ministers in 2005 a
decree delineating responsibilities and organization internal control within ministries and
nationwide and setting norms and standards.

Strengthening External Audit

72.     The Government intends to continue strengthening internal audit through (i)the
implementation o f performance audits on the execution o f the 2002, 2003, 2004 program-budget
by the Chamber of accounts based on the performance reports presented by the ministries
participating inthe PSRP; and (ii) the creation o f a Court o f Auditors inBenin.

73.      The development o f the current "Chamber o f accounts" will continue pursuant to the
2003 Commitment protocol even if the recruitment o f additional resources i s postponed in2005.
The Government i s committed to ensure due diligence in transforming the Chamber of accounts
into a full-fledged Court o f Auditors. At the same time, the 2001 and 2002 "Lois de reglement"
(Budget Review Laws) as well as the 2002 performance audit reports o f ministries involved in
budget reforms with support from PERAC will be submitted to the National Assembly without
delays. Government accounts for 2003 will be submitted to the Chamber of accounts by the end
o f November 2004. Lastly, the Government i s expected to submit the 2003 performance audit o f
the eight PERAC ministries to the National assembly within a reasonable period.

74.     Carrying out these activities will enhanced capacity o f the Chamber o f accounts, and
necessary steps will be taken to further develop its capacity with respect to performance auditing,
modernize its assessment methods and more broadly consolidate its gains. The intendedresult i s a
more autonomous and independent, hence more efficient Chamber o fAccounts.

Administration and Public ServiceReforms

75.     The introduction o f result-oriented management requires implementing more flexible
administrative structures, and adapting public administration human resource management
policies, particularly performance-based salaries and decentralized personnel recruitment and
management. There i s however the need for an appropriate performance-based management
reform, a clarification o f the legal framework, and of the duties and responsibilities o f public

                                                142

servants in the context o f a competent, integrated and performing, politically neutral and
objectively impartial public service geared to render quality public services.

76.      The human resource management reform aims at better matching applicant profiles and
job descriptions, at extending the tenure for competent civil servants who are committed to the
management and assessment o f the programs. Program managers should be able to define what
they need to achieve specific objectives, as this will facilitate arbitration between objectives and
resources they needto successfully implement their programs.

77.      The Government i s convincedthat at the core o f the reforms i s a complete overhaul o f the
civil service status to align it with the requirements o f the result-oriented management. Inview o f
this, the Government is expected to draw up a communication plan to involve all stakeholders,
including social partners in the new result-oriented management. When completed, the civil
service reform will provide for a motivating wage policy based on merit and performance and a
new career management and state personnel salary system, on the one hand, and the
implementation o f an adequate recruitmentpolicy on the other.

78.      Following the establishment o f a single reference file integrating payroll and personnel
data, which will provide the exact number o f paid civil servants, will enhance civil service
management and will limit fraudulent personnel management practices, the Government in 2004
has (i) delegated by decree the administrative management o f the personnel currently under the
sole responsibility o f the Ministry in charge o f Public Service to the Ministries o f Education; and
(ii) established a technical framework for the management o f administrative reforms made up o f
 Secretaries General o f the Ministries.

 79.     The Government i s expected to establish and implement a medium-term reform program,
 consistent with the public expenditure reforms, to manage humanresources inline with the result-
oriented public expenditure management, To that end, its 2005-2007 reform action plan for 2005
includes: (i) a career development strategy within a sustainable framework and (ii) finalization
                                                                                        the
o f a new civil service status inline with performance-based management.

Decentralization and "Deconcentration       ''

 80      The Government will continue its decentralization process after municipal elections in
 December 2002. An on-going study o f the modalities and the cost o f transferring authority to
 local Governments will facilitate the transfer at the local level o f credit management initially
 carried out at central Government level. The study and its associated action plan will spell out
 detailed measures and a time table for their execution. Legal texts governing local Governments'
 accounting and budget frameworks have been adopted. Lastly the Government will continue
building budget management capacity o f local Governments to ensure that the devolution o f
budgetingresponsibilities does not affect the quality o f public expenditure management.

 81,     Starting 2005, to ensure effective management at the commune level and at the level of
regionalized services o f the central administration, the Government will: (i) up and adopt a
                                                                                  draw
vision and strategic plan to guide the "deconcentration";         (ii) prepare a functional integrated
 organizational framework in order to undertake the deconcentration reforms; (iii)enhance
 collaboration between `prefets' (administrative authority at the department level), mayors and
 deconcentrated services; (iv) adopt a strategic implementation plan to guide the decentralization
process and ensure early allocation o f financial resources earmarked for communes inthe General
Budget.


                                                  143

Fight Against Corruption and Improvement of Public Communication

82.      To enhance governance and ensure the rule o f law, the Govemment has adopted a
strategic plan to fight corruption based on the following major pillars: (i)   improving the control
system through the enactment o f an anti-corruption law; (ii)   pursuingthe reform o f management
and institutional procedures; (iii)building capacity o f civil society and o f the private sector; (iv)
creating an environment that discourages corruption; and (v) strengthening accountability and
fighting impunity. An anti-corruption observatory aiming at consolidating achievements with
respect to governance has been established in2004 following the adoption o f its draft written law.
Moreover the first survey on governance and corruption which aims at establishing a reference
base for monitoring progress o f the Public Sector Adjustment Credit and its updating in2005, has
began. A public information mechanism inthe implementationo fthe strategic anti-corruption and
the progress o f corruption isbeing set up.

83.      The Government intends to enhance communication with its social partners with the aim
o f improving access to public information and promote civil society participation inthe decision-
making process. The Government i s committed to adopting the mediumterm national information
and communication strategy, and improving the communication capacity at the Governmental
level.

Coordination and Monitoring Arrangementsfor the Execution and Impact of the of the PSRC
SupportedProgram.

Coordination o fthe PSRC Supported Promam

84,      Inline withPSRC-1, the Programwillbe generally carriedout bythe MinistryofFinance
and Economy, through a Ministerial Committee (actually a subcommittee o f the National Poverty
Reduction Committee) chaired by the Minister o f Economy and Finance who will have overall
responsibility for program execution. The committee membership includes ministers whose
departments are involved inpoverty reduction, in addition to the Ministers incharge o f ministries
identified as priority ministries in the PSRP. Its Secretariat i s provided by the Permanent
Secretariat o f the National Poverty Reduction Committee.

Monitoringthe Implementationo f the PSRC-Supuorted Promam

85.      The Permanent Secretariat of the National Poverty Reduction Committee and the Social
Change Observatory (OCS) will ensure the overall monitoring o f the program as part o f the
monitoring o f the poverty reduction Strategy execution, essentially through the monitoring
activities o f line ministries. In practice, the monitoring and evaluation capacity remain very
limited. Where they exist or are operational, they are limited to the supervision o f budget
execution and sector activities. Outputs rather than impacts and final results are monitored,
without adequately stressing effective and efficient performances o f the expenditure programs. To
strengthen the monitoring /evaluation o f sector ministries, the Government will take the following
steps: (i)equip the monitoring and evaluation units with full time professional human resource;
(ii)establish performance evaluation frameworks; and (iii)implement the performance
monitoring capacity building/ evaluation program.

86.      Lastly, the PSRC will be monitored through the program-budget execution reports and
the target sector performance reports. The Bank will also carry out joint reviews with other
development partners, while a regular dialogue will be maintained among signatories o f the
program.

                                                 144

Monitoringthe Social Imuact o f the PRSC-Supported Poverty ReductionProgram

87.     During the PRSP preparation and the implementation o f the PSRP monitoring /
evaluation system, the Government and the development partners recognized the need to design a
program which would make it possible to conduct a thorough Poverty and Social Impact Analysis
(PSIA). The Permanent Secretariat o f the National Poverty Reduction Committee and the Social
Change Observatory are currently identifying areas that require a participatory PSIA analysis.

88.     A program o fpriority studies will be launched in2005 and will include: (i) impact o f
                                                                                        the
the reforms and expansion o f the cotton sector; (ii)   an analysis into the low usage o f health
services; (iii)
              a qualitative and quantitative evaluation o f the proportion o f the poor with access to
social services and basic infkastructure; and (iv) an analysis o f the impact o f credit transfer to
schools and community health facilities under the HIPC initiative. This will be done
simultaneously with the annual HIPC expenditure audit.

Possible Next Steps in thePSRC-SupportedProgram

89.     A satisfactory execution ofthe secondyear programwithregardto: (i) expenditure
                                                                                   public
management; (ii)   the PSRC-2 priority sectors would be an important trigger o f a final third phase
that would provide for an extension o f the program to other sectors. This evaluation i s scheduled
for June 2005.

90.     The Government has agreed with IDA on linking the decision to extend the PSRC-
supported program to other programs to progress achieved in the preparation o f these sectors,
especially in the implementation o f measures and actions identified during the PSRC-2
evaluation.

91.     The Government therefore believes that these policies and measures constitute an
important stage inthe achievement o f its medium-term PSRP objectives. Therefore it i s soliciting
the financial assistance o f the Bank inimplementing its poverty reduction strategy.

INTRODUCTION

1.      L a presente lettre de politique de developpement decrit le programme de reformes
appuyk par le deuxikme credit d'appui a la reduction de la pauvrete (PRSC2), qui vise a
mettre en ceuvre la strategie de reduction de la pauvrete du Benintelle que dicrite dans l e
Document de Strategiejde Reduction de la Pauvrete (DSRP), adopte par le Gouvemement
en dCcembre 2002 et dpresenter les perspectives pour la ptriode 2005-2007.

2.      Cette lettre qui fait suite a celle en date du 23 fevrier 2004 decrit les actions que l e
Gouvemement entend exkcuter sur le moyen-terme afin de mettre en ceuvre effectivement
sa strategie de reduction de l a pauvrete en se concentrant sur les mesures qui permettront
d'accroitre l'efficacitk et l'impact des dtpenses publiques et contribueront ainsi a
ambliorer les services publics en particulier pour les plus pauvres. D e plus, j e joins la
matrice des politiques et mesures actualiskes appuyees par le PRSC qui a et6 prtparke en
collaboration avec l'equipe de I'IDA et les autres partenaires au developpement, et qui
resume et specifie le contenu de cette lettre. Je joins egalement le tableau des indicateurs
de suivi du programme appuyk par l e PRSC.

3.       L a matrice des politiques et mesures reflete un intense effort de definition des
priorites qui a tenu compte des contraintes budgetaires identiflees dans le Cadre de
DCpenses a Moyen-Terme 2005-2007 et des contraintes institutionnelles qui affectent la
capacitC d'absorption de l'administration. L'execution des actions et la realisation des
resultats indiques en caractltres gras dans la matrice sont considerees c o m e essentielles
pour le succes de ce programme de reformes. Aussi, suis-je d'accord que ces actions et
resultats sont des mesures prkalables au PRSC-2. Les               autres actions et risultats
representent la vision du Benin du processus de mise en ceuvre des reformes et constituent
sa meilleure appreciation actuelle des actions et resultats attendus pour 1'annCe 2006.

1. Contexte et Evolution Ricente

4.        L e bilan de plus d'une decennie d'ajustement structure1 appuye par les Institutions
de Bretton Woods et la Communaute Financiere Intemationale au Benin a rkvele que
nonobstant le rktablissement des grands Cquilibres macro-economiques qui a permis
d'accelerer la croissance Cconomique de maniltre durable, la pauvrete n'avait pas
significativement recule.

 5.       C'est dans ce contexte que le Gouvemement du BCnin a elabore et adopte en
dkcembre 2002 une strategie globale de reduction de la pauvrete qui vise iis'assurer que
les progres en matiitre de croissance economique se traduiront par une amelioration
tangible des conditions de vie des menages et une reduction significative de la pauvrete.
 L a strategie de reduction de la pauvrete a ete ClaborCe sur la base des programmes de
 reformes structurelles et des strategies sectorielles elabores et m i s en ceuvre au cours des
 annkes quatre-vingt dix. Ces strategies et programmes ont Cte ameliores dans le cadre de la
 preparation du DSRP afm de mieux prendre en compte les objectifs de reduction de la
 pauvrete, en particulier dans les secteurs sociaux. L a preparationdu DSRP a co'incide avec
 la preparation d'un Cadre de Depenses a Moyen-Terme, (CDMT) qui traduit en termes
 budgetaires les programmes de reforme et les politiques sectoriels. Ce CDMT comprend
 des budgets-programmes sectoriels a moyen-terme qui definissent les depenses relatives A
 la mise en ceuvre des programmes et des politiques Sectoriels pour l'atteinte d'objectifs
 specifiques clairement identifies. L e DSRP et le C D M T qui l'accompagne refletent les
 priorites et l'engagement du Gouvemement A reduire la pauvretk au Benin ti moyen et long
 terme.


6.        C o m e    indique   dans    le   DSRP,      le   Gouvemement       souhaite  obtenir
progressivement l'adhesion de l'ensemble des partenaires exterieurs au developpement a
l'approche d'aide budgetaire, qui par definition, est non ciblee. Afin d'obtenir cette
adhision, le Gouvemement entend ameliorer l'efficacitk des services publics de base ainsi
que leur capacite a redpire la pauvretk. Ces deux objectifs d'amklioration des services
publics de base et l e bassage a une assistance budgetaire non ciblee requierent une
amelioration significative de la capacite de gestion de l'administration tant au niveau
central que local, ainsi qu'une plus grande responsabilisation des gestionnaires de
programmes en matiere de rksultats concrets, de transparence et de gestion financiere.

7.        C'est pourquoi le Gouvemement a demande et obtenu un premier credit d'appui a
la reduction de la pauvretk (PRSC) pour appuyer son programme de reforme dans ces
domaines et contribuer au financement de sa strategie de reduction de la pauvrete.

 8.        L e premier credit (PRSC1) a fait l'objet d'une evaluation qui a conch, a la
necessite de preparer le deuxieme credit (PRSC2). Par cette lettre, l e Gouvemement
 sollicite que ce deuxieme credit d'appui a l a reduction de la pauvrete lui soit accord6 pour
 la poursuite de son programme de reformes en w e de contribuer au succes du DSRP.

 2.      Lt programmede rCformes2005-2007

 9.       L e DSRP est structure autour de quatre grands axes stratkgiques :

      0   le renforcement du cadre macro-economique a moyen terme ;
      0   le developpement du capital humain et la gestion de l'environnement ;
      0   le renforcement de la gouvemance et des capacites institutionnelles ;
      0   l a promotion de l'emploi durable et le renforcement des capacites des pauvres a
          participer au processus de decision et de production.

  10.      L e programme appuye par le PRSC decrit ci-dessous est organise autour de ces
 mCmes axes stratkgiques.         En plus des mesures visant              a renforcer  le cadre
 macrokconomique, l'atteinte des objectifs de reduction de la pauvrete, en particulier ceux
  lies aux indicateurs sociaux, necessitera de la part du Gouvemement, un engagement
  explicite et fort concemant la mise en place d'une gestion axie sur les resultats et
  l'amtlioration de l'efficience de l'economie ainsi que l'efficacite des programmes. Par
  ailleurs, 1'Assemblee Nationale a vote l a loi de finances 2005 en autorisations de
  programme pluriannuel et affectations de paiement annuelles, qui est conforme au cadre
  de dipenses a moyen-terme 2005-2007 et aux priorites du DSRP y compris les budgets-
  programmes detailles pour l'approvisionnement en eau en milieu rural, la santC,
  l'tducation de base, l'environnement et l'assainissement urbain, l a gestion forestiere et le
  transport. D e plus, les valeurs cibles definies dans les budgets-programmes 2004 pour ces
  secteurs ont et6 largement atteintes.

   11.      L a premiere annee du programme s'est concentrke sur l'amelioration de : (i)
  l'acces B l'eau potable en milieu rural; (ii)a performance du systeme national de sante ;
                                                 l
  (iii)aqualit6del'kducationdebase; et(iv)lagestionenvironnementaleetforestiere.Sur
       l
  le plan transversal, l`accent a et6 m i s sur: (i)  la r k f o v e des depenses publiques et le
  renforcement du cadre fiduciaire ;(ii)la poursuite de la lutte contre l a corruption ; (iii)le
  renforcement du suivi-evaluation de l a strategie de reduction de l a pauvrete.

12.       Sur la base d'une evaluation des progres qui ont ete realises vers la mise en place
d'un cadre acceptable pour les budgets de performance et d'une strategie sectorielle
pertinente, la deuxieme annee du PRSC (PRSC2) couvre en plus les secteurs de lajustice,
de l'agriculture, et du transport rural. Afin de lever les obstacles au developpement du
secteur privC et amkliorer le climat des affaires, il est prkvu que le PRSC appuie le
diveloppement de cej secteur au cours de la troisieme annee de mise en e u w e du
programme. De m&md,ily sera inclus un plan d'actions de reformes administrative evou
de l a fonction publique de court et moyen termes glissant coherent avec la reforme des
finances publiques.

Axe Idu DSRP: L'accClCration de la croissance de faqon durable

13.       Les objectifs macro-economiques du programme du Benin sont de parvenir a une
croissance acceleree, condition d`une reduction significative de la pauvretk, par un
accroissement de l'investissement prive national et etranger. Ainsi, initialement la
croissance economique devrait Stre portee a 7 % en moyenne annuelle d'ici a 2006.

14.       Mais ces objectifs ont dii ttre revus pour prendre en compte les effets du
ralentissement de l'activite economique intervenu lors de la mise en euvre de la premiere
annee du PRSC (PRSC1) en 2004 caractiris6 par (i)les bameres au commerce de
reexportation du Benin introduites par le Nigeria qui a etendu de 21 a 44, la liste des
produits interdits (ii)la concurrence du Port de Lome qui s'est accrue a la suite d'une
persistance de la contre performance du Port de Cotonou (iii)une production cotonniere
inferieure aux projections et au potentiel de production expliquee par l a desorganisation de
l a commercialisation de la production et des intrants (iv) - l'appreciation de 1'Euro par
rapport au dollar americain qui a penalise l'activite Cconomique notamment industrielle.

 15.      Dans ce contexte ou les estimations provisoires de taux de croissance en 2004 ne
sont que de 2,7% contre une moyenne de 4,2% pour les deux annees precedentes et un
objectif du DSRP de 6,8 a 7%, les objectifs de croissance economique sont de 3,6%, 5,0%
 et 5 3 % respectivement en 2005, 2006 et 2007. L'objectif principal du Gouvemement sera
 de favoriser l'initiative privee en particulier dans les domaines d'activites de l'agro-
 industrie, du tourisme et de l'hbtellerie, des nouvelles technologies de l'information et de
 l a communication et du transit afin d'en faire la base de l a croissance economique. I1
 s'agira essentiellement d'amkliorer le climat des affaires en reduisant les cocts de
 transaction et de renforcer l e cadre juridique et judiciaire afin de skcuriser les
 investissements prives.

 16.      Pour accompagner la strategie de croissance reductrice de pauvrete et compte tenu
 des necessaires delais pour que se materialisent les rksultats d'une politique en faveur du

 porter le taux d'investissement public de 7'1% du PIB en 2000-2004 a 7,6% du PIB entre
 dkveloppement du secteur privi, l e Gouvemement prevoit dans un premier temps, de

 2005-2007 tandis que l'investissement prive qui Ctait autour de 12,4% du PIB sur la
 pkriode 2000-2004 serait porte a 13% en 2005-2007. Ainsi, le taux d'investissement total
 augmenterait de 1,l point de pourcentage pour s'ktablir   a 20,6%0 du P I B en 2005-2007.

  17.      MalgrC les taux de croissance attendus, le taux d'inflation serait maintenu dans la
 limite prevue par l e pacte de convergence de l'UEMOA, inferieur a trois pour cent tandis
 que le deficit de la balance courante exterieure se maintiendrait a un niveau relativement
 Cleve en raison d'un volume d`importation plus important lie a l'acceleration attendue de
 l a croissance.



                                               - 4 -


18.      L e Gouvemement considere que l'acceleration de la croissance et la reduction de
la pauvretk necessiteront dans une premiere &ape un accroissement des dkpenses
publiques dans les infrastructures Cconomiques de base et dans les secteurs sociaux. Ainsi,
les depenses totales de 1'Etat devraient representer en moyenne 21,8% du PIB sur la
periode 2005-2007 contre 20,3% en 2000-2004. Cette hausse des depenses publiques,
particulierement dans 14s secteurs de l'education, de la santk et de l'hydraulique, serait
partiellement couverte! par une augmentation des recettes totales de 1'Etat qui sont
projetkes a 17,0% du PIB en 2005-2007 grPce notamment a l a mise en euvre des mesures
visant a accroitre l'efficience du recouvrement fiscal et A rechercher des sources
alternatives de recettes. En definitive, le deficit global hors dons devrait &tre contenu      a
6,0% en moyenne sur la periode 2005-2007.

 19.     L'impact du ralentissement Cconomique observe en 2004 et qui se repercute en
2005 amplifik par les difficult& de la filiere coton auquel ilfaut ajouter la nicessaire prise
en charge par 1'Etat de certaines depenses supplementaires dont l a subvention aux
producteurs de coton et les pertes d'exploitation de la SONAPRA exigent un resserrement
de la politique budgitaire en 2005. En effet, il devrait se degager pour l'annee 2005 un
besoin de financement de 81,3 milliards de FCFA que l e Gouvemement se propose de
resorber a l'aide de trois mkthodes complementaires.

20.      L a premiere qui permettra de ramener le besoin de financement a 4 7 3 milliards
 FCFA conceme: (i)une augmentation des recettes de 14,5 milliards FCFA resultant
 d'efforts administratifs supplementaires des regies financibres ; (ii)un recours au
 financement bancaire interieur de 13,3 milliards FCFA y compris 1,3 milliards FCFA
 d'appui financier du FMI ; (iii) la cession effective des trois lots de l'outil industriel de la
 SONAPRA qui pourrait entrainer un supplement de financement de l'ordre de 6 milliards
 FCFA apres la prise en compte de frais de liquidation complementaires, tels que le plan
 social et le remboursement integral du reliquat du credit relais de l a SONAPRA que 1'Etat
 reprendra A sa charge. I1 est aussi retenu la cession du quatrieme lot aussit6t aprbs la
 resolution du contentieux entre le Gouvemement et une tierce partie.

 21,     L a deuxieme est une reduction des depenses budgetaires de 35,O milliards FCFA
 qui ramenerait le besoin de financement i12,5 milliards FCFA. Avant la mise en Ceuvre
 de cette mesure, le Gouvemement entend : (i)d'une part, revoir la justification et le
 montant des depenses supplementaires envisagees ;(ii)    d'autre part, examiner la faisabilite
 de ces reductions par rapport aux obligations et engagements pris dans le cadre de l a
 reductionde la pauvrete et avec les partenaires au developpement.

 22.      L a troisiime conceme les actions a mener, apres les efforts qui auraient et6 faits
 en matiere de reduction budgetaire, aupres de la Communaute des bailleurs de fonds pour
 financer   le besoin de financement residue1 de 12,5 milliards FCFA. Cette prospection
 pourrait Stre faite en direction, entre autres, de 1'Union EuropCenne, de l a France et de l a
 BAD quiest disposCe a considerer le decaissement d'une nouvelle tranche de 8,O milliards
 FCFApour le Beninen 2005.

 23.      Pour ce qui est des annkes 2006 et 2007, compte tenu des projections de recettes
 et de depenses mais egalement des ressources attendues de l'allbgement de l a dette
 exttrieure dans le cadre de l'initiative PPTE, le gap serait financC en partie par les appuis
 budgetaires de l a Banque Africaine de diveloppent (BAD), 1'Union EuropCenne (UE), le
 Danemark, les Pays-Bas et la Suisse qui ont signe un protocole relatif a un cadre conjoint
  de concertation au Benin, et 1'IDA. L e reliquat du GAP fera actuellement l'objet de
 requCte aupres des principaux bailleurs de fonds du Benin.

                                                - 5 -                                              9


24.       L'acckleration de la croissance Cconomique de faqon durable suppose un
developpement significatif du secteur prive au Benin qui se traduise par une augmentation
de l'investissement privk et une amelioration de la compktitivitk du secteur pnve. L a mise
en ceuvre du premier credit (PRSC1) a permis de retenir que l'atteinte de tels objectifs
passe, entre autres, par [i)le renforcement du dialogue Secteur Public/Secteur Privk ;(ii)
l'amklioration de l'env$onnement des affaires et enfin (iii) renforcement du partenariat
                                                                le
Public-PrivC pour le developpement des infrastructures.

25.       Outre la dynamisation du dialogue secteur publicisecteur prive en cours, pour
montrer son engagement au plus haut niveau en faveur du dkveloppement du secteur prive,

notamment l a Banque Mondiale, un Forum de haut niveau des Investisseurs a Cotonou a
l e Gouvemement entend organiser avec l'appui de ses partenaires au developpement

l'instar du Mali, du Senegal, du Ghana et de la Tanzanie.

26.       Par ailleurs, face aux difficultes enregistrees pour la realisation des differentes
operations de privatisation qui, du reste, demeurent essentielles pour la rkalisation de la
Strategic de Reduction de la Pauvrete du Benin, le Gouvemement est convaincu de la
nkcessite de renforcer l e partenariat public-prive pour faciliter leur poursuite dans la
transparence. Aussi, souhaite-t-il, avec l'appui des partenaires au developpement sa mise
en ceuvre dans quatre secteurs prioritaires que sont : les ttlecommunications, l'energie,
l'eau et la gestion du Port. L'objectif est de creer des conditions qui permettront aux
operateurs et aux investisseurs prives de participer sous n'importe quelle forme
(privatisation, concession, affermage) au developpement des secteurs prioritaires cites
supra.

27.       Dans tous les cas, l e Gouvemement              entend poursuivre les differentes
privatisations en cours en veillant particulikement a (i)ameliorer le cadre legal et
 institutionnel des privatisations (ii)adopter l a politique sectorielle de l'electricite (iii)
 adopter le cadre reglementaire et crker l'organe de regulation pour les secteurs de l'eau et
 de l'electricite (iv) finaliser et lancer le dossier d'appel d'offres (DAO) pour la
 privatisation de la SBEE (v) finaliser l a mise en place d'un organe de regulation des
 Telecommunications (vi) reprendre les discussions avec les partenaires sociaux l e plus
 rapidement possible sur la poursuite de l'etude de faisabilite de l'implication du secteur
 privk dans l a gestion du Port en tenant compte de l'evolution du secteur.

 28.      Dans la perspective d'acceleration de l a croissance, la filiere coton continuera de
jouer un r61e majeur (l'exportation de coton constitue en moyenne environ 80% des
 exportations hors reexportations). C'est pourquoi, la reforme du secteur (y compris
 l'achevement de la privatisationdes usines d'egrenage de la SONAPRA) qui vise in fine a
 augmenter la part du revenu de la filiere qui revient aux producteurs, sera poursuivie sur la
 periode (voir details ci-dessous).

 Secteur Agriculture

  Secteur Global

 29.      Les priorites etablies dans les diffkrents documents stratkgiques du secteur rural
  sont en parfaite adequation avec les priorites de l a stratkgie de Reduction de la Pauwete et
  constituent donc un bon cadrage pour le developpement du secteur agricole qui a
  l'adhtsion de la totalite des partenaires au developpement. D e mCme, le Gouvemement est
  conscient que les soutiens technique et financier accordes aux institutions du secteur sont

                                                - 6 -


.-

      insuffisants pour permettre la mise en place des instruments de realisation de ces
      strategies. C'est pourquoi, les budgets programmes des trois prochaines annees vont donc
      supporter l'instrumentalisation de ces strategies.

      30.      Ainsi, pour ameliorer la gestion globale du secteur, les reorganisations
      institutionnelles ont et4 engagees par l e Gouvemement afin de permettre au secteur
      agricole de jouer veritadlement son r81e de moteur de la croissance. Ainsi, avec l'objectif
      de mieux cibler les investissements publics afin de dynamiser les initiatives privees et
      repondre aux prioritts du DSRP, unbudget programme sptcifique a egalement CtC finalise
      avec l'appui de la FAOMEPAD pour soutenir les directions des peches, de 1'Elevage et
      celle du genie rural dans la preparation participative et dkcentralisee de trois programmes
      d'investissement prioritaires.

      31.      D'une gestion a travers plus de 60 projets, le MAEP s'est organise en 13 grandes
      fonctions qui supporteront disormais l a mise en ceuvre du Cadre de Depenses a Moyen
      Termes. L e Budget Programme 2005 visera en premier lieu la consolidation et la
      rationalisation des instruments de gestion du secteur au niveau central et deconcentrk. D e
      ce fait, il a et6 retenu de se focaliser sur l a consolidation et la rationalisation des
      instruments du secteur agricole tant au niveau central que regional. Cette demarche a
      permis tres precisement de finaliser les programmes et budgets de l a Direction des
       Ressources Financikres (DRF), la Direction des Ressources Humaines (DRH), la Direction
       de l a Programmation et de la Prospective (DPP) avec son nouveau service de suivi
       evaluation et le renforcement de son service des statistiques agricoles, l'installation des
       Centres Regionaux de Promotion Agricole (CERPA) et de leur demembrement au niveau
       des communes (CECPA).

       32.      . Au total, le Gouvemement est convaincu que la gestion du secteur agricole sera le
       fait de quatre partenaires indissociables : l e secteur public a travers l e Ministtre de
       l'Agriculture, de 1'Elevage et de la Pcche, l e secteur prive, les elus au niveau local,
       regional et national ainsi que les organisations professionnelles agricoles (OP). Les OP
       ayant apparu cornme un maillon faible et insuffisamment soutenues ces demieres annees,
       unbudget programme spkcifique visant      a developper une meilleure reprtsentativite et une
       meilleure gestion a et6 conGu. A l'appui, les responsables du niveau dtconcentre du
       M A E P ont et6 nommes. Par ailleurs, le Gouvemement entend poursuivre la liberalisation
       de la filiere coton et s'engage a privatiser l'outil industriel de la SONAPRA comme prCvu
       par l a cession des quatre lots comme indique au paragraphe 20.

       Sous-secteur du coton

       33.      L'objectif primordial du Gouvemement est de restaurer et de perenniser le
       caractere de filiere inttgrie dans un contexte de gestion privee. C'est pourquoi, 1'Etat a (i)
       mis en place un mecanisme opposable a tous les acteurs pour l'importation et la
       distribution des intrants pour la campagne 2005-2006 ;(ii)       adopt6 un mkcanisme unique
       de commercialisation du coton graine pour l a campagne 2004-2005 utilisant les structures
       existantes comprenant Cgreneurs, producteurs, distributeurs et Etat ; (iii)adopt6 un
       nouveau cadre reglementaire rkgissant l e fonctionnement de la filikre ;et (iv) m i s en place
       unnouveau cadre de regulation de la filikre qui favorise la concurrence.

       34.      D e mCme, il entend encourager l'klaboration et l'adoption par l'interprofession,
       d'un mecanisme incitatif enfonction de l a productivite rtelle et des prix aux egreneurs et
        aux producteurs qui soit transparent et automatique, tout en permettant des prix flexibles.
        Ce mecanisme serait la condition sine qua non d'un mecanisme de soutien a la filiere et


                                                      - I -                                           9-


inclurait une possible charge ou provision qui alimenterait un fonds de soutien en cas de
depassement d'un certain niveau par les prix intemationaux et un possible transfert du
fonds de soutien dans les cas conjoncturels oh les prix intemationaux tomberaient en
dessous d'un seuil convenu.

35.     Dans la perspective du dksengagement de 1'Etat de la SONAPR4 a travers la
cession des usines dkgrenage, le Gouvemement s'engage des l'achevement de la
campagne cotonniere 2004-2005, a reprendre le processus de l'opkration de cession en
cours. A cet effet, le Gouvemement reprendra contact officiellement avec les
adjudicataires provisoires des trois lots au plus tard, le 16 mai 2005. Notification de cette
reprise sera faite aux partenaires techniques et financiers du secteur. Par lettre officielle
aux adjudicataires, la volonte du Gouvemement a ceder les lots leur sera confirmee. Les
adjudicataires auront une semaine h compter de la date de l'accusb de reception pour
confirmer leur engagement pris quant a la reprise de ces lots. L e transfert des trois lots
interviendra apres les negociations (qui comprend l'accord dkfinitif sur le plan social) avec
les adjudicataires et l e reglement effectif des outils cedes au plus tard l e 31 octobre 2005.
Encas de rkponse negative d'un ou de plusieurs adjudicataires, le Gouvemement s'engage
a relancer immediatement le processus de privatisation en consultation avec les partenaires
techniques et financiers. Quant au demier lot (lot 3), les dispositions seront prises par le
 Gouvemement pour que la cession puisse intervenir d'ici le 30 novembre 2005, sous
reserve des actions judiciaires intentees par l'adjudicataire provisoire, En tout etat de
 cause, le processus de cession du demier lot (lot 3) interviendra a la suite du denouement
 des actions judiciaires intentees par l'adjudicataire provisoire de ce lot.


 36.     Par ailleurs, en tant que source importante de croissance, l e Gouvemement aprts
 une reorganisation de la gestion globale du secteur agncole, entend (i)      finaliser de faqon
 participative et adopter une structure nationale des services agricoles (ii)finaliser avec le
 secteur prive un programme d'appui au developpement de trois (03) nouvelles filieres a
 savoir : l'anacarde, l e karite et la Peche.

 37.     Au total, le Gouvemement, convaincu que seul la mise en euvre d'un programme
 intkgre du secteur prive peut creer les conditions d'un reel developpement, s'est engage a
 realiser les etudes et activitks suivantes (i)finaliser 1'Ctude sur l a compttitivitk de
 l'economie bkninoise et 1'Ctude-diagnostic sur le commerce intkgre en cours (ii)       accelkrer
 le demarrage de l'enqutte sur le climat des investissements et l'etude sur les sources de
 croissance (tourisme, ago-industrie et fonction de transit). (iii)realiser l a synthese de
 toutes les ktudes suscitkes en se concentrant sur la nicessaire reforme de la titrisation
 fonciere et permettre l'elaboration d'une nouvelle strategie pour chacun de ces domaines.



 Transport rural

 38.     L'objectif poursuivi dans ce secteur vise a ameliorer les transports dans les milieux
 ruraux en vue d'accroitre l'acces des communautes rurales aux services sociaux de base,
 aux marches et aux zones de production.             L a note de strategie de Transport Rural
 recemment finaliske servira de cadre de reference au programme de transport rural pour
 2005. L'objectif physique retenu pour cette annee est de rendre 950 km de pistes rurales
 praticables d'ici a 2005. D a m ce cadre, les zones gkographiques devant beneficier de ces

 pauvrete. .Ainsi, le secteur pourra disposer B moyen terme d'une STR h finaliser en 2005,
 investissements pnoritaires ont ete identiflees sur la base de crititres d'accessibilite et de



                                                - 8 -


d'un programme pluriannuel d'investissements et d'entretien en matiire de transport rural
et d'un cadre institutionnel de mise en euvre de cette strategie qui servira a l'elaboration
des budgets programmes des 2006.

39.     Dans ce cadre, des l'annke 2005, le Gouvernement devra (i)adopter la STR et le
programme pluriannuel Y'investissement et d'entretien des pistes rurales (ii)elaborer les
nouveaux textes definidsant le cadre institutionnel de mise en euvre de l a STR, (iii)
rkaliser 1'Ctude sur les moyens intermediaires de transport en milieurural.

Axe I1du DSRP :L'amblioration des services de base et la gestion durable des
ressources naturelles

40.     L'accelkration durable de la croissance et la reduction de la pauvrete ne sauraient
&@eobtenues sans le dkveloppement du capital humain et la gestion durable des ressources
naturelles. En effet, parmi les principales causes de la pauvretk identifikes au Benin, les
difficultes d'acces A l'eau potable, aux soins de santk primaire, a l'kducation de base et a
l'alphabetisation. sont les plus importantes et constituent la priorite des trois prochaines
annkes. L'amelioration de l'offre, de l'utilisation et de la qualit6 de ces services et de
faqon specifique, la lutte contre le VIHiSIDA et le paludisme constituent les objectifs
prioritaires de ce volet de la stratkgie.

Ame`lioration de l'Acc2s a I'Eau Potable en Milieu Rural

41.      L a mise en Oeuvre de la strategie d'assainissement et de developpement du secteur
de l'eau et de l'assainissement en milieu rural (PADEAR) au cours de la demiere decennie
s'est traduite par des progres substantiels dans ce domaine. Cependant, sur la base des
principaux obstacles au developpement du secteur identifies que sont : (i)la faible
viabilite des services ; (ii)l'insuffisance des capacites nationales en ressources financitres
 et (iii)l'inadequation des mecanismes de contr6le et d'evaluation, le Gouvemement a fait
 siennes les recommandations faites dans le cadre de la revue annuelle conjointe avec
 l'ensemble des partenaires du secteur pour l'klaboration du Budget Programme 2005-2007
 de la Direction de 1'Hydraulique.

 42.     Ainsi, la revue de la mise en euvre du programme 2004 a permis d'Ctre optimiste
 dans l'atteinte des OMD, ce qu'il y a peu de temps encore, paraissait tres improbable dans
 l'hydraulique. En effet, le secteur est en passe de doubler sa capacite de creation de points
 d'eau entre 2002 et 2004. Pour la premiere fois, en terme de creation de point d'eau grdce

 depasse. L'amelioration de la planification et de l'execution budgetaire combinkes a la
 aux performances de 2004, le seuil des 1200 equivalents points d'eau par an devrait &tre

 volonte d'atteindre les objectifs du millenaire pour le developpement (OMD) couplee avec
 un soutien accru      fort de plusieurs bailleurs de fonds a Cree cette dynamique pour
 ameliorer et rechercher la performance du secteur.

 43.     Pour une gestion plus efficiente du sous-secteur, le budget-programme 2005-2007
 met l'accent sur (i)

44.     Dans ce contexte, l'objectif vise par le programme de ce sous-secteur est
d'accroitre le taux de desserte en eau potable de 38% en 2004 a 43% en 2006 et 45% en
2007 en realisant sur la periode (2005-2007) environ 2950 nouveaux points d'eau et la
rehabilitation de 630 anciens points d'eau. Au moins 80% des points d'eau seront
fonctionnels en 2006.

45.     Dans l a persp ctive de mieux apprehender les problemes de maintenance et de
                        I
gestion des points d'eau, la strategie d'approvisionnement en eau potable en milieu rural a
CtC validCe au cours d'un atelier et adoptee en conseil des Ministres ; elle precise les
orientations strategiques concemant la professionnalisation de la.gestion des AEV au
travers de partenariat public privC de mCme que les modalitts de maintenance et de remise
enfonction concemant les 2000 pompes en panne.




46.
s'inspirent a l a fois du DSRP, les Objectifs du millCnaire pour le DCveloppement (OMDs)
        Dans l'ensemble, les programmes du secteur gagnent progressivement en qualite et

et des Politiques et strategies nationales de developpement socio-sanitaire pour l a pCriode
2002-2006. Notamment, des efforts sont foumis pour reduire la mortalite infantile,
matemelle et pour lutter contre les principales maladies que sont le paludisme, la
tuberculose et l e VIHISIDA. De nombreuses initiatives sont prises dans le sens de la
protection des plus pauvres par rapport A leur accts aux services de santi de qualite.

47.     Ainsi, le Gouvemement est convaincu qu'il aura a relever les principaux defis ci-
aprks : (i)l'identification et la mise en auvre des interventions en faveur des plus pauvres
retenue c o m e action prkalable a Ctt realiste (ii)la question recurrente des ressources
humaines en quantitk et en qualite ainsi que leur ripartition adCquate sur le temtoire
national la problematique de la motivation du personnel (iii)la piremite des acquis

 48.    A cet effet, entre autres choses en 2004, une mtthodologie d'allocation des
 ressources a CtC mise au point sur la base de criteres de pauvrete et de l a performance des
 services sanitaires et a servi de base pour l a preparation du budget-programme 2005.
 Aussi, un paquet      Ctendu de services sanitaires a-t-il CtC identifie et sera foumi aux
 familles dans les dix districts sanitaires      ciblees au   cours de l a premiere annee du
 programme.      Des efforts vont se poursuivre au cows de l'annie 2005 pour amCliorer
 l'accessibilite et la qualite des interventions dans l e secteur, y compris la mise en auvre
 effective des mkcanismes rkcemment adopt& de financement des services pour les
 pauvres dans les zones ciblkes.


 Education de Base

 49.     Des progres s'observent dam l'amklioration de l'accbs des populations a
 l'education et notamment 1'Cducation de base, mCme s i 1'amClioration de l a qualite et la
 riduction des disparites demeurent des dCfis importants A lever au cours des annCes a
 venir. L e Gouvemement s'engage a poursuivre les efforts invites en 2004 pour amkliorer
 l'accessibilite, les apprentissages et la qualite de l'education de base, d'une part, et a
 renforcer l'efficacite des prestations et de l a gestion des services dans l'enseignement de

      base, d'autre part. A cet effet, les objectifs essentiels suivants seraient poursuivis d'ici
      2006 : (i) un taux d'achkvement des filles de 34% en 2001/02 a 41% ;(ii)la reduction du
      taux moyen de redoublement au primaire de 20% en 2001/02 A 15% en 2005/2006; (iii)          le
      ratio de disponibilite des livres (mathematiques et lecture) atteint un livre par elkve ;(v) le
      pourcentage des enfants en situation de discontinuite educative est reduit de 10'5% A 5'5%
      sur la mCme periode.      Ij
      50.      L'atteinte de ces objectifs s'appuiera sur les avanckes faites en 2004 et notamment
      en termes de ;(i)mise en aeuvre des deux plans d'actions adapt& en 2003 pour ameliorer
      l'execution de l a reforme pedagogique et l a retention des Clbves a.l'Ccole, y compris la
      preparation d'un rapport d'execution sur l a suppression du redoublement au CPI; la
      preparation d'un programme de construction d'au moins cinquante salles de classes iiCtre
      finance sur le budget 2005 pour reduire l a discontinuite dans les zones geographiques
      cibles (ii)le recrutement de 1183 enseignants contractuels et le deploiement du
      personnel qui ont contribue a ameliorer l a repartition regionale des enseignants; et (iii)la
      reduction du coQt de la scolarisation aux populations pauvres. Par ailleurs, 70% au moins
      des programmes cibles ont ete realises et la liste des Ccoles qui beneficieront des
      programmes d'intervention ciblks a ete preparee.

       51.     Au plan stratkgique, les efforts porteront sur les deux axes retenus en 2004 et
       concement notamment : (i)le renforcement et la mise en Oeuvre du programme de
       scolarisation des filles cible sur les 19 communes a faibles taux de scolarisation des filles
       (taux inferieur a 60%) et la protection de la jeunes fille et, ce avec une forte implication
       d'ONGs et autres associations ;(ii)   le renforcement de l'execution du plan d'action relatif
       a la mise en ceuvre de la refonne pedagogique, y compris la definition et l a mise en ceuvre
       progressive de la nouvelle strategic de formation initiale des enseignants du primaire ;(iii)
       le renforcement de l'execution du plan d'action visant a accroitre le niveau de l'effcacite
       interne et de la retention du systeme en accordant une attention au phenomkne de
       redoublement et de discontinuite educative ; (iv) la poursuite du             programme de
       recrutement dicentralise et sur poste du personnel enseignant additionnel (environ 1000 en
       2004/2005) et celui de redeploiement du personnel en place ; et (v) l a consolidation de
       l'experience d'octroi de subvention aux communautes pour pennettre l a prise en charge
       des salaires des enseignants communautaires exerqant dans le systeme.

       52.     L e Gouvemement envisage aussi de finaliser d'ici 21 novembre 2005 les travaux en
       cours pour l'adoption d'une politique sectorielle integree ainsi que l a preparation d'un
       programme decennal de developpement du secteur.



       Environnement et Assainissement en Milieu Urbain

        53.    D'importants progrbs ont Cte realises dans la mise en Deuvre du Programme
       National de Gestion de 1'Environnement (PNGE) dont l'execution a demane en 2 0 0 2 .
        Ces progrbs qui confirment le r81e clC que joue ce programme dans l a mise en ceuvre du
        plan strategique A moyen terme (2002-2006) du Ministkre de l'Environnement, de
        1'Habitat et de 1'Urbanisme (MEHU) traduisent l a volontt politique du Gouvemement A
        l'appuyer. Ces investissements correspondent aux objectifs du DSRP et aux objectifs de
        developpement du millenaire tant dans leur orientation anti-pauvrete que d a m l a poursuite
        d'un developpement durable. L a programmation actuelle des investissements du PNGE
        qui doivent se poursuivre, comporte trois axes principaux: (i) outils de gestion de
                                                                             les
        l'environnement ;(ii)  la gestion environnementale urbaine ;(iii) activitks relatives 6 l a
                                                                            les
        mise en ceuwe des conventions intemationales sur l'environnement.

54.     Les mtmes progres ont ete constates du c6tC des activites d'appui A la gestion
urbaine. En effet, l'exkcution de tous les programmes est conforme aux contenus des
contrats de performance (ressources, activites et cibles) signes entre les gestionnaires de
programmes et leurs superviseurs. L'allocation des ressources du budget 2006 sera baske
sur la performance enyiference au contrat de performance adopt&en 2005.
                        I
Gestion des For& et des Terroirs Riverains

55.      L e Gouvemement est convaincu que la gestion durable des for&        classees et des
terroirs riverains est une composante importante de la strattgie de reduction de la
pauvrete. L a gestion rationnelle des ressources naturelles devrait permettre d'inverser a
terme le processus de degradation du patrimoine forestier national dont dependent les
populations en milieu rural pour leur subsistance. L'option retenue a cet effet est la mise
en euvre des mecanismes visant une responsabilisation accrue des communautes a la base
et la promotion des activitks lucratives alternatives    l'exploitation anarchique des for&
L e Programme de Gestion des ForCts et des Terroirs Riverains (PGFTR) vise
essentiellement l a gestion durable de 22 massifs forestiers et comporte trois composantes
que sont : (i)l'appui institutionnel et le renforcement des capacitks ; (ii)  l'amenagement
participatif des for& et terroirs riverains; et (iii)
                                                    l a gestion durable du bois energie et des
impacts environnementaux.

56.      Enfin, ce programme vise a mettre en euvre le plan d'action ci-apres, (i)mettre en
place un rCgime fiscal favorable pour le bois de feu et le charbon produits par une fori3
placee sous gestion ; (ii)achever la privatisation de la branche industrielle de l'Office
National du Bois (ONAB) ;et (iii)poursuivre l'extcution des plans participatifs de gestion
des fortts. I1 s'agira egalement d'etendre la gestion communautaire des ressources
forestieres a 7 fortts classees et a 2 terroirs riverains et d'ameliorer les techniques de
production et d'exploitation des fortts et de promouvoir des activites alternatives
generatrices de revenus (au total 12 forCts classkes seront couvertes en 2005).

Axe I11du DSRP :L'amilioration ainsi que le renforcement de la gouvernance et des
 capacitks institutionnelles

Secteur judiciaire

 57.     Un des objectifs fondamentaux du DSRP est l'amelioration du fonctionnement de
 l'efficacite et de l'accb au systeme juridique et judiciaire. Aussi, le Programme Inttgre de
 Renforcement des Systemes Juridique et Judiciaire du Benin, qui a Cte approuvt par les
 bailleurs de fonds, puis officiellement adopte par le Gouvemement en 2001, constitue la
 strategic du Gouvemement pour son programme de reformejuridique et judiciaire pour les
 dix ans a venir.

 58.     En 2004, le Gouvemement a Clabore le plan d'operationnalisation 2005/2007 du
 Programme Integre, a prepare un Budget Programme 2005-2007 pour l e Ministere de la
 Justice, de l a Legislation et des Droits de l'Homme, qui reflete notamment le contenu du
 plan d'operationnalisation 2005/2007 du Programme Integre, et a mis en place un
 dispositif de suivi de la mise en oeuvre du Budget-Programme . L e Gouvemement a par
 ailleurs fait approuver l e plan d'operationnalisation 2005/2007 du Programme IntegrC par
 le Comite National de Suivi charge de piloter l e Programme IntCgrC.

 59.     Pour une mise en euvre de ce Programme IntegrC dans les meilleures conditions
 au cours de l'annte 2005, le Gouvemement a procede en 2004 au recrutement de 28

                                                                                                i


magistrats et 29 greffiers supplementaires. D e mCme, depuis septembre 2004,               le
Gouvemement applique certains des decrets du 6 avril 2004 relatifs a la remuneration des
magistrats (ceux relatifs    (i)l'indemnitt delogement;(ii)l'indemnitedebiblioth2queet
de recherche ;et (iii) l'indemnite dejudicature et la prime de qualification) .

60.     Pour 2005, le Gpuvemement entend rkaliser l'ensemble des actions prevues pour
cette annCe-lh dans l e d a n d'operationnalisation 2005-2007 du Programme IntCgrC et dans
le Budget-Programme 2005-2007 du Ministere de l a Justice, de l a Legislation et des Droits
de 1'Homme. En particulier, le Gouvemement veillera A la bonne execution des activites
de renforcement des capacites du Ministerede la Justice, de la Legislation et des Droits de
1'Homme necessaires a la bonne realisation des reformes, et des activites qui permettront
d'ameliorer la performance des tribunaux. En 2005, les actions suivantes seront
notamment rCalisCes : (i)    mise en place des conditions indispensables a l'execution des
reformes prevues dans le Programme IntCgre, y compris l'etablissement d'un systeme de
collecte et de gestion des informations relatives au secteur de l a justice ; (ii)execution
d'un audit du Ministere de la Justice, de la Legislation et des Droits de 1'Homme ; (iii)
mise en place d'un systeme de suivi et evaluation performant au sein du Ministere de l a
Justice, de la Legislation et des Droits de 1'Homme ;(iv) preparation et debut d'execution
d'un programme de formation continue (qui couvrira notamment les actes uniformes de
1'OHADA) destine aux magistrats et au personnel du Ministere de la Justice, de la
Legislation et des Droits de 1'Homme ;(v) acquisition d'kquipements pour le Ministere de
la Justice, de la Legislation et des Droits de 1'Homme et pour les cours et tribunaux ; et
(vi) creation effective d'un Centre d'Information Juridique et Judiciaire. Enfin, en 2005, le
Gouvemement entend appliquer l'ensemble des decrets du 6 awil 2004 relatifs a la
remuneration des magistrats, et recruter 40 magistrats et 30 greffiers supplementaires.

 Reforme budgetake

 61.    Dans l e but d'accroitre effectivement l'efficacite des depenses dans un cadre de
 gestion transparente, le Gouvemement du Benin est resolu a poursuivre la reforme
 entreprise en profondeur de son systeme budgetaire qui visait a (i)introduire une gestion
 budgetaire axee sur l a performance via les budgets-programmes clairement dtfinis et
 coherents avec un cadre de depenses a moyen terme ; (ii)deleguer la responsabilite de
 gestion de depenses publiques du ministere des finances et de 1'Economie et du Ministere
 charge du Plan vers les ministeres sectoriels et finalement vers les niveaux deconcentrks
 de l'administration dans un cadre fiduciaire renforce (Gestion budgktaire saine) ; (iii)
 rationaliser et informatiser l e circuit de la depense.

 62.     Depuis le debut de cette reforme budgetaire, des progres remarquables ont ete
 accomplis dans le domaine de la formulation, de l'execution du budget et de la production
 de rapports grace a la conduite des rkformes institutionnelles cles et ti un effort intense
 visant le renforcement des capacites. Tout ceci, grace aux efforts des partenaires au
 diveloppement dont l a Banque Mondiale par ses instruments PERAC et PRSC. D e meme
 des dispositions ont et6 prises pour ameliorer l a fiabilite de l'execution budgetake en : (i)
 limitant le recours aux procedures exceptionnelles (ii)       accelerant la regularisation des
 avances faites aux rCgies (iii)    Cvitant la generation de nouveaux impayes sur les marches
 publics (iv) assurant l a sincerite des engagements (v) proctdant au rattrapage de la
 comptabilitb.

 63.     Par ailleurs, le Gouvemement entend poursuivre l a reforme des depenses publiques
 en 2005-07 a travers entre autres : (i)la mise en Ceuvre du plan d'actions decoulant de
 l'evaluation independante des depenses non regularisees et de l a qualite comptable de
 celles-ci.; (ii)une organisation de services qui pemette une regularisation             et une
                                                 -13-


imputation au budget national de depenses payees sans ordonnancement prealable au mois
le mois ; (iii) la poursuite des efforts d'apurement des regies ; (iv) I'octroi d'avances aux
rtgisseurs dans les cas strictement prevus rkglementairement et seulement apres
justification et ordonnancement de l'avance prkcedente ; (v) la recherche d'une solution,
en concertation avec les organes de contrble, pour apurer les regies anciennes et solder les
comptes ; (vi) la mise    4 jour du recensement  des engagements juridiques non enregistres
dans le SIGFIP (depedses engagkesjuridiquement) y compris les factures parvenues non
ordonnancees faute de credit ou en credits de paiement ;(vii) le renforcement du contrde
des engagements sur le ministere des travaux publics ou les ministeres susceptibles de
gCnCrer des amCrCs ; (viii) le renforcement des capacitks du Trksor Public (qualit6 des
ressources humaines et materielles, conditions de travail) et la mise en auvre des mesures
 specifiques devant permettre la centralisation au TrCsor Public des ressources sans pour
 autant compromettre l'execution des projets.

 Gestion Axe`e sur les Re`sultats.

 64.     En outre, le Gouvemement continuera avec la mise en place des budgets-
 programmes, le suivi de la performance de l a reddition de comptes et l'evaluation des
 programmes afin de realiser les objectifs d'instauration progressive au sein de
 l'administration publique d'une gestion axee sur les resultats. Afin de mettre en euvre ces
 pratiques de gestion au niveau des ministkres, l e Gouvemement a : (i)prepare un projet
 de lettre de politique de developpement de cette reforme (gestion axte sur les resultats) et
 un plan operationnel de sa mise en euvre ;(ii)amorce des 2004 les actions requises pour
 assurer une gestion axee sur les resultats dans un certain nombre de sous-programmes en
 2005 dans cinq ministkes (MFE, MMEH, MEPS, MSP, MEHU).

 65.      Pour ce faire, le Gouvemement a exprime sa volonte politique de rtaliser cette
 reforme et d'appuyer les efforts des Cquipes techniques par un protocole d'engagement
 que le Ministre des Finances a signe avec chaque ministre sectoriel pour chaque sous-
 programme identifie qui couvre la ptriode 2005-2007. Ce protocole d'engagement est
 conforme au budget 2005 et delegue les credits fongibles de fonctionnement et
  d'investissement ainsi que l'autorisation de depense au gestionnaire responsable de sous-
  programme. L a poursuite du programme et l'approbation du budget 2007 dependront des
  resultats atteints en 2005.

  66.     Dans ce cadre, compte tenu des difficultis auxquelles font face les ministeres dans
  la mise en euvre d'une pratique de suivi des performances, l'appui apporte par l a mise en
  place d'une assistance technique multi-sectorielle de longue duke pour les ministeres
  impliques dans l a reforme budgetaire, ainsi que des assistances techniques ponctuelles sur
  demande s'averent necessaires a mettre en place. L a gestion de 1'Equipe Technique
  d'Appui a la Reforme Budgetaire (ETARB) sera renforcee sur la base des resultats de
  l'evaluation externe et du plan d'action qui en decoule.

  L a Reforme de l a Passation des Marches Publics

  67.     Dans le cadre de l'amelioration du cadre fiduciaire, les differentes reformes
  entreprises par l e Gouvemement au niveau de l a passation des marches publics ont permis
  par la mise en place d'un nouveau cadre institutionnel-dans ce domaine (i)       d'accroitre l a
  transparence et l'efficacite des passations de marches (ii) de moderniser les procedures de
  passation des marches ;(iii)   de mettre en place un systeme de contr6le independant afin de
  reduire la corruption dans les marches publics. L a mesure prkalable visant h rendre


                                                -14-


operationnelle la nouvelle commission nationale de regulation des marches publics a ete
effective.

68.     Avec un certain retard, le nouveau cadre institutionnel se met progressivement en
place. Ainsi, l e Gouvemement a dabore, les programmes d'activites chiffrks pour 2005 et
2006, y compris le budget de fonctionnement et d'kquipement des principales structures
du cadre institutionned notamment la CNRMP, la DNMP et les CPMP des dix (10)
ministeres pilotes. L'objectif pour 2005 sera d'ameliorer la fonctionnalitk du nouveau
dispositif et l a realisation duprogramme d'activites et d'avancer les travaux de refonte du
code des march& publics.

L a Reforme et l a Rationalisationdu ContrBle et de 1'Audit Inteme

69.      L a reforme budgetaire en cours et, B plus forte raison, la mise en ceuvre d'une
gestion axee sur les resultats, appellent a une transformation de la fonction de contrBle
inteme au sein de l'administration publique. Dans un tel contexte, la fonction de contr6le
inteme doit adapter son organisation et ses mtthodes afin d'appuyer la performance des
programmes du Gouvemement, tout en agissant de fayon A minimiser les risques de
mauvaise gestion. S'il est vrai que cette reforme sous le leadership de 1'IGF de faqon
globale se dtroule tel que prim, ilconvient de remarquer que des retards substantiels sont
observes au niveau d'importantes &tapes.

70.     Dans ce contexte, outre l'appui institutionnel qui est recherche par le
Gouvemement aupres des partenaires au developpement pour les corps de contrBle, un
appui technique sera recherche a 1'Inspection Generale des Finances pour la conduite de
cette reforme si importante dans un contexte de gestion axee sur les resultats.

 71.    C'est pourquoi, le Gouvemement envisage fermement (i)de preparer pour 2005
un plan de formation au contr6le et        l'audit inteme pour le personnel professionnel de
 contr6le dans l'administration ;(ii)I'adoption en 2005 en conseil des ministres d'un dicret
 portant organisation et attributions du contr6le inteme dans les ministeres et a competence
 nationale, et definissant les normes et standards

 Le Renforcement de I'Audit Externe

 72.     D e mzme, le Gouvemement entend poursuivre le renforcement de l'audit exteme a
 travers (i) realisation, par la Chambre des Comptes, d'audits de performance portant sur
            la
 l'execution des budgets-programmes 2002, 2003, 2004 sur la base des rapports de
 performance des ministkres participant au PRSC ;(ii)l a creation de la Cour des Comptes
 duBenin.

 73.     L a Chambre des Comptes poursuivra son developpement en accord avec l e
 protocole d'engagement 2003, meme si le recrutement de ressources additionnelles est
 report6 en 2005. L e Gouvemement s'engage        a  renforcer les diligences necessaires afin
 que la Chambre des Comptes soit effectivement transfoxmee en Cour des Comptes. Par
 ailleurs, ilsera soumis le plus rapidement possible B I'AssemblCe Nationale les projets de
 loi de rbglement 2001 et 2002 ainsi que les rapports d'audit de performance 2002 pour les
 ministeres impliques dans la reforme budgetaire appuyCe par le PERAC. D e meme ily a
 lieu de soumettre a la Chambre des Comptes, au plus tard a fin novembre 2004, les
 comptes Gouvemementaux 2003. Enfin, ilfaudrait envisager de soumettre dans des delais
 raisonnables a 1'Assemblee Nationale les rapports d'audit de performance 2003 pour les
 huitministkes PERAC.


                                               -15 -


74.     Pour mener ces activites qui necessitent un renforcement des capacitks de la
Chambre des Comptes, les moyens necessaires seront mobilises pour lui permettre d'une
part de poursuivre le dkveloppement de ses capacites au chapitre d'audit de performance,
d'autre part d'actualiser ses mkthodes de verification et de consolider ses acquis. Ainsi,
elle pourra renforcer son autonomie et son indkpendance qui sont les gages de son
efficacite.              /1
L a rkforme administrative et la rkforme de la Fonction Publique

75.     L'introduction de la gestion axte sur les resultats necessite la mise en place de
structures administratives plus souples et une politique de gestion des ressources humaines
dans l'administration publique, en particulier le developpement de la remuneration selon
le rendement et la mise en place d'une decentralisation de l a responsabilite en matiere de
recrutement et de gestion du personnel. Cependant, il faut une reforme administrative
approprike bade sur la performance, une clarification du cadre juridique, des missions et
des responsabilites des fonctionnaires avec c o m e toile de fond, une fonction publique
competente, integre, performante, politiquement neutre et objectivement impartiale, afin
de rendre au public des services de qualite.

76.     Quant a la reforme de l a gestion des ressources humaines, elle vise notamment
l'adequation profiliposte, la durabilite aux postes des fonctionnaires competents commis a
la gestion et a l'evaluation des programmes. Ainsi, les gestionnaires de programmes
devraient pouvoir definir les moyens qui leurs sont necessaires en fonction des objectifs
bien precis ; cela facilitera l'arbitrage entre les objectifs et les moyens a mettre en aeuvre
pour le succis de leurs programmes.

77.     Le Gouvemement est convaincu que la priorite et le naud de la reforme resident
dans la refonte des statuts des agents de 1'Etat afin qu'ils soient compatibles avec les
 exigences de la gestion axee sur les rksultats. Dans cette optique, ilentend elaborer un plan
 de communication en vue de l'adhksion de tous les partenaires notamment les partenaires
 sociaux au nouveau mode de gestion axie sur les resultats. Car si cette refonte aboutit, elle
 permettra d'une part la definition d'une politique salariale motivante par la connaissance
 du merite et de la performance et d'un nouveau systime de gestion de la camere et de
 remuneration des personnels de l'Etat, d'autre part la mise en e u x e d'une politique
 adequate de recrutement.

 78.     C'est pourquoi, apres la mise en place du fichier unique de reference qui permet de
 connaitre exactement les effectifs des fonctionnaires payes, de mieux gkrer le personnel de
 1'Etat et de limiter l'introduction d'actes de nomination ou d'avancement frauduleux dans
 le circuit, le Gouvemement a en 2004 (i)delkgue par dkcret l a gestion des actes
 administratifs au personnel du Ministre charge de la Fonction Publique aux ministeres en
 charge de 1'Education;       (ii)mis en place un cadre technique d'integration et de
 coordination des rkformes administratives compose des Secretaires GenCraux des
 Ministeres.

 79.     Globalement, pour gerer les ressources humaines en coherence avec l a gestion des

humaines professionnelles a plein temps ; (ii)mettre en place des cadres de mesure de
performance et (iii)mettre en auvre le programme de renforcement de capacites de suivi
des performances et d'tvaluation des programmes.

programme appuyC par le PRSC a d'autres programmes sera base sur les progrbs realisis
dans l a prkparation de ces secteurs, en particulier sur la mise en ceuvre des mesures et
actions prevues et retenues lors de 1'Cvaluation du PRSC2.
