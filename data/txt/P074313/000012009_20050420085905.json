The\n            potential adverse environmental and social effects are\n            associated mainly with the rural/semi-urban water supply\n            activities, the health sector interventions, the investment\n            in rural roads, the implementation of the forest management\n            schemes, and the intensification of agricultural production,\n            including cotton production. While the drilling of wells may\n            only have minimal adverse impact on the physical\n            environment, the use of water sources and the maintenance of\n            their surroundings could generate environmental effects\n            stemming from the lack of adequate hygiene and the spread of\n            water-borne disease. The mismanagement and inadequate\n            disposal of medical and biomedical wastes are also the\n            source of substantial public health risks.
