satisfactory, risk to the development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also rated satisfactory. Ratings\n            for the Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project\n            (PRSC II) for Benin are as follows: outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to the development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was rated moderately satisfactory. Ratings for\n            the Third Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project (PRSC\n            III) for Benin are as follows: outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to the development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was rated moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) selectivity and simplicity of the\n            design are essential to the success of the operation.\n            Obstacles due to administrative resistance to change, as\n            well as due to lack of capacity cannot be underestimated. It\n            is better to start with a very selective matrix and enlarge\n            progressively, building on success in some components. There\n            is also a need to be realistic about the scope and pace of\n            reform; 2) it is important to properly align the PRSC with\n            budget management, so that the priority components of the\n            PRSC and the performance budgets of those ministries are\n            supportive of each other. It is also important that budget\n            support be phased with the budget cycle, in order to\n            properly impact on budget composition, and to provide budget\n            support in a timely manner; 3) the effectiveness of the\n            PRSCs in supporting sector reforms can be highly increased\n            by using a sector wide approach, as was successfully\n            experienced in rural water supply. The approach federated\n            donors around the government's objectives and allowed a\n            mix of central government programs, decentralized programs,\n            budget support and projects to combine efficiently; and 4)\n            PRSCs (I-III) rightly focused on the critical areas of\n            governance and basic service delivery. Future PRSCs need to\n            deepen support in the areas of reforms where progress has\n            been slow and focus on critical bottlenecks rather than\n            broadening the areas of support to new areas."}, "docdt": "2008-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
