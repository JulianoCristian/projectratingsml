Project Description:         The project aims at increasing production,
productivity and energy efficiency in selected
fertilizer facilities in Turkey through energy
saving, rehabilitation and rationalization
investments supported by appropriate technical
assistance and institutional improvements.
The project consists of; (a) the rehabilitation
of Azot's 340,000 tons per year (tpy)
lignite-based Kutahya II calcium ammonium nitrate
fertilizer plant; (b) rehabilitation and
modernization of Azot's 220,000 tpy triple
superphosphate and 230,000 tpy di-ammonium
phosphate fertilizer complex at Samsun; (c)
modifications and conversion to use lower cost
refinery gas to replace part of the naptha
feedstock and fuel for the IGSAS 511,500 tpy urea
fertilizer plant; (d) rehabilitation and
modernization of Gubre's Yarimca 200,000 tpy
triple superphosphate and 200,000 tpy complex
fertilizer plants, and the construction of a new
250,000 tpy sulphuric acid plant at this facility
to balance production; (e) training of fertilizer
subsector personnel; and (f) provision of about
1,500 man-months of technical assistance and
engineering services to design and implement plant
improvements, operate the Azot plants, prepare and
implement financial management and organizational

improvements in Azot, and undertake a fertilizer
marketing and pricing study.
The major benefits of the proposed project are
substantially increased production from the
rationalized facilities, lower energy costs, and
more cost-efficient operations. By project
completion, an estimated 623,000 tpy additional
nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer will be produced
at lower unit cost, and $118 million per year of
foreign exchange saved. Technical risks are
considered moderate, as the project is dealing
with existing plants and commercially proven
technology. The main risks are delays in
implementation and increased costs. These have
been mitigated by providing, where necessary,
expatriate specialists to strengthen the
operational staff and by the involvement of
experienced engineering firms.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR A FERTILIZER RATIONALIZATION AND ENERGY SAVING PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$110 million to help
finance the foreign exchange costs of a Fertilizer Rationalization and
Energy Saving Project. The loan would have a term of 17 years including 4
years of grace, with interest at 9.6 percent per annum. The equivalent of
about $69.0 million, $20.6 million and $20.0 million, respectively, would
be onlent to Azot Sanayii, Istanbul Gubre Sanayii, and Gubre Fabrikalari
for 12 years including 4 years of grace, at 10.6 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY _/
2.       A Special Economic Mission visited Turkey in April/May 1979 to
evaluate the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1979-1983). Its report entitled "Turkey;
Policies and Prospects for Growth" (No. 2657a-TU dated December 12, 1979) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on December 26, 1979 and its Postscript
on March 24, 1980. A small mission visited Turkey in May 1980 to update
information and Bank analysis of the country's economic prospects. Its
findings are reflected below. Annex I contains the Basic Country Data.
Development Trends and Policies
3.       As the result of a strong commitment to rapid growth and moderni-
zation, GDP increased at an average annual rate of 6.4 percent, 6.7 percent
and 7.2 percent respectively, during the First Plan (1963-67), Second Plan
(1968-1972), and Third Plan (1973-1977) periods. This compares favorably with
the experience of 55 "middle income" developing countries, whose GDP growth
averaged a little under 6.0 percent per annum between 1960-1978. Moreover,
the relatively high growth rate in Turkey was achieved without significant
deposits of oil or other important natural resources.
4.       Growth was accompanied by significant social changes.  Although
population grew annually at 2.5 percent, rapid GDP growth allowed substantial
advances in per capita income. However, rising income levels were not accom-
panied by better income distribution. Although basic needs have been met,
significant sectoral and regional inequalities in income continue.
1/ This Part is identical to Part I of the President's Reports on the Labor
Intensive Industry Project (P-2956-TU) dated February 11, 1981, and on the
Second Fruit and Vegetable Project (P-2985-TU) dated March 10, 1981.



- 2 -
5.       The public sector has played a key role in Turkey's development.
Between 1963-1977, its share in total fixed investment fluctuated around 50
percent, and its share of fixed investment in manufacturing increased from 21
to nearly 49 percent. The public sector dominates basic industries. Never-
theless, the private sector has emerged as an increasingly important and
dynamic element in the economy and is beginning to shift its orientation from
consumer goods to intermediate and investment goods, and from the domestic
market to exports. Private sector investment increased at nearly 11.5 percent
per year in real terms during 1967-1977 compared to an average annual increase
of only 4.8 percent between 1963 and 1967.
6.       Turkish development between 1963-1977, however, exhibited a number of
structural characteristics which are of considerable relevance for future
development policy. First, for a country of Turkey's size and per capita
income, it has a very low level of exports relative to GDP--about 4 percent in
1977--as against a more or less "normal" import level of around 20 percent for
middle income countries; this highlights the vulnerability of the balance of
payments and the importance of export development to sustain the needed inflow
of foreign exchange resources. Second, while the level of investment relative
to GDP increased rapidly and compares favorably with other developing
countries, mobilization of domestic savings has lagged; the ratio of domestic
savings to GDP, is well below the average for middle income countries; the
growing gap between domestic savings and investment led in the mid-1970s to a
relatively high level of external borrowing, and domestic inflationary
pressures emanating from excess demand and deficit financing. Third, a
relatively high proportion of the labor force is still in agriculture, reflec-
ting significant disguised unemployment and the need for accelerated job
creation in non-agricultural activities; that in industry is low compared to
other large middle income countries; furthermore, the relatively inadequate
generation of additional employment has become more serious following the near
cessation of workers' migration to Europe since 1974. Fourth, despite the
growing dynamism of the private sector, the industrial scene is dominated by
inefficient State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) which have not been exposed to
market forces and serve not only economic but social goals; their growing
deficits have imposed an inflationary burden on the budget, while their ambi-
tious investment programs were financed through Central Bank borrowings, since
their controlled prices have, until recently not enabled most of them to
generate sufficient cash to cover costs or investment expenditures. Fifth,
due to the successes achieved since the early sixties through economic
planning, there has been an increasing tendency to plan to a micro-level and
seek to achieve changes through administrative fiat; however, the economy has
reached a stage where such excessive reliance on this becomes counter produc-
tive; planning needs to be increasingly geared towards setting a framework in
which market forces could secure the desired economic results in both the
public and private sectors.
The Economic Crisis and Stabilization Efforts
7.       These institutional and structural characteristics of the economy
made it particularly vulnerable to the sharp increase in import prices (inclu-
ding oil) in 1974 and the simultaneous occurence of recession, inflation and



- 3 -
rising unemployment in the industrial countries. These factors played a key
part in the deterioration of the economy. However, the politically weak
governments, their policies in response to these factors and their efforts to
pursue a high growth policy despite the worsening international environment
through increasing reliance on short-term external financing, together created
forces that brought about the economic crisis in mid-1977 which is still con-
tinuing. The detailed analysis of this crisis, and of Turkey's attempts to
stabilize the economy in the short-run up to late 1979, is provided in the
abovementioned Special Economic Report and Postscript, as well as in paras. 8
to 15 of the President's Report (dated February 29, 1980) for the Structural
Adjustment Loan approved by the Board on March 25, 1980.
8.       Despite domestic and international efforts, 1979 was another diffi-
cult year for the economy; production stagnated, unemployment increased,
inflation accelerated, the balance of payments position remained tight, export
performance was poor, severe import rationing continued and the external debt
position remained precarious. Policy initiatives taken till then proved
inadequate to reverse the tide, as political and economic uncertainties con-
tinued to erode the impact of the measures taken.
9.       Compared to a growth of 3 percent in 1978, GDP stagnated in 1979.
Value added in agriculture increased by 2.5 percent, and in services by about
1 percent, but in industry value added declined by about 2 percent. In agri-
culture, further growth was held back by a sizeable decline in production of
industrial crops, mainly cotton, and a bad olive crop; the area cultivated
declined, due to shortages of fuel and fertilizers. In industry, worsening
shortages of imported raw materials and energy, especially oil, led to a
decline in production of about 3.5 percent. Production of manufacturing SEEs
declined by about 2 percent, and was manifested by decreases of 28 percent in
cement production, 9 percent in steel production and 51 percent in certain
petroleum production and processing operations. In contrast, the construction
and transport sectors grew modestly, but insufficiently to overcome the
decline in other sectors. This stagnation was accompanied by unprecedented
inflation of about 65 percent in 1979.
10.      The overall public sector deficit increased from TL 80 billion in
1978 to TL 132 billion in 1979. It was financed mainly by borrowing from the
Central Bank (TL 70 billion). The consolidated budget and the operations of
the SEEs were almost equally responsible for the enlarged deficit. The
deterioration in the consolidated budget was caused mainly by a sharp increase
in transfers to the SEEs, which in 1979 amounted to TL 89 billion.
11.      On the external account, there was a marginal decline in the value of
recorded exports of goods to $2.3 billion, although in volume terms, exports
actually declined by an estimated 17 percent. The value of merchandise
imports was about 10 percent higher than the previous year at $5.1 billion;
but due to substantial price increases, the volume is estimated to have
declined by 19 percent. The current account deficit in 1979 was the same as
in 1978, i.e. around $1.7 billion.



- 4 -
12.      Turkey achieved some success in diversifying the sources, and
increasing the level, of M&LT commitments, including $250 million in project
credits from the Saudi Fund. Perhaps the most important arrangement arrived
at was the May 1979 OECD sponsored pledging of $1.45 billion in special assis-
tance, including about $900 million in M&LT bilateral credits and export
credits, besides $407 million of medium-term credits from commercial banks
(finalized in September 1979). However, actual capital inflows were about the
same as the previous year (see para. 18 for rescheduling in 1980).
13.      Also, throughout 1979, Turkey made a major effort to alleviate the
critical burden of external debt through: (a) slowing the growth of shortterm
liabilities; (b) debt relief arrangements; and (c) efforts to pursue new
sources of credits, especially M&LT credits. The first debt relief operation,
arranged through the OECD Consortium for Turkey in May 1978, involved consoli-
dation of $1.14 billion in arrears on guaranteed short-term and bilateral M&LT
debt, as well as amounts due over the thirteen month period May 21, 1978 to
June 30, 1979. A second major rescheduling took place in July 1979, involving
payments of about $1.02 billion on official bilateral and private guaranteed
credits due between July 1, 1979 and June 30, 1980. A third major arrange-
ment, finalized in July and August 1979 with commercial banks, rescheduled
convertible lira deposits ($2.3 billion), banker's credits ($429 million) and
third party reimbursement credits ($300 million). About $317 million in oil
debt was also rescheduled. The total amount thus rescheduled was about $5.5
billion. This was perhaps the largest debt rescheduling operation anywhere.
Even so, net arrears of about $500 million emerged given the remaining high
debt service burden in 1979.
January 1980 Structural Adjustment Program and Policy Objectives
14.      Against this background, it was quite clear that drastic and painful
stabilization measures were not enough to reverse the adverse economic tide.
What was needed, was a major program of long-term structural adjustments, if
the economy was first to be nursed back to normalcy and then to resume viable
growth. Such a bold and far-reaching program of policies to effect structural
adjustments in the economy over the medium term was announced on January 25,
1980, accompanied by initial measures to implement adjustments in certain
critical areas. These were described and discussed in detail in the Presi-
dent's Report (No. P-2725-TU dated February 29, 1980) for the Structural
Adjustment Loan. The policy objectives underlying, the program, and the
measures it initiated, represent a basic departure from past planning objec-
tives. Turkey has undertaken, through it, the essential first steps to foster
major structural and institutional changes in the key economic areas.
15.      The program's stated goal of "bringing about a major reorientation of
the economy" calls for: (i) greater reliance on market mechanisms and forces,
by both the public and private sectors; (ii) reduction in the rate of infla-
tion; (iii) improved management of the balance of payments and external debts;
(iv) policies to encourage the public and private sectors to be efficient and
internationally competitive; (v) the implementation of rational exchange rate
policies and of measures encouraging exports; (vi) domestic resource mobiliza-
tion efforts to be substantially augmented through increased tax efforts,



realistic SEE pricing, and increased private savings via the banking system
and the development of financial markets; (vii) an investment policy aimed at
fuller utilization of existing productive capacity and completion of ongoing
projects requiring modest inputs, and tailored to scarce resources; and
(viii) conditions to stimulate foreign investments in oil, industry and agri-
culture.
16.      Successful implementation of this program over the medium-term, will
require persistence and courageous action on the part of the Government. It
will also call for substantial support from the international community, with-
out which it is unlikely to succeed. However, if Turkey implements it vigor-
ously, and periodically makes critical in-depth reviews as to the impact of
the measures and what further modifications and adjustments are needed to
achieve the program's economic goals, it will strengthen the basis for
Turkey's creditworthiness and re-establish a path of stable economic growth.
17.      Following the announcement of this program, the IMF approved a modi-
fication of the terms of the July 1979 Standby Arrangement and the release of
larger second and third tranches on February 21 and March 24, 1980. In addi-
tion, SDR 71.6 million ($93 million) in compensatory financing for export
shortfalls was provided on February 21, 1980, together with the modification
of the Standby. Together, this resulted in the provision of $301 million (SDR
231.6 million), with the remaining $26 million (SDR 20 million) to be provided
in June. However, on June 18, this Standby was cancelled. Instead, the IMF
Board approved a new three-year Standby Arrangement involving SDR 1.25 billion
($1.63 billion), with SDR 460 million ($600 million) in the first year, SDR
400 million ($522 million) in the second year and SDR 390 million ($509
million) in the third year. The key conditions of the new Standby are that;
(i) exchange rate policy is to be kept more flexible; (ii) the financial
position of the public sector is to be improved, mainly as a result of the
restructuring of the operational policies of the SEEs; (iii) monetary condi-
tions are to be kept extremely tight, as a result of the observance of limits
on Central Bank lending; and (iv) interest rates are to be adjusted to reflect
market conditions.
18.      In addition, Germany took the lead in organizing the provision of
sizeable external assistance, as well as a further debt relief operation. In
meetings under OECD auspices in March and April, $1.16 billion of bilateral
aid was pledged, with much more rapid disbursements than in 1979. The Bank
also supported OECD's and IMF's efforts through a $200 million Structural
Adjustment Loan in March 1980. Furthermore, about $2.5 billion in service
payments to OECD countries on public and publicly-guaranteed debts falling due
prior to June 1983 were rescheduled, again under OECD auspices, in July 1980.
This included all arrears up to June 30, 1980, payments due prior to June 1983
on debt not previously rescheduled, and payments due up to June 1981 on debt
already rescheduled in 1978 or 1979. Ninety percent of these sums were
rescheduled over 8 to 10 years, including 4 to 5 years of grace. With these
developments, Turkey secured debt relief estimated at $1.1 billion in 1980 and
another $0.8 billion in 1981, with smaller amounts thereafter. The only size-
able new commitment in recent months has been a $250 million cash loan on 15



- 6 -
year low-interest terms from Saudi Arabia, of which $100 million has been dis-
bursed, with another $100 million scheduled for December and the balance for
March 1981. Turkey has approached leading commercial banks to secure a
softening of the terms of the August 1979 rescheduling agreement. After con-
siderable delay due to wariness on the part of banks both of a new reschedu-
ling and, to some extent, of extending new credit to Turkey, a modest syndi-
cated loan is under discussion. The Government will try to reduce to the
extent possible the current and prospective large net outflow of funds to the
commercial banks.
Economic Developments in 1980 and Outlook for 1981
19.      As expected, the initial impact of the January 1980 package has been
to exacerbate many of the economic pressures. Uncertainty about the course of
future policies and about the timing and pace of economic recovery, as well as
tight monetary conditions aimed at reducing aggregate demand, have slowed
investments and economic growth. Devaluation and the removal of price con-
trols on both private business and SEEs, while necessary to alleviate allo-
cative distortions in the economy, contributed to a large initial upsurge in
the rate of inflation. Also as expected, the financial rehabilitation of the
SEEs and their reorientation to market conditions has only begun, and will
require more fundamental changes than price liberalization alone over the
medium term. Budgetary transfers to the SEEs to cover remaining operating
subsidies and investment expenditures have continued to rise. The budget
position as a whole continues to be weak. It is still too early to say
whether the initial adjustment phase is over. However, preliminary data
suggest that the worst may be past. Inflation has come down sharply, and
indeed more rapidly than expected (next paragraph); the impact of higher
import prices (especially for oil) has been alleviated (though so far only for
1980) by a commensurate increase in capital inflows; and 1980 saw a very
modest resumption of economic growth.
20.      For the full year, GDP growth is likely to be between zero and 2 per-
cent, with growth in agriculture of about 2.5 percent, but stagnation in
industry. Public investment has continued to fall in real terms for lack of
financial resources, and private investment remains depressed. Unemployment
is still rising, and real disposable incomes are falling. As mentioned above,
inflation--which averaged over 100 percent on an annual basis in early
1980--has since slowed considerably, and expectations are that over the
remainder of the year it will be about 2 percent per month. The fiscal and
monetary situation remains difficult. There has been a substantial increase
in Government expenditures over previous forecasts, in line with inflation.
However, there is evidence of tax revenues lagging behind inflation, and sub-
stantial arrears have built up in tax collection. SEE operations will show a
small profit this year after several years of mounting deficits. However, to
finance their investments and debt repayments, budgetary transfers to SEEs
will rise again to TL 138 billion. As a result, the budget deficit is likely
to be TL 155 billion in spite of a further accumulation of Government arrears
vis-a-vis the private sector. Pressures have therefore built up to expand



Central Bank credit, which is strictly limited under the IMF Standby Arrange-
ment. Nevertheless, the first discussions under the Standby were satisfac-
torily concluded at the end of August, and the second drawing was made avail-
able on schedule on September 29. However, IMF Board agreed to a small
increase in the ceilings on Central Bank net domestic assets and credit to the
public sector to accommodate crop purchases by the Soil Products Office
(particularly of wheat) without impinging on the availability of financing for
the private sector, especially for exports.
21.      The balance of payments position remains quite tight.  Over the first
eight months of 1980, the value of merchandise exports was only 6 percent
higher than in the corresponding period of 1979. However, taking into account
the seasonal rise in agricultural exports, the end of various labor disputes
in industry, and the rising trend in production, and provided markets recently
established in the Middle East are not long disrupted by the Iran-Iraq war,
the Government projects exports of $2.8 billion for the year as a whole, com-
pared to $2.3 billion last year. While the value of merchandise imports is
expected to be considerably higher than in 1979--$6.7 billion (including $3.2
billion for oil) as against $5.1 billion, the volume increase will be negli-
gible due to increases in import prices, especially for oil. As a result,
fairly severe import rationing continues. Workers' remittances have increased
strongly this summer and should reach $1.8 billion for the year as a whole.
Even so, it is estimated that the current account deficit will increase from
$1.7 billion in 1978 and 1979 to $3.1 billion in 1980. Capital inflows will
also be higher than last year, with gross public M&LT disbursements expected
to be about $2.2 billion, given the Government's concerted effort to disburse
the pipeline of OECD sponsored external assistance pledged in May 1979 and
April 1980. Moreover, the massive July rescheduling (para. 18) has eased the
external debt position considerably.
22.      The outlook for 1981 is slightly more promising, although the balance
of payments position is likely to remain extremely difficult. It is too early
to predict the impact the Iran-Iraq war may have, given that these two
countries normally provide nearly 55 percent of Turkey's oil imports on favor-
able terms. Assuming the impact can be mitigated, the growth rate of real GDP
is projected to be about 3 percent, with value added in agriculture and
industry growing on the order of 3 and 4 percent respectively. Investment is
likely to grow only by about 1 percent, after real falls in recent years. The
Government hopes to reduce the rate of inflation substantially again. The
external position is expected to remain tight. Exports should grow by about
20 percent to $3.4 billion, and imports by about 16 percent to $7.8 billion,
in nominal terms. As in 1980, the volume increase in imports is likely to be
negligible due to increases in import prices, especially for oil, and hence
import rationing will have to continue. With only a modest rise in service
receipts and workers' remittances, the current account deficit in 1981 is
expected to be $3.6 billion, or $500 million more than in 1980. Turkey has
already begun to make preparations to meet the very large financing gap in
1981, and hopes to secure considerably higher capital inflows than in 1980,
particularly gross public M&LT disbursements which need to be around $3.5
billion. Apart from the Bank, IMF and commercial bank loans arranged or being
processed, the Government intends to seek further special aid from OECD
members in 1981.



- 8-
Turkey's Medium-Term Economic Prospects
23.      The international oil situation, following the substantial end-1979
price increases, has a major impact on future prospects. Even if Turkey
allows only a marginal increase in oil imports during 1980-1985 to sustain a
gradual resumption of growth, the oil import bill is estimated to increase
from $3.2 billion in 1980 to $6.1 billion by 1985; as a percentage of merchan-
dise exports and non-factor services, this is equivalent to about 83 percent
in 1980 and is likely to remain at about 70 percent until 1985. The pressure
this will exert on Turkey's already difficult balance of payments position is
obvious. The projected current account deficit as a percent of GNP in current
dollars increased from 3 percent in 1979 to about 8 percent in 1980 and is
projected to remain at or above 5 percent until 1984. Considering the limita-
tion on available external assistance and given the need for continued sound
external debt management, Turkey can sustain the projected annual current
account deficits of the order of $3-3.5 billion annually in the short run,
given further quick-disbursing assistance in 1981; the deficits are projected
to decline to a sustainable $2.5 billion annually in the next few years.
24.      Taking into account international inflation and the substantial obli-
gations for debt amortization, despite the July 1980 debt rescheduling, this
situation necessitates a large and sharply increasing annual average gross
inflow of foreign capital, rising to $4 to 5 billion during the next five
years.   Such major inflows of foreign capital can only be sustained on the
basis of prudent external debt management. In any case, debt service obliga-
tions are likely to remain high over the coming 5 years. In 1979, total debt
service payments were 26 percent of exports of goods, non-factor services and
workers' remittances after rescheduling payments. The ratio is projected to
rise to around 45 percent in 1984, taking account of the July 1980 debt
rescheduling. This, however, should represent the culmination of the finan-
cial consequences of the present crisis and the debt burden should remain
manageable, provided the structural adjustment policies are successfully
implemented and the export drive is sustained.
25.      Given the accumulation of economic problems of the last three years,
the political difficulties, the significantly increased cost of oil imports,
and the difficulty of significantly increasing the net inflow of capital, Bank
projections suggest that GDP growth in real terms may average around 4 percent
p.a. with a real growth of exports about 9 percent p.a. during 1980-1985.
These growth rates appear attainable, assuming continuation of appropriate
economic measures (including those announced in January 1980), and taking into
account the low export base and present underutilization of capacity.
26.      The recent political changes do not change these expectations regar-
ding economic developments. The military government which assumed power on
September 12 is determined to pursue the program of structural adjustments
announced in January 1980, as well as economic policies and commitments agreed
with the Bank, IMF and members of the OECD Consortium for Turkey. Indeed, two
days after the takeover, both the Bank and the IMF were officially informed of
this decision. A civilian Cabinet, responsible to the military's new National



- 9 -
Security Council, has been named, with the principal architect of the recent
economic policy reforms, Mr. Ozal, assuming the position of Deputy Prime
Minister for economic affairs. Its program confirms the commitment to con-
tinue implementing the January 1980 program, and the intention to introduce
those portions of it which have been blocked hitherto by deadlock in
Parliament.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
27.      A large lending program for Turkey was begun following the intro-
duction of its 1970 Stabilization Program. Despite the slowdown caused by the
1977-78 crisis, the Bank/IDA have lent to date $2,815 million, through 65
projects. Agriculture accounts for 22 percent of funds lent, industry and
DFCs for 35 percent, power for 13 percent and urban development,
transportation, education and tourism for the rest. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of March
31, 1981, with notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
28.      The implementation of private sector projects has been satisfactory.
Political instability, limited coordination amongst ministries, staffing
problems and the serious external and domestic financial crisis since 1977
have seriously affected project implementation in the public sector. A system
of joint project reviews between Turkey and the Bank was instituted in June
1975. This has resulted in distinct, but modest, improvements. As of June
1980, disbursements increased to 70 percent of appraisal estimates against 51
percent in June 1975. The broad reform of the public sector launched in
January 1980, and pursued with new measures since, allows cautious optimism
that performance can be gradually improved further, provided it is not eroded
by new factors, including shortages of resources.
29.      Bank lending is aimed at supporting the economic policies initiated
in January 1980, especially; (a) the pursuit of an export oriented develop-
ment strategy; and (b) domestic economic policies aimed at establishing a
macro-economic balance, increasing domestic savings, restraining public
investment and reorienting it to reflect the new Government priorities
(completion of ongoing projects, emphasis on quick-yielding new investments,
and balance of payments impact). The Bank has discussed with the Government
how its overall lending can best contribute to the latter's medium-term
objectives, and help remove past policy and institutional constraints. A
series of structural adjustment loans are envisaged, at the Government's
request, to support its program of structural adjustments to be implemented in
the medium-term. Agriculture, industry and energy will be the key sectors for
project lending. In agriculture, projects emphasize livestock, exports, and
rural development; in industry (including DFCs), the emphasis is on promotion
of exports and employment, and the gradual strengthening of the SEEs. Energy
projects underway are in power generation based on domestic hydro and lignite
resources; future projects will emphasize the oil/gas sub-sector and



- 10 -
coal/lignite. Projects for urban development and public utilities may
supplement these efforts. The close macroeconomic and sector dialogue
established with the Government in recent years is expected to be pursued on
key issues. The economic and sector work planned over the next several months
includes special studies of the public investment program, of
industrialization and foreign trade strategy, and of the energy sector, and
completion of sector memoranda on agriculture and industry. In addition, the
progress made in fostering structural adjustment will be monitored in the
context of each future structural adjustment loan.
30.      A supplement to the first Structural Adjustment Loan, the Bati Raman
Enhanced Oil Recovery Field Demonstration Project and the Petroleum
Exploration Project, were approved by the Executive Directors in November
1980, and the Labor Intensive Industry and Second Fruit and Vegetable Projects
in March 1981. Other loans being presented this fiscal year are for state
industrial enterprise finance and a second structural adjustment loan.
Projects being processed for later consideration include: sewerage disposal
in Istanbul, rural development, seed production, promotion of export oriented
industries, and paper and cement modernization.
31.      The Bank Group's share of the estimated total external debt
(including short-term obligations) was 8.0 percent in 1979, and is expected to
grow to 10.0 percent by 1981 and 12.5 percent by 1985. Its share of service
payments is projected to fall slightly from 8.8 percent in 1979 to 6.4 percent
in 1981, thereafter increasing to 7.6 percent by 1985.
32.      IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, pulp and paper, glass, aluminum,
iron and steel products, motor bicycle engines, piston rings and cylinder
liners, and tourism. It has also invested in the Turkish Industrial Develop-
ment Bank (Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi--TSKB). As of March 31, 1981, gross
IFC commitments totalled about $212 million, of which $91 million were still
held by IFC. New investment opportunities are being pursued.
PART III - THE FERTILIZER SUBSECTOR AND THE BENEFICIARIES
Introduction
33.      The fertilizer industry underpins Turkey's agricultural sector, which
in turn, is a major source of employment and foreign exchange earnings.
Starting from modest beginnings as a byproduct to steel production in 1939,
the industry now includes 10 public, private, and mixed sector companies with
18 plants, 6 of them built in the last five years. The installed capacity of
the industry is about five million product tons, equivalent to about one
million nutrient tons of nitrogen and 845,000 nutrient tons of phosphate
fertilizers. For reasons noted in para. 36, capacity utilization has been
poor in recent years (around 30-40 percent) and domestic production does not
meet demand, a cause for serious concern since fertilizer imports are
substantial (an estimated $450 million in 1980, was for finished products and



- 11 -
$230 million for inputs). Since the import cost of inputs is about 40-60
percent of the import cost of the finished product, increased and more
efficient use of installed capacity is of high priority.
34.      Fertilizer is produced in Turkey from a wide variety of inputs
ranging from import-based petroleum feedstocks to domestic lignite; Turkey has
substantial lignite reserves and two of the world's limited number of
lignite-based fertilizer plants. Turkey also has large deposits of pyrites
(iron sulphite) suitable for the production of sulphuric acid, a key
intermediate, much of which is still imported. Extensive deposits of
phosphate rock are known to exist but are of low quality and in difficult
locations. Hence, except for lignite and pyrites, Turkey does not possess
substantial proven raw material resources for fertilizer production and most
of the basic inputs (oil for naptha and fueloil feedstocks, rock phosphate,
and sulphur) and some intermediates (ammonia, sulphuric acid and phosphoric
acid) are imported. Altogether, Turkey depends on imported materials directly
or indirectly for 80 percent of its fertilizer needs.
35.      In the long-term, prospects are good for Turkey to maximize the use
of local materials such as lignite, pyrites and possibly natural gas in the
production of fertilizer. In the medium-term, besides increasing production
and productivity, lower energy consumption per unit of production can be
obtained from existing capacity by the substitution of locally available lower
cost feedstocks such as refinery gas for high-value naptha. Considerable
foreign exchange can also be saved by increased production of intermediates
such as sulphuric acid based on domestic pyrites or imported sulphur. Because
of the changed economics of fertilizer production, availability of alternative
feedstocks and improvements in the technology for using lignite, expansion
plans for the next few years are focused on developing a third lignite-based
plant and a plant based on gas resources in Thrace which might prove suitable
for fertilizer production.
36.      Production improved in 1980 and reached an estimated 460,000 nutrient
tons of nitrogen and 352,000 nutrient tons of phosphatic fertilizers, about 50
percent of capacity. The deficit in 1980, about 145,000 tons of nitrogen and
about 94,000 tons of phosphatic nutrients, was covered by imports. Low
capacity utilization is due to several factors including; structural and
technical bottlenecks arising from poor maintenance, inadequate spare parts,
or design deficiencies; poor and uneven quality and unreliable supply of local
raw materials (lignite, pyrites, rock phosphate etc.); weak organization and
management; lack of trained manpower, working capital diffiuulties; inadequate
foreign exchange for raw material inputs and spare parts; power shortages; and
inadequate water supply. Steps to correct some of these probl-ms have already
been taken.  The Government is giving priority in the allocation of foreign
exchange to fertilizer inputs rather than finished product imports, and a
considerable proportion of these imports of inputs are being financed out of
the structural adjustment loans.  Some of the other major Droblems wiil be
addressed directly by the proposed project.
The Market and Marketing
37.      Agriculture is an important sector, accounting for about 60 percenr
of export earnings, of particular significance in the current balance of



- 12 -
payments crisis. While the performance of agriculture has been reasonably
good by international standards, and Turkey is self-sufficient in food, there
is scope for increasing the area under cultivation and the use of more
intensive methods, such as fertilizers. Fertilizer consumption, almost
nonexistent in the early 1960's, has increased dramatically (by 15 percent per
annum since 1972) and reached 780,000 nutrient tons of nitrogen and 660,000
nutirient tons of phosphate nutrients in 1979. It declined in 1980, in
response to substantial price increases. Although the increases in use have
been significant, it is still low, about 47 kg/ha of arable land in 1977. The
Bank projects consumption to resume an upward trend in 1981, increase
thereafter at about 6.5 percent per annum and by 1987 reach about 1.2 million
nutrient tons of nitrogen and 0.9 million nutrient tons of phosphatic
fertilizers. The projections assume retail prices rise to world levels but
that the ratio of fertilizer prices to crop prices will continue to be
favorable. Assuming restoration of reasonable capacity utilization levels,
domestic production should reach about 842,000 tpy of nitrogen and 716,000 tpy
of phosphlate nutrients by 1987, still significantly below demand.
38.      Fertilizer distribution used to involve a number of public and
private firms. However, to ensure an orderly and broad distribution of
fertilizers during a period of foreign exchange shortages, DONATIM, the State
Economic Enterprise (SEE) responsible for supplying inputs to farmers, was
made responsible for distribution. A small amount, less than 10 percent, is
distributed by the Turkish Sugar Company (SEKER). These two SEEs are also the
only authorized fertilizer importers. Fertilizers account for a substantial
proportion (as much as 50 percent) of DONATIM's sales and it has done a
reasonable job in the physical distribution of fertilizers through its network
of outlets throughout the country. A fertilizer marketing study focusing on
the introduction of urea was undertaken in the early 1970s, in connection with
the Bank-financed IGSAS Project (Ln. 845-TU of June 1972), and resulted in
improvements to the system. However, with the increased consumption of
fertilizers, there is a need to update this study and examine whether the
present dealer network, warehousing system and transport network are adequate
for the increasing volume of fertilizers, as well as whether, in line with the
Government's market oriented policies, producers should be allowed to
distribute part or all of their products directly. The proposed project
therefore includes a marketing and pricing study. Assurances were obtained
that the marketing and pricing study will be carried out before December 31,
1982 under agreed terms of reference. Consultants, acceptable to the Bank, to
carry out the study will be employed by October 31, 1981. The Government has
a4so agreed that after an exchange of views with the Bank, changes, based on
the study's recommendations, will be implemented by June 30, 1984 (Loan
AgreemeDt, Section 3.01).
lcsrtal~"i iZ( ic ing
i9.      W-dtt, ex-factory and retail fertilizer prices are controlled by the
Governmuit. Yoth were substantially increased in 1980; retail prices by over
f-ive tiiUwf  (ice. to $i)60/ton for urea), and ex-factory prices by about four
times (i e. to about 4330/ton for urea).  Despite this, retail prices are
5t1l1 -bovli ou(h iiholf world market levels.  The subsidies are partly financed



- 13 -
by the agriculture sector through a Price Stabilization Fund which derives its
resources from a levy on the margin betwen the price received by exporters and
the price paid to farmers. These arrangements are relatively new and it is
not yet clear that the Fund is a reliable source of funds for the fertilizer
producers. During 1980, all fertilizer producers experienced substantial
accounts receivable problems, which impeded their ability to produce. The
Government has recently taken steps to rectify this situation, including
providing additional funds to DONATIM and SEKER. Receivables for all three
beneficiary companies had been reduced to acceptable levels by March 1981.
Nevertheless, an assurance was obtained that satisfactory arrangements will be
made by government to ensure payments by DONATIM and SEKER for fertilizers
purchased from local producers are made within four months of date of delivery
(Loan Agreement, Section 3.05). In connection with the proposed Second
Structural Adjustment Loan, the Government has indicated its intent to phase
out subsidies on fertilizers within the next five years. The marketing and
pricing study will facilitate this change by examining such issues as the
impact on farmers' incentives of deregulation, problems of the present
financing arrangements, etc.
40.       Under a new system established in January 1980, ex-factory
fertilizer prices are established every six months by a formula based upon the
average cif dollar price of comparable products imported by DONATIM. The
formula is designed to provide an incentive for local fertilizer producers to
increase domestic value-added since those with higher value-added receive a
higher TL price. By providing an international reference point, it also
encourages more economic investment decisions by producers and facilitates the
planned transition to a market price system. Under the formula, ex-factory
prices are equivalent to a range from $246/ton to $332/ton, depending on the
product, or 8-17 percent above cif prices, which are currently below projected
long-term equilibrium levels. Most producers are now profitable and
generating sufficient cash for their operations.
The Beneficiary Companies
41.      Azot Sanayii.  Azot, an SEE formed in 1954, is the major government
fertilizer company and the largest fertilizer company in Turkey, accounting
for 34 percent of the nitrogen and 30 percent of the phosphate capacity. It
operates six plants, including the two lignite-based plants at Kutahya. Like
other SEEs, Azot is under the direction of a permanent five-man board
including its General Manager, a capable and experienced administrator.
Despite a conscientious and relatively efficient management and staff, Azot
faces many of the general problems of the SEEs: inadequate management and
professional compensation and incentives, overcentralization, overstaffing and
inadequate financial management systems.
42.      While some of the general SEE problems are being addressed by the
Government's ongoing efforts on SEE reform, implementation of these decisions
will require adjustments within the company. In addition, Azot's management
wishes to address a number of management issues: production and process
planning; maintenance planning; inventory control and management;
organizational structure; incentives; standard costing; energy management;



- 14 -
financial management including management information systems, capital
budgeting and financial planning; and training. The project provides
consultants to help Azot do this. Assurances were obtained that the
consultants will be engaged by no later than December 31, 1981, that an action
program will be prepared by December 31, 1982, and that the program will be
implemented after consultation with the Bank by December 31, 1983 (Azot
Project Agreement, Sections 2.03 and 2.04). In addition, an assurance was
obtained that the Government will take all measures necessary and within its
powers to enable Azot to implement this program and grant Azot sufficient
autonomy to carry out its operations (Loan Agreement, Section 3.04). To
increase operational flexibility, an informal understanding was also obtained
that Azot's Board will delegate greater authority over personnel, minor
investment, and purchasing to its General Manager and staff. To help
stimulate more efficient SEE operations and provide a clearer measure of
performance, the Government has agreed, that a control and monitoring system
will be established in coordination with Azot by December 31, 1981, to review
Azot's performance against efficiency criteria and monthly production targets,
including unit costs (Loan Agreement, Section 3.03).
43.       Azot's installed capacity, including the new Gemlik plant (still
being run in), is 1.7 million product tons per year (300,000 nutrient tons of
nitrogen, and 240,000 nutrient tons of phosphate). Except for the small 50,000
tpy Kutahya I lignite-based plant operating above designed capacity, all its
plants are operating at low capacity utilization rates. Total production in
1980 was 531,000 product tons or 34 percent of capacity. Three of the plants,
the 340,000 tpy Kutahya II lignite-based nitrogen plant, the 220,000 tpy
triple superphosphate (TSP) plant and the 230,000 tpy di-ammonium (DAP)
phosphate complex (both at Samsun), show the most promising opportunities for
rationalization and increased production, and are included in the proposed
project.
44.      The Kutahya II plant is of great interest to Turkey because of its
use of domestic lignite as a raw material and fuel. This plant, commissioned
in 1968, uses the Koppers-Totzek process for gasification of lignite from the
nearby Turkish Coal Authority (TKI) mine at Seyitomer. It has never reached
its design capacity and has suffered from its inception from uneven quality in
the lignite supplied (consistency, not quality, being essential in fertilizer
production). Poor operation and maintenance practices at the plant, and power
failures have also caused problems. A debottlenecking plan was prepared by
the plant's original engineering firm, Krupp-Koppers from Germany, and is
supported by the project. The Samsun complex includes, besides the finished
product facilities, a 214,000 tpy sulphuric acid plant using pyrites from a
local copper smelter (the smelter is expected to be modernized under the
proposed State Industrial Finance Project also scheduled for Board
consideration in FY81), a 72,000 tpy and a 109,000 tpy phosphoric acid
plants. Inadequate water supply, poor quality, insufficient and wet pyrites
and inadequate handling facilities are the major bottlenecks which the project
will address.
45.      In addition to the rehabilitation of the Kutahya and Samsun plants,
which are included in the project, Azot is completing a naptha based 330,000
tpy ammonia plant as part of the Gemlik plant, financed by bilateral credits.



- 15 -
At the suggestion of the Bank, Azot is re-examining the economic justification
of completing the investment in view of higher naptha prices as well as the
feasibility of converting this plant to an alternative feedstock. In any
case, because of sunk costs and tied credits, the additional investment to
complete this facility is likely to be justified, even if based on naptha.
46.      Azot's financial results have been mixed.  From 1977 to 1979 it
showed substantial losses, partly due to low capacity utilization and partly
to low ex-factory prices. However, during 1980, due to increases in
ex-factory prices, the company showed a substantial profit, an estimated TL
1.9 billion ($21 million) after taxes, reflecting the profitability under the
price formula of domestic based lignite fertilizer production. During 1980,
Azot's equity base, which had significantly eroded, was also restored by the
profits and an additional TL 5.1 billion ($56 million) increase in equity from
the Government. As a result, the debt/equity ratio improved from 98;2 to
50:50 and the current ratio to 1.7;1.
47.      Istanbul Gubre Sanayii.  IGSAS, established in March 1971 under the
Commercial Code, is a wholely owned subsidiary of the Turkish Petroleum
Corporation (TPAO) and IPRAS, a fully owned subsidiary of TPAO. IGSAS
operates a Bank-financed 511,500 tpy urea plant, including a 330,000 tpy
ammonia unit, on the Marmara coast utilizing naptha from the adjacent IPRAS
refinery (Lns. 845 and 845-2-TU). Commissioned at the end of 1977, after some
mechanical problems during start-up, production from the plant has increased
gradually, reaching in 1980 a total of 265,000 tons of ammonia and 430,000
tons of urea, or 84 percent of capacity, one of the highest rates in the
country . The company is well managed with a competent and efficient staff
reflecting in part the relative flexibility allowed under the private
statutes. IGSAS has, nevertheless, been subject to some political
interference in its activities and its general manager was changed twice
during the last three years. The current General Manager and senior staff are
experienced and competent. Nevertheless, assurances were obtained that
qualified management and staff will be retained (IGSAS Project Agreement,
Section 3.01).
48.      The company first became profitable in 1979 and, under the new
ex-factory price regime and relatively high level of capacity utilization,
realized TL 2.8 billion ($31 million) of profits after taxes in 1980. The
general financial situation as a result is satisfactory with a current ratio
of 1.3:1 and a debt/equity ratio of 45:55.
49.      Although production is satisfactory, the economics of fertilizer
production have been adversely affected by the sharp increases in naphtha
prices, i.e. from $20/ton at project appraisal in 1971 to $350/ton at
present. Substantial savings can be realized by converting the plant to use
platformer gas from the adjacent IPRAS refinery as feedstock and excess
refinery gas, otherwise flared, as fuel.
50.      Gubre Fabrikalari.  Gubre is a joint sector company established in
1953. Its ownership is divided among; three SEEs, including Azot, holding 34
percent of the shares; agricultural cooperatives and insurance companies with
35 percent of the shares; and private shareholders holding 31 percent. It



- 16 -
operates two 200,000 tpy triple superphosphate plants, one at Yarimca and the
other at Sariseki, and a 200,000 tpy complex fertilizer plant also at
Yarimca. Production at these plants in recent years has been reasonably
good--385,000 product tons in 1980, about 64 percent of capacity.
Nevertheless, substantial improvement can be obtained through
rationalization. Moreover, the plants presently depend on the importation of
sulphuric acid, uneconomic because of high transport costs. The addition of a
new sulphuric acid plant would reduce production costs, balance the production
system and also reduce energy needs. Gubre has shown a profit over the last
four years and earned about TL 580 million ($6 million) in 1980, after taxes.
The company has a very sound debt/equity ratio of 33:67 and a current ratio of
1.1:1 which while low, is acceptable.
Bank Assistance in the Sector
51.      The Bank has financed one fertilizer project in Turkey, the IGSAS
Ammonia/Urea Project (Ln. 845-TU of June 1972, and Ln. 845-2-TU of April
1975). The Bank's operations in the industrial sector have been reviewed by
the Operations Evaluation Department in its report entitled "Sector Operations
Review: Industries and DFC's Program in Turkey" (Report No. 3077 dated July
18, 1980). This report and a separate Project Performance Audit Report on the
IGSAS Project (Report No. 3037 dated June 17, 1980), noted that the IGSAS
project had faced a number of financial, managerial and technical problems,
particularly during start up including frequent management changes and
difficulty in maintaining adequate debt/equity and current ratios. As pointed
out in the section on the company, these problems have been resolved. The
IGSAS report also noted the contribution of the project to Turkey's
agricultural development and remarked on the high level of competence of
middle-level technical and managerial personnel in the country.
52.      More generally, the sector report commented on the relative lack of
success the Bank's industrial lending had realized in stimulating greater
export orientation or less capital intensive investments and the limited
achievements in solving the major institutional problems facing the SEE
sectors. The report also highlighted the limitations on solving sector
problems through individual projects.  It concluded, however, that more recent
Bank operations have supported broader socio-economic objectives, that the
Bank's long and consistent association with TSKB (the Turkish Industrial
Investment Bank) resulted in a viable and effective institution, and that the
Bank Group has transferred much needed foreign exchange resources and
contributed substantially to the country's industrial development. As has
been noted above, the export and SEE reform issues are being addressed at the
policy level in the context of structural adjustment lending. In addition,
projects specifically focused on less capital intensive development and
exports have recently been approved or are under preparation. The proposed
project will indirectly support agricultural exports and directly improve
operations of Azot, the only SEE involved.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
53.      The proposed project grew out of the recognition that Turkey was not
obtaining reasonable results from its existing fertilizer capacity, in part
due to foreign exchange shortages, but primarily because of technical and
operational problems. Encouraged by the Bank, the Government and the major
fertilizer producers identified and prepared a rationalization and energy
saving project designed to increase capacity utilization, save energy and
reduce major bottlenecks existing among selected major fertilizer producers.
Seven of the eighteen plants in the country were identified as having high
economic priority for rehabilitation. Because of status of preparation and
local and foreign resource constraints, these were then separated into two
phases. The first phase, encompassing four plants identified as having the
highest priority, is supported by the proposed project.
54.      Project preparation was carried out by the sponsoring companies,
coordinated by Azot and assisted by a number of specialized foreign
consultants financed by a $600,000 advance under the Bank's Project
Preparation Facility (PPF)(P-027-TU). The project was appraised in December
1980. Negotiations were held in Washington between April 1 and 3, 1981, with
a delegation headed by the Chief Financial Counselor of the Turkish Embassy
and representatives of the Treasury and the three beneficiary companies.
Project Objectives and Scope
55.      The project's objectives are to; increase fertilizer production and
productivity in existing facilities by rationalizing them; save energy and
decrease costs through debottlenecking; increase the domestic production of
key intermediates, especially sulphuric acid; and reduce the foreign exchange
burden of imports. Besides providing equipment and engineering services to
rationalize the selected plants, the project provides assistance for:
training, a marketing study, and plant operations and management improvements
for Azot. The project covers three companies, Azot, IGSAS, and Gubre, and
four plants: (a) Azot's 340,000 tpy Kutahya II lignite-based calcium ammonium
nitrate (CAN) plant; (b) Azot's 220,000 tpy triple superphosphate (TSP) and
230,000 tpy di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) plant at Samsun; (c) IGSAS's 511,500
tpy urea plant; and (d) Gubre Fabrikalari's 200,000 tpy TSP and 200,000 tpy
complex fertilizer plant, both at Yarimca. Details of the project are
provided below, in the Loan and Project Summary, in Annex III and in the Staff
Appraisal Report (No. 3377-TU dated April 9, 1981) distributed separately to
the Executive Directors.
The project includes specifically:
(a)  Kutahya II.  Provision of equipment, materials and spare parts
to increase production of CAN to about 290,000 tpy by: (i) improving lignite
processing (including mixing, grinding, and cleaning facilities); (ii)
modifying and repairing badly eroded or corroded equipment and machinery
including gasifiers, gas compressors and waste heat and steam boilers; (iii)
strengthening the utility and power supply systems; and (iv) improving the



- 18 -
process and operation and control systems. Engineering services to design and
carry out the improvements and about 145 man-months of expatriate production
specialist assistance are also included.
(b) Samsun; Provision of materials and equipment to increase
production of TSP to about 198,000 tpy and DAP to about 204,000 tpy by; (i)
modernizing the existing 214,000 tpy sulphuric acid plant, including
installation of a sulphur burner, a pyrite crushing and grinding system,
blowers and economizers; (ii) modifying the phosphoric acid concentration
units and constructing two new phosphoric acid tanks; and (iii) modernizing
bagging, handling and storage systems. Construction of a new fresh water
system, including a 25 kilometer pipeline, and engineering services to design
and carry out the improvements are also included.
(c) IGSAS: Provision of equipment and spare parts to increase urea
production to about 486,000 tpy and improve energy efficiency by: (i)
modifying the existing 330,000 tpy ammonia plant to replace part of the high
cost naptha feedstock and fuel with platformer gas and refinery fuel gas from
the neighboring IPRAS refinery; (ii) replacing ammonia condensers, modifying
the ammonia converters and installation of a new purge gas recovery system to
increase ammonia production; (iii) modifying the refrigeration system to
reduce excessive corrosion and clogging problems related to sea water cooling;
(iv) rehabilitating the urea desorption system and installing a C02
purification system to improve efficiency and safety and reduce pollution; and
(v) improving utility systems and product storage, handling and shipping
systems. Engineering services to design and carry out these improvements are
also included.
(d) Yarimca: Construction and equipping a new 250,000 tpy
sulphur-based sulphuric acid plant to replace imports, including a 4.5 MVA by-
product steam generator to provide 50 percent of the power needs of the
complex. Provision of equipment and spare parts to increase production of TSP
and complex fertilizer to about 180,000 tpy each by: Ci) equipping the
existing 90,000 tpy phosphoric acid plant with a new rock grinding unit and
pumping facilities, heat exchanger, and storage tanks; (ii) installing a
mixer, and granulator and drying section, including a dedusting unit in the
existing TSP plant; (iii) improve the utility systems and the process
operation and control systems; and (iv) providing a new 500 ton gypsum barge
and additional loading facilities to improve storage and handling.
Engineering services to design and carry out the improvements are also
included.
(e) Training: Provision of about 24 man-months of technical
assistance to strengthen training programs for professional and technical
staff of Azot, IGSAS and Gubre in operations, maintenance and financial
management. Equipment and training aids and expanding of training facilities
of Azot at Ankara, Kutahya, and Samsun, and of IGSAS at Tutunciftlik as well
as about 75 man-months of overseas training for selected staff.
(f) Management Improvement Component: Provision of 260 man-months
of technical expertise to undertake a comprehensive study of the management
and organization of Azot and prepare and implement operations, organization
and financial management improvement program including steps to increase
efficiency through increased delegation of authority (para. 42).



- 19 -
(g) Fertilizer Marketing and Pricing Study: Provision of about 30
man-months of technical assistance to help the Government undertake a study of
the fertilizer marketing, transport, storage and distribution system, and its
pricing.
In total about 1,500 man-months of technical assistance are provided, at a
cost of $13,000 per man-month, inclusive of salaries, travel and subsistence.
The largest part, 990 man-months, are for the engineering services needed to
design and implement the improvements and the remainder, as noted above, are
for plant operations, training, management assistance, and study programs
under the project. A list of the major items of equipment under the project
was agreed during negotiations.
Project Costs and Financing
56.      The total cost of the proposed project (including an average 27
percent price, and 10 percent physical contingency on base cost but excluding
interest and other charges during construction), is estimated at about $203
million. International escalation rates have been used for local costs, as
well as for foreign costs, on the assumption that differences between local
and international inflation will result in corresponding exchange rate
adjustments. The estimated foreign exchange cost is $103 million excluding
interest and other charges during construction. However, if these are
included, then the total financial requirements would be about $237 million,
and the foreign exchange resources $131 million. The cost estimates assume
sufficient power for the Kutahya II plant will be provided at a modest cost by
a direct line from the Seyitomer Power Plant (Loan Agreement, Section 3.08).
However, the Turkish Electric Authority (TEK) has recently questioned whether
this solution would be sufficient to avoid fluctuation in power supply.
Assurances have therefore been obtained that Azot will carry out a study
working with TEK to develop a plan of action by September 30, 1981 for meeting
the power requirements of the plant (Azot Project Agreement, Section 2.10).
Because of its importance, the completion of satisfactory arrangements for
financing and constructing the needed power facilities is a condition of
disbursement for the equipment for the Kutahya II component (Loan Agreement,
Schedule 1, Para. 4(c)).
57.      The proposed Bank loan of $110 million will finance 84 percent of the
foreign exchange requirements and 46 percent of the total financing
requirements. This includes about $7 million of interest during construction
for Azot, justified by the cash flow needs of the company. In the event that
additional foreign funds are required to ensure adequate power for the Kutahya
II plant, based on the study mentioned above, the allocation to interest
during construction could be reduced. The remaining foreign exchange
requirements for working capital and financial charges during construction,
i.e. $21 million, will be met as follows; IGSAS $5.3 million, Gubre $6.7
million, and the Government $9 million.
58.      The $105.6 million equivalent required for local costs, including
financial charges in TLs during construction, and the local component of
working capital will be financed as follows: about $39.0 million equivalent
will be provided by Azot; about $9.7 million equivalent will be provided by



- 20 -
IGSAS; and about $25.9 million will be provided by Gubre; all from internal
cash generation. The remaining local currency requirements, $31.0 million
equivalent, required for Azot, will be provided or arranged by the
Government. The total Government contribution, including foreign exchange
requirements, is expected to be about $40.0 million equivalent, part in equity
in order to maintain Azot's debt/equity ratio at 60:40, on revalued assets.
Agreement was obtained that the Government will provide, or cause to be
provided funds, on appropriate terms, and will ensure funds are available in
case there is a shortfall in any of the components (Loan Agreement, Section
3.01). Agreement was also obtained from the companies, that they will not
undertake nonproject investments costing more than $7 million per year for
Azot and $5 million per year for IGSAS and Gubre (Project Agreements, Section
4.06). An understanding was reached that Azot's Gemlik expansion, referred to
in para. 45, is exempted from this limit, subject to confirmation of its
justification and to financial arrangements being made for completing it which
do not impair Azot's ability to carry out the proposed project.
59.      The Bank loan will be to the Government for 17 years including 4
years of grace. It will be onlent to the beneficiaries at 10.6 percent p.a.
for 12 years including 4 years of grace. The beneficiaries will bear the
foreign exchange risk. Inflation was 50 percent in 1978, 65 percent in 1979,
and 105 percent in 1980. Because of uncertainties associated with changes in
economic structure expected in response to Government policy initiatives, it
is difficult to forecast the rate of inflation. It is tentatively projected
to decline to 60 percent in 1981, 40 percent in 1982 and 30 percent in 1983,
if government policies are effectively implemented. Interest rates of
domestic lending institutions for foreign currency lending, which are adjusted
every six months, range from 11.5 to 16.6 percent inclusive of taxes, charges
and rebates extended to foster inter alia exports and regional development,
and borrowers also bear the foreign exchange risk. Under current policies,
exchange rate adjustments are expected to offset the inflation differential
between Turkey and its major trading partners.
Project Execution
60.      Each company will be responsible for implementing the components in
its plants and project teams have been formed for this purpose. The project
teams in IGSAS and Gubre will supervise the activities of the engineering
consultants and subcontractors and with their assistance, handle procurement
of equipment and materials. Because of the limited inhouse expertise in Azot,
as a condition of disbursement for the equipment for the Kutahya II and Samsun
components, services of at least 4 specialists to supplement Azot's staff will
be hired under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank (Loan Agreement,
Schedule 1, para. 4(b)). In addition, Azot has agreed to develop a staffing
plan by March 31, 1982 and implement it by June 30, 1982 (Azot Project
Agreement, Section 3.01). Because of specialized technology and licensing
agreements, the firms which built the plants, and prepared the rehabilitation
programs, will also be the lead firms for rehabilitation. The firms are Krupp
Koppers from Germany for Kutahya II; Uhde from Germany for IGSAS; and Davy
International from Germany for Samsun and Yarimca. All are technically
competent.
61.      Overall project coordination will be the responsibility of the
coordination unit in Azot, which was established to prepare the project. This



- 21 -
group will supervise the training activities and the management improvement
component. The fertilizer marketing and pricing study will be carried out
under the direction of a steering committee with representatives from the
State Planning Organization (SPO), the Ministry of Agriculture, the fertilizer
industry, the fertilizer marketing organizations (DONATIM and SEKER), and the
Agriculture Bank. Because of the importance of reliable local raw material
supply, a fertilizer industry working group with representatives of the
producers and raw material suppliers, and SPO, will be established to review
and formulate plans for ensuring smooth production (Loan Agreement, Sections
3.01(a) and 3.07). The foreign exchange requirements for operations will
increase after rehabilitation. The Government has agreed to make available
the amounts of foreign exchange needed for fertilizer inputs and spare parts
needed to ensure efficient operation of the companies' plants, and to ensure
prompt licensing of such imports (Loan Agreement, Section 3.06).
62.      Existing environmental standards for industrial effluents in Turkey,
are generally less stringent than current Bank guidelines. Thus, agreement
was obtained that the company's plants will meet acceptable environmental
guidelines for fertilizer plants (Project Agreements, Sections 3.01(f) or
(g)). Because of its location in a built-up area, the new sulphuric acid
plant at Yarimca will use a technology designed to minimize particulate
emissions.
Procurement and Disbursement
63.      Machinery and equipment totalling about $69 million will be procured
under international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Proprietary items procured on a negotiated basis, and time or process critical
equipment and spares, procured under limited international tendering, will be
permitted up to a total of $24.5 million, which is justified by the rehabili-
tation requirements. Small items costing $100,000 or less, totalling about $3
million, will also be procured under limited international tendering. All
such items will be on the basis of a list of goods satisfactory to the Bank
(Project Agreements, Schedule 1, para. Cl and 2). Domestic manufacturers will
be allowed a preferential margin under international competitive bidding of 15
percent or the actual customs duty, whichever is lower. The qualifications,
experience, terms and conditions of employment and selection of the
engineering consultants for the new sulphuric acid plant for Yarimca and the
new purge gas recovery unit at IGSAS will be satisfactory to the Bank.
Because of the urgency of commencing rehabilitation, retroactive financing is
proposed for up to $4 million for downpayments to engineering firms and
equipment suppliers for contracts awarded in accordance with Bank guidelines
entered into after January 1, 1981 (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, para. 4(a)).
64.      The Bank loan will be disbursed as follows:  100 percent of the
foreign expenditure for imported equipment and spare parts, foreign
consultants (including repayment of advances under the PPF), and training, 100
percent of the ex-factory costs of contracts won by local suppliers under
international competitive bidding (excluding local taxes), and 100 percent of
the foreign expenditure or 60 percent of the total expenditure for the
marketing consultants. Disbursements are expected to be completed by
December 31, 1985.



- 22 -
Financial Analysis
65.      Financial projections for the four plants have been prepared assuming
production build-up will begin in 1984/85, and reach the capacity utilization
targets as follows; (i) Kutahya II, 85 percent from 1986; (ii) Samsun, 90
percent from 1986; (iii) IGSAS, 95 percent from 1985; and (iv) Yarimca, 90
percent from 1986. The projections assume that without the project, Kutahya
II's capacity utilization could increase to about 28 percent and Samsun's to
about 55 percent if raw material supplies improved. While current ex-factory
prices are slightly above landed cif prices for similar products, current
international prices are depressed below long-term trends. The Bank expects
cif prices to rise in real terms over the next four years close to or above
the current level of Turkish ex-factory prices.
66.      The projections show substantially improved results may be expected
as early as 1985 as spare parts, components, and technical assistance begin to
yield substantial improvements in efficiency. Total incremental sales are
projected at $243 million in 1985 rising to $310 million in 1987. Profits and
internal cash generation are also expected to be substantially improved,
although the projections are sensitive to pricing policies. The estimated
incremental financial rates of returns before taxes, the estimated
improvements in net profits after tax as a percentage of sales for the plants
and internal cash generation are shown below. Because of the importance of
internal cash generation, and the current Government control over ex-factory
prices, assurances were obtained that so long as the Government continues to
set ex-factory prices, they will be not less than cif equivalent levels (Loan
Agreement, Section 3.02). The overall project financial rate of return is 49
percent. A one year delay in project implementation, combined with a 10
percent capital cost increase and the eventual attainment of 10 percent less
capacity utilization will reduce the returns to 41 percent (26 percent for
Gubre, the worst case).

Gubre                       33%                   14%                $25
67.      The current ratio of the companies is expected to be at or above
1.1:1; and the debt/equity ratios below 60:40. Assurances were obtained
that the companies will maintain a current ratio of at least 1.3:1 (1.1:1
for Azot during project implementation); a debt/equity ratio of 60:40; that
they will not encourage additional debt if by so doing the projected debt
service coverage would fall below 1.5 times; and that without Bank consent,
they will not declare dividends if after such payments, the current ratio
would fall below 1.4:1 (Project Agreements, Sections 4.04, 4.05, and



- 23 -
4.07). While present accounting practices are reasonably satisfactory in
IGSAS and Gubre, Azot will be provided assistance under the project to
modernize its accounting systems and practices.
Benefits and Risks
68.      The incremental economic rate of return is estimated at 43
percent, reflecting the high value gained by restoring capacity with modest
amounts of capital investment. The subprojects show economic rates of
returns as follows: 36 percent for Kutahya II; 35 percent for Samsun; 68
percent for IGSAS; and 39 percent for Yarimca. The project returns are
most sensitive to delays. A 10 percent increase in operating costs would
reduce the return to 39 percent. However, even under very adverse
assumptions of capital costs increased by 10 percent, capacity utilization
10 percent below levels assumed, and a one year delay, the rate of return
would still be 35 percent (27 percent for Samsun, the worst case). Overall
rates of return of the plants being rehabilitated using salvage values for
existing facilities, have also been calculated to ensure that the project
supports economic production. The results are; 37 percent for Kutahya II;
25 percent for Samsun; 17 percent for IGSAS; and 23 percent for Yarimca,
all of which are satisfactory.
69.      The main benefits of the project are increased output at lower
cost and substantial energy savings. By project completion in 1987, an
additional 623,000 product tpy of fertilizers will be produced, valued at
$168 million in 1980 cif prices. The net foreign exchange savings, after
debt service and cost of inputs, is expected to be $118 million per year in
1980 dollars. In addition, the production of intermediates will increase
including an additional 126,000 tpy of ammonia, 151,600 tpy of sulphuric
acid and 98,450 tpy of phosphoric acid. At targeted capacity rates, about
88,000 tpy of naphtha (worth $31 million) will be saved at IGSAS and about
56,000 tpy of fueloil (worth $12 million) will be saved at Samsun, IGSAS,
and Yarimca. This will be partially offset at IGSAS by a 76 million
m3/year increase in the use of platformer gas and 46 million m3/year
increase in the use of refinery off gas, worth in total about $18 million
if valued at fuel oil equivalent prices. Thus, the net energy savings are
expected to be about $25 million/year. Moreover, since part of the
refinery off gas is normally flared, this understates the real savings to
the economy.
70.      The main technical risks facing the project are delays in
implementation and inadequate cost controls due to management
inefficiency. These risks have been mitigated by the involvement of
experienced engineering firms for project design and implementation and the
strengthening of the project team of Azot with expatriate specialists.
Risks also arise from the general economic situation, particularly the
severe inflation which will require frequent price adjustments to maintain
cash flow and provide the substantial internally generated funds required
for financing and operating the projects. The Government's very tight
budget position could delay the provision of the TL funds required to
Azot. The pricing and cash flow risk has been mitigated by the formula
linking ex-factory prices to international prices which over the long run

are expected to increase, as well as by the undertaking of the Government
to ensure adequate funds flow into the marketing organization for payments
to the companies. The budget risk is minimized by the high priority the
Government gives to the development of fertilizer production in view of its
impact on agriculture and the balance of payments.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
71.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the
Bank, the draft Project Agreements between the Bank and Azot Sanayii,
between the Bank and IGSAS, and between the Bank and Gubre Fabrikalari, and
the report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The special features of the Loan and Project Agreements are
referred to in the text and listed in Section III of Annex III.
72.      Special conditions of loan effectiveness include execution of the
Subsidiary Loan Agreements between the Republic of Turkey and the three
beneficiaries (Loan Agreement, Section 6.01). Special conditions of
disbursement include; (i) for the equipment for the Kutahya II and Samsun
components, the employment by Azot of four operational experts; and (ii)
for the equipment for the Kutahya II component, the completion of adequate
arrangements for power supply to the plant (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1,
Para. 4).
73.      I am satisfied the proposed loan will comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
74.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Ln. No. 844 Istanbul Water Supply Project; US$37 million loan of June 30,
1972. Effective Date; January 4, 1973. Closing Date; June 30, 1981.
Project construction was delayed about 2-1/2 years due mainly to
problems in the use of ICB procurement procedures and inefficient management.
However, construction moved swiftly in 1977 and the two major water resources
development programs were completed in early 1979. Substantial improvements
to the distribution system, required to enable full utilization to be made of
the new water sources, are under implementation. Tariff increases have been
implemented recently, and a reorganization of the management, accounting and
financial systems is under consideration.
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 883/360, Ceyhan Aslantas Multipurpose Project; US$44 million
loan and US$30 million credit of March 22, 1973. Effective Date; March 20,
1974. Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
Following delays due to difficult rock conditions and inappropriate
tunnelling methods, two diversion tunnels have been completed, about two years
behind appraisal estimate. The upstream coffer dam has also been completed.
Progress in 1980 was in general satisfactory. The pace of construction of the
power-house was lower than forecast, but is not expected to delay completion.
The construction of the irrigation system is progressing, with the system now
ready to transport irrigation water to about 30,000 ha, one third of the
target. On-farm works are progressing steadily, with about 50 percent
completed. Tile drainage is being delayed until the main drains are located.
Staffing of the extension service is satisfactory except as regards consul-
tants; the Government is taking steps to hire the latter. Project is expected
to be completed by end 1983.
Ln. No. 893 Turkish State Railways; US$47 million loan of May 25, 1973.
Effective Date: August 28, 1973. Closing Date; June 30, 1981.
After initial delays, physical progress, including track renewals,
rolling stock, and locomotive production, the latter financed by the European
Investment Bank, is satisfactory. Over 95 percent of the loan has been
disbursed and procurement action has been completed for use of the remaining
loan funds. Despite several tariff increases since the loan was made, the
Railways have continued to fall short of the financial targets in the revised
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Plan of Action agreed with the Bank in mid-1975. However, it is hoped that
further increases in passenger fares and freight tariffs averaging 70 to 170
percent, which became effective in January 1980, will improve the Railways'
financial situation. While the dieselization program is making satisfactory
progress, other measures to improve operational efficiency, such as
appropriate manpower planning, have not been given sufficient attention.
Project is expected to be closed on schedule.
Ln. No. 957 Antalya/Akdeniz Forest Utilization Project; US$40 million loan of
January 28, 1974. Effective Date: May 26, 1976. Closing Date: June 30,
1982.
Construction is substantially completed. Most of the main ancillary
process equipment is in place, but construction is hindered by material
shortages. The project is expected to be completed by January 1982 and
production commence in mid-year, two and a half years behind the revised
schedule. Sufficient foreign currency is available to complete the project.
Local currency payments for the Akdeniz establishment are now being made.
Substantial price increases in 1980 should enable the company to meet most of
the local currency requirements.
Ln. No. 1023 Elbistan Lignite Mine and Power Project; US$148 million loan of
June 28, 1974. Effective Date; June 1, 1976. Closing Date; July 30, 1982.
Project implementation had been delayed by critical problems,
including insufficient staff, inefficient management, inadequate coordination
among various agencies and unsatisfactory performance of civil contractors.
Following continuous Bank and co-lender reviews of the situation with the
Turkish authorities from early 1977, the remedial measures initiated by Turkey
resulted in some improvement of project execution, until mid-1979. However,
continuing and serious shortage of local funds has affected project progress,
which has been aggravated by staff and management deficiencies. The Govern-
ment's expected timely provision of adequate local funds for this high
priority project from the Structural Adjustment Loan Counterpart Funds has
helped resume momentum. The colenders and the Government agreed in November
1980 on a detailed program of action to overcome remaining implementation
problems; this program is now being implemented.
Ln. No. 1130 Corum-Cankiri Rural Development; US$75 million loan of June 23,
1975. Effective Date; January 22, 1976. Closing Date; December 31, 1981.
The project is in general progressing satisfactorily though because
of disruptions in construction it is probable that the irrigation works will
be completed only by end 1983. Corum dam has been completed as also the works
to divert run-off from 5 nearby watersheds. Kumbaba pumping station is ready,

and irrigation has started. Alaca dam is expected to be completed by end
1981. Damage to the Alaca diversion tunnel, because of rock slides, has been
repaired and the tunnel lining is almost finished. Contracts for the irri-
gation system of the Guldercek area has been awarded and work is in progress.
The project extension service is operating successfully and its impact on
agriculture is promising. The Government has replaced one of the two vacant
consultant posts. Further construction of village centers is being delayed
until agreement is reached on satisfactory plan for using and maintaining
existing centers and plans for additional centers are revised.
Ln. No. 1194 Second TEK Power Transmission Project: US$56 million loan of
June 14, 1976. Effective Date: April, 21, 1978. Closing Date: December 31,
1981.
Procurement action is almost complete, somewhat behind schedule, and
almost the entire loan is committed.
Ln. No. 1248 Agricultural Credit and Agroindustries: US$54.3 million loan of
May 5, 1976. Effective Date; May 11, 1977. Closing Date; September 30,
1981.
The ferryship component has been implemented, and the two roll-on and
roll-off ships purchased under this project and the Fruit and Vegetable Export
project are now operating a regularly scheduled service between ports in
Turkey and two ports in Italy. The implementation of agro-industries
component is delayed, mainly due to investors' reluctance to assume the
foreign exchange risk. Government is reviewing possible measures to overcome
this problem. The Agricultural Bank (TCZB) has introduced improved lending
procedures for its ongoing supervised credit program, and this component is
being implemented satisfactorily. After considerable delay, consultants have
begun the study of TCZB's structure and procedures. At the Borrower's
request, a cattle-fattening component of the Project, and US$7.7 million of
the original Loan amount of $63 million allocated for this purpose, were
cancelled on May 5, 1977. Also, as provided for in the Loan Agreement, $1.04
million for training was cancelled on December 22, 1977, following approval of
UNDP funds for this purpose.
Ln. No. 1258 Balikesir Newsprint; US$70 million loan of May 21, 1976.
Effective Date: October 15, 1976. Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project is nearing physical completion. The sawmill has begun
operations, although wood supply and marketing problems now must be resolved.
Recent price increases have helped to correct the local currency shortage
situation and the project is expected to start production in early 1981, 2
years behind the appraisal schedule. Trial production runs have already begun.

Ln. No. 1265 Livestock III; US$21.5 million loan of May 26, 1976. Effective
Date: February 25, 1977. Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
After a slower than anticipated start-up, project implementation
improved but has recently deteriorated due to resource constraints affecting
field staff travel. This has adversely affected the preparation of farm
development plans. Though project area offices have been established, they
are not fully staffed. Government has taken some measures, and is reviewing
others to correct the situation. A higher than expected proportion of
sub-loans has been made to small farmers. The Governmental budget required
for 1981 has been approved in its entirety.
Ln. No. 1310 South Antalya Tourism Infrastructure: US$26 million loan of
July 9, 1976. Effective Date; March 1, 1978. Closing Date: December 31,
1982.
Implementation of most project components is underway, with progress
being made in preparation of specifications and project design work, although
the pace of overall project implementation is somewhat slower than expected
due to staffing constraints and difficulties in ensuring adequate
inter-ministerial and inter-agency coordination. However, measures to
strengthen the Project Unit and its consultants, the Tourism Bank, are being
taken.
Ln. No. 1379 DYB (State Investment Bank of Turkey): US$70 million loan of
March 23, 1977. Effective Date; July 21, 1977. Closing Date; March 31,
1982.
The loan is expected to be fully committed in the next few months.
DYB still has severe staff constraints, which it has in part overcome by
recruitment of additional junior staff. It hopes improved contract terms will
enable it to fill more senior positions as needed.
Ln. No. 1430 TSKB XII (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey): US$74.0
million loan of June 3, 1977. Effective Date; August 29, 1977. Closing
Date: December 31, 1981.
Progress is satisfactory and the loan has been fully committed. TSKB
has essentially reached its agreed targets for allocation of its resources to
projects in less developed regions and export-oriented industries. It has so
far been unable to raise resources in international capital markets as
expected because of Turkey's economic difficulties, but the interest of
several financing sources is anticipated once conditions permit renewed
efforts.

Ln. No. 1585 Northern Forestry; US$86.0 million loan of June 5, 1978.
Effective Date; October 30, 1978. Closing Date; March 31, 1986.
Industrial wood production for 1979 was close to forecasts but there
were significant shortfalls in some other targets, principally as a result of
Government budget cuts. Continuing local resource constraints have adversely
affected all targets during 1980, causing delays in preparation of forest
management plans over about 22 percent of the project area and timely payment
by SEEs' for timber delivery. Foreign procurement is effectively up to date
but local state enterprises have been unable to supply much of the locally
produced equipment (principally vehicles to replace existing stocks).
Consideration is being given to procuring them internationally.
Ln. No. 1586 Livestock IV: US$24.0 million loan of June 5, 1978. Effective
Date; October 31, 1978. Closing Date; June 30, 1985.
The supervised credit program for farm development has been
initiated. The milk industry study has been satisfactorily completed.
International recruitment of technical specialists, considerably delayed, is
underway, and the staffing requirements agreed upon with the Bank have been
met. The 1981 budget has been approved in its entirety.
Ln. No. 1606 Erdemir Stage II Steel; US$95.0 million loan of June 30, 1978.
Effective Date: July 30, 1979. Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
