Equally important in this\n            project is the attempt to assist SOCADA, the CAR's\n            major rural development institution, to become a more\n            effective and financially sound development agency. As a\n            means of achieving these objectives, the project aims to:\n            (i) strengthen agricultural extension service; (ii) provide\n            production inputs (fertilizer, insecticides) and\n            agricultural implements; (iii) support applied research and\n            seed multiplication programs; (iv) promote animal traction;\n            (v) rehabilitate 950 km and periodic maintenance of 2300 km\n            of feeder roads; (vi) construct about 150 village water\n            wells; (vii) improve the country's five cotton\n            ginneries; (viii) provide workshops and equipment to improve\n            the maintenance capacity for SOCADA's agricultural\n            transport fleet; and (ix) establish a project monitoring and\n            evaluation system."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
