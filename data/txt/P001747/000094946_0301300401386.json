The lessons learned indicated that\n            the project was streamlined to focus on legal reform.\n            Matching of the grant and the public-private dialogue\n            contributed to the success of the project. The project\n            performed better when the private sector increased its\n            involvement following a restructuring. The moderator that\n            was carrying out the technical work for the Private-Public\n            Commission did not engage the stakeholders, and the\n            technical work has not had as much impact as would have been\n            expected. The work of the Financial Sector Commission\n            demonstrated that the appointment of experienced, and\n            dynamic persons helps to ensure that the project meets its objective."}, "docdt": "2002-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
