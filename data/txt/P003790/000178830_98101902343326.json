assist the Government's efforts to increase rice\n            production and to develop islands other than Java by\n            completing the partly constructed Kosinggolan irrigation\n            system on the Dumoga left bank, and constructing the right\n            bank Toraut irrigation system (together forming the 11,600\n            ha Dumoga irrigation scheme) in North Sulawesi. The project\n            will provide special environmental protection through\n            creation of a Nature Reserve covering the Dumoga catchment\n            area. Planning and programming activities of the Directorate\n            of Water Resources Development (DGWRD) will be expanded and\n            strengthened, topographic surveys and mapping improved, and\n            studies, investigations and engineering design for\n            irrigation supporting the transmigration program and for\n            further irrigation upgrading on Java will be carried out.\n            The Dumoga project will create a demand for some 25,000\n            man-years of labor over the five year construction period,\n            and will increase rice production by about 46,000 tons per\n            year by 1989."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
