The lessons\n            learned indicate that the non-additionality of Bank-lending\n            greatly complicates the introduction of new approaches and\n            structures for development. Projects that finance small,\n            demand-driven community subprojects through decentralized\n            implementation structures must greatly simplify financial\n            management processes especially those related to the\n            validation of disbursements and expenditures. Innovative\n            projects and Adaptable Program Loans (APLs) require early,\n            in-depth evaluation before new phases, expansions or major\n            implementation changes. A strong management information\n            system and an efficient administrative structure are needed,\n            as in any project. Mainstreaming and scaling-up of projects\n            is extremely desirable from many perspectives. Given the\n            space and the flexibility, the states can innovate and\n            develop appropriate solutions to address implementation\n            issues and create more favorable environments for\n            implementation, tailored to their particular environment.\n            Direct disbursement of resources to farmers' groups for\n            their own administration dramatically decreases the time\n            required to initiate local projects. The regional councils\n            were useful instruments for improving transparency and\n            accountability with respect to development investments. In\n            the later transition to Departmental and Municipal\n            Development Councils these could have remained a bit longer\n            in place to transfer their experience and facilitate the\n            change to the new structures."}, "docdt": "2004-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
