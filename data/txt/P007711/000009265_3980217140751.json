the poorest of the country, through sustainable\n            increases in productivity and better food security. The\n            project consists of four components. First, productive\n            investments will finance demand-driven investment\n            sub-projects for agricultural production, natural resources\n            management, processing activities, and productive\n            infrastructure. Second, community development will include\n            preparation of community-based natural resources management\n            plans and small works associated with them; small projects\n            related to community activities; and training and workshops\n            to facilitate beneficiary participation in the project.\n            Third, technical support covers the provision of extension\n            services, technical assistance, training for farmers,\n            producers organizations, women's groups, and small\n            entrepreneurs. Fourth, institutional strengthening and\n            project administration will support project management and\n            include expenses associated with institutional strengthening."}, "docdt": "1997-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
