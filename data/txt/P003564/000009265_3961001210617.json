to assist\n            Beijing Municipality to plan cost-effective strategies for a\n            comprehensive environmental protection program, strengthen\n            the policy and institutional framework required, and support\n            priority investments needed to start the process.  The\n            project will address pollution problems associated with air\n            and water quality, and the disposal of domestic and\n            industrial solid wastes.  The physical works include: (a)\n            the construction of sewer networks to prevent pollution of\n            groundwater and the city's waterways; (b) the\n            construction of a pressurized hot water piping system for\n            district heating to alleviate air pollution from the burning\n            of coal at domestic residences; (c) renovation of a number\n            of highly polluting industries, and, in some cases,\n            relocation of these industries from the inner city area; and\n            (d) construction of a sanitary landfill and procurement of\n            equipment for municipal solid waste disposal.  Technical\n            assistance will be included for studies to develop cost\n            effective plans which consider collectively the\n            environmental goals and resource needs between the various\n            economic and service sectors in order to arrive at an\n            optimal solution that can be sustained by the municipality.\n            A training component will be included to help improve the\n            environmental management capability of key staff of the\n            Environmental Protection Bureau and institutions providing\n            urban environmental services."}, "docdt": "1991-10-16T00:00:00Z"}
