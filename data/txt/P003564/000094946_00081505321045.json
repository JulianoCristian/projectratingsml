the project is\n            satisfactory, with a likely sustainability. Nonetheless, key\n            lessons suggest that, although broad, and complex projects\n            do provide an opportunity to learn, while supporting the\n            borrower's comprehensive programs, it limits the\n            opportunity of significant Bank's contribution to\n            physical, and institutional improvement. Furthermore,\n            institutional development may be hindered by the exclusive\n            focus on form, and structure, whereas broader governance,\n            focusing on policies, and performance should be addressed.\n            For instance, industrial pollution can be better addressed\n            through strict market-based financing, focusing on\n            commercial viability, strong regulations, and, a limited\n            public assistance to channel solely pollution control, for\n            the low increases in management efficiency of district\n            heating, energy, and pollution control, indicate the\n            desirability of smaller market-based systems. Finally, it is\n            suggested that in order to maximize the value of large-scale\n            studies, clear policy motivation, and an institutional\n            basis, are essential factors to support this value."}, "docdt": "2000-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
