Construction\n            works include the rehabilitation of roads, flood control,\n            and irrigation systems, in addition to schools\n            rehabilitation. Moreover, the project will assist the\n            Government in formulating a long-term strategy, aimed at\n            reducing the country's vulnerability to flooding.\n            Nonetheless, potential risks include the occurrence of\n            flooding during project implementation, therefore damaging\n            project investments, and, weak implementation capacity, and\n            delays due to slow procurement processes. However,\n            implementation risks will be minimized by using existing\n            agencies, while damage from recurring floods would be\n            minimized by assisting the Government in developing a\n            long-term strategy to reduce vulnerability to floods."}, "docdt": "2001-02-16T00:00:00Z"}
