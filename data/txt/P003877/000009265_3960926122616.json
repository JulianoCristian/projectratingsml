the condition of these roads through rehabilitation and\n            maintenance in 78 districts.  To that end, the project\n            provides for:  (a) institutional reform through realignment\n            of responsibilities for district roads programs among\n            central, provincial and district government agencies;(b)\n            rehabilitation improvement of about 6,000 km of district\n            roads; (c) financing parts of a three-year program of\n            maintenance in the project districts; and (d) a pilot scheme\n            to improve existing labor-based road construction and\n            maintenance methods and introduction of new techniques for\n            this purpose.  Further to this, the project provides (e)\n            construction/rehabilitation of workshops and laboratories;\n            (f) equipment for construction and maintenance works,\n            workshops and laboratories; (g) technical assistance for\n            project implementation, training and studies of district\n            roads contractors and road components of development\n            schemes; and (h) in-country and overseas training."}, "docdt": "1987-10-12T00:00:00Z"}
