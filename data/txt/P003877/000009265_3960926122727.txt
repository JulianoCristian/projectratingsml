MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A SECOND RURAL ROADS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed develop-
ment loan to the Republic of Indonesia for US$1900 million is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be for 20 years, including five years of
grace, at the standard variable interest rate and help finance a second rural
roads development project.
2.        Background.  Indonesia's road network comprises some 205,000 km of
classified roads. About 70% of the roads are administered by 243 districts
through the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the remainder by the national
and provincial road authorities through the Directorate General of Highways
(DGH) of the Ministry of Public Works and the Provincial Public Works
Departments (DPUPs), respectively. District (rural) roads are generally in
poor condition and practically unmaintainable. Improvement in the condition
of the roads is essential in view of their economic and social importance in a
country where 75% of the population lives in rural areas, transmigration is
opening up new areas, and agriculture comprises some 252 of GDP. The impor-
tance of district roads is reflected in the traffic levels carried, which
range between 50 and 200 vehicles per day. In recognition of the key role of
district roads in the development of the rural areas, the Government initiated
large-scale funding programs for improvements in the late 1970s and increased
budgetary allocations steadily up to FY86/87. This effort received support in
25 districts from the Bank finarced First Rural Roads Development Project
(Loan No. 2083-IND of January 22, 1982) and in some 80 other districts from
other donors.
3.        The district roads programs have experienced serious problems,
including weak planning and monitoring, inadequate design and construction
standards, poor construction, inefficient supervision and lack of maintenance,
that have resulted in very short investment lives for the roads. The problems
arise mostly from the complex and inadequate institutional arrangements for
district roads. Neither the MHA as overall manager at the central government
level nor the district public works departments as implementing agencies at
the district level, have the technical capabilities to plan and execute large
district road programs.
4.        In early 1986, when implementation of the First Rural Roads
Development Project was coming to a halt because of these problems, a Steering
Committee for District Roads, involving MHA, DGH, Bappenas and MOF, was
established to address the most urgent problems and this initiative together
with the restructuring and strengthening of the Project Management Unit (PMU),
achieved considerable success. Subsequently, the Government has decided to
implement permanent institutional reforms to overcome the above problems in
the development of district roads and issued a Ministerial Instruction and
implementation guidelines for this purpose in May 1987. The key elements of
the reforms consist of the introduction of direct technical involvement of the



- 2 -
DGH and the relatively well developed DPUPs in the district roads programs and
of arrangements to gradually upgrade capacity at the district level so that
the districts eventually can manage their programs themselves.
5.        Rationale for Bank Group Involvement.  The Government recognizes the
need for urgent improvement of district roads to facilitate development of the
rural areas and is allocating considerable resources for this purpose. How-
ever, for these resources to be used efficiently, institutional reforms are
required to realign responsibilities among central, provincial, and district
government agencies involved in district road programs. These reforms consti-
tute a major undertaking with many dimensions. The Bank's involvement is in-
tended to help overcome traditional resistance to institutional changes in the
subsector, and ensure satisfactory implementation of reforms over a realistic
time frame. Furthermore, in view of the deterioration in the Government bud-
getary situation, there is a risk that cutbacks in budgetary allocations for
roads will undo the modest but important improvement in the district road net-
work achieved in recent years. Bank involvement would contribute to the
availability of reasonably adequate funds for district roads development and
maintenance and also to better utilization of resources.
6.        Project Objectives.  The aims of the proje t are:  (a) to bring
about improvements in the management of district road programs in terms of:
(i) planning and monitoring; (ii) design and construction standards;
(iii) work supervision; and (iv) maintenance, through institutional reform
consisting of realignment of responsibilities among ministries and agencies
involved in district roads programs, including roads in transmigration areas;
(b) to provide financial support for the Government's district roads programs;
and (c) to improve existing labor based construction and maintenance
techniques for such roads and to introduce new appropriate techniques for this
purpose.
7.        Project Description.  The project would be implemented in 78
districts in 11 provinces over a three-year period and comprises the
following:
(a)  realignment of the roles and responsibilities of the institutions
and agencies at the central, provincial and district levels
concerned with district roads program;
(b)  financing of parts of the annual district roads rehabilitation!
improvement programs for 1988/89-1990/91 in the project districts
totalling some 6,000 km or about 13Z of the network of these
districts;
(c)  financing of parts of the annual district roads maintenance programs
for 1988/89-1990/91 in the project districts;
(d)  financing of fully equipped workshops and basic soils and materials
Laboratories in project districts where none exist, and tools/
equipment for existing district workshops and laboratories;



-3-
(e) a pilot scheme to improve existing labor-based road construction and
maintenance methods, and to introduce appropriate new techniques for
this purpose;
(f) equipment and spare parts for road maintenance and improvement works
in the project districts;
(g)  consultant services to assist in institutional reform and associated
training programs and in the preparation of annual work programs and
project implementation and to train district staff in those
functions and to carry out studies of civil works contractors, and
roads built under development schemes; and
(h)  training for some 2,000 provincial and district staff concerned with
roads and overseas training for some 100 middle and higher level
provincial and district road officials.
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D, respec-
tively. A map No. 20238 showing the project districts is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 6905-IND dated September 28, 1987 is being
distributed separately.
8.        Actions Agreed.  At negotiations the GOI agreed on the following
main actions:
(a) implementation of the institutional reforms over a three year
period, according to an agreed Action Plan and timetable to be
reviewed and updated by March 31, each year;
(b) by February 29, 1988 preparation of a maintenance strategy for
district roads and by March 31, 1988 formulation of evaluation
-  methods for proposed road works which are not amenable to the
standard approach;
(c) preparation of the three annual road rehabilitation/improvement
programs by February 29, 1988, December 31, 1988 and 1989 respec-
tively, based on agreed criteria and in the context of a balanced
highway sector expenditure program (only the districts which have
implemented satisfactorily their 1988/89 and 1989/90 rehabilitation/
improvement and maintenance progra$.s would be eligible to the proj-
ect's 1989/90 and 1990/91 rehabilitation/improvement programs
respectively);
(d) submission by February 29, 1988, December 31, 1988 and 1989, of
annual maintenance programs (including both physical and budgetary
aspects) satisfactory to the Bank, based on the agreed strategy;
(e) restructuring and strengthening of the PMU through the appointment
of a full time Unit Chief and the employment of an additional number
of qualified key staff.



9.        Benefits.  Improving the generally poor condition of district roads
will reduce transport costs in the rural areas. Road users will benefit from
these cost reductions which are expected to be passed on to producers and
consumers in the rural areas.  The quantified transport cost reductions are
estimated to yield an ERR of 29%. The roadworks are expected to generate some
80,000 man-years of employment during the three year project implementation
period. In addition, there are other, less easily quantifiable benefits, such
as the impact of the institutional reforms which would increase the efficiency
of the district roads programs in general.
10.       Risks.  The main risk of the project is that implementation of the
institutional reforms could be slower than anticipated and that improvements
in program formulation and implementation could be delayed. This risk,
however, has in part been averted by ensuring that all institutional reforms
are agreed and that the corresponding Ministerial Instruction and implementing
guidelines are already issued. Agreement has been reached with GOI on an
adequate Action Plan for implementation of the reforms and implementation of
the Plan will be carefully monitored .
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend thac the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
