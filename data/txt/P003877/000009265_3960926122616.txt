SECOND RURAL ROADS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:           Republic of Indonesia
Beneficiary:        The 78 districts participating in the project
Amount:             US$190.0 million equivalent
Terms:              Twenty years, including five years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate
Purpose:            To reform and strengthen the institutions concerned with
district roads in Indonesia and to improve the condition
of these roads through rehabilitation and maintenance in
78 districts. The project will provide for: (a) insti-
tutional reform through realignment of responsibilities
for district roads programs among central, provincial and
district government agencies; (b) rehabilitation/
improvement of about 6,000 km of district roads;
(c) financing parts of a three-year program of maintenance
in the project districts; (d) a pilot scheme to improve
existing labor-based road construction and maintenance
methods and introduction of new techniques for this
purpose; (e) construction/rehabilitation of workshops and
laboratories; (f) equipment for construction and main-
tenance works, workshops and laboratories; (g) technical
assistance for project implementation, training and
studies of district roads contractors and road components
of development schemes; and (h) in-country and overseas
training.
Risks:              The main risks are slow implementation of the institu-
tional reform and of the improvements in program
formulation and implementation. The project includes
measures to minimize these risks.

I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Economic and Sector Setting
1.1       Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago nation, extends some
5,000 km across the equator and comprises several thousand islands; the more
important of these are Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan and Sulawesi. The country is
endowed with considerable natural resources. Until the early 1970s agricul-
ture and forestry constituted the mainstay of the economy and were the main
source of foreign exchange. Oil assumed a more prominent position in the
economy when oil prices rose in 1974 and since then the economic situation has
been closely tied to developments in the oil mtLrket. In recent years the
Government has made efforts to broaden the manufacturing base and axport more
manufactured products. However, agriculture with a 25% share of the GDP,
remains the backbone of the economy. It provides employment to more than 50X
of the population and accounts fo= about 50% of non-oil exports.
1.2       The distribution of population and economic activities is very
uneven. High population densities, smallholder agriculture and a relatively
well-developed market economy are found on the islands of Js.val Bali and
Lombok and in some parts of Sumatra and Sulawesi. Estates and commercial
agriculture are prevalent in the relatively less populated areas of the larger
islands. Subsistence agriculture is still important in outlying areas of
Kalimantan and Irian Jaya. About 751 of the population lives in rural areas.
1.3       Transport flows consist mainly of exports of primary products,
imports of capital goods and consumer products and movement of intermediate
products and staple produce from surplus to consuming regions. In the rural
areas there are heavy farm-to-market flows. As the manufacturing base is
still relatively limited, there is as yet no large-scale exchange of manufac-
tured goods between regions. Some ten transport corridors, however, display
intense transport activity. These are mainly on Java and between Java and
selected points on the other main islands. Jakarta and Surabaya are the focal
points of transportation flows, Jakarta for the western part and Surabaya for
the eastern part of the nation. All transport modes--road, rail, shipping,
air and river--play a role in Indonesia's transport system, and they are more
often complementary to each other rather than competitive. With an estimated
share of 701 of cargo and 80% of passenger traffic, road transport, however,
is the dominant mode. In all parts of the courntry it plays a key role in
promoting ,he economic interchange between the rural and urban areas.  In view
of the archipelagic nature of the country, shipping and air transport are
critical for economic and political integration.
B. Government Sector and Subsector Objectives
1.4       The Government's objectives for transport emphasize:  developing
transport in line with the needs of the productive sectors; promoting the
economic and social integration of the different regions and fostering
national unity; opening up remote regions through the so-called pioneer
services; creating an integrated transport system; improving the reliability
and safety of transport services; and promoting efficiency in the various
modes and transport agencies.



- 2 -
1.5       In the early national development plans the focus was on upgrading
and developing the main road network and establishing pioneer services to
remote or poorly accessible areas. This was followed by greater emphasis on
expansion and modernization of facilities in the other subsectors, on district
road development and on rehabilitation of all road classes. Differences in
emphasis are to be noted between the Sumatra-Java-Bali-Lombok chain of
islands, which has a relatively complete network of land transport and ferry
links, and the other islands, which in general have lower population densities
and less complete transportation networks. Since the mid-1970s the Government
has also established many state enterprises in pursuit of social and/or equity
objectives; these have been given generous financial assistance. In recent
years, in line with increased emphasis on efficiency, the role of the private
sector and the need for introducing a commercial approach in state enterprises
have received more attention. Adequate maintenance of existing assets was not
accorded high priority in the past but is now being recognized as an important
objective and Bank finenced projects are assisting in introducing effective
maintenance programs.
1.6       The district (rural) roads improvement programs are seen as the main
instrument to draw rural and remote areas into the market economy, support
major transmigration schemes, and achieve equity and uecentralization objec-
tives by redistributing Central Government funds to the regions. The economic
and social importance of district roads is highlighted by the high percentage
of the population living in rural areas and by the relatively high traffic
volumes on district roads (mostly in the range of 50-200 vehicles/day). The
Government, recognizing the key role of district roads in the development of
the rural areas, initiated large-scale funding programs aimed at district road
improvement in the late 1970s. The first Rural Roads Development Project (Ln
2083-IND) provided funds to support this program.
C. Government Sector Organization
1.7       The organizational structure of the Government has both a functional
(line ministries) and a regional dimension. Government authority, however, is
essentially centralized: policy-making power is vested in the President and
his Cabinet. The main line ministries and agencies which have responsi-
bilities in transport--the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS),
the Ministry of Communications (MOC), the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) (for
the development and upkeep of national and provincial roads), and the Ministry
of Home Affairs (MHA) through the Directorate General of Regional Development
(DGRD) (for the development and upkeep of district roads)--are active both at
the national and regional government levels. The regional government has
three levels: the provinces; the districts and municipalities (Kabupaten and
Kotamadya); and the villages (Desa). The first two have some degree of
autonomy. Subject to the approval of the next higher level, they have some
regulatory powers. In addition, they can levy taxes and charges to supplement
the budgetary transfers from the Central Government, within the constraints
established by it. The province is headed by a governor, appointed by the
President and responsible to him, but he reports administratively to the
MHA. The governor coordinates the activities of the regional offices of all
Central Government line agencies represented at the provincial level. The
districts are headed by a bupati who is appointed by the Minister of the MHA,



- 3 -
on the advice of the provincial governor. The bupati is responsible for all
district government activities and is the only link between the district staff
and their counterparts in the provincial and Central Government organizations;
no formal organizational ties exist. The bupati reports directly to the
governor. In the highway sector, this institutional setup, which leaves the
district road officials largely on their own, has been detrimental to the
effectiveness of the district roads program (paras. 1.16, 2.14).
D. Planning and Sector Expenditures
1.8       Transport secLor planning responsibilities are shared by MOC, which
covers planning for air, land and sea transport and intermodal coordination;
MPW, which covers planning for highways; and BAPPE1NAS, which covers overall
coordination. MOC's central planning function is performed by the Bureau of
Planning (which is at echelon II level) under the Secretariat General. In
addition, there are planning divisions for air, land and sea transport (at
echelon III) in each of the modal directorates general of MOC. The planning
function for highways comes under the Directorate General of Highways (DGH) of
HPW and is at directorate (echelon II) level and thus has been accorded a
higher status and role than is the case in the modal directorates of MOC. The
planning of district road investments is essentially the responsibility of the
districts themselves within the framework of overall guidelines and a funding
envelope for each district set by the Central Government. (Planning for
roads, district roads in particular, is discussed in Chapter II.)
1.9       Transport planning focusses on the five-year development plans and
the annual uudget cycle. The five-year plans were first introduced in 1969
and the current plan--thie fourth--covers the period FYs84-89. These plans
define broad development objectives and over time have become more explicit in
terms of physical targets for new investments. The plans, however, are
essentially static: while substantial resources are devoted to their initial
preparation there is only limited provision for mid-term or annual reviews/
updating or for rolling medium-term plans. Consequently, the annual tranches
of the plan tend to lose relevance during the middle and later years as
economic circumstances deviate from those underlying plan preparation.
Planning as part of the annual budget cycle focuses narrowly on individual
aevelopment projects and is weak in terms of priority ranking and overall
coordination of investments.
1.10      In absolute terms, allocations to transport under the successive
plans have continued to increase. The current plan allocated Rp 9,106 billion
to transport or 11.6X of total plan outlays. However, the share allocated to
transport has decreased gradually from an initial 17% in the first plan. In
the first two plans three-quarters of transport inves-.ments were allocated to
roads but in the last plan the share for roads was less than half
(Table 1.1). In parallel, within the road subsector the emphasis has shifted
from road construction to road betterment. In broad terms, these shifts
correspond to changing needs and intersectoral and intrasectoral priorities.



E. Sector Performance
1.11      Overall, the transport sector has been able to meet the rapidly
growing transport needs of the economy, but capacity bottlenecks exist on
particular links, and in certain parts of the country transport availability
remains poor. Efficiency in large segments of the sector--rail transport,
ports and shipping--is inadequate and costs are higher than they could be.
The causes of inefficient operations are numerous and partly relate to the
public enterprise status of many transport operators characterized by
ponderous bureaucratic procedures, Government interference in management and
poor accountability. Other causes can be found in excessive regulation, the
compartmentalization of markets, lack of effective competition and shortage of
managerial skills. The Government has recognized some of the main deficiences
and their causes and has initiated measures to remedy the most significant
problems, e.g., bold measures were taken in April 1985 to remove cumbersome
regulations in the maritime subsector. The ongoing ports and railway projects
support specific programs aimed at improving performance.
1.12      Even though the road transport industry is relatively efficient,
total road transport system costs are high due to three factors which have led
to rapidly deteriorating roads: (i) inadequate road design and construction
standards (for national and provincial roads this is now largely a problem of
the past); (ii) inadequate road maintenance; and (iii) vehicle overloading.
These problems are more pervasive and deepseated in the district roads
subsector than for national and provincial roads. However, the Government has
recognized the importance of both adequate initial standards and subsequent
maintenance and has made significant improvement in the composition of the
highway expenditure program. Continued improvements are necessary,
particularly for district roads, and will be supported under the proposed
project.
F. Bank Goals and Strategy in the Sector
1.13      The uncertain outlook for oil prices and the Government's weakened
budgetary situation underline the importance of measures to promote the
transition to a more diversified economy. Transport sector support for these
measures would principally aim at reducing transport costs and enhancing the
flexibility and responsiveness of transport services. The broad areas where
such improvements can and should be achieved are sufficiently clear, and
current projects focus on improving the efficiency in highway construction and
maintenance, in the ports sector and in railways. Bank sector work and
project supervision activities are directed at: (i) sharpening Bank knowledge
of sector performance as it is determined by Government policies and by
institutional or structural factors; (ii) identifying key needs and, in
collaboration with the Government, establishing programs of priority measures
which can be supported by Bank lending.
G. Experience under Previous Bank-Financed Highway Projects
1.14      The Bank has assisted Indonesia's transport sector through four
maritime projects (two shipping and two port projects), one railway project,
two fertilizer distribution projects and nine road projects. Beginning in



- 5 -
1969, the Bank has participated particularly in the road subsector: five
highway projects, a rural roads development project, a toll road project and
two highway maintenance/betterment projects. The nine highway loans and
credits total US$1,039.2 million (US$869.2 million for highways and US$85 mil-
lion each for rural roads and toll roads), an average of 10% of the annual
expenditures on roads. This average will increase in 1987 to about 15% and
then to about 20% when the Second Rural Roads Development Project becotmies
effective.
1.15      Of the nine road projects financed by the Bank, five have been
satisfactorily completed. Project Performance Audit reports have been
prepared for the first four, and a Project Completion Report is being prepared
for the fifth. The Project Performance Report for the Second and Third
Highway Projects (Sec. M81-4, dated January 6, 1981) found that the second
project had minor delays and cost overruns, while the third had significant
delays because of mobilization problems in a very remote area and unusually
wet weather and increased construction costs. The Project Completion Report,
dated June 15, 1984, for the fourth project found that: (i) construction
delays were significant (about two years), due mostly to the weak local
construction industry; (ii) cost overruns were minor; (iii) traffic increases
were much greater than expected at appraisal resulting in underdesigned works;
and (iv) maintenance was inadequate. The Highway Betterment Project
(Ln. 2404-IND) and the Highway Maintenance and Betterment Project (Ln. 2717-
IND) are progressing on schedule, and experience so far indicates that at the
central and provincial level, capacity for planning, designing and
implementing extensive highway programs has improved significantly in volume
and quality and further improvement is underway.
1.16      The experience with the ongoing Rural Roads Development Project (Ln
2083-IND; Closing Date December 31, 1987), on the other hand, has highlighted
several serious problems at district level, including weak planning and
monitoring, inadequate design and corqtruction standards, poor construction,
inefficient supervision, and lack of maintenance. All of these lead to very
short investment lives for the roads. Funding for maintenance was established
in 1984 (para. 2.31) and training of distriPt staff was carried out throughout
the project period (para. 2.17) but most of tale problems persisted until early
1986 when intensive discussions between the Bank and the GOI led to some
improvements through the setting up of a steering committee (para. 2.11);
these improvements were, however, limited to the 25 project districts. The
problems relate mostly to the complex and inadequate institutional setup:
neither the MHA as overall manager at the Central Government level nor the
district public works departments as implementing agencies at the lowest
echelon have the technical capabilities to plan and execute large district
road programs. The lessons learned from this project have been taken into
account in designing the proposed Second Rural Roads Development Project (see
Chapter III for details).

II. THE ROAD SUBSECTOR
A. Highway Netwo.k and Road Use
2.1       Indonesia's road network has grown rapidly in recent years, from
126,100 km in 1979 to 205,000 km in 1985 (national roads: 12,400 kmi; provin-
cial roads:  39,000 km; district roads:  142,600 km; and municipal roads:
11,000 km; see Table 2.1). Although this growth occurred mainly in the
district roads (they increased from 78,500 km in 19{1 to 142,600 km in 1985),
it resulted more from absorption of existing roads -  into the category of
district roads than from new construction, which has been very limited
recently since the emphasis for all road classes has been on betterment and
rehabilitation. The road network will be reclassified and upgraded during the
next 2-3 years with assistance from ongoing Bank-financed projects. In 1985,
82,115 km of the total road network were reported paved; about half of them
were district roads. In general the condition of the network has improved
steadily since rehabilitation began in 1969, after 30 years of neglect.
However, many roads are still in poor condition. The information available on
district roads suggests that most are unmaintainable (Tables 2.2 and 2.3).
Furthermore, an estimated 70% of the national and provincial roads still need
rehabilitating.
2.2       In step with an annual average increase of about 14% in the motor
vehicle fleet (Table 2.4), road traffic has grown rapidly during the last 15
years especially during 1972-79 when the domestic price of fuel was low.
Growth rates vary considerably among provinces, but averaged about 13%
annually during 1972-84: 17% between 1972 and 1979 and a more modest rate of
3% from 1982 to 1984 (Table 2.5). The highest traffic flows are on approach
roads to the cities of Jakarta, Surabaya and Bandung in Java, and Medan in
North Sumatra, where volumes range between 15,000 and 40,000 vehicles per day
(vpd). On Java major national roads typically carry 4,000-10,000 vpd and
provincial roads 1,000-4,000 vpd, on most of the other islands, typical
volumes are between 600 and 4,000 vpd.
2.3       Traffic on district roads is not counted systematically.  However,
counts available for a sizeable sample of roads from externally financed pre-
investment studies indicate wide variations in traffic levels between
provinces. Average annual daily traffio. (AADT) was estimated at about 160 vpd
on a sample of roads studied in early 1986 as part of the preparation for the
Second Rural Roads Development Project; the average for West Java was about
280 vpd as against 90 vpd for the outer islands (Table 2.6). In rural areas,
however, motor vehicles account for only a small fraction of total movements--
11% in the above sample period.  The remaining movements are non-motorized and
motorcycles--69% and 20% respectively in the sample.  Of the non-motorized
movements the largest part are pedestrians, with the balance being bicycles
and various forms of animal-drawn vehicles (Tables 2.7 and 2.8). These
figures underline the need to include in the economic evaluation of road
improvements their impact on non-motorized traffic.
1/   There are unknown lengths of village roads and other unclassified roads
in transmigration, estate and other development schemes.



2.4       Road traffic accidents are a serious socioeconomic problem in
Indonesia with about 11,000 fatalities reported annually. Studies financed
under previous highway projects have identified as causes: inadequacies in
the laws and regulations regarding vehicles and traffic and deficiencies in
their enforcement by the police. Measures to improve the situation are being
implemented under the Highway Betterment Project and the Highway Maintenance
and Betterment Project (see para. 2.9).
B. Road Transport Industry
2.5       An estimated 70% of all freight movements (ton/km) in Indonesia are
by roads. Surveys done in 1981 indicated that the share of the for-hire
trucking industry was 301 of the total; privately and publicly owned own
account operators had estimated shares of 45% and 25X, respectivelv. For-hire
operators outside the Jakarta region need a license issued by the level II
regional authorities; those within the region need one issued by the
Governor. The requirements for this license are minimal. In Java, but not in
the other islands, interprovincial road freight transport requires a route
license. In addition to licensing, trucking regulations cover restrictions on
operations in urban areas, weights and dimensions, vehicle inspections and
guideline tariffs for interprovincial transpurt. Many of these regulations
are not strictly enforced. Competition is intense in many submarkets, and
overall the industry is reasonably efficient. The supply and quality of
services are generally adequate; safety standards, however, are poor.
2.6       Buses are estimated to carry about 90% of passengers transported and
some 751 of the passenger-kms travelled. Intercity passenger transport is
provided primarily by private bus companies. PN DAMRI, the state-owned bus
company, provides most urban bus services outside of Jakarta, some interurban
services, and subsidired pioneer (perintis) services in remote areas where
operations are not commercially viable. Cooperatives, which are composed of
small operators who individually cannot meet minimum bus fleet size
requirements, provide short distance interurban, rural and urban services
using minibuses and microbuses. Bus transport is highly regulated; require-
ments and regulations cover availability of facilities, route licensing and
scheduling, fleet size and tariffs. Compliance with many of these regulations
and requirements is not well enforced. Tariffs generate adequate revenues for
interurban bus companies, while state-owned intraurban bus services are still
operated with substantial, but decreasing, subsidies since fares have been
gradually increased over the last few years.
C. Traffic and Transport Regulations
2.7       A new Road Traffic and Transport Law replacing the Highway Traffic
Law of 1933 was promulgated in 1965. It defines only the basic outlines of
the rules that govern the use of the road network. Since implementing
regulations were never issued, the regulations relating to the old law and
dating back to 1936 still apply. Moreover the provisions of these old
regulations have been subject to frequent amendments and refinement through
numerous decrees and regulations issued at various levels of government. This
has resulted in an ill defined and confusing body of regulations with
imprecise delineation of responsibilities which seriously hampers enforcement.



- 8 -
2.8       The above problems are particularly acute in the area of vehicle
axle weight controls. Full responsibility for on-the-road enforcement was
transferred recently from MOC's Directorate of Land Transport (DGLT) to the
police. Enforcement has been in a state of flux during the last few years
mostly because of the confusing status of the regulations, illegal fees, low
fines and the excessively restrictive and out-of-date legal axle load limits,
ranging from 1.5 tons to 8.0 tons. Random checking has been carried out at a
limited number of weighing stations, and DGLT's statistics show that overload-
ing has been significantly reduced. However, these findings conflict with
visual evidence and admissions from operators, so some verification of DGLT's
statistics is needed. It will be achieved during 1987 and 1988 by weigh-in-
motion measurements planned to supplement regular traffic counts for DGH's
pavement management system (para. 2.20). Furthermore, the Bank will review
with GOI its vehicle weight and axle load controls in connection with
revisions of the regulations for traffic and road transport (para. 2.9).
improvements in enforcement are expected to result from modernization of the
regulations.
2.9       Recommendations for modernizing and streamlining the legal framework
governing road traffic and transport have been prepared under various
studies.  GOI is presently developing comprehensive road transport legislation
consisting of four legal codes: the Highway Code, for the implementation of
the Road Law of 1980 which has been completed and was issued in 1985, and the
Traffic Code, Vehicle Code and Public and Commercial Road Transport Code.
Together these three would complete the legislation required to implement
adequately Road Traffic and Transport Law No. 3 of 1965. The Vehicle and
Traffic Codes have been drafted as part of the Highway Safety Program
(financed under the Fifth Highway Project) and are being reviewed by the
various ministries and agencies. MOC now intends to proceed with preparation
of the last component, the Public and Commercial Road Transport Code, and the
decrees and instructions required to implement the three other codes. The
Highway Maintenance and Betterment Project (Ln 2717-IND) is financing consult-
ants to assist the Government in drafting the remaining code and the decrees
and instructions required for implementation of all the codes. The Government
has committed itself under Ln 2717-IND to issue and implement the three
remaining codes no later than June 30, 1988.
D. Admii.istration, Staff and Training, Accounts and Audits
2.10      The highway network is administered by the public works agencies of
the various tiers of government in accordance with institutional and
functional responsibilities for the development and operation of highways.
These responsibilities were broadly defined in the Road Law of 1980 and its
implementation regulations of 1985. At the central level, the DGH has primary
responsibility for the road subsector (Chart 2.2). Road agencies at lower
levels are, respectively, the provincial public works departments (Dinas
Pekerjan Umum Propinsi-tMPUP) and the district/municipality public works
departments (Dinas Pekerjan Umum Kabupaten/Kotamadya-DPUK) (Charts 2.3, 2.4
and 2.5). An Indonesian Toll Roads Corporation, P.T. Jasa Marga, was
established in 1978 to develop and operate toll roads.



-9-
2.11      The DGH is responsible for the design and execution of most major
road works in Indonesia. It also coordinates the betterment, maintenance and
minor construction programs which are carried out by the DPUPs and it operates
a national highway equipment pool.  In2the last few years, through the
Steering Committee for District Roads - and its Project Management Unit (PMU)
for externally assisted projects, DCH has become increasingly involved in
assisting with the management of the district road program funded through
Inpres Jalan (para. 2.35).
2.12      Provincial and district road agencies are part of a common system
under the DGRD in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) (Charts 2.1, 2.1A), which
is responsible, through the Governor, for regulating and monitoring the
governance of local authorities. It also controls appointments of their
senior officials, regulates staffing and salaries, reviews their development
plans, budgets and financial performance. For technical guidance, these road
agencies have access to DGH. However, in practice the application of this
system is ineffective because it gives rise to many subtle and complex
arrangements involving many interlocking relationships.
2.13      Theoretically, the various provincial p!lic works functions are
handled by separate departments within the DPUPs;-  for roads it is the Dinas
Bina Marga (DBM). These departments are being established in the large
provinces where administrative capabilities are well developed. In most other
provinces staff and equipment for the various DPUP functions will continue to
be shared until sufficient managerial skills are developed for effective
provincial highway management. In order to overcome the shortcomings in
highway management at the provincial level, DCH has established Regional
Betterment Offices (RBOs) which design and supervise highway betterment
schemes, Vt these will be phased out as provincial highway management
improves.,   Assistance in developing highway management skills at the provin-
cial level is being provided under the Highway Maintenance and Betterment
Project and further assistance, with specific focus on establishing permanent
technical liaison with the DPUKs, will be provided under the proposed project
(para. 3.17).
2.14      At the central level, functions and responsibilities for the
development and maintenance of district roads are not clearly defined among
2/   The committee consists of the Deputy Chairman for Economic Affairs,
BAPPENAS, as Chairman and the members: Deputy Chairman for Regional
Development, BAPPENAS; Directors General for Regional Development and for
Regional Autonomy, both in MHA; Director General of Highways in MPW; and
Director General for Budget in MOF.
3/   Reorganization is planned based on a Ministerial Instruction of October
1986. Some aspects are still unclear and the new structure will hardly
be in place until late 1988.

given an echelon grading.



- 10 -
those departments in MHA, MPW and BAPPENAS which are concerned with these
roads. At the provincial and district levels, the principal organizations
associated with roads in conjunction with the DPUPs and DPUKs are the
Provincial Regional Planning Boards (BAPPEDA I), and the Development Bureaus
and the District Planning Boards (BAPPEDA II), of the Provincial and District
Secretariats, respectively. DPUPs report directly to the governor of the
province and DPUKs to the bupati of the district. The MPW provides the DPUPs
with technical direction and some administrative support and they act as the
implementing agencies for many of the Ministry's functions. Despite weak
capabilities, the districts have virtual control over their roads since there
is no direct line of communication between the DPUK and the DPUP and requests
for assistance from the DPUK must go through the bupati to the governor's
office and then to the DPUP. This complex and inadequate institutional setup
is the cause of most of the problems experienced in district roads development
and maintenance (para. 1.16). As a first step in resolving these problems,
GOI has issued a Ministerial Instruction for institutional reform for the
planning, programming, design, construction and maintenance of district roads
together with Guidelines for its implementation (para. 3.6). Furthermore, the
highest echelon officials in the district administration have recently heen
raised by one grade level, thus improving their career opportunities
significantly and removing a serious constraint in the development of the
capabilities of the districts.
2.15      At present, P.T. Jasa Marga's functions are effectively restricted
to the operation and maintenance of toll roads and bridges. Although its
charter provides for it to handle the development of the toll road network,
planning and design still remain in DCH.
2.16      In addition to the agencies mentioned above, other institutions are
involved in road development in the rural areas, particularly those concerned
with agricultural and transmigration schemes. The road components under these
schemes, however, are not adequately coordinated with the road authorities,
and their planning and implementation has suffered from many weaknesses. At
the planning stage, coordination between the Ministries of Agriculture and
Transmigration and the road authorities concerning network rationalization,
design and construction standards have been very poor or nonexistent; the
quality of the construction works has been deplorable and maintenance has also
been poor or nonexistent. As a result, these roads generally deteriorate to a
very critical state soon after completion. Moreover, Government policy is
that at the completion of these sphemes, the road infrastructure should, in
most cases, be handed over to the district authorities--only exceptionally, to
the provincial authorities. The district authorities are in most cases then
confronted with severe problems of reconstructing or rehabilitating these
roads, for which they are ill-prepared. The problem tends to be compounded by
the perception that these roads have lower priority than the existing district
roads. There is an urgent need, therefore, to institute improved arrangements
for handling the road components which are part of development schemes. For
this reason, the project includes a study to analyze and make recommendations
on: (a) design, construction, and maintenance standards for road components
of development schemes; (b) institutional responsibilities and processes for
programming, budgeting and implementing the road programs of development
schemes (including their maintenance); and (c) the process of transferring



- 11 -
these roads to district and provincial authorities, to ensure, inter alia,
that adequate funds would be budgetted for their maintenance and rehabilita-
tion, and the capabilities of local authorities would be upgraded as required
by their additional responsibilities. At negotiations, an agreement was
reached with GOI (a) on terms of reference for the study; and (b) that it
would be completed and submitted for the Bank's review no later than March 31,
1989. Its recommendations would be implemented, as appropriate, through
subsequent agricultuare or highway projects.
2.17      The steadily increasing volume of work and the quality of
engineering imposes strains on DGH as well as on the DPUPs and DPUKs.  The DCH
permanent staff has increased by some 10% annually over the last five years
while the number of nonpermanent employees has more than doubled over this
period. Total DGH staff now exceeds 8,000, 4,000 of whom are permanent.
About l1500 are professionals (about l,000 engineers). Despite substantial
efforts to expand and upgrade staff, the shortage of qualified personnel
remains an important problem for road authorities at all levels. Training
continues to be a major element in DCH manpower management through both MPW's
overall training activities and specific DCH programs, both of which have
trained several thousand DPUP and DPUK technical staff during the last five to
six years.  The MHA also has training programs for administrative functions,
and it occasionally conducts training in development planning for provincial
and district staff. The proposed project will provide for both classroom and
on-the-job training of DPUP and DPUK staff (paras. 3.17-3.20, 3.23).
2.18      The DGH's accounting procedures are adequate.  Accounts are audited
both internally and externally.  The MPW's Inspectorate General, which reports
directly to the Minister, does the internal auditing of DGH. The State
Auditors (BPKP) do the external auditing; these audits are satisfactory. The
Regional and Provincial Inspectorate of MHA audit the district and provincial
accounts internally; the BPKP does the external auditing.
E. Planning, Design and Construction
2.19      The DGH is directly responsible for the planning of national,
provincial, and toll roads, it plays an important role in urban road develop-
ment and it has a coordinating and advisory role for pl.nning the development
of district roads. The MPW's Directorate General of Human Settlement (Cipta
Karya) helps coordinate long-range planning of regional development, which is
carried out by MPW's various directorates.
2.20      The DGH's Directorate of Planning has improved its planning
capabilities through periodic data collection on traffic, including origin-
destination surveys and systematic annual road and bridge condition
inventories of all national and provincial roads. The planning methodologies
it applies for national and provincial roads are basically sound. Reliable
procedures have been developed for screening and ranking highway betterment
proposals. The Highway Maintenance and Betterment Project is assisting in the
establishment and operation of a pavement management system (PMS) for national
and provincial roads, its associated road inventory, and pavement condition
and traffic surveys, which will effectively integrate highway maintenance into
the planning process. This should provide DGH with the capability of



- 12 -
developing comprehensive strategies aimed at minimizing long-term transport
system costs and which are based on choices in respect of design standards for
improvement programs, of maintenance policies and of vehicle specifications
and axle load controls.
2.21      District officials have primary responsibility for planning of
district roadworks. Their approach is based on local knowledge and perceived
priorities, and does not involve extensive network surveys followed by
screening and ranking analyses. The advantages to this method are that the
time and resources required for planning are minimized and district autonomy
is fostered, However, there are clear disadvantages to this approach: a lack
of uniformity and rationality in planning; a much lower economic return of
investment funds than could otherwise be obtained; difficulty in central
monitoring and evaluation; and, slow development of district planning
capabilities.
2.22      Systematic planning for district roads began to receive attention
with the introSt-ion of the Inpres Jalan Program in 1979/80 (para. 2.35).
The external funding agencies (World Bank and ADB) supported early efforts to
initiate planning procedures based upon technical criteria. They required
that the road improvement programs they would finance be formulated using a
systematic planning procedure. In preparing these programs, several alterna-
tive forms of collaboration between Government staff (mainly from the
Subdirectorate of Rural Roads in DCH) and consultants were used. As part of
the first Rural Roads Development Project (RRI) a planning approach was
developed which attempted to reconcile the dual aims of ensuring that selected
road investments were economically justified without placing inordinate
demands on the planning resources required. The approach consisted of a
ranking procedure based on "zone of influence" criteria, namely a population
index (cost/head/km) and a land index (cost/hectare/km). An integral part of
the approach was a set of sample feasibility studies using conventional
economic analysis. These were designed to establish the cut-off values for
the indices which correspond to an ERR of 12X. A wanual outlining this
approach was prepared; it was intended to be used for the preparation of the
Second Rural Roads Development Project and eventually for the district roads
programs in general. Road planning studies for a Second Rural Roads
Development Project were undertaken in 1983-84 by the DGH planning staff and
district staff following the standard manual of procedures. The outcome of
these studies, however, did not provide a satisfactory basis for appraisal of
a project and in early 1986 the decision was made to start the project
preparation exercise over again using a modified approach that retained many
of the survey features from the manual of procedures but which complemented
these with systematic traffic counts which, once available, permit rapid
screening.
2.23      Thus, the first attempt at introducing systematic planning in
district road program formulation was not successful. Several factors
contributed to this. First, use of the manual posed difficulties not only
because the resources provided for training the district planning officials
had been inadequate but also because the approach required, inter alia,
considerable data to determine the zomnes of influence of the road links and
estimate population and cultivated land. Second, statistical analysis of the



- 13 -
results of the sample studies revealed that the relationship between the
population and cultivated land indices and the ERR was rather weak, thereby
casting doubt on the predictive value of the indices. Also, there has been
insufficient recognition, both at district and at Central Government level of
the benefits to be obtained from improved planning approaches. Finally, many
constraints have continued to hamper introduction of adequate planning, e.g.,
the budgeting system did not provide for timely availability of funds and
resources to carry out preliminary planning activities. These experiences in
district road planning have been taken into consideration in formulating the
planning approach to be used under the proposed project (paras. 4.5 and 4.6).
2.24      The DGH's design work is the responsibility of the Directorate of
Planning. With about 580 employees, including those of the nine RBOs, this
office has demonstrated its capacity to produce acceptable designs for a broad
range of highway and bridge construction and to supervise a large volume of
design work by consultants as well. Design work at the provincial and dis-
trict levels is the responsibility of the DBMs and DPUKs, respectively; these
departments have limited design capabilities, especially the DPUKs, so the
proposed project will provide assistance for improvements in the project
districts.
2.25      Responsibility for highway construction lies with DGH's three
Regional Operation Directorates for the national roads and some of the major
works on provincial highways; with DPUPs for the provincial roads and some of
the minor works on national roads; and with DPUKs for the district roads. The
works are executed under a variety of arrangements. Most typical for minor
construction is the use of small contractors who supply labor and local
materials but use equipment and manufactured materials supplied by the
respective road authority. Some ten years ago Indonesia had a relatively
small number of experienced contracting firms capable of executing major road
works, and therefore DGH used mainly foreign contractors for such jobs. Since
then local capability has developed so that there are now 250 "A" class (with
no upper limit of contract price) and several thousand "B" class (eligible to
bid on contracts up to Rp 500 million (US$300,000]) local contracting firms
registered in Indonesia. In addition, there are many thousands of small
contractors, registered as class "C" (eligibility ceiling of Rp 100 million
CUS$60,000]) mostly providing unskilled labor and production and transporta-
tion of materials for larger contractors and government agencies.
2.26      The GOI has long recognized the need to improve the capabilities of
local contractors and has provided assistance by arranging short-term lending
to small- and medium-sized firms at concessional rates and by training con-
tractors' personnel. Previous and ongoing highway projects have provided
limited technical assistance for contractors engaged on road works. The long-
range development of Indonesia's construction industry was the subject of a
study sponsored by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization
(UNIDO) in 1976-77. In addition, the Bank undertook a sector review in 1981
identifying problems in the construction, legal, and regulatory fields; this
review was updated in 1985. The Bank is discussing with GOI the further
development of the industry with the main focus on: (i) revision and easing
of GOI regulations regarding the industry; (ii) improving support institutions
such as MPW's Construction Industry Development Bureau and the business



- 14 -
associations; (iii) improved availability of credit and equipment to local
contractors; and (iv) better organization and management of enterprises.
F. Road Maintenance
2.27      The DBMs are responsible for maintenance of the national and
provincial roads. Recent studies have found that during the past several
years only a part of the national and provincial roads network has received
some maintenance, and most of that was inadequate. The DGH records indicate
that at the end of 1984 about two thirds of the network was still in unmain-
tainable condition. The studies also found that routine maintenance is
performed unevenly and inadequately and that periodic maintenance is
essentially not carried out, consequently accelerating the deterioration of
the roads and shortening their life. Furthermore, in spite of reduced
allocations during the last few years, physical construction targets have
remained virtually unchanged with the unfortunate consequence that DGH
designed some road betterment works for a life of only five years or less,
thus straining future maintenance efforts still further.
2.28      One of the main reasons for the lack of maintenance has been
inadequate funding. In addition, studies have identified many deficiencies in
the organization, administration and execution of road maintenance of all
classes: (i) through organizational changes during the last three years,
DGH's responsibilities for maintenance have been combined with those for other
functions thus diffusing the required attention (and diluting the efforts of
technical assistance) but also creating an overlap of duties; (ii) excessive
resources are inefficiently devoted to collecting and processing information
and to planning, programming and budgeting; (iii) excessively detailed and
rigid budget allocations; (iv) long delays (up to six months) in the release
of funds to the executing unit after the budget has been approved, which
results in most works being carried out during the wet season; (v) classroom
training of staff is ineffective (attendance is decided mostly by rank rather
than need) and very little on-the-job training takes place; (vi) shortage and
uneven distribution of strategic materials such as asphalt; (vii) extremely
cumbersome procurement procedures, even for very minor expenditures;
(viii) inadequate equipment with inadequate maintenance and lacking deployment
procedures; and (ix) inadequate supervision and monitoring of output but
excessive financial control. Improvement programs are being carried out under
ongoing highway projects to address these deficiencies with respect to
national and provincial roads.
2.29      To further improve and rationalize the planning and execution of
periodic maintenance/rehabilitation/betterment, DGH has employed consultants
under ongoing highway projects to prepare and establish a Pavement Management
System (PMS) for the national and provincial roads in all of the country's 27
provinces to analyze on a regular basis the status of the network and estimate
the costs involved in its maintenance and upgrading. Design of the basic
system is complete and its installation, including a new inventory system,
traffic counting and condition surveys and associated maintenance strategy and
standards, is expected to be completed in all provinces by the end of 1988.



- 15 -
2.30      In addition to the problems caused by the inadequate institutional
setup (para. 1.16), district roads maintenance, the responsibility of the
DPUKs, has been hampered by the same factors described above for national and
provincial roads, and by lack of information on the extent of the maintenance
problem with the result that it has been largely neglected, particularly
routine maintenance which is virtually nonexistent. A ministerial instruction
establishing maintenance funding as 25% of annual Inpres Kabupaten funds was
issued in 1984 but has had little effect. Ongoing efforts to improve main-
tenance of national and provincial roads will also benefit district roads
indirectly, but will not be sufficient to achieve rapid improvement. The pro-
posed project therefore includes specific measures to strengthen maintenance
of district roads (para. 3.10).
C. Financing
2.31      While funding for all road classes comes almost exclusively from the
Central Government, different funding channels are used. All roadworks on the
national road network are financed through the Central Government budget
allocation to DCH under the development (APBN) budget. For provincial roads
there are four funding channels or sources: (i) a part of the Central
Government budget allocation to DGH; (ii) a Central Government grant to the
provinces made specifically for provincial roads programs; (iii) part of a
general purpose Central Government grant to the provinces; and (iv) provincial
revenues. For district roads there are three funding channels/sources: (i) a
Central Government grant to the district made specifically for district roads
programs (Inpres Jalan); (ii) part of a general purpose Central Government
grant to the districts (Inpres Kabupaten); and (iii) the district's own
revenues. For toll roads there are three funding sources: (i) part of the
Central Government's allocation to DGH under the development budget to finance
land acquisition; (ii) bond issues; and (iii) toll revenue. The domestic
funds mentioned above are supplemented by external funds from lending
agencies, which over time have contributed an increasing share of the total
expenditures (from 19% in FY82/83 to 40% in FY86/87 (Table 2.9).
2.32      During the period FYs82/83-86/87, total expenditures have increased
in steps, first in FY84/85 and then in FY86/87. Even though in nominal terms
the total level of expenditures was considerably higher in FY86/87, in real
terms there has been no increase since FY82/83. Only expenditures on toll
roads registered an increase in real terms. In the process their share in
total expenditures increased from 7% to 16%. Expenditures on district roads
remained stationary for four years and increased very substantially in
FY86/87, but compared to FY82/83 their share in the total increased only
marginally from 31.7% to 33.5%. Expenditures on national and provincial roads
increased modestly in nominal terms but their share in the total declined from
65.7% to 54.5%. Provincial roads registered a decline even in nominal
terms.
2.33      An analysis by type of expenditure is somewhat complicated as Bina
Marga's work activity nomenclature is different from that generally used else-
where. However, focusing on the more clearly identifiable activities it is
apparent that since FY84/85 expenditures on new construction of national and
provincial roads are not increasing while expenditures on rehabilitation and



- 16 -
maintenance have increased substantially (albeit from a low start) and now
appear set to continue to increase. In the case of district roads,
maintenance expenditure also increased substantially in FY84/85.
2.34      The budget for FY87V88 would indicate that the shift in emphasis
from new construction to maintenance is firmly established. In the future,
increasing attention will have to be paid to the relative priority of the
various road classes and work activities and, toward this end, the programs to
be financed under the proposed project will be establistied in the context of a
balanced highway sector expenditure plan. In addition, the efforts to
strengthen the central planning capabilities at DGH should be vigorously
pursued. The Highway Maintenance and Betterment Project (Ln 2717-IND)
provides assistance to DGH's Planning Directorate for this purpose.
2.35      Funding for district roads was established on a systematic basis
with the introduction of tht Inpres (Presidential Instruction) grant programs
to district administrations in the early 1970s. The first program, the Inpres
Kabupaten, is a a general purpose program and is determined on a per capita
basis. The districts have traditionally allocated between 60% and 80% of
their total grant to roads and bridges. The second funding program, Inpres
Jalan, is earmarked solely for roadworks, mainly in districts outside Java and
Bali. The two Inpres funds together provided an annual budget of about Rp 250
billion in ?Y85/86 and FY86/87 (approximately US$155 million). By the year
1990, some 195 districts out of a national total of 246 districts are expected
to have received some form of assistance from four external funding sources
(para. 3.1). So far, external funds have been channelled through Inpres
Jalan. Foreign financing of district road works reached Rp 35.5 billion in
FY86-87, more than 20% of the total.
2.36      In FY80/81 road users contributed only some 43% of road-related
expenditures through various taxes and duties. The issue of inadequate cost
recovery in the road subsector has received considerable attention in the
context of the Bank's policy dialogue on the sector. Since then GOI has taken
several measures to increase road user taxation, including increases in fuel
and vehicle taxes, with the result that between FY80/81 and FY85/86 revenues
from road users increased five-fold. In FY85/86 road user revenues are
estimated to have covered 114% of road related expenditures. However, taxes
on the different categories of users are not in line with the cost they impose
on the road system. While the major proportion of revenues are generated by
gasoline-powered private vehicles, much of the expenditure is attributable to
the needs and damage caused by heavy vehicles. The GOI is committed to
monitor this question and to bring about further improvements in road user
charges (Ln. 2404-IND).

III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Origin and Formulation
3.1       Improvements in the condition of district roads is essential in view
of their economic and social importance since 75Z of the population lives in
rural areas, and agriculture accounts for some 25% of GDP. The Government
recognizes the need for urgent improvement and is allocating considerable
resources for this purpose. This effort has received support in 25 districts
from the Bank financed first Rul Roads Development Project (RRI) and in som
65 districts from other donors.- The project continues the efforts for
district roads improvements initiated under RRI, which suffered serious
implementation difficulties, but was put back on course in early 1986
following decisive and concerted actions by the GOI and the Bank. Significant
progress has been made since then and this togettwr with the GOI's strong
commitment to the district roads programs, provide the basis for continued and
expanded Bank involvement in the subsector. The proposed project covers 78
districts in 11 provinces (Map IBRD 20238 and Annex 1), including the 25
districts previously assisted under RRI, with about 45,100 km of district
roads and 21,300 km of national and provincial roads (32% and 41% respectively
of the total lengths of these road classes). The selection of the districts
stems mostly from attempts to rationalize donor assistance to the district
roads programs which were started in 1980 when GOI asked the donors involved
in district roads development to provide funds for the designated parts of the
country. Thus 43 of the 53 additional districts in the proposed project were
selected in 1982 for preparation of a follow-up project to the RRI. Later
additions and changes to the list of districts were made mainly to consolidate
project areas among aid agencies and complete coverage of provinces to
economize and simplify logistics and to include neglected roads in former
transmigration areas.
B. Objectives
3.2       The aims of the project are:  (a) to bring about improvements in the
management of district roads programs in terms of: (i) planning and
monitoring; (ii) design and construction standards; (iii) work supervision;
and (iv) maintenance, through institutional reform consisting of realignment
of responsibilities among ministries and agencies concerned with district
roads programs, including roads in transmigration areas; (b) to provide
financial support for GOI's district roads programs; and (c) to improve
existing labor-based construction and maintenance techniques for such roads
and to introduce new appropriate techniques for this purpose.
51   The ADB has provided assistance to 44 districts, OECF to 21 and is
planning assistance for another 38 districts and USAID is planning
assistarce for 11 districts. In total, counting planned and proposed
projects, 192 districts out of the country's 246 districts will have
received some form of assistance for their road networks by 1990.



- 18 -
C. Project Scope
3.3       The project would consist of the following:
(a) realignment of the roles and responsibilities of the institutions
and agencies at the central, provincial and district levels
concerned with district roads programs;
(b) financing of parts of the annual district roads
rehabilitation/improvement programs for 1988/89-1990/91 in the
project districts totalling some 6,000 km or about 13% of the
network of these districts;
(c) financing of parts of the annual district roads maintenance programs
for 1988/89-1990/91 in the project districts;
(d) financing of fully equipped workshops and basic soils and materials
laboratories in project districts where none exist, and
tools/equipment for existing district workshops and laboratories;
(e) a pilot scheme to improve existing labor-based road construction and
maintenance methods, and to introduce appropriate new techniques for
this purpose;
(f) equipment and spare parts for road maintenance and improvement works
in the project districts;
(g) consultant services to assist in institutional reform and associated
training programs and in the preparation of annual work programs and
project implementation, to train district staff in those functions,
and to carry out studies of civil works contractors and roads built
under development schemes; and
(h) training for some 2,000 provincial and district staff concerned with
roadc and overseas training for some 100 middle and higher level
provincial and district road officials.
D. Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.4       District roads are in urgent need of improvement and the GOI is
allocating considerable resources to the subsector. Yet, the effectiveness of
these funds is being hampered by an inadequate institutional setup. The
reform of a long established institutional setup involving various ministries
and agencies is, however, a major undertaking with many dimensions. The
Bank's involvement is intended to help overcome traditional resistance to
institutional changes in the district roads subsector, and ensure their satis-
factory implementation over a realistic time frame. Furthermore, in view of
the deterioration in GOI's budgetary situation, there is a a risk that cut-
backs in budgetary allocations for roads will undo the modest but important
improvement in the district road network achieved in recent years. Bank
involvement would contribute to the availability of adequate funds for
district roads, and also to better utilization of resources.



- 19 -
E. Project Description
Institutional Reform
3.5       Several institutional deficiencies have hampered the administration
of the district road programs at the central, provincial and district levels
(paras. 1.7, 1.16, 2.14-2.26). In the case of the central Government,
functions and responsibilities for district roads are not clearly defined
among concerned departments in the MHA, MPW, MOP and BAPPENAS. At the
provincial level, there is little effective involvement in the district roads
programs. In the districts, administrative and technical capabilities are
weak in terms of numbers and competence of staff and adequacy of procedures to
execute the responsibilities assigned at this level for the extensive road
networks and to properly exercise their authority over the district road
budgets.
3.6       The project will address these problems by realignment of the roles
and responsibilities of the various agencies involved in district roads
programs at the three levels of government as well as by strengthening of the
agencies at the district level through provision of technical assistance and
training. The aim of the institutional reforms is improved efficiency through
improved planning, programming, budgetting and supervision of works and the
establishing of appropriate maintenance of district roads. The GOI has issued
in May 1987 a Ministerial Instruction for the realignment of roles and
responsibilities together with Guidelines for its implementation and, in July
1987, an addendum to the Guidelines to firm up arrangements for tendering and
contract award (Annex 2). The Ministerial Instruction and the Guidelines are
a satisfactory basis for the short- to medium-term improvement of the planning
and execution of district roads programs provided the technical guidelines to
be issued by DGH are in accordance with earlier agreements with Bank staff.
At negotiations, an agreement was reached with GOI (a) on an Action Plan and
time frame for implementation of the institutional reforms (Annex 3) and on
the review of the Plan and its updating by March 31 in the years 1989, 1990
and 1991; (b) on the substance of the technical guidelines (Annex 4); (c) that
technical guidelines satisfactory to the Bank will be issued by February 29,
1988; and (d) that none of these documents will be changed without prior
consultation with the Bank.
3.7       The Ministerial Instruction (together with its implementing
Guidelines) covers all aspects of the preparation, execution and supervision
of all district roads in Indonesia regardless of the source of finance and
gives responsibility for technical matters to DGH and the relatively well
developed DPUPs. This new res-onsibility will first be applied in the project
districts mostly through project financed technical assistance and training,
followed soon in other districts currently receiving donor assistance. The
remaining about 85 districts (out a total of 243) would be receiving DGH and
DPUP assistance and training to gradually apply the technical guidelines. In
general, it should be expected that it will take a few years for the agreed
pl aing/selection/evaluation procedures to be fully applied, while purely
technical aspects should be relatively easily adopted.



- 20 -
Road Rehabilitation/Improvement
3.8       The 6,OOO km of rehabilitation/betterment works will involve several
hundred sections of seriously deteriorated district roads with lengths varying
between 0.5 km and 25.0 km. Traffic counts on roads studied in 1986 for
inclusion in the first year program found that more than two thirds of
recorded movements was non-motorized traffic. The AADT of motorized traffic
(excluding motorcycles which outnumber motor vehicles by almost two to one)
was just over 150 vpd; in West Java the average was about 300 vpd compared
with less than 100 vpd outside of Java. Traffic volumes of less than 90 vpd
were found on 9% of project sections in West Java and on 47% of sections
outside West Java while volumes of over 1,000 vpd were found respectively on
6% and less than 1% of sections. The roads will be brought up to minimum
standards based on projected traffic volumes and topography (Table 3.1);
existing alignment will be retained to the extent possible. Works will be
designed for a ten year lifetime and would include, as required, rehabilita-
tion of pavement layers, shoulders, side and cross drainage and bridges. The
traditional pavement surfacing on district roads is penetration macadam
carried out by labor-intensive methods. When adequately done this gives a
satisfactory surfacing but workmanship has deteriorated and specifications are
inadequate; improvements will be introduced under the project through new
specifications and technical assistance and subsequently through the results
of the labor-intensive pilot scheme (para. 3.12). Other surfacing methods will
be introduced under the project such as single and double bituminous surface
treatments, cold mix asphalts and hot-rolled sheets when works are close
enough to an operating asphalt mixing center for such overlays to be
economical.
3.9       The first year program of about 2,000 km is being selected on the
basis of an approach agreed with the Bank during project preparation. The
selection, design and detailed engineering for about 1,000 km have been com-
pleted in accordance with agreed standards and specifications. Implementation
is expected to start in June 1988. About 50% of works in the first year
program are expected to be rehabilitation of sealed roadst about 25% improve-
ment of gravel roads to sealed standard, about 15% rehabilitation of gravel
roads and about 10% improvement of earth roads to gravel standard. The selec-
tion and evaluation of subprojects for the second year program has already
started. The estimated scope of rehabilitation/improvement works by province
is shown in Table 3.2. During negotiations, an agreement was reached with GOI
that proposals for the three annual programs of rehabilitation/improvement
works selected in accordance with procedures for subproject identification and
evaluation (paras. 4.5, 4.6, 4.9), will be submitted to the Bank for review by
February 29, 1988, December 31, 1988, and December 31, 1989, respectively.
These programs will be established in the context of a balanced highway sector
expenditure plan and the programs for the second and third year will only
include subprojects located in districts which have satisfactorily implemented
both their rehabilitation/improveme.t programs and their maintenance programs
(para. 3.10) during the previous year.



- 21 -
Maintenance
3.10      This component comprises parts of the annual district roads mainte-
nance programs in the 78 districts over the years 1988/89-1990/91. The first
year program is expected to include some 4,500 km in districts where
maintenance equipment and a detailed work program are expected to be available
(Annex 5). In the second year somne 10,000 km should be maintained, while in
the third year all maintainable district roads in the 78 districts, some
19,000 km, should be included. At negotiations, GOI agreed: (a) that the
future countrywide maintenance strategy for district roads, including
technical and performance standards, intervention levels, funding formulas
based on needs and monitoring criteria, will be designed in detail and
submitted to the Bank for review and approval before February 29, 1988; (b) to
submit for Bank review and approva' before February 29, 1988, December 31,
1988 and December 31, 1989 maintenance programs for project districts for
respectively 1988/89, 1989/90 and 1990/91 based on the agreed strategy,
including both physical and budgetary aspects; and (c) that only the districts
which have implemented satisfactorily their 1988/89 and 1989/90
rehabilitation/improvement and maintenance programs would be eligible for the
project's 1989/90 and 1990/91 rehabilitation/improvement programs
respectively; implementation of the programs would be monitored through
periodic reports on the basis of payment certificates issued by the
supervising consultants supplemented by quarterly photographic surveys. A
first draft of a future strategy is presented in Annex 5.
Workshops
3.11      Major repair and overhaul of district equipment will be carried out
in the provincial workshops but proper workshop facilities need to be
established in all project districts in order to carry out the servicing and
preventive maintenance of road equipment. Under the project fully equipped
workshops and basic laboratories will be staffed and operated in all 78
districts. Well equipped workshops have been established in all of the 25
districts included in the RRI including laboratories for basic testing of
soils and materials. Workshops exist in 50 of the 53 additional districts but
seven of those will be rehabilitated and three new workshops will be built
under the project. Equipment, tools and instruments will be provided for six
workshops and laboratories as summarized in Table 3.3.
Labor-Intensive Pilot Scheme
3.12      Traditional labor-intensive methods are widely used in Indonesia for
construction and maintenance of rural roads and other small-scale public
works. Government policy aims at maintaining the use of labor-intensive
methods where they are suitable and limiting the use of capital-intensive
technology to activities for which no labor-intensive technology is available
or to areas where manpower is very scarce. The traditional methods have, how-
ever, remained basically the same for decades since no systematic efforts have
been made to improve them. As a result, the quality of construction and
maintenance is not satisfactory and the cost of labor-intensive construction
is not as competitive with equipment as expected considering the low cost of
manual labor.



- 22 -
3.13      Experience from rural roads projects receiving assistance from the
Bank and ILO in other developing countries suggests that considerable
potential exists for improvement in the quality and efficacy of the labor-
intensive methods employed in Indonesia. The pilot scheme included in the
project will develop and intr'duce improved techniques, supervision and
organization for labor-based construction and maintenance of district roads,
with the intention of gradually replicating the results of the pilot scheme in
other parts of the country. It will be carr-ad out in four districts, two in
West Java and two in West Kalimantan in connection with rehabilitation/
betterment of about 80 km of district roads and maintenance of about 180 km.
Annex 6 has further description of the pilot scheme.
Road Construction and Maintenance Equipment
3.14      Preparation studies for the project have shown that some of the
equipment procured under RRI was not fully suitable for the size and scope of
works it was intended for in the 25 districts. New analyses have been made to
design an equipment fleet more appropriate in terms of types, sizes and
numbers to carry out efficiently routine works and maintenance by force
account and partly to lease out to contractors who lack certain essential
equipment. Table 3.3 shows the equipment and spare parts required for the 78
districts that will be procured under the project.
Equipment and Tools for Labor-Intensive Pilot Scheme
3.15      The pilot scheme will test a wide variety of hand tools and various
degrees of labor-plant mix using intermediate size equipment such as agricul-
tural tractors with attachments and trailers, towed rollers, etc. A tentative
list of equipment is shown in Table 3.3. However, because of the trial/demon-
stration nature of the scheme some flexibility to change types, sizes and
numbers of equipment is allowed for.
Technical Assistance
3.16      General.  Four types of technical assistance will be provided to the
agencies concerned with district roads: (a) technical support to the DPUKs;
(b) technical support to the PMU; (c) training support to DPUKs, DPUPs and
ITB; and (d) technical assistance for the labor-intensive pilot scheme. The
project would also include two studies concerning: (a) contractors and
contracting for district roads; and (b) improved arrangements for handling
roads built under development schemes. Draft terms of reference for these
services, as shown in Annex 7, were reviewed and agreed upon at negotiations.
3.17      Technical Support for the DPUKs.  This support is required for the
planning, programming, implementation and supervision of the annual programs
for rehabilitation/improvement and maintenance of district roads and for on-
the-job training of DPUK staff in these fields. GOI will employ foreign and
local consultants for this purpose some of whom will be stationed in the pro-
vincial centers and others in the district centers to work with the DPUP and
DPUK staff on a daily basis. To facilitate administration and coordination,
the services will be divided into the three geographical areas used by DGH
(Western, Central and Eastern Regions). In addition, DCH will provide to the



- 23 -
DPUKs on a secondment basis experienced engineers for up to three years while
DPUK staff are being trained. The proposed project will provide technical
assistance to the DPUKs for about 5,466 man-months, of which 996 man-months
will be foreign and 4,470 mar.-months (1,830 man-months of professionals' and
2,640 man-months of sub-professionals' services) will be local consultants'
services. These consultants should mobilize by March 1988 when consultants'
contracts tinanced under RRI wiil expire.
3.18      Technical Support for the PMU.  Technical assistance to the PMU by
foreign and local consultants is required to support and train staff drawn
from the DGRD and DCH to ensure efficient project implementation and
institutional development (para. 3.27). The consultants will also assist in
the preparation of standard guidelines for the planning, programming, design
and supervision of construction and maintenance of district roads. The
services will be required until about mid-1991 and the project would provide
for about 1,230 man-months of technical assistance, including 378 man-months
of foreign and 912 man-months of local consultants' services. These
consultants should mobilize by March 1988 when consultants' contracts financed
under RRI will expire.
3.19      Technical Support for the Labor-Intensive Pilot Scheme.  The pilot
scheme will require substantial technical assistance for the planning,
execution and supervision of the trial and demonstration tasks and for
training of DPUK staff and interested local contractors and consultants. The
proposed project will provide for about 300 man-months of technical
assistance, including 160 man-months of foreign and 140 man-months of local
consultants' services. The foreign advisors should mobilize by November 1988
and the local consultants by early 1989.
3.20      Training.  Technical assistance is required for:  (a) review,
evaluation and improvements of existing MPW, DGH and MHA classroom and on-the-
job training programs for technical and administrative staff of the districts
and provinces concerned with district roads; (b) certificate programs for road
and bridge engineers (five 16-week programs); and (c) administration of
overseas training of provincial and district staff concerned with district
roads. For this purpose, the proposed project will provide for about 169 man-
months of technical assistance, including 48 man-months of foreign and 121
man-months of local consultants' services (see also para. 3.23). Training
programs will be submitted to the Bank by September 30, 1988 and will be
implemented.
3.21      Study of Contractors and Contracting for District Roads.  The
capabilities and performance of the small contractors used for civil works on
district roads (class "C" contractors) have continued to present problems.
Among major concerns requiring attention are: the appropriate level of
sophistication of contract documents; types cf contracts, contract period,
system of supervision and certification of work for payment, minimum contrac-
tor capabilities for the standard of district roads, and the ways and means of
encouraging growth of small contractors including ownership of an appropriate
equipment fleet. Therefore, the proposed project will provide for about 36
man-months of technical assistance, including 12 man-months of foreign and 24
man-months of local consultants' services, to carry out a study that will



- 24 -
recommend measures to address the problems of the small contrActors used for
work on district roads. The terms of reference for the study are in
Annex 7. The study should be completed by March 31, 1989.
3.22      Study of Improved Arrangements for Handling Roads built under
Development Schemes. The rationale for this study is developed in para.
2.16. It would require about 60 man-months of technical assistance, including
24 man-months of foreign and 36 man-months of local consultants' services.
The study should be completed by March 31, 1989.
Training
3.23      While Indonesian universities, schools and vocational training
facilities are capable of providing basic training related to the planning,
design construction and maintenance of district roads, more specialized
training in these fields is not readily available and the most advanced
training in highway related fields and in project management can only be
obtained overseas. The project, therefore, includes: (a) in-country
training, formal and on-the-job, of some 2,000 district and provincial staff
concerned with district roads; and (b) advanced training overseas for some 100
middle and higher level district and provincial officials concerned with
district roads. During negotiations, an agreement was reached with GOI that
DGH and DGRD before September 30, 1988: (a) review, evaluate and make recom-
mendations for improvements in short-and long-term training for district and
provincial staff concerned with district roads and, in consultation with the
Bank and in accordance with an agreed action plan, introduce improvements in
the regular training programs of MPW, DGH and MHA for those staff; (b)
establish and make operational certificate course programs for road and bridge
engineers and (c) submit an overseas training program for the Bank's review
and approval. The project would finance, as appropriate, local and
international tra-vel, subsistence, course fees, training materials and aids
and consultants services (para. 3.20).
F. Cost Estimates
3.24      The total project cost is estimated at US$333.0 million
(Rp 51?.5 billion equivalent), including taxes and duties of US$18.8 mil-
lion.'  It includes:  (a) physical contingencies of 10% on the base cost of
civil works and technical assistance and 15% on training; and (b) price con-
tingencies of 3.0% during 1987, 1.0% during 1988-90, and 3.5% during 1991 on
the foreign component and of 10.0% during 1987, 5.0% during 1988 and 3.5%
during 1989-1991 on the local component. The direct and indirect foreign
exchange component is estimated at US$152.4 million or 46% of total cost.
Detailed cost estimates are given in Table 3.4 and summarized below:
7/   Includes US$11.4 million of identifiable taxes and duties on civil works,
US$5.9 million on procurement of equipment and US$1.5 million taxes on
the services of consultants.

3.25      The base costs are estimated as of September 1987.  In the case of
civil works, estimates are based on updated and adjusted recent unit prices
for similar works under highway projects and force account works carried out
in 1986. Rehabilitation/improvement works are estimated to cost US$23,100 per
km for sealed roads and UTS$21,100 per km for gravel roads. Routine main-
tenance is estimated to cost about US$260 per km for sealed roads, about
US$1,470 when drainage improvements are included, and US$570 for gravel roads,
about US$1,830 when drainage improvements are included. Periodic maintenance
of sealed roads is estimated to cost US$6,500 per km and US$2,300 for gravel
roads; the cycle for periodic maintenance is assumed to be four years. A new
workshop is estimated at US$60,000 and rehabilitation and upgrading of
existing ones about US$25,000. The cost of equipment for construction and
maintenance operations, for workshops, and for laboratories is based on recent
bids updated to September 1987 price levels. A summary of the required
technical assistance consultant services and their estimated cost is tabulated

Total                       180.6            152.4          333.0
The proposed Bank loan of US$190.0 million will finance about 57% of total
project cost or about 60% net of taxes and duties.  The project districts
would finance the remaining US$143.0 million equivalent, or about 43% of the
total estimated project cost through annual budgetary allocations from the
central government grant programs Inpres Jalan and Inpres Kabupaten. The
Bank's 601 share of project financing is similar to that of current operations
in Indonesia. The resulting local cost financing (211 of local costs) is
justified by Indonesia's very tight budget situation, which is expected to
continue in the near future, and the need to mair.tain an adequate roadworks
program funded from GOI's own resources in the districts which are not
supported by donor projects.

H. Implementation and Procurement
3.27      The project will be implemented over about three years by the DPUKs
in the 78 project districts, assisted by seconded DGH engineers, DPUP
technical staff and technical assistance consultants.  The PMU, on behalf of
DGRD under the overall guidance of the Steering Committee for District Roads,
will be responsible for ensuring effective implementation of the project on a
day-to-day basis, including the institutional improvements and overall project
coordination. The PMU will also be responsible for selective monitoring and
evaluation of the impact of investments in district roads. The structure and
staffing of the PMU was revised in early 1986, but in view of its expanded
responsibilities and increased workload, an ilreement was reached with GOI at
negotiations on restructuring and strengthening the PMU (Annex 8) and on
employing an additional number of qualified key staff in order to improve its
capacity to monitor the progress of the institutional reforms and of project
implementation, and to manage projects financed by other aid agencies. A
full-time unit chief has been appointed and is in post. The ILO, on behalf of
the GOI, will implement the labor-intensive pilot scheme. The project will be
completed by March 31, 1991.

- 28 -
3.29      The civil works are scattered over vast areas and although work will
be packaged to the extent possible, the size of contracts is expected to be
too small (about US$300,000 on average) to attract foreign contractors. Civil
works for road rehabilitation/improvement, periodic maintenance and workshops
will therefore be carried out by contracts awarded under local competitive
bidding (LCB) procedures which are acceptable to the Bank and open for
participation by foreign contractors. In order to improve the quality of
construction, GOI assurances were obtained at negotiations that contractors
invited to bid on civil works will be those registered as class Bi contractors
or above. While force account works will in general be kept to a minimum, a
part of rehabilitation/improvement and periodic maintenance works would,
however, be carried out by force account, to facilitate on-the-job training of
the staff of the DPUKs and interested contractors. Implementation of these
components will start in about June 1988 and would extend through April
1991. Civil works for routine road maintenance would be carried out mostly by
force account by DPUK staff but contracting may be tried on a small scale
through LCB in the second and third years. Standard bidding documents for
civil works have been agreed with GOI, but as no contracts are expected to
exceed US$0.5 million, actual bidding documents, bid evaluation reports and
contracts will be kept by the DPUKs with copies at the PMU for subsequent Bank
review.
3.30      Apart from some equipment and tools for the labor-intensive pilot
scheme (up to a total amount of US$300,000) that may be procured through LCB,
all equipment, together with associated spare parts (US$58.5 million), will be
procured in accordance with ICB procedures and Bank guidelines for procurement
and all documents will be subject to the Bank's review and approval prior to
invitation to tender. In bid comparison and evaluation, domestic manufac-
turers will be granted a margin of preference of 15% or the prevailing import
duty, whichever is lower. Delivery of equipment is expected to be completed
in early 1989. Except for expatriate consultants' services for the labor-
intensive pilot scheme that will be selected by ILO in accordance with UN
rules, consultants will be appointed in accordance with Bank guidelines and on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, and GOI's assurance to this
effect was obtained at negotiations.
I. Disbursements
3.31      The loan funds would be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) Civil Works:
ti)   40% of total expenditures of each of the three annual programs
for rehabilitation/improvement and periodic maintenance incurred
before April 1 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively;
(ii)   75% of total expenditures of the 1988/89 program for routine
maintenance, 50% of the 1989/90 program and 25% of the 1990/91
program incurred before April 1, 1989, 1990 and 1991 respec-
tively; and
(iii)   40% of total expenditures on workshops;



- 29 -
(b)  Equipment and Spares for Construction, Maintenance, Workshops and
Laboratories and Labor-Intensive Pilot Scheme: 100% of foreign
expenditures for directly imported items; or 95% of local expendi-
tures (ex-factory) of locally manufactured items, or 65% of expendi-
tures on locally procured items;
(c)  Consulting Services:  100% of expenditures; and
(d)  Training:  100% of expenditures.
Disbursements for items (b) and (c) will be made against full documentation of
expenditure while disbursements for all other items would be on the basis of
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Withdrawal applications for items (b), (c)
and (d) would be aggregated to conform to the following minimum thresholds:
reimbursement--US$60,000 equivalent; direct payment--US$10,000 equivalent; and
special commitment--US$10,000 equivalent. The schedule of estimated disburse-
ments is shown in Table 3.5; it differs substantially from the disbursement
profile for standard highway projects (which require some six years for
completion), mainly because the project is limited to a time-slice (three
consecutive annual programs) of the road programs of 78 districts.
Disbursements are expected to be completed in about three and one-half years.
3.32      In order to expedite and facilitate disbursements, GOI intends to
set up a Special Account in the Bank of Indonesia with an initial deposit from
the loan of US$8.0 million to serve as a revolong fund for covering local
currency payments of civil works expenditure.,   Only eligible project
expenditures, certified by PMU, would be made from the Special Account. The
PMU would manage all accounting records but preparation of supporting docu-
ments for SOEs. which will be retained by PMU for inspection by Bank staff
during supervision visits, will be the responsibility of the DPUKs and DGH.
The closing date of the loan will be December 31, 1991.
J. Accounts and Audits
3.33      The PMU will have overall responsibility for establishing and
monitoring the use of a uniform project accounting system. FinanLial records
and accounts by subprojects will be retained by the DPUK project units based
on copies of financial and supporting documents obtained from project managers
and relevant agencies concerned with project funding, payment and reimburse-
ment. The PMU will maintain accounts for equipment procured on behalf of the
project and for training and technical assistance. The DPUKs will transmit to
the PMU on at least a quarterly basis up-to-date project account records. The
PMU project comptroller will consolidate all accounts from the 78 districts
into a single project account on a quarterly basis for monitoring purposes and
1O/ At negotiations, GOI and the Bank agreed, on an exceptional basis, to
establish a Special Account for civil works expenditure considering that
the SKB 48 restricts the use of Special Accounts to local currency and
that all civil works expenditures are in local currency.



- 30 -
annually for audit purposes. The audit statements will deal with the Inpres
funds provided for the project as well as disbursements by the Bank, and will
include opinions on all expenditures including those made against SOEs.
Furthermore, during negotiations assurances were obtained from GOI that
(a) the consolidated project accounts, including documentation on SOEs, will
be audited annually in a timely fashion by independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank, and (b) the PMU will submit to the Bank certified copies of the
audited project accounts commencing December 31, 1989, and subsequently no
later than nine months after the end of each fiscal y ar.
K. Project Monitoring and Progress eporting
3.34      The PMU will monitor project expenditures and the physical progress
of the project from monthly reports provided by the DPUK project units. It
will send quarterly progress reports to the Bank not later than one month
after the end of each quarter. These reports will include both consolidated
monitoring information for the total project and individual reports for each
district.  The PMU will prepare a detailed project completion report and
submit it to the Bank not later than six months after the loan closing date.
L. Environmental Aspects
3.35      The project is not expected to have any adverse environmental
effects.  Works are mostly improvements of roads and bridges, including
improved side and cross drainage, widening and strengthening of shoulders and
pavements, overlays on old pavements, and bituminous surfacings on gravel
roads, all of which will improve conditions along the road through reducing
dust and noise and the possibility of flooding. As the works will be carried
out on existing alignments, requirements for additional land are minimal.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.1       The Government's overall district roads programs reach the majority
of the population in the rural areas as they are based on the programs of the
individual districts which in turn are composed of road works scattered over
the district's entire road network. The principal aim of these programs is to
advance the development potential of the rural areas by improving access and
lowering road transport costs. In addition, Government is pursuing regional
equity and employment objectives through the programs. The main quantifiable
benefits being derived from these programs are savings in vehicle operating
costs (VOC) and in personal travel time. Other benefits of improved road
conditions which are less easily quantifiable are reductions in freight damage
and improved access to agricultural extension services and social and medical
services. Furthermore, improvements in road maintenance will provide better
access to some outlying areas where roads are at times impassable and will
save on costly reconstruction works in the future.
4.2       The direct beneficiaries of the VOC savings are the traders/truckers
and transporters using both motorized and non-motorized vehicles and the
private road users. Given that the level of road freight rates varies with
road conditions, savings in VOC of commercial vehicles normallv are passed on
to producers (in the form of higher farm-gate prices) and consun.rs (in the
form of lower prices for inputs and consumer goods) in the rural areas. The
savings in VOC of private vehicles and in passenger time costs accrue directly
to the vehicle owners and individuals concerned. The other, less quantifiable
benefits are also spread widely over the rural population.
4.3       The project will enhance the benefits normally derived from these
programs as it will not only provide financing for physical investments in the
78 project districts, but also includes important institutional reforms and
institution building measures aimed at improving the effectiveness of the
resources devoted to district roads. First, the project will introduce
improved selection/planning procedures at district level based on more
accurate information on the road network of the districts. This should result
in annual programs which correspond more closely to priority needs. Second,
the project includes measures to improve the quality of construction work;
this should result in longer lives of the road investments. Third, the
project will institute road maintenance on a more systematic basis, which will
extend the life of the investments and reduce vehicle operating costs.
Finally, at the level of the central government the institutional reforms
should bring about improved overall management of the program. These
measures, through their impact on the effectiveness of the resources allocated
to district roads, will extend the benefits beyond the direct economic gains
of the physical investments financed by the project. The economic evaluation
of the project, however, only considers the quantifiable benefits of the
physical investments in the project districts.
4.4       On the implementation side, the district road programs place heavy
emphasis on labor-intensive techniques and these will be improved under the
project. The labor-intensive approach has the merit of generating



- 32 -
considerable employment for the local population in the rural areas and the
income thus generated is locally spent. Also, the laborers employed under the
program are drawn from the poorer sections of the population. During the
three-year implementation period, project works would generate an estimated
80,000 man-years of employment. Moreover, the project would assist in
improving the skills and work methods of these laborers which is likely to
have spillover effects in other spheres of activity.
B. Annual Works Program Formulation
4.5       The economic rate of return (ERR) of the overall district roads
program depends critically on the composition of the annual programs in each
district and the project, therefore, gives great emphasis to annual program
formulation. The planning and programming approach being developed under the
project relies heavily on systematic methods of survey and analysis and
comprises a survey phase and an evaluation phase. The survey phase which each
year focuses on a subregion of the district is designed to identify the
initial list of candidate subprojects, while the evaluation phase is aimed at
formulation of the annual works program following screening of the individual
subprojects. At negotiation, agreement was reached that every year, candidate
subprojects will be identified on the basis of a survey in a subregion of each
district and that the annual work program will be formulated following a
screening process of those subprojects. The economic evaluation for screening
purposes uses a traffic related methodology (para. 4.6). The average planning
lead time is about 18 months (Annex 9). Under the project, district staff
will be trained in the various phases of the planning procedures. At
negotiations, agreement was reached that every year by December 31, together
with submission of the program of works for the following year, the PMU will
submit an action plan for on the job training of district staff in planning
procedures.
C. Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Calculations
4.6       Under the project, annual programs are formulated by screening the
list of candidate subprojects following a standard economic evaluation based
on investment costs and road user savings accruing to all categories of road
traffic. The evaluation procedures adopted for the first year program are
appropriate and at negotiations agreement was reached that these procedures
will also be followed in subsequent years. The subprojects to be evaluated
are typically road links 5-10 km in length and the investment consists of
reconstruction or major rehabilitation. The elements entering into the
economic analysis include savings in motorized and non-motorized vehicle
operating costs and in passenger time costs; benefits in respect of generated
traffic; where applicable, benefits on account of diversion from non-motorized
modes to motorized vehicles; and savings in maintenance costs "with" and
'owithout" the project. The results of these evaluations provide the basis for
a ranking of subprojects by district, for final program formulation and the
calculation of the overall ERR. The minimum ERR for subprojects to be
included in the project is set at 10%. This was confirmed by GOI at
negotiations.



- 33 -
4.7       The average improvement cost of all viable subprojects evaluated for
a first-year program was US$22,500 equivalent per km. Technical options were
considered for each subproject. To estimate current traffic, classified
counts (6 and 12 hour counts) were conducted at a minimum of one station on
all project links and covering both motorized (fve vehicle categories) and
non-motorized (seven relevant types) movements. Traffic growth was projected
in the 3-6% range. Vehicle operating costs were derived by adjusting the VOC
model developed by DGH for national and provincial roads. Costs of non-
motorized traffic were developed separately. The value of "productive" time
was estimated on the basis of a representive economic wage while the value of
"private" time was based on half the estimated opportunity cost of unskilled
labor in rural areas.
4.8       Of the total of 420 subprojects studied for a first-year program,
231 or 55% have an ERR of 10% or greater. The remaining projects were either
found not viable, having an ERR below 10% or had not been fully evaluated on
the grounds that they were found not to meet the initial selection criteria or
because of inadequate survey data. Sensitivity calculations were performed on
a sample of 50 subprojects to test the sensitivity of the ERR to changes in
the basic assumptions, i.e. in respect of construction costs, base year
traffic and traffic growth, road condition assessment, generated traffic, non-
motorized traffic and modal diversion, time values, maintenance cost savings,
project life or implementation performance. The outcome of the ERR and
sensitivity analyses permitted the ranking of subprojects for each district
and then classification according to degree of risk. The overall ERR of the
subprojects screened for a first-year program and having an ERR of 10% or
greater was 29%.
D. Special Evaluation Procedures
4.9       Some subprojects, such as those involving significant development
benefits, substantial traffic diversion or forming part of former trans-
migration schemes, may not be suitable for the standard evaluation method.
For such subprojects there are essentially three broad options: (i) special
studies by the PMU; (ii) review and evaluation of the subproject by another
agency when the issues which have hampered traffic development are much more
complex than road access alone; and (iii) treatment of the subproject as a
special case. These options have not been worked out in detail but GOI has
prepared a broad outline of a satisfactory approach for dealing with such
cases. GOI intends to develop not later than March 31, 1988, for review and
approval by the Bank: (i) the criteria to determine whether a subproject
qualifies for special studies by the PMU, for reference to another agency, or
for treatment as special case; and (ii) the methodology to be employed in the
special studies. This was confirmed at negotiations. At negotiations
agreement was also reached that subprojects which fail to meet the standard
criteria will not be financed under the project unless they have been
evaluated and found viable, based on the special evaluation procedures to be
de7eloped and that subprojects evaluated on this basis shall not constitute
-more than 20% of the annual program in any district.

E. Overall Economic Rate of Return
4.10      The project covers both road rehabilitation/betterment works and
road maintenance. Overall, rehabilitation/betterment represents some 702 of
the project costs and the ERR of that part of the program already evaluatsd
indicates an ERR of 292 for these works. The ERR for subsequent years is
expected to be equal or higher and the overall ERR for the activities for
which costs and benefits have been calculated is therefore estimated to exceed
29%.
F. Project Risks
4.11      While the programs to be assisted in the project districts are
physically and economically feasible, there are a number of factors which
could frustrate achievement of the project's objectives. The main risk of the
project is that implementation of the institutional reform is slower than
anticipated and that the improvements in program formulation and program
implementation are delayed. This risk, however, has in part been averted by
et uring that the institutional reforms are agreed and that the corresponding
Ministerial Instruction and implementing guidelines are already issued. At
negotiations an agreement was reached with GOI on an adequate Action Plan for
implementation of the reforms; implementation of the plan will be carefuly
monitored (para. 3.6).

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.1       During negotiations, agreements were reached with GOI:
(a) (i) on terms of reference for a study to prepare recommendations for
improved arrangements for handling roads built under agricultural
and other development schemes; and (ii) that the study would be
completed and submitted for the Bank's review no later than March
31, 1989 (paras. 2.16, 3.22);
(b)  on an Action Plan and timetable satisfactory to the Bank and on the
review and updating of the Plan in consultation with the Bank, by
March 31 of 1989, 1990 and 1991 (para. 3.6);
(c)  that the institutional arrangements for implementing district road
programs, as set in the May 18, 1987, Ministerial Instruction and
associated addendum and guidelines, not be changed without the
Bank's concurrence (para. 3.6);
(d)  on the detailed scope of the technical guidelines for the
implementation of the Ministerial Instruction of May 18, 1987, and
that the guidelines will be issued by February 29, 1988 (3.6);
(e)  on the selection procedures for works to be included in the annual
programs as follows:
(i)   proposed maintenance programs, satisfactory to the Bank, will be
submitted to the Bank by February 1988, December 31, 1988 and
December 31, 1989 respectively. These programs (including both
physical and budgetary aspects) will be based on the agreed
strategy (para. 3.9);
(ii)   every year candidate subprojects shall be identified on the
basis of a survey in a subregion of each district and the annual
work program shall be formulated following a screening process
of these subprojects (para. 4.5);
(iii)   PMU, by December 31 of every year will submit to the Bank an
action plan for on-the-job training of district staff in
planning procedures (para. 4.5);
(iv)   the economic evaluation procedure for screening purposes and the
minimum ERR of 10% used in the preparation of a first year
program will also be followed in subsequent years (para. 4,6);
(v)   PMU, by March 31, 1988, will submit to the Bank for review and
approval a proposal specifying the criteria governing the
special evaluation procedures and the methodology to be employed
(para. 4.9); and



- 36 -
(vi)   subprojects which fail to meet the standard criteria under (iii)
above, shall not be financed unless they have been evaluated and
found viable based on the special evaluation procedures and
subprojects on this basis shall not constitute more than 20X of
the annual program in any district (para. 4.9).
(f) (i) that the future countrywide maintenance strategy for district
roads, including technical and performance standards, intervention
levels and funding formulas based on needs, will be designed in
detail and submitted to the Bank for review before February 29,
1988; (ii) on submitting for Bank review and approval by February
29, 1988, December 31, 1988 and 1989, maintenance programs for
project districts for respectively 1988/89, 1989/90 and 1990/91
based on the agreed strategy, including physical and budgetary
aspects; and (iii) that only the districts which have implemented
satisfactorily their 1988/89 and 1989/90 rehabilitation/improvement
and maintenance programs would be eligible for the project's 1989/90
and 1990/91 rehabilitation/improvement programs respectively
(para. 3.10);
(g) that DGH and DGRD will before September 30, 1988: (i) review,
evaluate and make recommendations for improvements in short- and
long-term training for district and provincial staff concerned with
district roads and, in consultation with the Bank and in accordance
with an agreed action plan, introduce improvements in MPW, DGH and
MHA regular training programs for those staff; and (ii) establish
and make operational certificate course programs for road and bridge
engineers; and (iii) submit an overseas training program for Bank
review and approval (para. 3.23);
(h) on restructuring and strengthening the PMU, particularly through the
appointment of key staff, in order to improve its capacity to ensure
effective implementation of the project, including the institutional
reforms, and of projects financed by other aid agencies (para.
3.27);
5.2       Subject to the above agreements, the project would be suitable for a
Bank loan of US$190.0 million equivalent to the Republic of Indonesia for 20
years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.

SEC.OND RURAL ROADS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Maintenance Program for Project Districts and a First
Proposal for a Maintenance Strategy for District Roads
A. Sumar
1.        The main conclusions of the work on d.strict roads maintenance
through August 1987 can be summarized as follows:
(a)  The maintenance program should attempt to provide for 100% of the
needs for maintenance of roads in good and fair condition in the
project districts. In the first two years of the program, it is
assumed that echievement of this will be limited by district
capacity, due to the persistence of the concept of applying main-
tenance funds to low quality repair of roads in bad condition. The
program estimate presented in Section B assumes progressive intro-
duction of maintenance of all good and fair roads.
(b) Three types of maintenance work are proposed for district roads, as
follows:
gi)    initial improvement of drainage systems on roads in good and
fair surface condition, both sealed and gravel. This is
required since most existing roads have been built without
formal design, are poorly drained, and the impact of other
maintenance works (and the residual life) would increase signi-
ficantly by first improving the drainage systems;
(ii)    road maintenance of newly upgraded roads and, after drainage
i_provement, of other roads in good and fair condition; and
(iii)    periodic maintenance, including overlays of sealed roads and
regravelling of unsealed roads, carried out on roads in fair
condition where drainage improvement has been completed.
(c)  Routine maintenance is defined to consist of different activities
from periodic maintenance and from drainage improvement (Attachment
1), in order to keep the programs clear and consistent and to
emphasize that routine works are required on all good and fair
links. Links budgeted for drainage improvement should also be
budgeted for routine maintenance in the same year. Routine main-
tenance on links budgeted for periodic maintenance should begin in
the following year.
(d)  At least for the first year and probably for the 3 years of the
program, the present COI maintenance funding criterion (25% of the
population-based Inpres Kabupaten program) should be retained due to
its simplicity, the greater importance of achieving physical objec-
tives over budget refinement, and the reasonable proportion of over-
all needs for which it in theory provides at present.



-58-                          ANN-X 5
Page 2 of 3
(e)  The greatest disadvantage of the present criterion, namely its lack
of relation to the size of maintenance needs in some districts,
should be addressed directly by the project financing an agreed pro-
portion of overall needs, with individual funding per district to be
distributed according to individual needs.
(f)  Any revisions to the above proposed budgeting strategy should not be
allowed to divert attention from the main thrust of the strategy,
that is to allow most effort to be concentrated on implementation of
maintenance in the districts, and on training ot district work
forces in maintenance routines and work methods.
(g) To implement the proposed strategy, a commitment is required from
the Government to:
(i)    budget for the proposed project component of maintenance under
Inpres Kabupaten beginning in 1988/89 with the program outlined
in Section B;
(ii)    issue policy guidelines from Home Affairs Department supported
by technical guidelines from Public Works t'epartment regarding
allocation of the major part of maintenance funds to the works
outlined in para (b) above on roads in good and fair condition
only;
(iii)    immediately procurs appropriate maintenance equipment as
required for the 78 kabupatens; and
(iv)    establish gangs of routine and periodic maintenance workers in
each district.
2.        Other important aspects of the maintenance strategy are as follows:
(a)  All repair and rehabilitation works on poor and bad condition roads
(except for emergency works as described under para. 2 (b) below)
should be excluded from maintenance, as should any works costing
over as threshold amount per km (to be determined each year and
agreed with the Bank), which should be subject to evaluation as for
other improvement works. The purpose of this bias towards good and
fair roads is to overcome present widespread neglect of routine
maintenance of such roads and the consequent rapid deterioration of
assets.
(b)  There should be an emergency maintenance provision in each district
maintenance budget, based on an appropriate formula yet to be
developed, to be allocated for works such as clearing landslips,
repairing collapsed bridges and improvement of bad spots to keep
roads open to traffic, subject to the limit in 2 (a). A contingency
of 10% has been included in estimated routine and periodic main-
tenance and drainage improvement costs to allow for emergency works
until an appropriate formula is derived. (It is noted, however,
that such a formula should probably relate to the length of roads in
poor and bad condition.)



ANNEX 5
Page 3 of 3
(c) Routine and periodic maintenance and drainage improvement works
should be planned and budgeted link-by-link, using a schedule of
quantities and rates, on which monitoring and loan reimbursement
should be based. However, emergency works saould be budgeted by
district, under the category of landslip removal, temporary bridge-
works and repair of flood damage. Terms such as "emergency works"
or "contingencies" should not be allowed in the district budgets, as
they would indicate excessive flexibility.
(d) In line with this, it is proposed that separate teams of workers
should carry out routine and periodic maintenance and drainage
improvements, with separate equipment units, separate reporting and
monitoring and separate budget categories (within the one program,
Inpres Kabupaten). As noted under section 1 (d) above, administra-
tive simplicity requires that as much uniformity as possible be pre-
served between procedures relating to these budget categories.
(e) Planning of periodic maintenance and drainage improvement works
should be closely coordinated with planning of rehabilitation/
improvement works for the following year, to avoid overlap.
(f) Maintenance planning surveys should be oriented to identifying road
deficiencies, for which special inventory forms should be used. For
monitoring purposes, maintenance planr.ing surveys should also
include adequate identification of link and location.
(g) Roads should enter the routine maintenance program in the year
following completion of construction, which would require a change
in current policy requiring a waiting period of two years.
(h) The maintenance guarantee period required under construction
contracts should be lengthened from one month to three months
following the inspection at which 100% completion is certified, and
should be subject to 10% retention rather than the 5% as at present.
(i) The above maintenance strategy should be reviewed annually before
preparation of the following year's maintenance works programs.
B. Proposed Maintenance Program
3.        Attachment 2 shows how the three year program has been estimated.
Unit costs of drainage improvement, periodic and routine maintenance have been
kept separate. Estimated unit costs of periodic maintenance overlays allow
for the alternatives of penetration macadam or cold mix asphalt surface
regulation. The estimated time cycle for periodic maintenance is 4 years.
4.        Attachment 2 also includes the estimated lengths of rehabilitation/
improvement works to be carried out on the various road condition cate-
gories.

1.        Traditional labor-intensive methods are widely used in Indonesia for
construction and maintenance of rural roads and other small-scale public
works. Reas ns for this include the shortage of equipment and the difficulty
in keeping equipment in working condition in the rural areas as well as the
ready supply of inexpensive labor in most parts of Indonesia. Government
policy aims at maintaining the use of labor-intensive methods where such
methods are suitable and limiting the use of capital-intensive technology to
activities for which no labor-intensive technology is available or to areas
where manpower is very scarce.
2.        The traditional methods have, however, remained basically the same
for decades since no systematic efforts have been made to improve them. The
results are that the quality of construction and maintenance leaves much to be
desired and that labor-intensive construction is not as cost competitive with
equipment as it could and should be considering the low cost of manual labor.
3.        Based on experience from Bank and IIO assisted rural roads projects
in other developing countries there is considerable potential for improvement
in both the quality and efficacy of the labor-intensive methods employed in
Indonesia. A trial and demonstration pilot component has therefore been
included in the project to develop and introduce improved techniques, super-
vision and organization for labor-based construction/improvement and main-
tenance of kabupaten roads.
Objectives
4.        The objectives of the pilot component are:
(a) the adoption and replication of techniques, supervision and
organization of kabupaten road construction and improvement best
suited to the resource endowments of Indonesia; and
(b) the adoption and replication of techniques, management systems and
budgetary arrangements suitable for a sustained program of routine
maintenance of kabupaten roads.
5.        The pilot component will be carried out over a period of 27
months. (Start will depend on timing of loan effectiveness.)

Scope
6.        The main features of the pilot component are:
(a)  experimentation and trials with alternative labor-based construction
methods, improved hand tools, intermediate equipment and
organization/supervision in connection with the rehabilitation/
improvement of about 80 km of district roads; the work will be
implemented by force account in four districts; viz. Bogor and
Subang in West Java province and Pontianak and Sambas in West
Kalimantan province;
(b)  trials with labor-based techniques and corresponding management and
reporting systems for routine maintenance operations on about 100 km
of different types and standards of kabupaten roads in the same four
districts as mentioned above;
(c)  provision of handtools and equipment for the experimental
construction/ improvement and maintenance works; these tools and
equipment form an essential and integral part of the trials and the
development work and full flexibility is therefore required in
respect of design and specifications, before as well as during the
implementation. The International Labor Organization (ILO), who
would be executing agency for the technical assistance, would assist
the government in the procurement of tools and equipment for the
pilot component.
(d) a technical assistance team that would:
(i) plan, direct, monitor, evaluate and report on the experimental
construction and maintenance work;
ii)  prepare detailed tools and equipment specifications and revise
them as necessary in the course of the implementation;
(iii)  study the local manufacturing capability of tools and equipment
and make recommendations on how it can be increased and
improved to raise the share of locally manufactured hardware;
(iv) carry out a comprehensive study of cost, output and
productivity and quality data of different construction and
rmiaintenance techniques including those currently used and those
developed by the trial and demonstration program;
(v) provide on-the-job training to the concerned kabupaten staff in
the planning and implementation of labor-based work (this would
be in addition to the training provided under the main
component of the Project) and organize an overseas study tour
on this subject for senior staff;
(vi) prepare an action plan for the Government's consideration on
how and to what extent improved labor-based techniques and



-64-                           ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 9
related management systems could be suitably introduced on a
wider scale on force account work as well as by contractors.
Description
7.        Pilot Districts.  The selection of four districts for the pilot
component is a compromise between the desirability of having as large and
representative a base as possible for the trial and demonstration program and
the necessity of keeping the program small enough to be closely supervised by
a team of consultants that could not be made very large. The two provinces of
West Java and West Kalimantan were chosen because both are easily accessible
from Jakarta and they represent different levels of population density, road
network characteristics, DPUK staff and equipment availability and insti-
tutional capacity. Between them the four districts also represent different
types of terrain and, to some extent, soil conditions.
8.        Rehabilitation/Improvement Program.  The pilot component will
include earth, gravel and sealed roads. The emphasis will be on roads in the
lower range of existing or anticipated traffic volumes. Transmigration and
NES roads may be included if they are under district jurisdiction.
Construction of new roads may be included if the Bappeda/DPUK can demonstrate
their viability on economic or socio-economic grounds. The construction
standards will be the same as for the main component of the Rural Roads II
project although the design may be altered to better suit labor-based
techniques.
9.        Rehabilitation/improvement under the pilot component will start
during the 1989/90 fiscal year. A list of suitable roads will be prepared
between March and August 1988 by each of the four districts. Main
criteria/priorities would be:
(a) assured supply of labor (order of 150-400 workers depending on the
volume of work) preferably within daily commuting distance (labor
camps will be avoided);
(b) roads with easy access to the DPUK office will be given priority to
facilitate supervision;
(c) roads where road building materials are available within relatively
short hauling distance would be given priority;
(d) if roads are much longer than five km or otherwise contain too much
work to complete within one construction season it should be
acceptable to divide the road in segments which can be completed in
one season; this criteria serves to ensure that complete data from
the road will be timely available;
(e) for the same reason proposed roads should not involve large bridges
or other major work which would substantially delay the compilation
of complete data;



-65-                           AMU  6
Page 4 of 9
(f)  about two thirds of the proposed road should be earth or gravel
roads;
(g) a variety of different terrain conditions is desirable in kabupatens
which offer that possibility.
10.       The PMU or its consultants will appraise the roads proposed by the
districts by August/September 1988. By and large the roads should meet the
main criteria set for the Project. However, in view of the pilot nature of
the component, some flexibility, e.g., in the ERR requirements, will be
allowed. The technical assistance team for the pilot component would then
make the final recommendations for approval by the Government and the Bank
before the end of 1988.
11.       The approved roads would be included in the detailed engineering
design work to be arranged in early 1989. PMU or its consultants would
prepare the normally required tender documents while the technical assistance
team would prepare the special instructions/conditions required by the pilot
nature of the roads and monitor the design work.
12.       The above procedure would be repeated in 1989 and 1990 for the
1990/91 t ial and demonstration program. The total length of roads in the
four kabupatens would amount to about 80 km with about 40 km in each of the
1989/90 and 1990/91 programs.
13.       To ensure that full freedom is retained in respect of experimenta-
tion with different work methods, equipment and organization of the trial and
demonstration program will be implemented through force account. The
recommendations to be prepared by the technical assistance team will, however,
outline how contractors would be encouraged to use improved labor-based
methods in the future. Moreover, contractors will be invited to participate
in suitable training program in 1990/91.
14.       The experimental work will encompass major road construction
activities like earthworks, drainage, pavement and surfacing. Various sources
of power such as manual labor, agricultural tractors and small to intermediate
vehicles and self-propelled equipment will be tried. Different methods of
producing construction materials from different types and sources of raw
material will be tried.
15.       Maintenance Program.  The pilot component will include trials with
and demonstration of labor-based maintenance of gravel and sealed roads. The
technical assistance team will select a total of about 60 km of roads in the
four kabupatens in early 1989 for inclusion in the 1989/90 pilot maintenance
program. In addition to these roads the 1990/91 maintenance program will
include also the roads completed under the previous year's pilot construction
program.
16.       Various methods of organizing maintenance work will be tried.
Possible systems include lengthman system, roving maintenance crews, village-
based systems, contracted maintenance and possibly other. Different traffic
volumes and types of roads are likely to be best served by different systems



-v;6-                        ANNEX 6
Page 5 of 9
of maintenance organization. The trials aim at establishing the appropriate-
ness of different systems under different conditions, their effectiveness and
costs.
17.       The trial and demonstration program will be concerned with routine
maintenance only. The roads selected for the 1989/90 program (existing roads)
must therefore be in good condition at the start of the trials. The aim is to
show that they can be kept in basically the same condition through the
introduction of regular routine maintenance and that good trafficability can
be maintained throughout the period between scheduled periodic maintenance.
18.       Equipment for the Trial and Demonstration Program.  The tools and
equipment that are expected to be tried out are listed beluw. They include
equipment of an experimental nature which are not normally used on road
construction sites in Indonesia (although they are regularly used on
successful labor-based projects in other countries) and some vehicles which
are needed throughout the pilot component by the technical assistance team to
carry out the work. Despite the experimental nature of the pilot component
some standard types of equipment are likely to be used, e.g. trucks for
transport of material (gravel, etc.) over long haul distances. Because of the
uncertainty of the extent to which such equipment will £, needed they are not
included in the equipment procurement list. If the district concerned does
not have such equipment available they will be rented or the work (e.g.,
transport of gravel) will be contracted.
19.       It is in the nature of a trial and demonstration program that all
resource requirements cannot be determined in advance. Some flexibility to
change the specifications and types and numbers of equipment must be
allowed. For this reason the equipment list contains a lump sum for
miscellaneous equipment. That amount will be used also to buy survey and
testing equipment, training equipment, office equipment, etc. The require-
ments of these minor, not construction related, equipment will be estimated
after the arrival of the technical assistance team.
Tentative Equipment List
65-70 HP agricultural tractors
50-55 HP 4 x 4 tractors

20.       Technical Assistance.  The planning and supervision of the trial and
demonstration programs and the related training activities require the
services of specially qualified senior experts with experience of efficient
and productive labor-based projects. Such expertise is not available locally
and provision is therefore made for about 63 man-months of senior expatriate
advisors. In addition about 96 man-months of UN Volunteers is provided for.
Two of the senior advisors will be civil engineers to be engaged for the whole
duration of the pilot component (27 months each). One will be stationed in
Jakarta and function as Chief Technical Adviser (Team Leader) and also super-
vise directly the activities in West Java province. The other will supervise
the activities in West Kalimantan province and be stationed in Pontianak.
Short-term senior expatriate advisors will be engaged for, inter alia, pre-
paration of tools and equipment specifications and local manufacturing study.
21.       Local consultants will be engaged for the day-to-day supervision of
the trial and demonstration programs, for data collection in relation to the
various studies of alternative techniques, etc., for compilation and analysis
of data and to serve as instructors in the training of district staff. Local
consultant services will comprise about 140 man-months of civil engineers and
about 140 man-months of clerical/research assistance.
22.       The major tasks of the technical assistance team are given in para.
6.d).
23.       The total base costs of the pilot component, excluding physical and
price contingencies, are tentatively estimated at about US$4.8 million. The
major items are:
US$
Civil works                               2.5 million
Equipment                                 0.6 million
Consulting services                       1.6 million
Training and miscellaneous                0.1 million
Total Project Cost                   4.8 million
Financing
24.       In view of the experimental and pilot nature of this component the
proposed Bank loan would be expected to cover the total cost of the pilot
component.
Implementation
25.       A long list of road links for possible inclusion in the 1989/90
pilot construction program will be prepared according to specified criteria
(para. 9) by the BAPPEDA and DPUK staff in the four pilot districts between
March and August 1988. The PMU or its consultants will appraise the rcads by
August/September 1988 and the technical assistance team will make final recom-
mendations on about 40 km of road links for Government and Bank approval
before the end of 1988 (para. 10). Arrangements for detailed engineering



-68-                           ANNEX 6
Page 7 of 9
design to be monitored by the technical assistance team will be made in earlX
1989 (para. 11). The second year's program (about 40 km) will be prepared by
a similar schedule in 1989 and 1990 (para. 12).
26.       The procurement list and specifications for the tools and equipment
expected to be used in the 1989/90 construction and maintenance pilot programs
will be prepared in October/November 1988 by an equipment specialist member of
the technical assistance team. Procurement will be done from November 1988 to
June 1989.
27.       The DPUKs in the four pilot kabupatens will carry out the
rehabilitation/improvement of the roads through the staff of the DPUK under
the supervision of the CTA or his designated representative.
28.       For the pilot routine maintenance program about 60 km of road links
will be selected in early 1989 by the technical assistance team for approval
by the Government and the Bank and inclusion in the 1989/90 maintenance
budget. In addition to those roads, the 1990/91 maintenance program will also
include the roads completed under the 1989/90 construction/ improvement
program, i.e., about 40 km for a total of about 100 km (para. 15-17). This
plan of action requires that the Government agrees to the allocation of
budgets for routine maintenance of all types of roads immediately after the
completion of construction/improvement.
29.       Taking into account the Government's budget release/funds disburse-
ment procedures, it is expected that experimental maintenance work will start
in May 1989 and experimental construction/improvement work will start in July
1989. Efforts will be made to speed up the procedures for the 1990/91
programs to enable an earlier start by a few months, thereby making better use
of the dry season for construction work.
30.       For each rehabilitation/improvement "project" (road link) the DPUK
need to allocate, on a full-time basis, the following staff:
1    engineer
3-4 foremen/technician
1    surveyor
1    soils/materials test technician
3    administrative/clerical staff
Each kabupaten will implement two or three such "projects" during the first
year and up to four during the second year.
31.       The district of Bogor has assured the appraisal mission that it will
have the required staff available on a full-time basis. The districts of
Subang and Pontianak may need to recruit some additional staff, particularly
engineers, and the district of Sambas will have to recruit about 10 to 15
additional staff members of all categories. The appraisal mission has been
assured that the recruitment of additional staff has been initiated by the
Ministry of Home Affairs and the required number of staff will be available at
the start of the 1989/90 fiscal year, at the latest. It should be noted that
the engineers and most of the foremen must have several years site experience.



-69-                           ANNEX 6
Page 8 of 9
32.       The concerned district staff would participate in the training
program that will be implemented under the main component of the Rural Roads
II project. In addition the technical assistance team will provide special
training in the organization and supervision of efficient labor-based
methods.   The special training will consist of several short class-room
sessions of a few days each interspersed with practical on-the-job training on
site.
33.       The ILO will be appointed as Executing Agency for the entire
technical assistance (T.A.) package. The ILO will provide the expatriate
advisors, subcontract the services of local consultants and assist the
government to procure local and foreign equipment.
34.       The ILO will appoint one of the senior expatriace advisors as its
Chief Technical Advisor (CTA) and team leader. The CTA will report to the PMU
and to ILO.
35.       The senior expatriate advisors including the short-term equipment
specialist will be mobilized in October/November 1988. The local consultants
and the UNVs will be engaged by late 1988 or early 1989 and mobilized in
accordance with the need for their services. This will be determined in
connection with the preparation of the detailed workplan which will be
established jointly by the CTA and the PMU within three months of the CTA's
arrival.
36.       Technical reports, briefly describing and summarizing in figures the
work done (construction, maintenance, experiments, studies, procurement,
training, etc.) will be prepared quarterly. Technical working papers will be
prepared after the completion of trials or studies on subjects which can be
treated as separate issues. Tentative or provisional recommendations to the
Government may be issued when the CTA deems that the results achieved warrant
them but not later than just after the completion of the first construction/
maintenance season. Final draft report and recommendations including an
action plan for future application of labor-based techniques will be prepared
by the CTA at least one month before the termination of his services.
Procurement
37.       Construction/improvement of roads under the pilot component will be
carried out by force account to allow the necessary freedom and flexibility
for experimentation and trials. Certain activities involving the use of
standard type equipment (e.g. the transport of gravel, etc., over long
distances where tractors and trailers would be uneconomical) might be done by
subcontracts at the discretion of the CTA, the PMU and the DPUK, if the
kabupaten does not posses or cannot rent the necessary standard equipment.
38.       Routine maintenance work under the pilot component may be carried
out under a variety of different force account and contract arrangements
(para. 16). A program for trials with different systems will be prepared by
the CTA for approval by the PMU and the DPUKs.



ANNEX 6
-70-                         Page 9 of 9
39.       Foreign consultants' services will be provided by the ILO in
accordance with terms of reference to be agreed by the GOI and the Bank.
Disbursement and Auditing
40.       For civil works of the pilot component the procedures would be the
same as for the main component of the Rural Roads II project.
Environmental Aspects
41       do adverse environmental effects are anticipated through the
execution of the pilot component since the use of labor based methods and
small equipment will reduce to a minimum the disturbance of property and the
noise and air pollution along the construction sites.

INDONESIA
SECOND RURAL ROADS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Terms of Reference for Technical Assistance Services
I. INTRODUCTION
The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is responsible ;for provincial
and district administration in Indonesia, and is also responsible for
implementation of public works funded through the Inpres (Presidential
Instruction) programs. Two Inpres programs apply to district roadworks,
namely Inpres Kabupaten (a per capita grant which, because of Indonesia's
uneven population distribution, applies mostly to districts in Java) and
Inpres Jalan (specifically for roadworks, and oriented to districts outside
Java partly to redress the imbalance of Inpres Kabupaten). Within MHA, the
Directorate General of Regional Development (Bangda) is responsible for the
above Inpres programs, and the Directorate General of Regional Government
(PUOD) is responsible for provincial and district administrative and
organization.
The Ministry of Public Works is the central government agency
responsible for major public works, and within it, the Directorate General of
Highways (Bina Marga) is the highway authority. Bina Marga is responsible for
assisting MHA on technical aspects of district road development, and
participates on a Steering Committee for Rural Roads chaired by Bappenas, the
National Planning Authority.
Bina Marga and Bangda staff are seconded to a Project Management
Unit (PMU) which on behalf of the Director General of Bangda is responsible to
the implementation and monitoring of all aspects of foreign-funded rural Roads
programs including preparation of technical guidelines, and implementation of
institutional government.
With regard to the rural road sector, the major objectives of
Indonesia's Fourth Five Year Plan (1984/85 to 1988/89) are to: (a) enhance
economic development in rural areas; (b) provide better mobility to rural
communities; (c) increase accessibility in isolated areas by providing all
weather Roads; (d) strengthen the capability of district staff to plan,
construct and maintain the district road network; and (e) introduce suitable
techniques and works methods for road construction and maintenance.
In line with this, the long-term objective of the planning
arrangements is that the districts should be able to survey and evaluate
projects and plan their own works prog-ams following rational planning
procedures with only limited guidance and sample vetting from higher level
agencies. Likewise, the long-term objectives of field technical assistance is
that district staff should be able to carry out, monitor and control road



-72-                         ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 28
construction and maintenance work themselves, supported by consistent and
clear guidance from higher levels.
In 1986 the Government of Indonesia received a loan (No. 2083-IND)
from the World Bank for a Rural Roads Development Project (Rural Roads 1, RR
1) including provision for civil works such as road upgrading and support
works, equilment acquisition and technical assistance in various technical and
management areas. The scope of the Project included 25 districts spread over
the Provinces of North Sumatra, West Sumatra, Bengkulu, Jambi and West Java,
assistance beginning in 1982/83.
The Government is now discussing with the World Bank the possibility
of another loan for an additional 53 or so districts spread over 9
provinces. The proposed Rural Roads 2 project (RR 2) is plannned to begin in
1988/89, and continue during the following two years. The project would
include assistance for rehabilitation/improvement, routine and periodic
maintenance in the 53 districts. The 25 ex-RR 1 districts would also be
include in the scope of maintenance programs during the three year RR 2
Project period. All 78 districts are listed in Annex 1, while the estimated
scope of works is given in Table 3.2.
In the light of experience from the RR 1 Project, the Government and
the World Bank have reached agreement that during the RR 2 Project, more
rigorous standards will be applied to planning, design and construction
supervision of rural Roads, and that institutional strengthening and
structured training is required consistent with the Government's objectives
stated above.
It is expected that rehabilitation/improvement works will be
budgetted through Inpres Jalan, while road maintenance will be funded
primarily from the Inpres Kabupaten budget. It is the Government's intention
that planning and implementation of the rural Roads maintenance program should
be improved, and consultant technical assistance and training for the
districts on preparation of detailed maintenance works programs will be
required.
Because of the difficulty of obtaining good quality works from small
local contractors during RR rl, most of the proposed RR 2 works will be
grouped into packets for implementation by large contractors (those eligible
for works of Rp 200 million or over). In addition, part of the program will
be carried out by force account, including routine maintenance and some
periodic maintenance and rehabilitation/improvement works. These works will
be the medium for practical training of district staff, for which consultant
technical assistance and roadworks equipment is to be provided under the RR 2
project.
The Project Management Unit is responsible for coordination and
monitoring of all activities on foreign funded rural Roads projects, as well
as planning activities in preparation for the RR 2 Project. The PMU will also
be responsible for coordination and consistency of actions to be taken to
realign duties and responsibilities of all agencies involved in the rural
Roads program throughout Indonesia, following Instructions and Guidelines



ANNEX 7
Page 3 of 28
issued by the Minister of Home Affairs and the Director General of Regional
Development in May 1987.
Coordination of such re-alignment will follow an action plan to be
prepared and agreed between the Government and the World Bank. The action
plan will cover identification of present roles and staffing at all levels,
preparation of modifications to roles of the various agencies, staff
reallocation, recruitment and training.

SECOND RURAL ROADS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Economic Evaluation
Annual Works Program Formulation
1.        Experience with planning exercises carried out in the context of
programs supported by external funding sources has shown that programs are
best formulated on an annual basis given that road conditions and other
factors evolve over time, thereby altering relative priorities and rendering
out of date rigid multi-year programs. Moreover, it has also become clear
that for road planning at district level to become firmly established and
soundly based, the quality of planning data has to be much improved and that
such improvement will require a sustained and long term effort. Since the
economic rate of return (ERR) of the overall district roads program depends
critically on the composition of the annual programs in the individual
districts, the project gives great emphasis to systematic annual program
formulation.
2.        District roads in Indonesia carry significant traffic volumes--typi-
cally in the order of 50-200 vpd. Furthermore, because of the inter-relation-
ship between these roads and the national and provincial roads and the village
roads, the overall road network in the district constitutes a key planning
factor. The planning and programming approach being developed under the
project is, therefore, based on the following elements: (i) the introduction
of systematic methods of survey and analysis which will improve the quality
and consistency of the data base for district road planning and project
evaluation; (ii) the adoption of road network planning areas whereby surveying
is concentrated each year on geographically contiguous areas, which constitute
up to a quarter of the road network of a distr.ct so that over a period of
four to five years the whole district is covered; and (iii) the maximum use of
a traffic related evaluation method, i.e., for reliable roads and for roads
with low to moderate access constraint.
3.        Furthermore, the planning approach and its implementation arrange-
ments emphasize: (i) simplicity of the procedures to be followed at district
level and institution building to ensure that district staff in due course
will be able to survey and evaluate projects and formulate their annual works
program with only limited guidance and sample vetting at the higher level;
(ii) consistent planning procedures covering all parts of the district road
network as the basis of the district's entire annual works program.
4.        Annual works program formulation under the project essentially
comprises a survey phase and an evaluation phase. The survey phase is
designed to identify the initial list of candidate subprojects. Each year,
the main survey components in each district's road network planning area will
cover the following:



-107-                          ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 5
(a) road link and network identification and mapping using topographic
maps;
(b) road condition surveys sufficient to allow generalized costing of
improvements for screening purposes;
(c) two-day traffic counts on most links;
(d) location and distribution of population;
(e)  sample speed surveys;
(f) supporting surveys of unreliable roads with access constraints, and
of major bridge sites and key economic activities.
5.        The evaluation (screening) phase, designed to result in formulation
of the annual works program, is conducted in two stges: preliminary
screening of the candidate subprojects based on preliminary cost estimates
followed by final screening. Subproject evaluation for screening purposes is
based on traffic thus allowing rapid processing of a number of technical
options. Additional engineering will be carried out for the subprojects
screened in the first stage, followed by detailed costing and final evaluation
and formulation of the annual works program. Chart 1 shows in outline the
procedure to be adopted. The average planning lead time (from start of
planning till start of implementation) is about 18 months. The planning phase
for the 1988/89 project year is employed to test certain survey and analytical
procedures and to train local consultants and district staff in the traffic
survey procedures which have already been adequately tested in the past.
During the planning phase for the 1989/90 project year the district staff will
be trained to carry out most of the other types of planning surveys.
Thereafter, the emphasis will shift to the transfer of skills in analytical
and evaluation procedures. Every year, by December 31, together with
submission of the program of works for the following year, an action plan will
be submitted for training of district staff in planning procedures.
6.        For most of the first annual slice of the project, because of the
time constraint an ad hoc approach (as opposed to the network planning area
approach) was adopted for the initial identification of candidate
subprojects. It consisted of the selection of a long list of subprojects--
420 road links covering some 2,900 km--by the districts according to specified
criteria, the most important being that the roads should be motorable vir-
tually year-round and should already carry at least a moderate level of traf-
fic. Thus subprojects were limited to those most amenable to standard
evaluation based on brief traffic and engineering surveys to be carried out by
local consultants. For this long list of-candidate subprojects field work was
undertaken covering traffic counts and engineering surveys. A works program
by disirict was subsequently formulated by screening the subprojects.
Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Calculations
7.        For screening of the long list a standard economic evaluation was
followed based on investment costs and road user savings accruing to all



-108-                            ANNEX 9
Page 3 of 5
categories of road users.  The evaluation method used is serving as a model
for the formulation of subsequent annual programs.  The calculation procedures
were suitably streamlined to permit rapid processing of the large number of
subprojects. The results of these calculations provided the basis for a
ranking of subprojects by district, for formulation of a program of works and
an overall ERR calculation.
8.        The subprojects to be evaluated are typically 5-10 km road links.
Improvement works to be undertaken usually consist of reconstruction or major
rehabilitation with penetration macadam surfacing for sealed roads or crushed
gravel for unsealed roads. Two or more improvement options defined in terms
of pavement width and surface type were usually tested for each subproject.
Minor improvement works were not evaluated as an alternative option. Design
standards are related to projected vehicle traffic five years after road
improvement. Design life is ten years with appropriate provision for periodic
resealing or regravelling. The average improvement cost of all viable
subprojects was US$22,500 equivalent per km. Benefit calculations included
the following: savings in motorized and non-motorized vehicle operating costs
and in passenger time costs; benefits in respect of generated traffic; for
roads with low traffic levels, benefits on account of diversion from non-
motorized modes to motorized vehicles; and savings in maintenance costs "with"
and "without" the project.
9.        Traffic counts (6 and 12 hour counts) were conducted at a minimum of
one station on all project links. Wherever possible counts were carried out
at the same station on two separate days to cover both a market day and a non-
market day. Adjustments were made to estimate 24 hours traffic and allow for
daily and seasonal variations in traffic. Since these were the first systema-
tic counts in the project districts, there are no historical records of
traffic trends on which to base projections of future traffic. Using availa-
ble data on traffic growth on main roads in combination with income elasticity
of demand for transport, traffic growth was projected to be in the 3-6Z
range. Traffic generation was estimeted using an assumed price elasticity for
transport demand of approximately -1.0. On low-trafficked roads, where
traffic levels or vehicle types are constrained by road condition, a transfer
from pedestrian and non-motorized freight modes to motorized vehicles has been
estimated using assumptions of the divertable proportion of existing traffic.
10.       For motorized traffic, vehicle operating costs (voc) were derived by
adjusting the voc model developed by DGH for national and provincial roads as
the voc available directly from that model are not appropriate for district
roads owing to differences in traffic composition and in road condition.
Seven road categories were specified on the basis of level of roughness and
average travel speed (Table 1). Five vehicle categories were adopted: light
vehicle (pick-up and minibus), light truck, light bus, car and motorcycle.
For non-motorized traffic, seven relevant types were identified: passenger
bicycke, freight bicycle, tricycle, ox-cart, horse-cart, packhorse and
pikulan. For the evaluation of personal time savings a distinction is drawn
between productive time and private time. Productive time has been calculated
on the basis of an economic wage rate of Rp 290/hour (US$0.18) in Java and
Rp 460/hour (US$0.28) in the Outer Islands. The value of private time is
based on half the estimated opportunity cost of unskilled labor in rural areas



-109-                           ANNEX 9
Page 4 of 5
i.e. Rp 75/hour (US$0.05) in West Java and Rp 120/hour (US$0.07) in the Outer
Islands. Combined vehicle operating and passenger time costs are shown in
Tables 2-5.
11.       Of the total of 420 subprojects studied, 231 or 55% have an ERR of
10% or greater. The remaining projects were either found not viable, having
an ERR below 10% or had not been fully evaluated on the grounds that they were
found not to meet the initial selection criteria or because of inadequate
survey data.
12.       Sensitivity calculations were performed on a sampls of 50 subproj-
ects to test the sensitivity of the ERR to changes in the basic assumptions,
i.e., in respect of construction costs, base year traffic and traffic growth,
road condition assessment, generated traffic, non-motorized traffic and modal
diversion, times values, maintenance cost savings, project life or
implementation performance. The outcome of the ERR and sensitivity analyses
permitted the ranking of subprojects for each district and classifying them
according to degree of risk. The cut-off ERR was set at 10% and the overall
ERR of all subprojects with an ERR of 10% or greater is 29%.
Special Evaluation Procedures
13.       Some subprojects, such as those involving significant development
benefits, substantial traffic diversion or forming part of former transmigra-
tion schemes, may noc be suitable for the standard evaluation method outlined
above. These subprojects will normally be identified in the annual survey
phase given that once the network planning areas have been determined, all
road links are to be surveyed according to consistent and similar procedures.
14.       Subprojects which present traffic diversion issues will require a
special survey and evaluation approach focussing on network effects. Other
subprojects may fail to meet the staindard viability criteria based on traffic
and road user savings because population or economic activity in the area of
influence of the road (or in the transmigration scheme as the case may be) are
at too low a level. It will therefore be necessary to deLermine whether this
is the result of constraints to development, and if so, to what extent these
constraints are related to poor road access or to other problems. The road
links which present problems of viability based on standard criteria and for
which road access has been ideatified as the prime constraint to development
would be the subject of special studies by a centrally based team.
15.       Special studies, however, cannot be expected to address satisfac-
torily complex issues of transmigration (or other) scheme development other
than those related to road access. For situations where the district
authorities attach high priority to projects which fail to meet standard
criter'a and cannot be covered adequately by special studies (or fail to pass
the teJt of special studies), two options remain: (i) to treat the areas/
transmigration sites as special cases under which basic all-weather access is
provided to population centers of pre-determined minimum size based on least-
cost solutions for designs appropriate to the function of the road; and (ii)
treat the road in the context of wider integrated studies of all aspects of
development in the area/transmigration site in question, to be handled by



-110-                              ANNEX 9
Page 5 of 5
other agencies (Chart 2). Specific criteria to determine whether a subproject
qualifies for special studies, for least-cost treatment or for reference to
another agency still need to be developed. The methodologies to be employed
for the special studies and the parameters for the least cost approach, also
need to be elaborated. Government intends to work out these criteria and
methodologies for submission and approval by the Bank not later than
December 31, 1987. No subproject which fails to meet the standard criteria
will be financed under the project unless it has been evaluated and found
viable, based on the broad approach outlined above and the criteria and
methodologies still to be developed.
