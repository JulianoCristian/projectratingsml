PUIPED STORAGE Pa{ER PROJEC'
SUvIARY
i.        The Government of Ireland on behalf of the Electricity Supply
Board (ESB), has requested a loan to finance part of the cost of a 280-NW
pumped storage power project to be located about 40 km south of Dublin.
The proposed loan would be for the equivalent of US$14.5 million, including
interest during construction which would cover about 80% of the foreign
exchange cost of the Project. The total cost of the Project would be
US$31.5 million.
ii.       The loan would supply only 8% of ESB's capital expenditure
program for the next four years. This would be the first loan to Ireland
and the Project would be the first pure pumped storage scheme financed by
the Bank.
iii.      ESB's capital expenditure program is well planned.  The Project
forms an integral part of this prograra, and is needed to meet the future
load growth and improve system operating flexibility. It is technically
sound, the estimated cost is reasonable, and the construction schedule is
realistic.
iv.       The proposed Borrower, the Electricity Supply Board, is an
autonomous Government agency responsible for generating and selling all
central-station power in the Republic of Ireland.  The system provides
service to virtually all sections of the country. The ESB is a stable,
conservative organization with a successful operating history and possesses
a staff capable of managing the construction and operation of the Project.
v.        ESB's financial position is regulated by the Electricity Supply
Act of 1927, which provides essentially that income should be just suffi-
cient to meet expenditures including allowances for appropriate reserves.
While this criterion has in the past yielded a relatively low rate of
return, ESB's financial performance is generally satisfactory.
vi.       The Project is the least-cost alternative for supplying the
needed capacity provided the cost of capital is not more than 14%.   The
estimated internal rate of return for the Project investment is 19%,
valuing additional sales at average rates.
vii.      Satisfactory agreement has been reached during negotiations
on the points sum,marized in paragraph 8.03. The Project would be suitable
for a Barik loan of US$14.5 million equivalent, for a period of 25 years
including a grace period of about five years.

PUMPED STORAGE PWER PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of a Project for the instal-
lation of a 280-MW pumped-storage power plant at the Turlough Hill 1 site
on the system of the Irish Electricity Supply Board (see Map). The PTroject
was originally proposed for Bank financing in 1966 and a reconnaissance
and identification mission visited Ireland early in 1967, but consideration
of the Project was deferred pending increased availability of Bank funds.
1.02      The purpose of a pumped-storage project is to supply economical
capacity for generating power to meet load peaks, and to provide flexi-
bility to system operation. Water is pumped from a lower reservoir to an
upper reservoir during the low-load early morning hours using the surplus
capacity of the large, efficient steam plants on the system. During peak
load hours, the water is returned to the lower reservoir through turbine
generators. A pure pumped-storage project (as in the Turlough Hill
Project) consumes more energy than it generates, but in so doing it permits
more efficient use of the energy that is generated by transforming low-cost
night energy into valuable peak energy. A fuller explanation of the pumped-
storage technique is given in Annex 3.
1.03      The Government of Ireland has requested a loan on behalf of the
Electricity Supply Board, which would be the Borrower. The proposed loan
amount of US$14.5 million equivalent, including interest during construction
would cover about 80% of the estimated foreign exchange cost of the Project.
The total cost of the Project is estimated to be the equivalent of US$31.5
million. The proposed loan would cover only about 8% of ESB's investment
program for the next four years.
1.04      This report is based on information furnished by the Electricity
Supply Board to a mission consisting of Messrs. J.J. Fish and S.S. Scales
who visited Ireland in August/September 1968, supplementing data collected
by Mr. F.H. Howell who visited Ireland in January, 1967.
1/ "Turlough" (tur-lok) means "dry lake" in the Irish language and is the
name given to the hill where the Project's upper reservoir will be
located. The reference is to the proposed man-made reservoir, or
"dry lake".



2. ENERGY USE IN IRELAND
2.01      In 1964, the Economic Research Institute of Dublin (ERI)
sponsored a four-part study of energy&- use in Ireland, aimed at fore-
casting energy consumption by sector and source in 1970. Most of the
values given in the following paragraphs are from that study. The fore-
cast is that use of commercial energy will increase at the rate of 4.9%
p.a., and that in 1970, 32% of all commercial energy will be consumed as
electricity, up from 21% in 1954. By sector, 36% of all energy will be
consumed by industry, up from 27% in 1954. Imported fuels will provide
73% of total energy and indigenous sources (mostly peat and hydroelec-
tricity) 27%. About half of the electricity used will be generated from
imported oil, 30% from peat (called "turf"), and 20%o from hydro power.
2.02      Natural gas is not yet available in Ireland.   Piped manufactured
gas is available in the larger urban centers but it is not significantly
cheaper than electricity and is not marketed aggressively. On the other
hand, liquified petroleum gas ("bottled gas") has recently been introduced
in rural areas and is enjoying a good acceptance for cooking and supple-
mental heating - loads which are not particularly desirable on the elec-
trical system. In terms of the total energy sector, though, gas plays a
small part - less than 4% in 1963 and a forecast of only 2.4% in 1970.
It is expected that gas will continue to be priced competitively with
electricity, and so even if natural gas were introduced or existing supplies
were marketed more intensively, the proportional share of the market is
not likely to change significantly.
Turf
2.03      Hand-won turf, that is, peat cut in bricks and dried, is the
traditional fuel of Ireland, but the work of cutting turf is arduous and
not particularly productive. This form of fuel accounted for 10% of total
energy used in 1963, but its use is declining, being replaced gradually
by electricity, gas and commercial peat briquettes.
2.04      The production of commercial milled peat, briquettes, and other
peat products, is the function of Bord Na Mona, (the Turf Board), a govern-
ment agency which started intensive development of the peat bogs about 15
years ago. The goal of the development was to relieve Ireland's dependence
on imported fuel. Today, two-thirds of total peat production is consumed
in ESBIs power stations with most of the remainder sold as briquettes for
domestic and industrial uses. The production targets were established at
a rate that would result in a 25-40 yr life for the bogs. Unfortunately,
the original forecasts of harvest capabilities and costs were optimistic
2/ The term "energy" is used in the general sense to include consumption
of petroleum fuels in vehicles, coal and oil for heating, and other
uses of commercial energy including electricity.

and made in a time of inflated prices for. imported fuel, and peat is now
not competitive in price with imported coal and oil. ESB supports Bord
Na Mona's activities by buying peat at rates fixed by the Turf Board,
with Government approval.   In 1967/68 the fuel cost for plants burning
peat averaged 0.8d/kl,lh while that for the oil-burning stations was only
o .35d/kwh.
2.05      The Government recognizes the cost disadvantages of the Turf
operations and has employed a consulting firm to explore methods of reducing
costs and opening new markets for peat products. The Turf Board itself is
developing imtproved machinery designed to reduce the number of passes over
the bog required to harvest a given amount of peat, and to alleviate the
dependence on weather. No peat-burning power stations have been built
since 1964, and the ESB does not plan to build any unless the cost situation
is corrected.
2.06      Because of the disparate cost, a good harvest year for peat
(as was 1968) has the effect of increasing ESB's generating cost because
ESB has a commitment to burn all the peat that is produced and pricing is
on a unit cost basis. The unpredictable year-to-year variation in average
fuel cost makes it difficult for ESB to maintain a uniform tariff policy
and still rmeet the !'no-profit, no-loss" goal for financial operations.
This question was discussed during negotiations when it was indicated that E3B
is reviewing the pricing policy with Bord Ila Mona.  In any event since
the percentage of total generation supplied from peat is declining the
problem is becoming of less importance.
The Power Sector
2.07      The Electricity Supply Board generates and sells all central
station power used in the Republic of Ireland. In the year ended March 31,
1968, ESB sold 3,570 GUih to its 745,000 customers, used for the following
purposes:
Residential                     Gt,h        % of Total

This 3,570 GWh is 1200 klVh for each of the Republic's 2,900,000 people.
By comparison, the annual per-capita consurz.ption of electricity in England
is about 3,600 kWh. At 1,200 kWlh/person, Ireland ranks above only Greece,
Portugal and Spain among European countries, but consumption is of the same
order of magnitude as that in Niorthern Ireland and Scotland.
2.08      When the ESB was established in 1927, it was authorized a total
capital expenditure of about £3 million. This has been increased period-
ically and the presently-authorized amount is more than £290 million, in-
cluding £42 million for rural electrification. ESB's estimated net assets
in operation on March 31, 1968, were £114 million (US$270 million equiva-
lent). Capital expenditure in fiscal 1968 was 14.3 million and is
expected to continue at a rate of about £18 million per year for the next
six years. This expenditure is about 15% of the total public investment
and perhaps 7% of all investment in capital projects in Ireland.
2.09      Energy sales show a marked seasonal variation as a result of
the predominant residential load.  In winter there are two pronounced
daily peaks (see Annex 2), at 12:30 and 6 p.m. These peaks are about
equal, but the day-time peak has been increasing in relation to the evening
peak. Elec-tric cooking demand coincident with maximum industrial usage is
the cause of the noon peak, as the Irish have their principal meal at mid-
day. ESB considers that supplemental electric space heating is responsible
for the evening peac, but no doubt lighting also plays an important part.
The evening pealk disappears in the summer and the mid-day peak is predominant.
Except for the evening peak, the summer daily load curve is nearly a duplicate
of the winter curve, reduced about 30%. The ESB has experienced a marked
increase in evening load with the spread of television, and timing of popular
programs is taken into account in establishing the daily generating schedules.
Interconnection
2.10      In 1966, a joint committee composed of representatives of the ESB
and the Northern Ireland electricity supply undertakings prepared a compre-
hensive report on the feasibility of interconnection between the ESB system
and that operated by the three organizations in Northern Ireland. The com-
mittee drew on the experience of authorities in the U.K., France and the U.S.
for guidance. The general conclusion was that interconnection would be de-
sirable and economical, and a 275/220-kV interconnection of 300-MWf capacity
was proposed. A basic agreement establishing the objectives and authorizing
construction of t1he scheme was signed in October 1967 by representatives of
the Republic and Northern Ireland. The connecting lines are now under con-
struction and expected to be in limited service in the Fall of 1969.
2.11      The size and load characteristics of the two systems are similar
(800 MW demand for Northern Ireland vs. 950 IM for ESB in 1968), and the
studies indicated that the difference in timing of the system peak demands
would result in a reduced requirement in total generation of 120 MW at the
time the interconnection was placed in service. This diversity is based
on historical load curves and ray be affected by the adoption of Central
European Time this year throughout Ireland. Because of this, the Boaid
has not included the diversity benefit in its forward planning for generat-
ing capacity pending an evaluation of the effect of the time change. The
effect of interconnection has been considered, however, in selecting unit
sizes.



-5-
2.12      A formal interchange agreement is being negotiated between the
Board and the Northern Ireland undertakings represented by the Northern
Ireland Joint Electricity Committee. The agreement will establish sales
prices for energy flows under various conditions of system operation, and
procedures for sharing cost savings. At present, no substantial net
energy flows are contemplated since plant sizes and efficiencies are
similar in both north and south, however, fuel used in Northern Ireland
is subject to an internal tax which increases the generating costs there
above those in the south. If this condition persists, it would be advan-
tageous for the North Ireland authorities to import power during periods
when ESB has capacity available from the large oil-fired plants. Since
these periods would coincide with the normal pumping periods at Turlough
Hill, the anticipated economies of the Project could be affected, but the
authorities recognize that the cost differential is in effect an artifi-
cial onc and such oDeatIon is no- provided for- in the objcctives of the
October 1967 cgreewent. Dui:inr negotiations ESB confirmed that the
provislons of the finial agreement w~ould not h-ve an adverse effect on
the P:'oJect `ustification.
Rural Electrification
2.13      In 1946, in an effort to halt emigration and urban migration,
the government initiated a social program to improve rural living condi-
tions. As part of this program, the government required the ESB to embark
on a country-wide rural electrification project. The government accepted
liability for the payment to the Board of a subsidy of 50% of the capital
outlay for the project, based on a report that electricity could be sold
at standard rates to the majority of rural dwellings in Ireland if this
level of subsidy were granted. The subsidy was discontinued in 1955,
unfortunately during the years of maximum expenditure, but it was restored
and increased to 75% in 1958. As of March 31, 1968, ESB had 334,000
customers, 45% of all customers, classed as "rural" (although not all
"rural" customers are served from facilities constructed under the rural
electrification program). An estimated 87% of the rural areas had been
served. The major expansion work was completed above five years ago,
but expenditures for strengthening the distribution network continue at
a rate of about L2.0 million per year. The total capital outlay on rural
electrification was B41.2 million. The subsidy has amounted to 112.5
million or 30% of the total expenditure. Rural sales in 1968 were 817
million klh, or 23% of total sales; the revenue accounted for 28% of the
total revenue.
Tariff Structure
2.14)     The 1927 Act in effect controls only the total revenue fran sales
of electricity; the detailed ramifications of the tariff structure are left
to the Board (see para. 6.08). Average revenue from all sales in 1968 was
2.01d/kWh.  Rural customers paid 2.5d/kWh.while urban sales (which includes
85% of all industrial loads) averaged 1.8d/kUh. Residential and commer-
cial sales for general service are on two-part tariff forms having a fixed



- 6 -
charge, related to the size of the premises served, and a "unit rate" or
energy charge. Of industrial sales, 85% are based on a tariff that in-
cludes a bmaad charge and an energy charge. This tariff includes a fuel-
cost adjustment which compensates for about 30% of the changes in ESB's
total costs for fuel, including peat. There is also an off-peak option
whereby the customer may request that only those demands occurring during
the peak hours will be counted in calculating the charges for the four
winter months. Industries taking advantage of this off-peak option are,
in effect, charged on a tariff approaching marginal costing.
2.15      Special tariff forms are available for certain loads.   The
lowest of these (0.8 and O.6d/kWh) applies to storage heating which is
connected only from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m. and for a two-hour afternoon
period. This rate was introduced a few years ago to promote an improve-
ment in system load factor. The Board estimates that 36 MW of storage
heating load was added in 1968, and sales under this tariff have increased
12-15% per year (20-30% in the domestic sector), but in the past six
years there has been no significant change in system load factor
(48.9-5o.5%). Under these circumstances it is difficult to assess the
effectiveness of the storage-heating promotion, and the introduction of
pumped storage may require a re-evaluation of this marginal tariff.
2.16      In applying adjustments, the Board tends to increase the
fixed-charge portions of the tariffs by a greater percentage than the
energy component or variable charge portions, thus making the overall
rate form more promotional in character. In the last two such actions
(1966 and 1968), the variable charges for industrial loads and storage
heating were not increased at all. This policy is easily justified since
incremental generating costs have, on the whdole, been declining, but
continuation of the policy would result in an unbalonced rate structure.
3. THE ESB PROGRAM
3.01      Planning for system expansion is the responsibility of the
Planning and Development division of the System Operations Department,
Office of the Chief Engineer. Generating plant expansion is proposed
for adoption by the Board about five years in advance of need. The
engineering group proceeds with designs on the basis of the Board's
adoption of the program, but final approval is required before contracts
are awarded.  Capital expenditure programs for transmission are prepared
two to three years in advance, but total expenditure forecasts for the
system are available only one year ahead, in the form of the annual
budget.



- 7 -
3.02      ESB's expenditures for capital improvements will average f18
million (US$43 million) annually over the next six years. Expenditures
for the previous six years averaged L12 million annually. At the pro-
posed rate of expenditure, ESB's net assets in operation will increase
about 50% in the next six years.
3.03      Generating facilities account for about 35% of total invest-
ment requirements. The present program includes the following new units:

1977 (tentative)  Pigeon Hse. #3 (or Nuclear)      400 NW
3.04      All plants except Turlough Hill are oil-fired thermal, and
orders have been placed and construction started on all units preceding
the Turlough Hill Project. Preliminary work has started at the Cork
site. The Tarbert plant is located in the west of Ireland on the Shannon
estuary; Pigeon House is in Dublin; Great Island and Cork are on the
south coast.
3.05      Transmission and distribution expenditures will be about 12
million annually. This relatively high figure reflects the low load
density and low average consumption in the system. Since the grid
already covers virtually the entire country, with the exception of the
E2 million interconnection with Northern Ireland there are no signifi-
cant extension projects. The funds will be used to strengthen the
existing system and increase distribution capacity.

4. THE PROJECT
l.01      The Project proposed for Bank financing would consist of an
underground power cavern with four 70-NW reversible pump-turbine units,
an artificial upper reservoir and improvements to an existing lake,
Lough Nahanagan, which would be used as the lower reservoir. A 220-kV
switchyard and about 80 km of 220-kV transmission line are also included.
The location and general arrangement of the Project are shown on the map,
and explained in detail in Annex 3. The cost of the Project would be
US$31.5 million equivalent, which is 12% of ESB's capital expenditure
program for 1969 to 1974.
Status of Engineering and Procurement
4.02      Although ESB's own staff normally undertakes all of the engineer-
ing and design work for new projects, in the case of Turlough Hill they
selected Lahmeyer International of Frankfurt for economic studies and for
consultation on the unique aspects of the Project. The Consultants sub-
mitted their final project report in September, 1968. This report defined
the details of the Project including economic tunnel sizes, choice of
conduit linings, and similar construction details of civil, mechanical,
and electrical features.  The working drawings and tender documents for the
Project are being prepared by ESB staff with advice from the Consultants as
required. The staff is capable of doing this work. The cost of the Consult-
antts services would not be financed from the proposed loan.
4.03      Calls were issued on an intiernational basis for prequalification
of contractors for the main civil works, and tender documents for this
contract have been prepared and are acceptable to the Bark.  The Board has
invited eleven contractors to bid on the Project. The selected contractors
are required to associate themselves with a firm having proven experience
in constructing the type of asphalt membrane to be used to seal the upper
reservoir. The pre-qualification evaluation procedure used by the Board
to select the eligible contractors is acceptable to the Bank. Specifica-
tions for major mechanical and electrical equipment are also being prepared
and contracts for civil works and major equipment are expected to be awardedin
M4arch or April of 1969. This work is being done in accordance with the
Bank'cs procurement guidelines.
4.04      Under ESB's usual procurement procedures, payment for major
equipment items is not made until the goods are installed at the plant
site, with the usual retention.  In order to achieve quicker disbursement
of the loan and to obviate the need for the contractors to carry the
financing burden for the three year construction period, the Borrower
agreed during negotiations to adopt more conventional payment
procedures for contracts financed from the loan (i.e. - a modest down
payment plus progress payments during the manufacturing and construction
period).

Construction Schedule
4.05      The Electricity Supply Board has awarded contracts for site prepara-
tion, access roads, and construction of the outlet and spillway on the lower
reservoir& When the mission visitd, the site in August 1968, the access xcacs
were about 50% complete, exploratory tunneling was finished, and the
spillway excavation was nearly complete and the lake was being lowered
preparatory to starting work on the bottom outlet. The cost of this
work would not be financed from the proposed loan. The site should be
ready for start of the main civil works in the Fall of 1969. A hi-
year construction schedule is planned with the first 70-MW set to be
in commercial operation early in 1973. All major work is expected to
be complete by the end of 1973.
Cost Estimate
4.06      The estimate of cost was prepared by the Consultants and has
been reviewed and accepted by ESB. Estimates for general civil works
were checked against recent ESB cantracts for similar work and the es-
timate of cost for the reservoir sealing work was based on figures
obtained from specialists in this field. Estimates used for major
equipment were verified using budget quotations from manufacturers and
costs for transmission facilities are ESB estimates. The contingency
allowance of 20% on civil works and 10% on equipment is considered to
be adequate, and the estimate is realistic.  The cost would be $112/kW,
including interest during construction, which is reasonable for peaking
capacity.

Disbursements
4.07      The proposed loan would cover the foreign exchange costs of the
major civil works, estimated at 50% of the total cost of the major civil
works contract, and the cost of the large equipment items, for which
contracts would be awarded after international competitive bidding as
pointed out in para. 4.03. Certain imported materials used throughout
the ESB system (i.e., tower steel, insulators, conductor, control devices)
are purchased under blanket contracts and other items (lighting fixtures,
air conditioning equipment) would be included in small local contracts
for which Bank financing would not be feasible. Interest during con-
struction is also included in the proposed loan, and on this basis,
the loan would cover about 80%of the total foreign exchange cost of the
Project. In general, there are no import duties or taxes levied against
materials of the type used in the Project. Loan disbursements would be
for the foreign currency costs of imported equipment and services only,
and expenditures prior to the date of signing of the loan would not be
eligible for reimbursement. Should the Project be completed for less
than estimated costs, any undisbursed amount of the proposed loan would
be cancelled unless there were good grounds for applying savings to
additional works.
Operating Cost
4.08      Pumping energy is expected to be supplied from large sets
having a fuel cost of 0.3d/kWh, which, with an allowance for cycle effi-
ciency of 63%, would result in a unit cost of generation from Turlough
Hill of 0.48d/kWh.  Operating and maintenance costs would add 1140,000
per year, or 0.2d/kWh based on 900 hours annual operation at full-load,
although in order to minimize operating labor costs at Turlough Hill
3SB is planning to operate the plant remotely from a control center in
Dublin.
5.  JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Load Forecasts
5.01      Energy consumption on the ESB system has displayed a remarkably-
constant growth rate of about 9% (see Annex 1). Slackening of growth in
one year (e.g. 1967 - 8.6%) seems to have been compensated for in the
next (e.g. 1968 - 10.3%). The 1964 ERI report (para. 2.01) included a
study to determine, by means of regression analysis, the significant
parameters affecting growth of both energy usage and electricity sales.
Parameters studied included time, temperature (weather) variations,
Gross National Product, and price. Cross-section analyses using data
from selected countries were also made, but the results indicated growth
rates of 5.6 and 3.8% which were discarded as being unreasonably low.
In the time-series analysis, GNP was the significant dependent parameter
but the predicted electrical growth rate of 16.8% based on the GNP fore-
cast of 4.35 was considered unreasonably high.  Price did not prove to be
sigaificant,   and temperature variations affected only the quarterly
distribution of annual sales - not total sales. The conclusion was that,
despite a very sophisticated statistical analysis, simple time trends



- 11 -
provide the best basis for forecasting grnth in electrical consumption,
and that for Ireland a growth rate of 8.5% p.a. was taken as reasonable.
5.02      The Electricity Supply Board has adopted this philosophy and
based on historical data uses a forecast of annual grath in total gene-
ration of energy of 9% per annum for basic planning. Cumulative weekly
records of generation, corrected for temperature variation, are used to
monitor the forecast and to adjust the planning targets if necessary.
Required Generating Capacity
5.03      Until 1961, the total capacity needed in the ESB system was
determined by the amount of thermal-plant capacity needed to supply
firming energy for the hydro and peat-fueled plants, both of which are
weather-dependent. Thermal capacity sufficient for this purpose in-
herently provided enough capacity to meet peak power demands. After
1961, as the proportion of hydro and peat-fueled stations declined,
system peak demand became the determining criterion. Since 1964 the
department of engineering has had the exclusive use of a computer for
construction and generation programming and other engineering studies.
The availability of this machine has led the ESB to develop advanced
procedures in generation planning which probably are as sophisticated as
any being used in the world today.
5.o4      The method used for programming construction of generating
capacity involves a demand forecast using as input the 9% growth in gene-
ration (kwh) and the historical relationship between the annual generation
and the 50 highest peaks. Two sets of demands are calculated; a iIedian
Annual Peac, which is the demand that would be exceeded with a probability
of 1/2 (i.e. - once every two years), and a "highest expected" demand
which has a probability of 1/15 (see Annex l). Generating plant is then
fitted to these curves using historical outage data of representative
plant until a system is developed which has a failure rate of not greater
than 1/15. This procedure has resulted in a generating program having a
minimum reserve capacity of 22%, which is high compared with the 15-17%
range common in Europe and the U.S. One significant feature of the method
is the small difference, about 2%, between the 1/2 and 1/15 probability
demand forecasts. The variation in actual demand resulting from fluc-
tuations in the assumed growth rate of 9%o would presumably be much greater
than this. The generating development program indicated on Annex 1 was
derived using the method outlined above, and has been adopted by the Board.
Size of the Project
5.05      As explained in Annex 3, the economic size of a pumped-storage
project is largely a function of the site parameters, which govern the
amount of storage and head that can be developed. -Once the economic
capacity of a particular site has been determined, it is necessary to as-
certain if the system can absorb that capacity, and in what stages it
should be developed. The Consultant's study determined that the economic
size of the Turlough Hill development would be 280 1V based on a six-hour
daily full capacity pumping cycle, and that the full capacity could be



- 12 -
utilized in the system on a feasible operating schedule, although initially
this represents 18% of demand, somewhat high for a development of this sorto
ESB's own studies on cost savings confirmed the desirability of installing
the full capacity of the Project as scheduled in the program.
Alternatives
5.06      The initial economic studies for the Project were made on
conventional grounds comparing the pumped storage scheme -with both base-
load and peaking thermal stations. These studies were made both by ESB
and their Consultants and indicated annual cost savings of about $1O0
million for the pumped storage plan. ESB also made a supplementary study
that indicated that, even with the most unfavorable utilization of ESB s
thermal plants in conjunction with the pumped storage scheme, annual
savings would exceed $200,000. In these studies, no credit was taken for
the anticipated system operating benefitse
5.07      An analysis on a discounted cash flow basis using information
furnished by the ESB indicates that the pumped-storage project is the
least-cost alternative for supplying the needed peaking capacity, provided
the cost of capital is not more than 14%. Alternatives considered were
gas-turbine peaking units and oil-fired steam plant. Costs used in the
comparisons were 0.72d/kWh and 0.42d/kMh for fuel and $70/kW and $132/kW
respectively, which correspond to actual costs for similar units on the
ESB system. There are no other reasonable alternatives. The internal
rate of return on the investment for the Project would be 19%, based on
an analysis wherein the additional kWh sold are valued at prevailing
rates averaging 2.15d/kWh.
5.o8      The development of off-peak load such as night storage heating
is sometimes considered as an "alternative" to pumped storage, but
actually such development only changes the parameters affecting the type
of peaking-capacity selected since, with pumped-storage, the added off-
peak load would require increased generation from the less-efficient
thermal plants. A pumped-storage scheme intended to supply a large
portion of the peak (as in Turlough Hill) is vulnerable to pronounced
changes in the shape of the load curve, at least in the early years, but
no such changes are foreseen on the Irish system (para. 2.15),
6. THE BOFWRER
6,01      The Electricity Supply Board generates and sells all central
station power used in the Republic of Ireland. It engages in all aspects
of electricity supply from the construction of its own power stations to
the sale of electrical appliances, and it is, by any measure, one of the
largest enterprises in the country. It is the largest in terms of net
assets and annual revenue and second in number of employees (surpassed
only by C.I.E. - the government transport company, and perhaps by the
Guinness brewery and its peripheral activities). The Board is also
the largest of all public bodies in Ireland.



- 13 -
6.02      Even though the ESB is a government-sponsored statutory
corporation, it is generally free of government control except for the
development of rural electrification, (para. 2.13), the obligation to
use indigenous fuel (para, 2.04), and approval of tariff changes and
borrowing (paras, 6.08 and 6,14). The seven members of the Board,
selected from business and the professions, are appointed by the Cabinet
for individual terms of up to five years. Reappointments are customary
which contributes to the high degree of responsibility and continuity
which characterizes the Board. The Chairman of the Board is the chief
executive officer of the organization and with the Chief Engineer, Chief
Accountant, and Secretary, forms the executive committee -which deals
-with the routine work of the enterprise. The Board itself meets fort-
nightly to consider policies, budgets, and major expenditures. The senior
officers of the organization are career employees with years of service 'with
the ESB and there is a definite effort to build strength "in depth" in the
departments. Few employees are lost through emigration or to private firms.
6.03      With 10,000 employees (25% of whom are classed as "Temporary")
the Board is a natural target for labor disputes. In the year ended
March 31, 1968, the ESB suffered eleven strikes, only one of which was
"official". Two of these caused sme interruption of supply, principally
to industrial loads. The large labor force is partially explained by
ESB's extensive service area and the fact that it maintains its oun con-
struction forces, The Board is making an effort to hold employment at
reasonable levels, and has requested legislation aimed at reducing the
number of employee unions (i.e. - amalgamation) and expediting the hand-
ling of disputes.
Physical Assets
6.04      The Board was created in 1927 specifically to undertake the
Shannon River hydroelectric scheme. The first Shannon plant (Ardnacrusha)
was placed in service in 1929. Since that time the ESB has added genera-
ting units at a rate in excess of one a year (see Annex 1). Although
originally a supplier of bulk power, the Board gradually purchased all
small undertakings and expanded its own system which now covers virtually
the entire country.
6.05      At the end of fiscal year 1968, ESB's generating capacity amounted
to 1,290 ME; 220 HI of hydro capacity, 420 MW in turf-fired steam stations
anid 660 III of capacity in thermal stations fueled with imported oil and
coal. The system contains over 3,000 km of lO-kV and 220-kV lines and
over 11,000 km of lower-voltage lines. Distribution substation capacity
was 2,500 MVA.  The system is well maintained, and the Board uses the
latest in construction materials and techniques. System losses in 1968
amounted to 12% of net generation, 'which is reasonable considering the
extensive network, relatively-low load factor, and unfavorable location
of the hydro and peat-fired generating stations, System losses have been
declining slightly in the past few years with the increase of generation
from oil-fired plants at the load centers.



- 3i4 -
6.06      In addition to generating, distributing and selling electrical
energy, the Board also has an active customer service division that handles
installation work and appliance sales. Similar services are also provided
by private firms. l'he Board also acquired the fisheries interests affected
by its hydroelectric schbmes and so deals commercially in salmon and eels,
both fresh and processed. Neither of these enterprises, however, are
significant in termrs of ESB's overall activities (see Annex 5).
Tariffs
6.07      The Electricity Supply Act 1927 (Section 21 (2)), established
the basis on which electricity prices were to be fixed. It states that
All charges made by the Board shall be fixed at such rates
and on such scales that the revenue derived in any year from
sales and services together with revenue from other sources
will be sufficient and only sufficient (as nearly as may be)
to pay all salaries, working expenses, and other outgoings
of the Board properly chargeable to income in that year,
(including payments ... of interest and Sinking Fund payments ...)
and such sums as the Board may think proper to set aside in that
year for reserve fund, extensions, renewals, depreciation, loans
and other like purposes.
6.o8      In practice the annual revenues have covered annual operating
expenses (including depreciation based on the sinking fund method) and
annual debt service charges with a small surplus of approximately 1% of
revenue from sales. The Act of 1927 did not concern itself with the
individual charges making up the tariff schedule (paragraph 2.14). Under
the Prices Act 1958 and 1965, tariff increases became subject to approval
by the Minister of Industrny and Comm,erce. Tariffs were stable for almost
six years until November 1966 when they were increased by 7% and a further
7% increase from November 1968. This last increase was to cover increased
fuel costs, salary and wage increases, and part of the 214 turnover tax.
6.o0      The provisions of the Section 21 (2) of the Act have proved
effective for increasing tariffs to maintain the sound financial position
which has characterized the Board's operations. The loan documents will
include as an event of default any change made in the Electricity Supply
Act 1927 as subsequently amended which, in the opinion of the Bank,
adversely affects the carrying out of the Project or the financial
condition of the Board. This condition together with ESB's agreement
obtained during negotiations for amortization of its stock issues (para-
graph 6.15) should produce adequate annual revenue and is acceptable in
lieu of the more conventional tariff and debt service covenants.
Accounting and Audit
6.10      The ESB is obliged under the Act of 1927 to keep accounts, as
approved by the Mlinister of Transport and Power, of all moneys received
and expended by them including a capital account, revenue account profit
and loss account and a Balance Sheet. The Act also provides for the audit



- 15 -
of the accounts by a qualified auditor appointed annrially for the purpose
by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the consent of the Minister
of Finance. Yessrs. Kennedy, Crowley and Company, a professional firm of
Chartered Accountants in Ireland$ have undertaken the audit for several
years. This arrangement has been satisfactory* During negotiations the
Government agreed 'ILat the qualified auditor to be appointed annually will
be an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank.
Capital Structure and Financial Position
6.11      Summaries of the audited Balance Sheets as at March 31, 1965
through 1968 are shown in Annex 4. ESB has attached no significance to
the value of net assets in service as a rate base* For this reason, the
Balance Sheets as at the end of fiscal 1967 and 1968 have been revised
(Annex 4) with a view to calculating a rate of return to enable a better
appreciation of ESB's finances. Certain aspects relating to the treatment
in the accounts of depreciation, rural subsidies and consumers contributions
are discussed in notes 2 and 3 attached to Annex 4, Fixed Plant as of
March 31, 1968 totalled £177.6 million, and after deduction of depreciation,
rural subsidies and consumers contribution, the net fixed plant in service
totalled £114 million. These plant values are shown at historical cost.
Considering the recent devaluation, the values are probably slightly
understated.
6.12      The value of current assets exceeds by 3½1 times the value of
current liabilities. This current ratio includes large cash balances
due partly to the timing, regulated by the Government, of ESB's borrowing
activities at the fiscal year end, and partly to the level of accounts
receivable discussed in Note 5(a) to Annex 4. For short periods before
the loans are floated in fiscal 1969 through 1971, ESB could experience
possible cash shortages which should be manageable with the use of bank
overdraft facilities. ESB is introducing a monthly billing cycle for
industrial consumers and arranging for hire purchase debts to be taken
over by a finance company. These measures will reduce working capital
requirements.
6.13      ESB's capitalization as of March 31, 1968 is summarized as
follows:
Equity                                        £V000's        %

- 16 -
6.14      ESB's long term debt represents 78% of total capitalization, the
balance being represented by reserves built up mainly from -the accumulation
of net profits and sales of scrapped assets.  Up to 1954 the Government
helped to finance the Board's system expansion by making advances repayable
with interest (presently averaging 124 p.a.) over 50 years. The Electricity
Supply (Amendment) Act of 1954 empowered the ESB to borrow money by the issue
of stock and other forms of security subject to prior approval of the Minister
of Finance.  Since that time it has borrowed about £63 million from the local
market in a series of separate stock issues at interest rates of 5% to 7½%
p.a. and repayable over periods of 19-25 years.  In addition, a 6% £500,000
loan was arranged in 1962 from the New Ireland Assurance Com,pany Limited,
and in 1964 a 5WS US$10 million loan was arranged with the First National
City Bank of New York, repayable over five years. The net debt outstanding
at March 31, 1968 was $114.5 million.
6.15      The mechanics of the sinking funds are referred to in Annex 4
(note 4). When the first two stock issues were sold in 1955 and 1958 the
sinking provisions were not designed to amortize the total amounts borrowed
by the respective due dates in 1975 and 1978. It is now estimated that the
provisions will then be short of about £3.75 million and £2 million respec-
tively since slinking fund contributions form part of the charges against
revenue in assessing ESB's annual surplus which is used as a guide in
assessing tariffs (parag±aph 6.08) it follows that inadequate contributions
would cause the revenue surplus to be inflated and could even convert into
a surplus what may otherwise have been a deficit. Under-assessment of
tariffs could result. The sinking fund contributions should therefore be
assessed realistically with the object of' ensuring full amortization within--
the life of the loan, This would produce a more realistic guide for assess-
ing tariffs and would obviate conversion loans or other borrowing for purposes
of loan repayment at a time when the local money market may be heavily bur-
dened by demands for capital development, During negotiations ESB agreed to
reserve adequate contributions for each of its existing stocks created
after 1958 to ensure full amortization by the appropriate redemption
dates, and to make adequate provision for the purpose in future stock
issues.
6.16      The conditions of ESB stock issued provide inter alia that when
the stock is priced at par or under par (excluding accrued interest), the
sink-ing fund may purchase available stock for cancellation, and when the
price rises above par, the sinking fund "may be otherwise invested for the
benefit of the sinking fundi". Since 1954 when ESB was first empowered to
borrow by means of stock issues, subsequent stock issues have been at
higher coupon rates, and the sinking fund has purchased for cancellation
stocks at prices under par. It is unlikely that the present conditions of
high interest will be maintained throughout the remaining life of the exist-
ing ESB stocks, e.g., over the next 20 years or more. As market prices rise
above par, alternative investments of the sinking fund moneys will need -to
be found. ESB indicated during negotiations, that a policy of investing in
appropriately dated trustee securities was followed for the investment of
sinking funds when its own stock issues were not otherwise available for
purchase and cancellation. This is satisfactory to the Bank.

Past Earnings
6.17      Income statements for the four years ended March 31, 1968 are
surmmarized in Annex 5. Although energy sales had been increasing at about
10% per annum to 1968, since 1962 annual average revenue per kWh has
declined gradually from 2.12d/k!ih to 1.96d/kWh in 1966.  This decline is
due to increased sales at rates in the lowest price brackets. Average
revenue per kWh increased in 1967 following the November 1966 tariff
increase. Costs of operation had been reasonably stable despite the
sensitivity of fuel costs to weather conditions and increased cos'ts
generally. The fact that tariffs had not been increased from fiscal
1962 to 1967 is attributed to the more-efficient generating units that
were installed during the period. Fuel prices were increased in fiscal
1968 by about 26 shillings (US$3.12) per ton, known as the 'Suez surcharge',
by oil companies transporting oil via the Cape route, and by an additional
16 shillings (US$1.92) per ton due to the devaluation of sterling in
November 1967. These increases in oil prices, which added over $1.1
million to the fuel costs in 1968, were offset to a large extent by favorable
hydro conditions and a shortfall in scheduled peat deliveries.
6.18      Annex 5 shows that despite tariff increases of 7% in November
1966 and again in November 1968, the increase in the average revenue per
kWh sold is considerably smtaller being only about 2%.  This shows the
effect of the sales charged at- the lowest priced category of consumer
referred to in paragraphs 2.14 through 2.16.  The Annex also shows that the
adjusted net revenue (before interest) in pence per kW,h sold each year is
relatively stable which indicates that the rate of increase in revenue is
keeping pace with rate of increase in the expense of operations
6.19      The return oil average net assets in service was 6.5;% in 1966,
6.7% in 1967 and 6.8% in 1968. These returns were relatively low probably
due to an under assessment of tariffs arising from. the inadequate sinking
fund contributions referred to in paragraph 6.15. The level of return,
however, produced internal funds (net of debt service) during 1966 through
1968, adequate to finance 36% of total requirements. The balance came
from rural subsidies and consumerts contributions and other receipts to the
extent of 14%, with the remaining 50% being financed by long term loans
raised locally.

7.02      3SB's own resources net of debt service would contribute 36% of
total requirements, 6% would come from government subsidy and consumers
contributions, local borrowings would provide 42%, Suppliers' Credits 8%,
and the proposed Bank loan 8%.



- 19 -
7.03      Although ESB has had access in the past to finance on reasonable
terms in the local capital market, it may find the increased rate of
borrowing a little more difficult. Borrowing of £34 million or US$81
million equivalent is assumed by the issue of local stock repayable over
25 years and carrying interest at 7% p.a.
7.04      ESB has entered into contracts involving nearly $16 million
equivalent of suppliers' credits in connection with the additional thermal
generating plant presently under construction. (Annex 4 note 6 (e)).
7.05      The proposed Bank loan of US$14.5 million is assumed repayable
over a term of 25 years, including a five year grace period, carrying
interest at 6.5% p.a. and a commitment charge of 3/4 of 1% on the undis-
bursed portion of the loan.
Future Earnings
7.o6      Forecast income statements covering the six fiscal years 1969-
1974 are shown in Annex 5. Energy sales are assumed to increase at 9%
per annum. Since much of the increase will be in the lower priced brackets
revenue would increase at a lower rate than energy sales and a rate of 7.2%
per annum is forecast, apart frcm additional revenue from any increase in
tariffs.
7.07      Operating expenses are estimated to rise by 17.7% in fiscal 1969
and thereafter at a rate of 8% per annum. The sharp rise in fiscal 1969
is due to an assumed 35% increase in fuel costs. This increase is attrib-
uted to the dry weather throughout the summer of 1968, which was unfavorable
to low cost hydro operation and favorable for the production of peat.
Forecasts of fuel costs in subsequent years assume production of peat at
Bord Na M4ona target levels, and a continuation of the Suez surcharge.
7.08      Forecasts of the expenses chargeable to revenue each year as
permitted by Section 21 of the Electricity Act 1927 shows revenue deficits
despite the tariff increase of 7% from November 1968. As a result, further
tariff increases of 4%L in January 1970, and 4% from November 1972 are
assumed to produce small annual revenue surpluses shown in Annex 7. The
increased revenue enables forecast annual returns on average net fixed
assets to be maintained at a level of between 7.4% and 7.9%. It is now
understood from the Irish delegation during negotiations that ESB will
now benefit from a substantial reduction in the price of fuel oil. This
reduction would improve returns and could result in a deferment, by
several months, of the assumed January 1970 tariff increase.

Future Financial Position
7.09      Forecast Balance Sheets as of March 31, 1969 through 1974 are
shown in Annex 4. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities
maintains a level of about 3.1 times throughout the construction period.
The ratio continues at a high level for the same reasons explained in
paragraph 6.12. Interest would be covered more than 1.3 times by net
income before interest, and debt service (including sinking fund con-
tributions would be covered more than 1.5 times internal cash generation
after fiscal 1969. The ratio of long term debt (net of Sinking Fund)
to total capitalization, which was 79% at the end of fiscal 1967, would
gradually reduce to 72% by the end of fiscal 1974.  This would represent
a satisfactory financial position.
8. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The Project would form an integral part of the Electricity
Supply Board's program to meet the growing power demand in Ireland, and
is justified.
8.02      The Project is technically sound, the estimated cost is
reasonable, and the arrangements for engineering and supervision of
construction are satisfactory.
8.03      During negotiations in January 1969
(a) ESB indicated that there is a joint Technical Committee with
Bord Na Mona which periodically discusses the pricing policy
for peat (paragraph 2.06).
(b) ESB confirmed that the interchange agreement with Northern
Ireland will not contain provisions which would affect the
economic justification of the Project (paragraph 2.12).
(c) The loan documents will include as an event of default,
any change made in the Electricity Supply Act 1927 as
amended which in the opinion of the Bank adversely affects
the carrying out of the Project or the financial condition
of the Board (paragraph 6.09).
(d) The Government agreed that the qualified auditor to be
appointed annually will be an independent auditor accept-
able to the Bank (paragraph 6.10).



- 21 -
(e) ESB agreed to make adequate provision for the repayment of
stock issues, created by it after 1958,by the latest appli-
cable redemption dates (paragraph 6.15).
(f) ESB indicated that the policy of investing in appropriately
dated trustee securities was followed for the investment of
sinking funds when its own stock issues were not available
for purchase and cancellation (paragraph 6.16).
8.o4      The Project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$14.5
million equivalent, including interest during construction, for a term
of 25 years including a grace period of five years.

PRINCIPLES OF PUMPED STORAGE--
THE TURLOUGH HILL PROJECT
Purpose of Pumped Storage
Electricity cannot be stored in large quantities - it must be
generated as it is used, A pumped-storage project provides the next best
thing, though, by storing energy in the form of water in an elevated res-
ervoir, available for quick conversion into electric energy as needed.
Thus a pure pumped storage project does not add to the energy resources
available to a system, but does permit more efficient management of those
resources.
In any system that has developed over a period of time there
will be certain plants that can generate energy at less cost than other
plants in the system, These low-cost plants most often are those em-
ploying large new high-pressure steam units. The characteristics of these
units are such that maintenance and operating costs are reduced if the
machines are run round-the-clock at nearly uniform load. Unfortunately,
no public utility systems have uniform round-the-clock loads; the daily
load curve is marked by day-time and evening peaks and early-morning
valleys with rapid changes from one state to the other (see Annex 2).
These rapid load swings present a problem to system operation since
generating units can only accept or shed loads at certain maximum rates;
in this respect large steam units are the worst performers and hydro units
are the best, so a system with a high proportion of hydro capacity is more
flexible than one based on large steam units.
In a growing system with a daily load curve such as that shown at
Annex 2, and having efficient generating capacity considerably in excess
of that required to meet demands in the early morning hours, a pumped
storage installation can be the most economical choice for the next incre-
ment of system capacity; 200 FW of pumped storage permits the system to
supply just as much new load as 200 NW of any other kind of capacity, and
improved system operation is made possible by the operating characteristics
of the hydroelectric units used in pumped storage schemes.
TyDes of Pumesd Storage
Pure pumped storage schemes (as is the Turlough Hill Project)
use no natural water flows to generate electricity - all water used is first
pumped to an elevated reservoir.
Combination type schemes are constructed in conjunction with
hydroelectric plants using natural water flows. For the pumped-storage
part of a combination scheme, water may be pumped back into the natural
reservoir, or into an auxiliary artificial reservoir.   Some schemes pump
water from adjacent watersheds to augment the natural flow through a
hydro plant, as in the Ltxnersee scheme in Austria (a Bank-financed Project).
There are many variations on the basic arrangement. Due to economic limit-
ations governing the size of the artificial reservoir, pure pumped storage



ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 6 pages
schemes usually are used in a daily, or at most weekly, pumping-generating
mode. On the other hand, combination schemes with their typically large
natural reservoirs may be used to augment system generating capacity on
a seasonal basis.
Equipment
The construction of pure pumped storage schemes has been given
impetus in the past few years by the availability of efficient reversible
pump/turbine units, in which, by reversing direction of rotation, one hydro
machine is used both as pump and turbine and one dynamo is used both as
motor and generator. Early schemes used separate machines for the pumping
and generating modes at a consequent cost penalty. Although combined
reversible machines were available, it is only in the last few years that
designers have been able to overcome the poor efficiency characteristic of
this type of unit. To achieve good efficiency, however, Francis-type units
of average size should operate at a design head in the range of 400 - 1200
feet. The Turlough Hill site has a realizable head of about 900 ft - well
within the acceptable range, In addition to reduced efficiency, reversible
units suffer another disadvantage in that, since direction of rotation is
reversed, the turbine cannot be used to start the machine in the pumping
mode. Although small units can be started with the main motor, usually a
separate starting motor or turbine is required. Some newer schemes start
the pump by parallelling it with an auxiliary set or spare turbine generator
and starting both machines from rest. This method was considered for Tur-
lough Hill, but the final design calls for starting motors.
Cost Factors
Ihere the pumping energy is supplied by off-peak operation of
thermal plants, unlike a hydro-electric scheme there is a fuel-cost
component associated with each k'h generated by a pumped-storage plant.
This cost is the fuel cost of the thermal unit divided by the overall
efficiency of the pumped st-orage scheme (50 - 70%), and is consequently
relatively high. The fuel-cost penalty is mitigated somewhat by the
savings in maintenance and operation of the large thermal units, Some
European operators have reported that these savings are sufficient to
offset the losses through the pumped-storage cycle.
Thus, except where surplus off-peak energy from run-of-river
hydro plants is available, a pure pumped-storage scheme has an operation
cost structure comparable with gas-turbine plant, -steam plant designed
for peaking service, diesel blocks, or other fuel-consuming generating
means intended for on-peak supply. The capital cost of such pumped
storage schemes must therefore be relatively low (under $130/kW) in
order to be competitive with the alternative generating means. This
implies a relatively high head development (to reduce the relative
physical size and cost of the hydro machines), the smallest practicable



ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 6 pages
artificial reservoir (where an artificial reservoir is used in the
scheme), a good ratio of head to distance between upper and lower
reservoirs (to minimize the length of water conduits - the ratio should
be less than 1:2); and a location close to load centers or generating
centers to avoid high transmission losses. Site selection is thus very
critical to the feasibility of a pumped storage scheme, and not all
systems have sites that can be developed within the criteria outlined
above.
Origin of the Turlough Hill Project
In the late 1950's, the Electricity Supply Board's department
of system operations recognized that a pumped-storage plant would play
a useful role in the system. The initial installations of this type in
Europe and the U.K. were then coming of age, and the serendipitous
benefits due to quick starting and flexible operation were reported as
exceeding the purely economic benefits as peaking capacity, which was
the basis for justifying the earlier installations. Since ESB was com-
mitted to an expansion program based on oil or turf-fired thermal plants,
pumped-storage units would be a welcome addition to the dwindling pro-
portion of hydro capacity in the system. Thus, although the possible
economic benefits as peaking capacity were fully recognized, it was the
secondary benefits accruing to system operation wihich gave the impetus
to the search for a suitable pumped-storage site.
The search naturally centered around Dublin, the most concen-
trated load area. Several sites in the hills north and south of the city
were investigated, as the topography around the existing hydro stations
precluded any possibility of developing economical pumped storage in
conjunction with the existing plants. A small lake in the area, Lough
Nahanagan, was included in the early investigations but the schemes
considered used it as the upper reservoir and the first plans were drawn
around another more favorable location. Later it was realized that the
top of the bluff overlooking the lake would make a good site for an
artificial reservoir, and on re-investigation this site proved to be the
most economical. The preliminary engineering report covering the Project
in essentially its present form was completed in Narch, 1965.   Another
site in the Glendalough valley only a few miles from Lough Nahanagan was
easily recognized as a very desirable location for a pumped storage
project, but this is a very scenic and historic area so no serious consi-
deration was ever given to a project at that spot.
The investigations have continued, and sites capable of being
developed economically for large schemes have been located in the south
in Co. Cork. These sites may be developed in the future in conjunction
with large thermal or nuclear plants on the Cork coast but the scale
required is too large to permit economic development at this time.
Partly because these sites exist, it was decided not to include provi-
sions for expansion in the Turlough Hill Project.

Description of the Project
The original engineering report recommended a project with four
60-I11J units, but subsequent refinements in the capacity of the upper
reservoir and a study of system operation indicated that a development
with four 70-Iv12 units (280 IIJ total) would be more worthwhile.
Some significant features of the proposed Project are:

aeservoirs
The upper reservoir will be formed by excavating at the top of
Turlough Hill and placing the dug material around the edge of the excava-
tion. The material is granite rock, suitable for the purpose. Leakage
from the upper reservoir cannot be tolerated in a pumped storage scheme,
therefore, the reservoir will be sealed with an impervious asphaltic-
concrete liner. This liner must be placed with extreme care so experienced
specialty contractors would be employed for this phase of the work.
The existing natural lake, Lough Nahanagan, will be used for the
lower reservoir. Since its full capacity is not required for storage,
the level of the lake is being lowered about 14m to provide additional
operating head for the scheme. The rate of release of water during the
generating cycle exceeds the acceptable maximum flow downstream of the
lake and some freeboard must always be available at the regulating weir
to absorb these surges. To permit this, a valved bottom outlet will be
provided to regulate the normal release of lake water.   The catchment
area for the lake is only 1.8 km , but rain-Pall averages more than 2m
per year, or more than ten times the estimated evaporation losses from
the upper and lower reservoirs. Even in the driest periods of record,
there would be sufficient rainfall to assure adequate makeup of losses.
Geology
Extensive geological studies have been undertaken, including a
comprehensive drilling program and driving of exploratory tunnels. The
work was done by local contractors but was directed and evaluated by a
German consulting geologist, Dr. Hleitfeld. The rock is generally sound
granite with mild jointing. A fault zone was detected near the proposed
site of the power cavern, but the cavern has been moved and the alignment
changed to avoid the zone.
Operation
The operating regime indicated on Annex 2 is an idealized curve
representing maximum daily energy flows for a peak winter day in 1974/75.



ANNEX 3
Page 6 of 6 pages
In actual service, considerably less energy may be generated depending
on the day-to-day operating requirements of the associated thermal sta-
tions and whether the pumped-storage units are operated at partial load
as spinning reserve, as "swing" capacity and for reactive compensation,
or at full load.
Since the demand in summer is considerably less than the winter
peak, the pumped-storage capacity would not be needed solely to supply
the peak demand since more than enough capacity would be available from
the other stations in the system. However, the pumped-storage machines
can provide spinning reserve at less cost than all types of units except
hydro, and therefore the ESB plans to operate the Turlough Hill plant on
a year-round basis.
As the system load grows, the amount of energy (kWh) associated
writh any specific amount of peak power (kW) decreases, and therefore it
would be expected that the annual energy generated by a pure pumped
storage scheme would gradually decrease, but in practice because of the
supplementary regulating functions the annual load factor tends to level
off at some lowf value. Thus, although Turlough Hill could generate up
to 325 GJTh annually, the generation will probably average about 170 GWJh
corresponding to an annual load factor of 7%`.
The ESB Transmission System
Until 1965 ESB depended on a grid of llO-kV transmission lines
to carry load flows throughout the country. With the development of
large thermal generating plants in the south (M4arina and Great Island)
and the possibility of interconnection with Northern Ireland, the 110-kV
system became inadequate and the first phase of a 220-kV grid was con-
structed. The grid will consist of a loop west from Dublin to the turf
area at Shannonbridge, thence south to Cork and the Marina station, east
to Great Island on the south coast, then north to Turlough Hill and back
to Dublin, with a double-circuit connection from Dublin to Northern
Ireland. The western half of the loop is complete and the Cork-Great
Island section is under construction. The Great Island-Dublin section
will be completed about the same time as the Turlough Hill Project. A
second line from Turlough Hill to Dublin is also planned. The cost
estimate for the Project includes the cost of the deviation of the Great
Island-Dublin line and the cost of the separate Turlough Hill-Dublin
connection.

ELF,      Y SUPPLY BOARD
Nctes and Assumptions in Balance Sheets
1,   Gross Plant
The value of gross plant is recorded in the books at historical
cost less retirements, and includes the additional cost of interest during
construction. Some plant was acduired from local authorities and the values
recorded in ESB's book were based on a reasonably assessed value.
2.   Depreciation
(a) The system used by ESB is not based on the concept that depreciation
is the writing off against revenue the cost of a fized asset over the
period of its useful life. Instead, the original cost of the asset
is regarded as the value of an investment to be recovered by charging
depreciation--on the basis of an annual fixed s-zm which if invested at
a notional 2-1/2% per annum compound interest would produce the original
cost by the end of the assumed life of the asset, The depreciation
contribution therefore, consists of two elements, an annual fixed
charge; and a sum representing the interest deemed to have been earned*
Compared to the equal annual charges produced by the "straight line
method" the sum of the two elements commences with a lower charge
during the early life of the asset and gradually increases throughout
the life time of the asset.
(b) It is the Board's practice to continue depreciation contributions on
assets which remain in service after the expiration of their hypothet-
ical lives. It was explained that it is continued "as a contribution
towards obsolescence and as an offset to assets retired before the
due date"0 Following the concapt that depreciation is the writing off
of the cost of the asset over the life of the asset, the contributions
would be discontinued after the end of the asset lifea
(c) Analysis of the accumulated Depreciation Reserve of £4907 million in
the ES3's accounts as at Ilarch 31, 1966 shows several items which
would be omitted if the calculation of net assets in service had any
significance as a "rate base", The following statement shows the
adjustments to the 'depreciation reserve' vihich would be required
in calculating the value of net assets in service.

ESB's Depreciation Reserve as at March 31, 1966       49.7
Less (i)    Amounts continued to be charged on
fully depreciated assets still in
service (see note 2 (b)).                 (2.1)
Less (ii)   Adjustment in respect of plant
financed from the rural subsidy and
consumers contributions. For the
purpose of calculating a rate of
return the equivalent plant value
should be regarded as fully
depreciated.                              (3.6)
Less (iii) Receipt from Sale of Scrapped
Materials                                 (3.7)
Adjusted Depreciation Reserve
as at March 31, 1966                            E4O.3
(d) Projections of annual depreciation originally estimated
by E,3B on the former basis, produced a composite rate of
about 3.7% on the gross plant value at the end of the
preceding year. This percentage has been applied to gross
plant value netted by the value of plant financed by the
annual subsidies and consumers contributions on the assump-
tion that the plant is regarded as fully depreciated.
3. Rural Subsidy and Consumers Contributions
In connection with the rural electrification policy which
Government directed ESB to pursue, Government agreed to subsidize part
of the capital outlay involved. Since ESB's accounting places no sig-
nificance on the value of net assets as a rate base, plant financed by
the subsidy has formed part of gross plant on which depreciation has
been calculated. This treatment not only increases net fixed plant
values but also increases operating expenses. In the revisions the
principle adopted is that contributions to reduce capital outlay such
as subsidy and consumers contributions, would reduce gross plant
values as though the plant financed from the subscriptions were fully
depreciated.



Page 4 of 5 pages
4. Sinking Fund
The terms of the ESB stock issue require annual sums to be set
aside from revenue to enable the annual interest to be paid to stock
holders and a sum to be paid into a sinking fund to be applied, when the
price of the stock ex.cluding accrued interest is at or under par, to the
purchase of stock for cancellation e.g., in the case of the 5% 1lO million
1966-1975 stock issue, the sum of 1650,000 of 6i% of the total issue is
set aside annually. As stock is purchased and cancelled, the portion
required for the payment of interest is reduced, and the portion remaining
to be paid into the sinking fund increases. The terms of the stock issue
provide that when the price of the stock increases above par, the sinking
fund will be "otherwi.se invested for the benefit of the sinking fund".
This implies that the sinking funds would not then be used to purchase
ESB stock issues for cancellation and that alternative investments would
be found. The above par prices of the ESB's stocks would reflect the
drop in interest rates in the market below the coupon rate of the stock.
As a result, yields obtainable from the alternative investments of the
sinking fund would normally be less than the interest coupon rate cf
the stock issue and this could lead to sinking fund deficits by the
redemption date of the issue.
5. Current Assets
(a)  Accounts receivable
This item in the Balance Sheet refers to consumers bills, sales
of appliances on hire purchase, and other debtors. Meter readings
are based on a two-monthly reading cycle and bills are prepared and
dispatched normally within two weeks of the meter reading. The
majority of consumiers pay within 15 - 30 days of the bill being
sent. Arrears are normally added to the subsequent bill which must
be paid within seven days. The level of unpaid consumers bills is
about 25% of revenue frcm sales, but some improvenent is expected
from arrangements, presently being considered, for industrial con-
suwers to be billed monthly.  ESB carries on a substantial business
in the sale of appliances and equipment aimed at promoting load
building and the 1968 accounts receivable included hire-purchase
debts of the order of L2.5 million. The ESB has arranged block
discounting with a finance company which will also take over hire-
purchase debts arising from future sales.
(b) Cash
The item 'cash-temporary investments' arises because the ESB
has normally raised the bulk of its loan moneys towards the end of
the fiscal year, i.e., in February or March.  The proceeds of the
loan are temporarily invested in short-term government bonds. It
is assumed that future stock issues will continue to be raised
towards the end of each fiscal year.

6.  Long Term Debt
(a) The Ministry for Finance advances were made prior to 1964 under the
various Electricity (Supply) Acts and Amendments. The original
total advanced was t68.4 million, repayable with interest
(presently averaging 4-1/2% p.a.) over 50 years. As at March 31,
1968, ElO.8 million had been repaid.
(b)  The ESB Stock issues amount to E63 million and comprise a series
of nine issues repayable over periods of 19 - 25 years, with
interest rates ranging from 5. to 7-l/l%.
(c) The 5-1/2% First National City Bank of New York loan of $10 million
was arranged in 1964. Anticipating difficulties in securing
sufficient ESB stock to absorb the annual sinking fund provisions,
and following legal advice, the proceeds of the dollar loan were
invested in the 6% ESB 110.5 million 1984/89 Stock and the stock
held for sinking fund needs. At the same time a sinking fund has
been established for the 19084/89 Stock. The dollar short-term
loan has since been repaid partly through the use of the holding
of' 1984/89 Stock and partly from new capital. The ESB Stock
issued in respect of the proceeds of the shorter-term dollar
loan is held by the NMunster and Leinster Banlc in a Trustee Account
for EBB. The Bank has no lien on this Trustee Account.
(d) The local Bank loan of El million refers to a loan being arranged
with a local Bank by ESB. Repayment terms are presently not
available but expected to be 'short term' with options to
"roll over". This could assist the possible periodic 'short
cash' position referred to in paragraph 6.12.
(e) Suppliers Credits have been arranged with three suppliers.
