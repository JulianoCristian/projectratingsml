It will also enable the base-load thermal plant\n            to operate more efficiently by running at more nearly\n            uniform load. The proposed pumped storage project is the\n            least-cost alternative presently available for supplying\n            needed peaking capacity. Both gas-turbine units and\n            additional conventional base-load steam plant which would\n            release older units for peaking service were considered.\n            Neither is as economically attractive as the proposed\n            project. The internal rate of return on the investment for\n            the project would be 19 percent with the additional power\n            sales valued at prevailing rates."}, "docdt": "1969-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
