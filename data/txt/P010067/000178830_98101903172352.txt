INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE SUI NORTHERN GAS PIPELINES LIMITED
TO BE GUARANTEED BY THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $19.2 million to
the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited to cover the foreign exchange costs
of extending its present transmission and distribution facilities in WVest
Pakistan.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The large gas field at  Sui, located in the desert of Central
West Pakistan, was discovered in 1952 by Pakistan Petroleum Limited
(PPL). PPL sells raw gas to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL)
and to Sui Gas Transmission Company (SGTC). The gas purification facil-
ities at Sui are owned and operated by SGTC which purifies gas for its
own transmission system as well as for SNGPL. A Tripartite Agreement
of September 16, 1969 between PPL, SGTC and SNGPL fixes the quantity and
price of puriIied gas to be delivered by SGTC to SNGPL. In addition SNGPL,
under an agreement of 1964 with the Attock Oil Company, will purchase small
quantities of gas from the Dhulian gas field located in Northern West Pakistan.
3.        The proposed project was appraised in February 1970.   Negotiations
were held in Washington on May 18 and 19, 1970. Mr. M. A. K. Alizai,
Managing Director,represented the company, and Mr. A. R. Bashir, Economic
Minister, Embassy of Pakistan, Washington, represented the Government of
Pakistan.
4.        The Bank to date has made three loans to help finance the expansion
of the natural gas industry in West Pakistan:   Loan No. 99-PAK (US $1.
million equivalent) to Sui Gas Transmission Company (SGTC) in June 1954;
Loan No. 377-PAK (US $15 million equivalent) in May 1964 and Loan No. 597-PAK
(US $8 million equivalent) in May 1969, both to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines
Limited (SNGPL). Loans Nos. 99-PAK and 377-PAK have been fully disbursed; the
works financed under Loan No. 597-PAK are proceeding on schedule.
5.        The Association has made thirty-one development credits to Palistan
totalling US $425.2 million, net of cancellations. Ten credits are fully
disbursed. The Bank has made thirty loans in Palistan totalling US $614.3
million, net of cancellations, of which eighteen are fully disbursed. The

6.        In my report on the Chandpur II Irrigation Project in Pakistan
(dated April 2, 1970; circulated to the Executive Directors as IDA/R70-12)
I referred to the slow rate of disbursement of some of the Bank Group's
loans and credits in Pakistan. As stated in that report, physical implemen-
tation of most projects is now making adequate progress; where major problems
exist, close contact with the project authorities is being maintained.
7.        Disbursements under the Dacca and Chittagong Water Supply and
Sewerage Projects (Credits Nos. 41 and 42-PAK) and the three Education
Projects (Credits Nos. 49,50, and 87-PAK), are still slower than expected;
had these projects been proceeding in accordance with revised schedules,
roughly US $23 million would remain undisbursed now instead of the US $32
million presently undisbursed; however, part of the difference represents
savings in project costs and may eventually be cancelled.
8.        For a number of other projects, disbursements have been slower than
originally forecast, due to problems encountered in project implementation,
but in most of these cases disbursements are now in accordance with revised
forecasts (Karachi Port Development -- Loan No. 376-PAK; WP Highways --
Credit No. 54-PAK; Karachi Electric Supply -- Loan No. 488-PAK; Lahore
Water Supply -- Credit No. 106-PAK). Of the latest three PICIC loans (Nos.
421, 509 and 590-PAK) about US $28 million remain undisbursed but the bulk
of this amount (US .$22.2 million) is accounted for by the third (No. 590-PAK)
which was made in March 1969; in fact, except for the first loan (No. 185-PAK)
all eight PICIC loans-have been disbursed more rapidly than expected. Under
the EP Highway Project (Credit No. 53-PAK), which has recently been revised
in accordance with my proposal of April 23, 1970 (IDA/R70-18), disbursements
are now expected to be made at an adequate rate.
9.        Most other loans and credits are being disbursed on or close
to schedule. There are several cases where, from the nature of the project
and of the Bank's contribution to its financing, it was known from the
outset that disbursements would be spread over many years (e.g., the Indus
Basin and Tarbela Multi-purpose Loans Nos. 266 and 548-PAK). Almost two-
thirds of the total undisbursed amount is accounted for by projects approved
during the last two years; these projects are now being implemented, and
disbursements in most cases are in accordance with agreed schedules.
10.       IFC has made eleven commitments in Pakistan totalling about US $21.6
million, net of cancellations. The value of outstanding commitments, net of
repayments, cancellations and sales of loans, is about US $16.3 million. IFC
is presently considering applications for investments in a large engineering
company and in a project for fertilizer production.
11.       Negotiations for a credit for the West Pakistan Engineering
Education Project (U S $8 million) have been substantially completed; a
proposal will be circulated to the Executive Directors shortly. Credits
for the West Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority - Power
Transmission and Distribution Project (US $23 million), and for the East
Pakistan Tubewells Project (US $14 million) are at present being negotiated.



PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
12.       Borrower:               Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL).
Guarantor:              Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
Amount:                 To finance the foreign exchange costs of
expanding the capacity and extending
SNGPL's transmission system together with
additional distribution facilities.
Amortization:            In 21 years, including a 3-year grace
period, through semi-annual installments,
beginning December 1, 1973 and ending
June 1, 1991.
Interest Rate:          7% per annum.
Commitment Charge:      3/4 of 1% per annum.
Estimated Economic
Rate of Return:      22%
PART III - THE PROJECT
13.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Third Sui Northern Gas Pipelines
Project - Pakistan" (No. PTR-56a dated May 25, 1970) is attached. This
project is designed to increase the capacity of SNGPL's pipeline system by
about 25 percent to enable the company to meet increasing demand in the area
now being served and to extend the supply to other areas of' potential indus-
trial and domestic demand in the northern region of West Pakistan.
14.       SNGPL was incorporated in Pakistan in 1963 to take over, extend and
operate a gas pipeline system in the Northern half of West Pakistan which
was previously owned by the Government of Pakistan and the Attock Oil Company.
SNGPL has an authorized share cpaital of Rs. 400 million, of which Rs. 100
million have been issued and fully paid up. A further issue of Rs. 18
million will be made later this year. The shares are held in equal propor-
tions by Burmah Oil Company (BOC), an international oil company registered
in the United Kingdom, West Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation
(WPIDC), a government financed and controlled investment corporation, and the
general public of Pakistan. Most of SNGPL's sales are to industrial customers
such as cement, textile and fertilizer plants and to the West Pakistan Water
and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) for the generation of electricity.
The proposed project would further diversify SNGPL's sales by adding sugar
and paper factories and would allow expansion of the domestic consumer market.
The financial condition of the Borrower is sound, and its management very good.



-5-
15.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US $40 million
equivalent, with a foreign currency component of US $19.2 million. The
proposed Bank loan would cover the entire foreign currency costs, with the
local currency being provided from local loans (US $7.1 million equivalent)
and SNGPL's internally generated funds (US $13.7 million equivalent). The
conclusion of satisfactory arrangements for the provision of the local
currency financing would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan.
16.       The proposed Bank loan would finance the foreign currency cost
of the procurement and installation (including cathodic protection) of high-
pressure gas transmission pipelines, the construction of three compressor
stations and additional low-pressure distribution facilities in certain
urban areas. Telecommunication and automation equipment for the three new
compressor stations, so as to allow their operation from the central control
station at Lyallpur, and the provision of telecommunications facilities for
the new pipeline extensions are also included. In addition, provision
has been made in the loan to finance the foreign currency costs of engineer-
ing consultants to assist in the preparation of plans, specifications and
bidding documents, and to supervise the construction of the Project. Procure-
ment for this project will be by international competitive bidding except
for small civil works and miscellaneous equipment which would not attract
bidders from abroad.
17.       In order to ensure an adequate supply of gas for the expanded
system,an amendment of the Attock Oil Agreement,dated September 23, 1964,
is required. The satisfactory execution of this amendment is a further
condition of effectiveness of the loan.
18.       Projected cash generation is adequate to ensure servicing of the
total long-term debt including the proposed new borrowings. To maintain the
financial viability of SNGPL, the draft Loan Agreement places conditions
upon SNGPL's right to declare dividends (Section 5.06), incur debt (Section
5.08) and make capital expenditures outside the project (Section 5.05). To
ensure further that SNGPL will be able to generate cash sufficient to meet
its financial obligations, the draft Loan Agreement provides that SNGPL will
establish and maintain tariffs for the supply of gas which will be sufficient
to produce an annual return (before interest and taxes) on the value of the
net fixed assets in operation of not less than 10 percent for each fiscal
year up to 1972/73 and not less than 12 percent thereafter (Section 5.07 of
the draft Loan Agreement). The draft Guarantee Agreement obligates the
Government to grant gas tariffs to SNGPL needed to comply with this rate
covenant (Section 3.03).
19.       The Government of Pakistan would guarantee the loan and has
informed the Bank that it intends to charge the Borrower a guarantee fee
at a rate of 1 percent per annum.



20.       Procurement is scheduled to start at the end of 1970 and
construction is expected to be completed by the middle of 1973. The pro-
ject is technically feasible and financially viable. The substitution
of natural gas for presently used fuels, such as furnace oil and coal,
will generate economic benefits in the form of fuel import savings. The
economic rates of return from different parts of the project range between
10 percent and 40 percent, with an average of approximately 22 percent.
A secondary benefit from the project will be the environmental effect,
since the processing and use of natural gas is signifiantly cleaner than
furnace oil and coal.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
21.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and SNGPL, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
22.       The draft Loan Agreement generally follows the pattern of agree-
ments for loans to private companies in Pakistan and of the agreemen-ts for
the previous loans to SNGPL. The Borrower would modify the trust deed
securing the previous Bank loans to SNGPL in order to secure this loan
also by the first specific mortgage upon the Borrower's immovable and other
properties and the first floating charge upon the Borrower's assets and
undertaking constituted by the trust deed (Section 5.03 of the draft Loan
Agreement). The draft Guarantee Agreement contains the usual provisions.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
23.       It now appears that Pakistan, despite severe adversities,
managed to achieve during the Third Plan period a rate of economic growth
comparable to the 5.5 percent per annum attained during the first half of
the 1960's. However, improvement in terms of per capita national income
slowed down as the population growth rate apparently increased somewhat
despite the introduction of a family planning program. Pakistan's popu-
lation, therefore, witnessed only a very small rise in its standard of
living, and the need for policies and programs designed to accelerate the
rate of economic and social progress is still very acute. A Basic Data Sheet
is attached as an Annex.
24.       West Pakistan's regional income increased by some 6 percent per
annum during the Third Plan period, mainly through large investments in
infrastructure and by concentration on quick-yielding production programs,
especially in agriculture. A similar rate is the aim of the next five
years, but conditions have substantially changed and new policies and programs



have to be devised. While economic strategy in the past relied pri-
marily on big landowners in irrigated areas and large-scale industrial-
ists, most of the poorer sections of West Pakistan's population benefitted
only marginally from the economic advance. In the future, West Pakistan
will also have to contribute towards raising the resources necessary for
narrowing income disparity between the two Wings. Therefore, policies are
being formulated which would improve income distribution as well as reduce
inter-regional disparities.
25.       There is considerable scope for improved management of the
country's resources and Pakistan would be able to economize in the use of
its scarce capital through improvements in public investment planning and
implementation, and in sector policies, particularly with regard to transport,
industry, water development and power. The authorities realize this and
are actively considering a number of measures that would help in improving
economic performance.
26.       The Government is aware of the need for a new strategy, and
discussions regarding the proposed Fourth Five-Year Plan (due to begin
July 1, 1970) concern possible changes of the type outlined. However,
programs have not yet been given concrete shape. Forceful action has
to be taken with respect to the mobilization of domestic resources. In
the Third Plan period, the marginal saving rate has been as low as 6.6
percent, which has led to a deterioration in overall saving performance of
the economy. Government revenue now accounts for only 9 percent of GNP, and
fiscal reforms are required to devise a tax system with greater elasticity and
equity. Externally, Pakistan may have difficulty in maintaining the net in-
flow of foreign assistance at the level of the latter half of the 1960's.
Thus, the need for vigorous promotion of exports continues.
27.       Any forecast at the present time regarding Pakistan's balance of
payments is risky, particularly because of uncertainties regarding the
prospects for attracting foreign assistance in amounts and on terms ap-
propriate to Pakistan's economic situation. In addition, present uncertain-
ties with respect to Government policies needed for a vigorous promotion of
exports cloud the Qutlook for export development; this presents a serious
problem, since the rate of export growth has been declining recently and
service on existing external debt is absorbing some 18 percent of Pakistan's
foreign exchange earnings. Under these circumstances, the Government realizes
that it should observe caution in contracting additional external debt on
conventional terms.  In view of Pakistan's external debt position and its un-
certain balance of payments outlook, I do not presently contemplate increasing
the Bank's exposure in Palistan, which currently amounts to approximately
US $470 million, of which about US $170 million remains undisbursed.   With
repayments of principal to the Bank estimated at about US $20 to $30 million
annually over the next five years, there is room for new Bank lending to
Pakistan within that range. I therefore consider Pakistan creditworthy for
the proposed loan.

PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
28.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMNDATION
29.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
