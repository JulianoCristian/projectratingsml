SUI NORTHE   GIAS ?IPELflES PROJECT
SUI2iRY AFD CONCLUSIONS
NMatural gas was discovered in lWest Pakistan in the early 1950's
and shortly thereafter made available to the Karachi area by pipeline.
Since then the importance of gas to this and other areas has increased
each year and gas now accounts for over 30% of the commercial energy supplies
of West Pakistan.  In addition, it is used as raw material for the productiun
of nitrogenous fertilizers. The expansion of the natural gas industry in
West Pakistan has been facilitated by Bank loans to the two pipeline companies
in the area.  In 1954 the Bank made a loan of US$14 million equivalent to
Sui Gas Transmission Cormpany (SGTC) to build a line from Sui to Karachi.
In 1964 it made a loan of US$15 million equivalent to Sui Northern Gas Pipe-
lines (SXGPL) to build a line northwards from Sui to the Lahore area and
in 1969 a further loan to the same company of US$8 million equivalent to
expand its capacity. The loans of 1954 and 1964 are fully disbursed and
US$6 million of the 1969 loan have been disbursed or committed. The per-
formance of both borrowers has been satisfactory.
ii.       The Bank has now been asked to assist in financing a project to
further expand and extend SNGPL's pipeline system in the northern part of
West Pakistan. The project is designed to increase the capacity of the
system from 207 to 266 million cubic feet (114cf) per day to meet increasing
demands for natural gas in areas presently served and to extend it to serve
industry in areas to the north of the present pipeline. Also included in
the project is the expansion of lowt pressure distribution facilities.
iii.      The project is estimated to cost US$40 million equivalent and the
Bank has been asked to make a loan of US$19.2 million to SNGPL to cover all
the foreign exchange cost which is 48% of the total cost.  The remainder of
the finance would be provided from local loans of US$7.1 million equivalenft
(18%) and SNGPL's internally generated funds of US$13.7 million equivalent
(34%). Procurement would be on the basis of international competitive bid-
ding. Consultants satisfactory to the Bank will be used in both the desigr
and construction phases of the project.
iv.       SN5GPL is a limited liability company in which the Government and
8urmah Oil Company (BOC) each hold a one-third interest, the remainder being
held by the general public in Pakistan. SNGPL transmits natural gas from the
Sui field in Central West Pakistan to the Lahore and Rawalpindi areas in the
north.  In addition it takes small quantities of gas from the fhulian field
in the north.  'lNost of its sales are to industrial customers such as cement,
t,extile and fertilizer plants and to the Wlest Pakistan Water and Power Develic -
ment Authority (IW;TAPDA) for the generation of electricity.  The proposed proje".t
would further diversify SIIGPL's sales by adding sugar and paper factories.



- ii -
v.        SNGQL's financial position is sound.  It has paid adequate dividends
in each year since its inception and has been able to contribute funds towards
its own expansion. It is expected that the financial condition of the company
after the proposed expansion will continue to be sound allowing the company
to pay a dividend of 10% per year and to increase its reserves.
vi.       SNGPL is efficiently managed.  It has evolved from its initial heavy
reliance on BOC for managerial and operational assistance to a point where
the post of Managing Director and most of the Head of Department posts are
in the hands of competent, well trained Pakistanis. In addition staff has
been cut to a size consistent with the volume of operations.
vii.      The project is estimated to yield an economic rate Qf return of 22%.
On completion of the project, the company is expected to have a financial
rate of return on its net fixed assets of 12%. Both these rates are satis-
factory.
viii.     The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$19.2 million
equivalent to be made to SNGPL. A term of 21 years, including a grace period
of three years, corresponding to the construction period, would be appropriate.

APP DSIS 11T COF THE THIRD
SUI NORTHERN GAS PIPELI17ES PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTIOIN
1.01      The Bank has been asked by Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd.
(SNGPL) for a loan of US$19.2 million to finance the foreign exchange
cost of a US$40.0 million expansion program to meet the growing demand
for natural gas in the northern half of lWest Pakistan.
1.02      The Bank has previously made three loans for a total of US$37
million equivalent for construction of gas pipelines in Pakistan, the
first to Sui Gas Transmission Company (SGTC) in 1954 (99-PAK), the second
to SNGPL in 1964 (377-PAK) and the third to SYGPL in 1969 (597-PAK). The
first two projects were successfully executed and the loans fully disbursed;
The second Sui Northern project is well underway and is likely to be com-
pleted on time by hay 1971. Both SGTC and SNGPL derive their gas from a
large gas field, discovered at Sui in the desert of central WTest Pakistan
in 1952, SGTC serving the areas to the south of Sui and SNGPL the areas
to the north. In addition SNGPL has access to small quantities of gas fromn
the Dhulian oil field in Northwest Pakistan. The discovery of Sui gas was
made by Pakistan Petroleum Limited, a subsidiary of Burmah Oil Company
(Pakistan Trading), wihich is itself a subsidiary of Burmah Oil Company Ltd.
(BOC). The shortage of other fuels in the country prompted the Government,
in cooperation with private industry, to seek the rapid development of this
important source of energy.
1.03      SGTC has delivered gas to Karachi since 1955 and SNGPL to the
Lahore and Rawalpindi areas since 1965. Both are limited liability com-
panies in which the Government participates, holding a one-fourth interest
in SGTC and a one-third interest in SMGPL. The remaining shares of SNGPL
are held in equal proportion by BOC and the Pakistan general public.
1.04      The rapid increase in industrial demand for natural gas in
areas already served by SNGPL and the establishnent of industry in new
areas make the expansion of SNC-PL's system necessary.
1.05      This report is an appraisal of the pipeline project proposed
by SNTGPL. It is a result of a pre-appraisal mission in September 1969
and an appraisal mission in February 1970. Messrs. G. F. Bain, Ports and
Pipelines specialist, D. C. Elliott, financial analyst, and Y. Abe, economrsr
all of the Bank staff and Yr. P. Nichols of Hu Harries and Associates and
Mr. K. Sonney of Stone and Webster (Overseas), both Consultants retained by
the Bank, participated in the appraisal mission. The report was written
by Mlessrs. Abe, Bain and Elliott.

2. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Pakistan's gross domestic product (GDP) in 1968/69 at constant
factor cost of 1959/60 is estimated at about US$10.7 billion with a per
capita GD? of about US$85. The average annual growth rate of GDP has
been about 5.5% over the 1960-1969 period.  The major sector in the
economy is agriculture generating about 4S% of GDP in 1968/69.  Other
important sectors are manufacturing (19), commerce (12%) and transport-
ation including communications (6%). The balance-of-payments situation
indicates persistent deficits of about US$460 million annually during
1964/65 - 1967/68 due mainly to stagnant exports. The population of
Pakistan is about 125 million in 1968/69 of which 46% is in West Pakistan.
The rate of population growth during 1964/65 - 1968/69 has been about 3%
per year.
2.02      Pakistan's history of the commercial utilization of natural gas
started in 1955 in the West and in 1960 in the East. The utilization of
natural gas in the East is small compared with that in the West, being
but 5% of the total. The pipeline system in West Pakistan is shown on
Map 1.  The natural gas in the East comes at present from gas fields at
Sylhet and Chhatak. Pipeline systems of about 27 miles of eight-inch
diameter from the Sylhet field and about 12 miles of four-inch diameter
from the Chhatak field serve plants for fertilizer, power and cement,
A new pipeline system of about 50 miles with 14-inch diameter from the
new field at Titas is under construction to serve various industries in
the Dacca area. The utilization of gas in the East is therefore expected
to increase substantiaIly in the near future.
B. Energy and Natural Gas Resources of West Pakistan
2.03      The most recent review of estimates of n4tural gas and mineral
fuel reserves was carried out in ;967 by the Bank_.. Fuel rese ges were
found to be the order of 16 x 1012 BTU of which some 11.83 x 10 ) BTU were
natural gas.  Net recoverable reserves stated in 1tandard cubic feet of
1,000 BTU per cu ft were estimated as 11.83 x 10   cu ft as of January 1,
1965 (see Table 1). These reserves are sufficient for over 75 years
consumption at recent levels of consumption.
2.04      Energy consumption in West Pa1`istan was estimated in detail in
the Bank's previous appraisal of SNGPLI2. In 1967 natural gas accounted
for 30%o of commercial energy supplies in the area. Although these data

have not been brought up to date by thle Bank, the rapid increase of natural
gas sales by 26.5% in the ensuing two years indicates that this energy
aource is of greater importance in 1970 than in 1967.
2.05      Natural gas was discovered in West Pakistan in the early 1950ts.
Since then two gas fields and one oil and gas field have been developed.
The latter is in the process of being extended. A large dry gas field was
found at Sui, in central West Pakistan. Since 1955 it has provided gas
vo Karachi through the lines of SGTC. It is also the source of nearly all
of the gas supplied to SNGPL. The oil and gas field developed by Attock
Oil Corapany (A0C) in northern West Pakistan, near Dhulian, serves a local
refinery and gas distribution system in the Rawalpindi area. This gas
distribution system was purchased by SNGPL and linked to the main trunk-
line in 1967.  The third gas field to be developed in West Pakistan is
near Mari, across the Indus River from Sui. Esso Standard (Eastern) has
constructed a fertilizer plant close to this field.
2.06      During the past year exploratory drilling for oil by Oil and
Gas Development Corporation (OGDC), owned by the Pakistan Government,
and by AOC has taken place in the south-easterly extension of the geolo-
gical formation underlying the Dhulian fields. OGDC has completed one
well at Tut delivering 3.4 1Ncf per day of pure gas in association with
1,000 bbl of oil and is drilling two more in the Tut and Meyal areas
respectively. AOC has completed one well at itleyal. This gas contains
poisonous concentrations of hydrogen sulphide and must be treated before
use. ACO is currently drilling a second well. Neither of these pro-
ducing wells can yet provide sufficient data for an estimate of new gas
reserves. Reasonable calculations of reserves and deliverability for
these three new fields cannot be made until each producer has three wells.
This will not be until about 1972, so that no dependency of SNGPL on
these new fields has been assumed in the forecast period covered in this
appraisal.
C. Sui Northern's Present Facilities and Operations
2.07      The facilities of SNGPL, existing or under construction, con-
sist of a pipeline system extending northward from the Sui gas field to
the Hattar-Rawalpindi area. The principal elements of this system on
completion of the second Sui Northern project (Loan 597-PAK) will be a
750-mile hign pressure transmission line from the Sui field to Multan,
Lyallpur, Lahore, Dandot and Wah; four compressor stations with a total
installed horsepower of 23,100; 17 repeater stations and 699 miles of
distribution mains serving some 27,887 premises. The whole of the system
is completely automated and is operated from a control center at
Lyallpur.



- 4 -
2.08      The original 16-inch Sui-Multan line was completed in 1958 and
extended to Lyallpur in 1965. In the 1965 project, a 12-inch extension
was built to Dandot from Lyallpur and a 10-inch spur was built from that
city to Lahore. In 1967 the Rawalpindi area, previously supplied by gas
from the Dhulian fields of AOC, was linked to the SNGPL system when the
trunk line was extended from Dandot to Galli Jagir. This extension was
undertaken concurrently with the sale of the AOC's distribution system
to SNGPL.
2.09      The current expansion program will increase system capacity to
supply gas to serve the Dawood-Hercules fertilizer plant near Lahore,
and on completion the SNGPL system will have a capacity of 207 MMcf per
day. A more detailed description of the facilities existing and under
construction is given in Annex 1 and is shown on Map II.
2.10      On completion of the extension of the system with the proposed
project, its capacity will reach 266 MMcf per day; of this quantity, all
but 20 ithicf per day will originate in the Sui gas field.  Should gas from
the new Tut-Meyal fields become available, offtakes from the Sui field
could be reduced, thereby lessening compression costs in other parts of the
system.
2.11      SNGPL's gas supplies are assured by long-term contracts with
PPL and AOC. At projected levels of consumption these contracts are suf-
ficient for about 30 years. AOC has agreed to increase its gas supply to
SNGPL's northern area and the conclusion of a contract satisfactory to
the Bank will be a condition of loan effectiveness.
2.12      Sui gas requires treatment before use.  SGTC has agreed, in
connection with the second project, to provide up to 275 MMcf per day
of purification capacity for SNGPL. Facilities to provide this capacity
are presently under construction and will be completed by mid-1971. The
maximum day requirements for Sui gas projected for the proposed expansion
will not exceed about 270 MMcf per day. Therefore, no additional puri-
fication plant capacity is required at this time.

3.  TEE ILVSVTOU PROGi[M ANID THE  PRCJECT
A. The Investment Program
3.01      SNGPL's investment program for 1970-1976 consists of expenditures
to provide gas to a large fertilizer plant, to expand capacity in markets
now served by the system and to extend the system to new areas. Loan 597-
PAK finances most of the foreign exchange cost of the project now under
construction, which provides facilities needed to serve the fertilizer
plant and to expand distribution facilities. The proposed loan will finance
the foreign exchange cost of further distribution, expansion and extension
of the system to new areas.
3.02      The investment program amounts to PRs 320.3 million during the
period 1970-1976 inclusive. Of this amount PRs 82.4 million is for the
project financed in part by loan 597-PAK, PRs 190.5 million is for the pro-
posed project and PRs 47.4 million for capital expenditures such as rein-
forcing the Sutlej bridge crossing and normal replacements. Details of this
investment program are shown in Table 2.
B. Description of the Project
3.03      The project consists of the facilities necessary to increase the
capacity of SNGPLts gas transmission system from 207 h1vicf per day to 266
liEcf per day through additional loops and compressors, and to extend the
system to Daudkhelg to the Peshawar-Takht Bai area, and from Mlurdike to
Rahwali, involving 208 miles of transmission line. Low pressure distribu-
tion facilities will also be constructed to serve domestic and commercial
premises.
3.04      The project includes:
(a) the procurement and installation, including cathodic
protection, of 76 miles of 18-inch and 30 miles of 16-
inch diameter high pressure steel pipe, paralleling
sections of the existing pipeline between Sui and Lyallpur;
(b) the procurement and installation, including cathodic
protection, of high pressure steel pipe to extend the
system by 80 miles of 10-inch, 98 miles of 8-inch and
30 miles of 6-inch diameter line to serve Daudkhel,
Gujranwala, and the Peshawar-Takht Bai areas;
(c) the construction of three new compressor stations and
the procurement of six 1,100 hp compressor units and
one 300 hp unit for installation in these stations;
(d)  three compressor units, with a capacity of 1,100 hp each,
to be installed at three existing compressor stations;



-6-
(e) the procurement of materials for, and installation of,
additional low pressure distribution facilities both in
the areas to be newly served and in markets now being served;
(f) the procurement and installation of telecommunication and
automation equipment at three new ompressor stations and
the extension of telecommunications into the Peshawars Deudkhe
and Rahwali areas.
The location of the facilities is shown on Map II.
3.05     Two river crossings bridging the Attock and Kabul Rivrs are in-
cluded in the project. Sites have been surveyed and preliminary designs
have been made, from which costs have been estimated by the consutants who
designed the existing bridges of the system. The new crossings are ulikely
to present diffioult problems.
3.06      The telecommunications and control center at Lrallpur monitors
data on gas flow, temperature, and pressure which are automatically recorded
at repeater and compressor stations and transmitted to the control center
On the basis of data received, the center regulates the flow of gas through
the line by remote control of compressor stations.* This system has worked
well in the pasts and it will be extended to the proposed project.
3.0?      The distribution system is to be extended over the years 1973
through 1976 in oonjunction both with the expansion of gas transmission lines
into new market areas and with the market growth in areas presently supplied
by SNGPL. This expansion program is designed to take care of the requirmnts
of small industrial consumers and to provide for additional residential con-
nections.
C. Construction Cost Estimates
3.08      The proposed project is estimated to cost the equivalent of ULS$40.0
million (Ms 190.5 milion). The loan of US$19.2 million covers the estimated
foreign exchange costs of the project which is 48% of total costs. The various
major elements of the project are shown in the table below. These costs in-
clude adequate allowance for engineering and contingencies. Additional details
are shown in Tables 3, 4 and 5,

3.09      All of the above figures are based on recent procureimvnt experie-neeP
ond include allowances fcr -rice es,a-at,-on of 5% per year for foreign cx-
chalige costs and 7rz$ per year for Rupee costs during the construction period.
In addition, an allowance of 41% for pipe procurement and installation and of
3% for compressor costs has been included to cover unforeseen contingencie-S.
An independent check of major cost items confirms that SNGPL's estimates are
reasonable.
D. Procurement
3.10      All procurement for this project will be by international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement",
except for small contracts for civil works and miscellaneous equipment which
would not attract international competition. The total value of such con-
tracts is not expected to exceed about 8% of the cost of the project or
US$1.5 m-illion equivalent.
E. Project Design, Engineering and Schedule
3.11      The detailed design of the project will take place under the pro-
visions of a Technical Services Agreement between SNGPL and BOC. This agree-
ment is satisfactory. Basic calculations regarding the requirements for
looping and for added compression were carried out by the tec1mical staff
of SNGPL and checked by the technical advisers. Design is advanced to the
stage where close cost estimates have been made. Detailed design will be
completed early in 1971. Consultants acceptable to the Bank will perform
the detailed design of the telecommunications system, the compressor stations.
bridges and the cathodic protection system. As a condition of effectiveness
SNGPL will prepare a plan satisfactory to the Bank to procure these consulting
services.
3.12      The current Sui Northern project has required the services of a
number of BOC personnel seconded under the terms of the Technical Services
Agreement. These personnel are now scheduled to remain with SNGPL until
May 1971, the estimated completion date of the project now under construction
under loan 597-PAK. SNGPL plans to retain this group until late 1972 to
complete the proposed project.
3.13      The route survey for the project is almost complete.  Right-of-way
acquisition has started. Expropriation procedures are available so that
no delays from litigation are anticipated.  Design of the propcsed system
has already started and materials inquiry, preparation of tenders, and
bidding will take place in the period October 1970 to April 1971. Mobil-
ization for pipe laying is programmed between March and May 1971 and the projec. `
will be completed by the end of 1972.
F. Disbursement
3.14      Disbursement of loan funds will be made to finance the foreign
exchange cost of imports for use in the project and for consultant services.
Since this is a self-contained project, any surplus loan amounts should be
cancelled.  Disbursements are expected to take place over a 2-6 year period
from end-1970 to mid-1973.

4. TmIE -MARKET
*.01      SNGPL's projected gas sales indicate that maximum-day and average-
day offtakes are expected to increase up to 266 and 188 Mlief per day respec-
tively by 1975, as compared to a maximum day offtake of 145 flIcf and actual
average daily sales of 106 niNcf in 1969. Sales will increase gradually to
average-day offtakes of 194 IMMcf per day in 1983.  A detailed statement of
SNGPL's past and projected maximum-day and average-day sales, by area and
industry, is given in Tables 6 and 7. The basis for sales projections and
changes in the structure of SNGPL's market is given in Annex 2.
L.02      The projected total gas sales consist of:
(a)  gas sales through the existing system, including the works
financed under the second Sui Northern project (597-PAK);
(b)  gas sales over and above (a) in the presently-served
market areas; and
{c)  gas sales in the new market areas.
G.as sales (b) and (c) are the incremental sales related to the proposed
=roject.  Out of the projected total gas sales, the share of the incremental
sales in terms of average-day offtakes amounts to about 21a in 1975 and
-bout 20o in 1983.  The compcsition of the projected total gas sales in terms
of average-day offtakes is listed below:

L.03      The average-day gas sales through the existing system including
works now under construction are expected to increase from 105 MIcf per day
in 1969 to 151 ,MAcf per day in 1974. After some decrease to a level of



- 9 -
148 i4Icf per day in 1975 due to expected lower offtakes by W-JAPDA, average-
day gas sales would increase up to 154 i4Hcf per day in 1983. The gas
released by the power plant would be gradually taken up by other consumers
2.n the existing market areas.
4.O      Incremental gas sales in the existing markets attributable to
The proposed project are expected to account for average-day offtakes of
13 114cf per day from 1975 onward.  The most important customers are small
consumers in the Multan, Lyallpur, Lahore and Rawalpindi areas, including
sales to households. These sales would amount to about 11 IEAcf per day in
1975. The remaining sales are to a foundry/forge plant in the Rawalpindi
area.
1+-O5     Gas sales in the new market areas -- Peshawar, Daudkhel and
.rujranwala -- are estimated at an average-day offtake of 19 IMNcf in 1972
after the completion of the project, and expected to increase to and stay
at 27 NMcf from 1975 onward. The sales in the Peshawar area account for
average-day sales of 12 NMcf per day; the Daudkhel area, 12 ISMcf; and the
Gujranwala area, 3 MMcf. Major industries and their projected average-day
offtakes in these areas for 1975 are listed below:
Industry              Projected Average-day Gas Sales
(li4cf)
Fertilizer                           6.7
Sugar                                5.7

Others                               7.6
27.1
4-oi.06   The foregoing sales projections for the existing market areas
are based on an analysis of the future requirements of IWJAPDA, each of the
aajor industrial consumers, and general industrial consumers, including
households. The sales projections for the new market areas are based on
the results of a detailed market survey of the major prospective industrial
consumers in each area. Given past and present gas sales experience and
the present structure of fuel prices, the projected sales of gas are
reasonable and perhaps on the conservative side.
4.07      Compared with the present situation, SNqGPL's future market would
be more diversified, due to new industries coming into the market, the de-
creasing relative importance of WJAPDA and the increasing importance of ferti-
lizer industries.  Particularly, the decreasing share of WTAPDA:s gas con-
sumption would improve the utilization of the system, since WAPDA's plants
have been subject to large seasonal, as well as daily, fluctuations in
demand resulting in a low ratio between average-day and maximum-day offtakes.

5.  ECONOIOIC EVALUA'XTION
A. General
5.01      The expansion of the capacity of the gas pipeline to meet increasiag
demand for natural gas in the existing market areas and to serve various
industries in the new market areas will bring substantial economic benefits
to the Pakistan economy. The substitution of natural gas for presently-used
fuels, such as furnace oil and coal, will generate economic benefits in the
form of savings in the cost of fuel consumption. The estimated economic rate
of return of the project is expected to be about 22%.
5.02      The proposed project will also have environmental benefits, which
h.ave not been quantified. These benefits occur since the processing of
.,atural gas will cause very little pollution and it is significantly cleaner
at the point of use than furnace oil and coal.
B. Economic Rate of Return
L"03     The major variables involved in quantifying the economic benefits
are economic costs of various fuels, the structure of existing fuel usages
in each market area and the sales of natural gas.
5,.04     The table below compares the cost at the point of use of serving
`he projected market with various fuels.  The calculations, described in
Annex 3, exclude taxes, duties and profits, and show costs both in the
absence of the project (furnace oil and coal) and with the project (natural
gas). The economic cost of all fuels has been assumed as constant for the
purpose of this analysis.

1/   All costs are per million BTU.
2/   Other costs include handling, storage and marketing costs.



- T1 -
The comparative data indicate that gas is substantially cheaper than furnace
oil and coal, due mainly to low wellhead cost. Thus, the substitution of
niatural gas for other fuels will generate economic benefits in the form of
cost savings.
.-05      The fuel replaced by gas in the existing market areas and the
?eshawar area will be furnace oil.  In the Gujranwala area, 90% of the fuel
replaced is estimated to be furnace oil and 10C' wood; and in the Daudkhel
area, 90% coal and 10% furnace oil.
P.o6      The project has been designed to achieve the least cost combination
of various sizes of pipe and compressors to deliver gas in accordance with
?rojected sales. The total costs are estimated at PRs 190.5 million or
US$40.0 million equivalent. Excluding the tax elements from the total expen-
ditures but including some nominal conversion costs of the original facilities
of the users to gas, the economic costs of the project are estimated at
PRs 165.0 million or US$34.7 million equivalent.
5.07      Based on an economic life of 20 years, and the economic costs of
the project estimated above, economic benefits in the form of cost savings
would yield an overall return of about 22%.  The economic rates of return
on various market areas- range between 10-40%, the highest being at the
Daudkhel area, followed by the existing market area, Gujranwala and
Peshawar areas.
.08      The estimated rate of return would vary, depending upon alternative
assumptions for major parameters in the analysis. Assuming that the
economic cost of the project would be higher by 5% and at the same time the
projected gas sales lower by 5%, the rate of return would be about 19%.
The application of a shadow exchange rate, valuing the Rupee at half its
official value (US$1.00 = PRs 9.52), would lower the rate of return by
only 1%. If sales materialize faster than estimated and costs are lower,
the rate of return would be higher than 22%. The most likely return on
the project is estimated to be 22%.

6.  TIE BORR01.
A. Corporate Structure
6.01      Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd. (SNGPL) is a limited liability
company incorporated in Pakistan in 1963 with its registered office and
headquarters in Lahore. It was formed in 1963 to take over, extend and
operate gas pipelines previously owned by the Government of Pakistan and
Attock Oil Company. Approximately 300 miles of existing pipeline were
taken over and a further 400 subsequently constructed.
6.02      SNGPL has a long-term contract with the Pakistan Petroleum
Ltd. (PPL) for the supply of natural gas from the Sui field, and with the
Sui Gas Transmission Company (SGTC) for the purification of this gas. The
majority of the shares in all three companies are held in varying propor-
tions by the Government of Pakistan and the Bunmah Oil Company (BOC), an
internatinnal company registered in Scotland vith assets exceeding
US$600 million.  SNGPL buys gas, arranges for it to be purified, transports
it and sells it to users.
6.03      The Company has an authorized share capital of Pus 400 million,
of which PRs 100 million have so far been issued and a further PRs 18 million
are to be issued this year. The shares are held in equal proportions by
BOC, Wlest Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (NJIDC), and the
general public in Pakistan.
6.04      TIPIDC is a corporation controlled and financed by the Government
of Pakistan. It has two main activities: setting up and managing industries
unable to attract private capital and investing in private industries which
the Government wishes to encourage. Its total investments amount to over
PRs 900 million including FRs 135 million in the natural gas industry.
The shares of SNGPL were issued in denominations of PRs 10 and are quoted
on the Pakistan stock exchange. Their value has increased from a low of
PRs 10.42 in 1965 to PRs 13.75 in September 1967 and PRs 16.10 in IHarch
1970. The present price gives a yield of 6.2 percent.
6.05      SNGPL has a Board of Directors composed of 13 members including
the Chaixman and the Hanaging Director.  The Chairman and three other
Directors are nominated by WPIDC. Four Directors are nominated by BOC
and four by the other shareholders. The Managing Director is the chief
executive of the Company and an ex officio member of the Board. The Board
meets at least once a month, and more often if necessary, to make decisions
on policy matters. Day to day control of the Company is exercised by the
Mranaging Director.

B. Organization and Mianagement
6.o6      The present company organization is shown in Annex 4.  All the
main departments are headed by Pakistani nationals with the exception of
the Engineering Department which is headed by an expatriate from the UK
on secondment from BOC under a technical services agreement between the
two c-mpanies. The total number of employees of the Company, other than
those ongaged on project construction has been cut from 1743 in July 1967
to 1222 in January 1970 despite expansion of the system. Of these 1222,
456 are engaged on distribution and the remainder on transmission and in
the Head Office. IJhilst there may still be room for further economies the
number of staff is reasonable for a pipeline system of this size. Labor
relations are good.
6.07      JP. M.A,K. Alizai was appointed Managing Director in January 1970.
Pvr. Alizai who had served as Joint General Manager and was appointed
General Manager in June 1968 is a competent Pakistani well trained in the
oil industry. He has in the last eighteen months made several organiza-
tional changes and has brought a sense of dynamism and greater efficiency
to the Company.
6.o8      SHGPL's accounting system is based on modern commercial accounting
principles. Previous reports on S3NGPL have remarked on the poor performance
of the accounting Department, but this has changed. A new Chief Accountant
Mr. Shaukhat, was appointed at the beginning of 1969 and he has reorganized
the accounting function. Trial balances are now produced promptly and
significant management information extracted and disseminated. There is
closer financial control of the company and the Chief Accountant makes an
important contribution to efficient management.
6.09      In the early days of the company, SNGPL relied heavily on BOC
to provide experienced technical personnel in key positions to ensure
efficient operation of its highly automated system. This dependence has
decreased over a period of time as SMGPL personnel have gained more
experience and training. Today the Company relies on BOG only to the
extent that any pipeline company would rely upon technical consultants
and the SNGPL system is as eff-ciently run as most pipelines in more
developed countries.
6.10      In view of the increase in management strength and the growth
of the market (as mentioned in para. 4.07), it was agreed in negotiations
that the debt/equity ratio, which has remained unchanged at 60:40 since
the inception of the Company be relaxed to 65:35. This is still lower
on the debt side than that encountered in similar ccmpanies in more
developed countries. Since a covenant in the present loan agreement,



- '14 -
whereby SNGPL may not make investments exceeding US$1.5 million a year
without the Bank's approval, remains unchanged the practical effect will
be small. It means that SNGPL will be able to raise debt without a
corresponding increase in equity for capital investment not exceeding
US$1.5 million in 1975 rather than 1976 without seeking the BankIs
permission.
C. Present Financial Position
6.11      SNGPL's financial position is sound as illustrated by the balance
sheets for the years ended July 31, 1966 through 1969 which are summarized
below in PRs millions:
1966     1967     1568     1969
Jurrent Assets                        33.01    32.59    45.26    57.19

Total liabilities                   262.45  299.21   335.86   352.04
Investments in fixed assets have increased over the period from FRs 245.03
million to PRs 349.30 million due to expansion partly financed by previous
Bank loans.
6.12      Long term debt was incurred only to the extent necessary to pay
construction costs and maintain an adequate liquid position. One of the
terms of the previous Loan Agreements is that no dividend may be declared
unless on the date of such declaration current assets exceeded current
liabilities (including the dividend declared) in a ratio of 1.5:1. This
restriction is being maintained.
6.13      In the early years the sums provided for liabilities for deferred
taxation were inadequate. This has been rectified and the provision now
covers the total theoretical liability.



- 15 -
6.14      Fixed assets account for over 85-% of the total assets of the
Company and this is in line with international practice in the pipeline
industry. As of July 31, 1969 fixed assets (at cost) amounted to PRs 349.3
million. The value of land included is insignificant since it is
acquired under expropriation procedures for laying of pipe, mainly in
unpopulated areas. The assets have been financed from the following
sources:

Internal Resources               81.2
31493
6.15      Loans have accounted for just under 50% of the financial
structure in line with a condition of the Bank's previous loans to SNGPL
that the debt/equity ratio be limited to 60:40 except during construction
periods.

6.17      Actual sales did not increase between 1966 and 1968 at the speed
originally foreseen, due to WAPDA's failure to take the qcantities envisaged
in their original projections. Despite this, actual net income was in line
with the forecasts and in 1969, when WAPDA's load was much steadier, net
income was higher than forecast.
6.18      SNGPL's accounts are kept in accordance with Section 130 of the
1913 Companies Act of Pakistan. The law requires the accounts to be audited
by independent chartered accountants annually. The Company's joint auditors
are Messrs. Ferguson and Co. and Rahim Jan and Co. both Pakistani firns.
Copies of their audit reports from inception of the Company to July 1969
have been reviewed by the Bank and are acceptable. There are, however,
certain obligations of SNGPL which the auditors have not so far been required
to comment on specifically. They include the limitations on SNGPL in the
loan agreements with respect to incurring debt, making investments, and
paying dividends.  SNGPL have therefore agreed to procure a certificate
from their auditors annually that these provisions have been complied with
and to forward such certificate to the Bank.
6.19      Depreciation is applied by SNGPL on a straight line basis at
rates comparable with similar industries elsewhere in the world. These
rates are satisfactory. The tax allowance for depreciation is higher in
the earlier years and lower in the later years, and consequently provision
for deferred taxation is made in SNGPL's accounts. Taxable profits are
subject to income tax at a rate of 50% at all levels of income. It is
SNGPL's practice, as stated in its prospectus, to pay a dividend of an
average of 10% each year on the issued share capital.
6.20      SNGPL carries adequate liability and property insurance on its
present facilities consistent with sound industrial and business practice.
D. Tariff Rates
6.21      Tariffs are set by SNJGPL but are subject to Government approval.
The latest rates were published and approved by the Ministry of Industries
and Natural Resources in the Gazette of Pakistan dated June 28, 1969. The
tariffs are basically negotiated rates, many of which are fixed by long
term contracts. The current rates which now include excise duty of
PRs .40 per Mcf levied at the well head are shown in Annex 5 and suwmarized
below:
WAPDA                           PRs 2.55 to 2.75 per M:cf
Fertilizer Factories                 2.15 to 2.40
Cement Factories                            3.10
General Industry                            3.25



- 17 -
Che -ieeighted average price for the year ended July 31, 1969 during which
excise duty at PFs .40 was levied for one month only, was PRs 2.53 per 14cf.
6.22      The Natural Gas Panel set up by the Government has drafted
legislation which provides for a reasonable rate of return on total invest-
ment in each company in the gas production and distribution industry. The
Government has the proposal under consideration.  Enactment would not affect
the terms of the present Loan Agreement, which provides that tariffs are to
be set to produce a return on net fixed assets of not less than 10% up to
1973 and not less than 12% thereafter.  It was agreed in negotiations to
leave this covenant unchanged.  Projections (Table 10) show that SNGPL will
achieve these rates of return.
E. Future Financial Position
6.23      As mentioned in paragraph 3.02 the project is estimated to cost
PRs 190.5 million. It is intended that the total cost be financed by loans
and internally generated funds. No further issue of shares is contemplated
in respect of the present project since BOC would not be able, due to other
commitments, to take up a second rights issue at this time.
6.24      The proposed financing method is:
PRs (millions)            US$ (millions)
Local   Foreign      Local  Foreign    Total
IBRD Loan                      -      91.62          -     19.24      19.24
Local Loans                  33.83       -          7.11     -         7.11
Internal Resources           65.06       -         13.66     -        13.66
98.89    91.62       20.77   19.24    40.01
The effect of this method of financing is that the debt:equity ratio -would
rise to a maximum of 70:30 in 1973 at the end of the construction period
and fall quickly thereafter to below 60:40 by 1976 (Table 9).
6.25      SN7GPL has agreed to make satisfactory arrangements prior to
effectiveness of the proposed loan to obtain new local loans amounting to
PRs 33.83 million.  SNGPL has also agreed to finance any project cost overrun.
6.26      The projected balance sheets for the years 1970 to 1981 illustrate
the soundness of the projected financial position of the Company. They are
sho-wnn in Table 9 and are summarized below in  PRs millions.

Long term debt which rises to a peak of nearly PRs 300 million in 1973 is
reduced to PRs 250 million by 1975. Surplus rises from 6.6 percent of share
capital to 22.5 percent by the end of the same period and makes a substantial
contribution to the increase in gross fixed assets.
6.27      Projected earnings for the years 1970-1981 are shown in Table 10.
Revenue is based on sales forecasts and present contract terms for sale of
gas. Expenditure is based on long term contract terms for purchase of gas
and on agreed purification rates. Other operating expenditure is projected
to increase by 7% per annum in line with general increases in prices over
the past years. Both sales volume and income increase by approximately 8C%
between 1970 and 1975 with profit rising at a slightly lower rate from
PRs 21.7 million to PRs 36.9 million.
6.28      During the remainder of the period sales volume, income and
profit level off, increasing operating expenditure being offset by lower
interest expense. The net income so produced is sufficient to support
dividends on shares of 10% in each year. In addition, the net income allows
reserves to be built up by over PRs 45 million which are invested in fixed
assets. Debt service is always adequately covered, the cover never falling
below 1.7 times the liability.
6.29      Sources and applications of funds which are shown in Table 11
and summarized below in PRs millions further demonstrate the financial
strength of the company.

million only PRs 200 million will come from loans and share issues, the
remainder being provided by internal resources. Funds for the proposed
project will start to be drawn down in fiscal 1971 in accordance with the

7. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
a)  SNGPL will enter into a contract with Attock Oil
Company guaranteeing deliveries to SNGPL of 20 MMcf
of gas per day prior to effectiveness of the loan
(para. 2.11);
b)  As a condition of effectiveness, SNGPL will prepare a
plan satisfactory to the Bank to procure consulting
services (para. 3.11); and
c) SNGPL will make satisfactory arrangements prior to
effectiveness of the proposed loan to obtain local
loans amounting to PRs 33.83 million (para. 6.25).
7.02      It is recommended that a Bank loan of US$19.2 million equivalent
be made to SNGPL to be repaid in 36 semi-annual equal installments of principal.
A term of 21 years including a grace period of three years would be appropriate.

APPIUMJZAIS  OF TEE THIRD
SUI NORTHIERu GAIS PIPELITES PROJECT
Basis for Sales Projections and Changes in the Market Structure
A. By4sting Market Areas
1.     The sales projections for the existing market areas are based on an
analysis of the future requirements of TUAPDA, each of the major industrial
consumers, and general industrial consumers, including households. On the
basis of past and present gas sales experience, SNtGPL's projected sales are
reasonable and perhaps on the conservative side. 1/
2.     One of the major SNGPL's customers, WAPDA, has been operating gas-
fired steam and gas turbine electric power units at its power stations at
Multan, Lyalipur and Lahore.  The primary function of these plants are to
supplement the base load hydro-electric plants. According to the agree-
ment between SNGPL and WIAPDA reached in 1963, SUTGPL are commaitted to
guarantee until 1973 a peak-day capacity of 57 Mcf;  i.e. 40 k4cf at
Xultan, 12 IJMcf at Lyallpur and 5 11Icf at Lahore. Once the full 220 kilo-
volt interconnected system will be in operation at the Multan power plant,
SNGPL expects that a netsystem capacity of 18 YI4cf will be released from
W-APDA beyond 1976. The average-day offtakes of IJAPDA are expected to be
26 ISlcf per day in 1976 as compared to 43 M`Ilcf per day in 1969.
3.     During 1968 and 1969, gas sales to the existing industries such as
the fertilizer plant at Multan, the Gharibwal cement plant, the soda plant
at Khewra, and other cement plants were generally in line with the pro-
jected sales. Since the projected sales for these industries are kept
constant beyond 1970, SNGPL's projections are reasonable. These sales
would amount to an average-day offtalke of 35 MMcf per day from 1970 onward
as compared to 31 .111Icf in 1969. The fertilizer plant at Lahore which has
been under construction is expected to achieve full-capacity operation
by 1974, and have an average-day consumption of 29 1Thif per day from 1974
onward. Projections of sales to other industries include a new fertilizer
plant at Rahimyar Kahn,    expected to be in operation as scheduled.  These
sales would amount to an average-day offtake of 17 i41cf per day in 1975 and
increase to 20 ~I]cf beyond 1976.
4.    Sales to general industries in Lyallpur, Lahore, and Rawalpindi have
been assumed to grow at 10oI annually through 1975. These sales are kept
l/ In 1969, actual gas sales exceeded forecasted sales for 1969 by
13 i1Ricf per day and for 1970 by 2 iMvIcf per day.

constant beyond 1976 on the assumption that no further expansion of the
system would take place after completion of the proposed project. Simi-
larly, sales to the Sui-Nultan areas have been assumed to grow at 10% up
to the limit of the present capacity in the area. It has been envisaged
that the gas sales for general industries in these areas would take up
gradually the released capacity from 14APDA due to the favorable price of
gas compared with those of other fuels. A comparison of the various fuel
prices is provided in Table on page 4.

B.  Ne_ Market Areas
5.     The sales projections for the new market areas of Gujranwala,
Peshawar and Daudlkhel have been based on the results of a detailed market
survey of the major prospective industrial consumers in each area. Given
the present structure of fuel prices in the new market areas, the projected
sales of natural gas as a substitution for existing fuels are conservative.
6.     The projected change over from existing fuels such as imported
furnace oil, domestic coal and wood to natural gas is based on the lower
price of gas. A comparison of the market prices for all fuels in the new
market areas (see Table attached) shows that gas is 40-50% cheaper than
furnace oil and 15-307 cheaper than coal. In addition, the furnace oil
sapply is slow 1/  and irregular by railway from Karachi, and has neces-
sitated storage facilities for industrial consumers. The availability and
quality of domestic coal is deteriorating.
7.     SNGPL's sales projections in the new areas are kept constant at an
average-day consumption of 27 MIcf per day beyond 1975.  This implies that
no account has been taken of the effect of savings on demand due to the use
of natural gas nor of economic growth beyond 1975. Thus, the projected gas
sales are conservative and might well be higher after 1975, the limiting
factor being SNGPL's ability to deliver larger quantities.
8.     The market in Gujranwala consists of small industrial consumers
1/ For example, travel time for oil-tank wvagons from Karachi to
the Peshawar area is often as long as 20 days.

using mostly Lrnported furnace oil and wood as fuels.  The Daudkhel area in-
cludes the TJPIDC industrial complex which comprises plants for fertilizers,
cement, dyes, and antibiotics. These plants need gas urgently as coal, their
main fuel, is becoming expensive and its supply unreliable. The Peshawar
area includes large industrial plants for sugar and paper. Presently these
industries rely heavily upon furnace oil. Fuel consumption in the sugar
mills has recently changed from bagasse to furnace oil.  The bagasse, which
was used as boiler fuel, is now being used as a raw material for paper pro-
duction and no longer available as a fuel.
C. Cllanges in MAarket Structure
9.     After completion of the proposed project, the structure of SNGPL's
raarket would be more diversified than the present one. The following com-
narative table of average-day offtakes by different industries at different
periods shows that:
(a)  new industries including paper and sugar are coming into
the market;
(b)  the relative importance of WiJAPDA is decreasing proportionally;
and
(c)  the importance of fertilizer industries is increasing in
relative as well as in absolute terms.

The ratio between average-day and maximum would improve from 62% during
1967-69 to 69% during 1973-75 and 72% during '981-83.  The main reasons are
the decrease in the importance of WAPDA whose demand is subject to la-rge
fluctuations, and the increase in the importance of fertilizer and other
industries whose demand is stable.

Assumptions Used for Economic Return Calculations
1.            The table in this Annex shows the calculation of the most likely
return on the project. All cost savings are generated by the replacement of
the presently-used fuels such as furnace oil, coal and wood. They consist of
the replacement of furnace oil including foreign exchange costs, marketing and
railway transportation costs, 52Z;  the replacement of coal and wood excluding
their handling and storage cost at the point of use, 387/; and the remaining
for handling and storage of all fuels.
2.            Economic costs of fuels described in paragraph 5.05 are deter-
mined by adjusting the current market prices of fuels. For example, furnace
oil cost per one million Btu has been determined in the following way:
Market Price            Economic Cost
(PRs)                   (PRs)
C & F at Karachi                      1.20                     1.20
Handling & Marketing                  0.20                     0.20
=fmport Duties & Taxes                2.23                        0
Rail Transport                        1.62                      0.86
5.25                     2.26
Handling and Storage                  0.26                     0.26
5.51                     2.52
Tax elements are considered as transfer payments and have therefore been
eliminated.  Rail transport cost has been reduced by about 41, this being
the proportion of the rail tariff which covers capital costs, depreciation,
etc.
3.            The economic cost of natural gas per one million Btu is
detemined on the basis of the end of incremental sales, as indicated
below:

3.00                  o4.h
The adjustment on  wellhead and purification charges is made on the basis
that the additional production of natural gas required for the proposed
project does not necessitate a large capital expenditure. Although the
operating costs for the pipeline are based on the anticipated financial
costs, the expected increase in financial costs due to the assumption
of annual 7% escalation of costs is eliminated for the economic analysis.
4F. -Based on these economic costs of various fuels, the projected
sales (Chapter 4)9 the structure of present fuel consumptions (para. 5.06),
and the estimated economic costs of the project (para. 5.07), the economic
rate of return has been calculated for 20 years of the project life.

Assumptions Used For Financial Forecasts
1.        Interest and other charges on the Bank loan during construction
are treated as operating expenses.
2.        The sale price of gas has been calculated on the basis of SNGPL's
current gas tariff. Details are given in paragraph 11.
3.        The purchase price of gas is based on the present contract price
of PRs .84 per Mcf for gas ex Sui and PRs 1.00 per Mcf for gas ex bhuli&.*
Both prices include PRs .40 excise duty.
4.        The cost of purification is based on the present rate of PRs .25
per Mcf. In addition, SNGPL pay to SGTC approximately 4 percent of their
offtake as their share of the gas used in the purification plant boilers.
5.        Transmission and distribution costs are based on Sui Northern's
actual experience for the year ended July 31, 1969 and on the budgeted
figures for the financial year 1969/70. In respect of the latter, the
budgeted figure amounts to PRs 16.7 million inclusive of compression. The
total operating costs have been allocated to transmission, distribution
and compression as follows:
Transmission     PRs 9.4 million
Distribution          5.6 million
Compression           1.7 million
PRs 16.7 million
Transmission and distribution operating costs are escalated at 7 percent
per annum throughout the study period in both cases in line with increases
in prices over the past few years. In respect of transmission loop lines,
the operating costs are calculated at PRs 3,500 per mile/year escalating
at 7 percent per annum with 1967 as base year. In the case of new lines
a base of PRs 10,000 a mile for easy terrain and PRs 15,000 for difficult
terrain has been taken.
6.        The following compression operating costs have been used:
a)   Labor and overheads:  To be taken as PRs 125,000 per station
in 1969 with a 5 percent escalation per year thereafter.
b)   Maintenance, Spares, Lub Oil, etc.:  The cost of maintenance,
spares and lubricating oil for com'ressors is to be taken as
PRs 63 per BHP per year and calculated on installed bp.
c)   Fuel Cost:  Fuel cost is based on PRs 1.12 per Mcf.  Gas consump-
tion for a centrifugal station is to be taken as 350 cu ft
per hp day.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
7.        Interest is calculated on the following assumptions:
i)  Foreign loans will incur an interest rate of 8% (including
the Government guarantee fee) on the reducing balance. The
oan will be repayable in 36 equal semi-yearly installments
of principal commencing in 1973.
ii)  Local xupee loans will carry an interest rate of 9% on the
reducing balance but will be repayable in 8 years.
iii)  Existing loans/debentures carry interest rates in accordance
with their teams.
8.        Depreciation is calculated at the rates approved by the Board
of SNOGP and accepted by the Government. Different rates apply for tax
purposes.
9.        Tax has been calculated at the existing rate of 50% less super
tax rebates on dividends to the extent admissible.
10.       A dividend of 10% per annum has been assumed.
11.       Sui Northern's gas tariff is as followss:
A. WADA Power Stations
(i)  Multan Station:
Fixed charge           PRs 380,000 per month
