HIV/AIDS\n            Project for Burundi development objective is to increase the\n            utilization of a selected set of preventive services, among\n            groups highly vulnerable to, or affected by HIV/AIDS. The\n            project will achieve goals by contributing to: (i)\n            capacity-building and service delivery for service providers\n            with a focus on prevention activities in high risk groups;\n            (ii) existing and new treatment services on the basis of\n            performance; (iii) small grants for highly vulnerable groups\n            and HIV affected families; and, (iv) capacity building for\n            local authorities and key ministries to implement and\n            monitor HIV/AIDS control activities, and operational costs\n            for managing the National Program including improving the\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system. The four project\n            components are as follows: the first component is preventive\n            services targeted to high risk groups. Interventions\n            supported by this component fall under the first axis (or\n            operational Program) of National HIV/AIDS Strategy and Plan\n            (NHAS) 2007-2011, and aim at reducing HIV transmission among\n            high risk groups through behavior change and increased\n            access to preventative services. Second component is\n            performance-based curative services. This component will\n            support the geographic extension of antiretroviral (ARV)\n            treatment and opportunistic infection prophylaxis and\n            treatment to HIV+ people in the whole country. Third\n            component is decentralized financing of small grants to\n            families living with HIVIAIDS and high risk groups. This\n            component aims at providing limited economic and legal\n            support to the most vulnerable families affected by\n            HIV/AIDS. Finally, capacity building for local authorities\n            and key ministries to implement HIV/AIDS Activities, and\n            National Program Management. The objectives of this\n            component are to build capacity to implement and monitor\n            HIV/AIDS activities in key ministries and local governments;\n            contribute to ensure adequate operation of the\n            Secre'tariat Executive du Conseil National de Lutte\n            contre le SIDA (SEP/CNLS); increase the SEP/CNLS capacity to\n            manage the M&E system; and implement that national waste\n            management plan."}, "docdt": "2008-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
