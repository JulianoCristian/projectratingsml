                         The Project has made much progress in the last year through: (i) an increased focus on most at risk populations (MARPs); (ii) use of results-based financing (RBF) to improve
                         delivery of clinical HIV services; (iii) grater attention to monitoring and evaluation (M&E); and (iv) greater attention to key preventive activities such as male circumcision.
