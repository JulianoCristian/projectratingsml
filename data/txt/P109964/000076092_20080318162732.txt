2. Project Objectives 
The Project objective is to increase the coverage and or utilization of a selected set of 
preventive and treatment services, among groups highly vulnerable to or affected by 
HIV/AIDS. The National strategy includes specific indicators for each of these 
objectives.   
 
3. Project Description 
Since the financing gap for the National Plan is substantial, both the Government and 
IDA have selected a limited set of activities for IDA financing. The Grant would be a 
Specific Investment Loan supporting activities from the National HIV/AIDS Plan (2007-
2011) selected on the bases of appropriateness for Burundi’s epidemic as per ongoing 
survey results, proven cost-effectiveness, and complementarity to activities financed by 
other donors, mainly the Global Fund.  By focusing on capacity building, development 
and improvement of processes and systems, and prevention activities for high risk 
groups, IDA funds would enable the Borrower to use the GF funds more efficiency. The 
Grant will have a unified category only so that reallocation can be easily done in case 
potential financing for some critical activity fails to materialize. The team considered a 
Page  2
programmatic loan and budget support but the weakness of Burundi’s financial 
management capacity,as experienced in the management of HIPC funds, suggest that a 
SIL would be more appropriate in current conditions.  
 
Project components will follow the four axes of the National Program. Specifically, IDA 
funds will finance the following selected activities under the following four components:  
 
Component 1: Preventive Services Targeted to High Risk Groups (IDA financing: US$8 
million). Interventions supported by this component fall under the first axis (or 
operational Program) of NHAS 2007-2011, and aim at reducing HIV transmission among 
high risk groups through behavior change and increased access to preventative services, 
particularly PMTCT services, to the whole territory.  
 
Component 2: Performance-Based Preventive Services Targeted to High Risk Groups 
(IDA financing: US$4 million).  This component will support the geographic extension 
of ARV treatment and opportunistic infection prophylaxis and treatment to HIV+ people 
in the whole country.  To achieve this objective, IDA resources will finance technical 
assistance to improve existing performance-based service contracts/agreements between 
the MOH and public and private health facilities to provide clinical care for HIV/AIDS 
patients. Currently such contact / agreements are between the SEP/CNLS and the service 
providers. Finally, resources under this component will also help further develop 
community-based home care services in a limited set of communities.  
 
Component 3: Decentralized Financing of Small Grants to Families living with 
HIV/AIDS and High Risk Groups (IDA financing: US$ 4 million).This component aims 
at providing limited economic and legal support to the most vulnerable families affected 
by HIV/AIDS. IDA grant resources will use the mechanisms set-up under the first MAP 
to finance sub-projects managed by NGOs, developmental commune councils and 
community-groups, that provide small grants to vulnerable families, and families living 
with HIV/AIDS to increase treatment compliance; and increase their capacity to nourish 
themselves in order to improve the impact of drugs.  
 
Component 4: Capacity Building for Local Authorities and Key Ministries to Implement 
HIV/AIDS Activities, and National Program Management (IDA financing: US$ 3 
million). The objectives of this component are to build capacity to implement and 
monitor HIV/AIDS activities in key ministries and local governments, contribute to 
ensure adequate operation of the SEP/CNLS; Increase the SEP/CNLS capacity to manage 
the M&E system, in particular carry-out impact assessment of interventions; and 
implement the National Waste Management plan.  
 
The proposed Grant would permit consolidation of recent gains on the ground and allow 
for the scaling-up of the local integrated response to HIV/AIDS and other well-
performing HIV prevention activities. It would also allow the strengthening of the quality 
of current interventions and the strengthening of key public agencies, in particular the 
MOH. The support to the MOH would follow the National health strategy, ensuring a 
coordinated and harmonized approach to health services. The Project will assess whether 
Page  3
indigenous groups are particularly affected by HIV/AIDS and will ensure that they have 
adequate access to culturally appropriated services.  
 
The implementation arrangements under the additional financing would be virtually the 
same as for the ongoing project, as they are working well. The only difference will be the 
creation of a dedicated MOH sub-account. This sub-account would be managed by the 
general directorate of resources of the MOH.  This directorate direction will hire an 
accountant, an assistant accountant and a procurement specialist to manage those 
resources in accordance with IDA procedures. Annual disbursements to that account will 
be agreed upon at the latest in the month of October of the previous year, after approval 
by the SEP/CNLS and IDA of an annual work plan and performance indicators. In terms 
of decentralization of local personnel to provincial level, the Project would follow the 
current practice of provincial accounts to be justified regularly.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The Project will cover the whole country.  However, in a concentrated epidemic, targeted 
interventions in high-risk areas and high-risk groups in Burundi are the most effective 
way.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The only Policy triggered under the first Project was related to medical waste 
management. Progress on medical waste management realized under the first Project was 
limited by civil conflict and low country capacity. The waste management assessment 
and action plan carried out under the previous operation has been updated to reflect the 
changing country situation. The results of the updated assessment and the plan to mitigate 
potential negative effects have been approved by ASPEN and will be made public prior 
Page  4
to appraisal. There is a very low probability that the operation includes some minor 
rehabilitation of existing facilities, which will in no case involve land acquisition and not 
involuntary resettlement.No rehabilitation is planed for the first year of the Project. If any 
rehabilitation was included in the plans after the first 12 months, civil works contracts 
will include, as it has been done in other Projects, clauses for the adequate provision of 
waste materials, use of non-toxic construction materials and respect for cultural property.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The results of the updated assessment and the plan to mitigate potential negative effects 
have been approved by ASPEN was made public in February 8, 2008. There is a very low 
probability that the operation includes some minor rehabilitation of existing facilities, 
which will in no case involve land acquisition and not involuntary resettlement.  No 
rehabilitation is planed for the first year of the Project.  If any rehabilitation was included 
in the plans after the first 12 months, civil works contracts will include, as it has been 
done in other Projects, clauses for the adequate provision of waste materials, use of non-
toxic construction materials and respect for cultural property.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
The study assessed current medical waste management practices in Burundi and made 
general recommendations for improvements. It noted that health care professionals have a 
very limited understanding of the dangers of medical waste, and the public information 
campaigns via radio and other channels do not highlight the risks of poor medical waste 
management. The most serious risk is the potential spread of HIV/AIDS due to 
improperly handled and disposed medical waste (blood, urine, syringes, sharps, 
bandages, laboratory waste etc.). The main recommendations centered on the importance 
of training health center personnel in safe medical waste management and to ensure its 
safe disposal.  
 
The appraisal mission discussed the recommendations of the above study with 
representatives of the SEP/CNLS; USLS/Sante; Departement de la Promotion de la 
Sante; and the Ministry of Environment. It was determined that the proposed project 
would fund the following activities under component 4 (total cost estimate: $105,500).  
 
(a) Update of the norms and standards for health centers providing HIV/AIDS services 
to include safe medical waste management practices (consultant);  
 
(b) Identification, quantification and description of materials needed for safe medical 
waste management in the health centers (consultant);  
 
(c) Preparation of a training module on safe medical waste management (consultant);  
 
(d) Multiplication and dissemination of the training module to about 500 health centers;  
 
(e) Training of health center personnel; and  
Page  5
(f) Acquisition of protective gear and equipment for health care personnel for safe 
medical waste management.  
 
The SEP/CNLS will be responsible for implementing the above measures.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Project Document recognizes that progress on environmental issues realized under 
the first Project was limited.  An action plan for adequate disposal of biologically 
hazardous materials has been updated.  No land will be acquired. The Project is not 
expected to affect Indigenous People.  
 
In an effort to mitigate potential adverse environmental and social impacts effectively, 
the project has prepared a study: “Etude sur la mise en place de plansde Gestion des 
Dechets Biomedicaux”, November 2007. This study has been disclosed in Burundi on 
February 6, 2008, and at the Bank’s Infoshop on February 8, 2008.  
 
The study was prepared in consultation with health care personnel, hygiene and 
sanitation personnel, representatives of the Institut National pour l’Environnement et la 
Conservation de la Nature (INECN), Bureau Burundais de Normalisation et de ContrÃ´le 
de QualitÃ© (BBN), Ministry of Public Health, provincial sanitationfacilitities, and 
environmental health specialists, and involved site visits to several representative health 
care facilities. Their views have been reflected in the study.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The Project will cover the whole country.  However, in a concentrated epidemic, targeted 
interventions in high-risk areas and high-risk groups in Burundi are the most effective 
way.
