                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project will be closed on June 30, 2011, as initially planned, with a 4-month grace period ending October 31, 2011. The Project Implementation Completion and Results Report
                         (ICRR) is due by end December 2011. Both Government and Bank Teams have taken required actions to prepare and deliver the ICRR on time. The Government has appointed a
                         consultant to prepare its own final evaluation report, and the Bank will prepare the Implementation Completion and Results Report during 1st quarter of FY12.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
