The National strategy includes\n            specific indicators for each of these objectives. There is a\n            very low probability that the operation includes some minor\n            rehabilitation of existing facilities, which will in no case\n            involve land acquisition and not involuntary resettlement.\n            Possible negative impacts include waste care activities that\n            have been identified in all structures that were visited.\n            They are mostly related to pollution of the air. The study\n            assessed current medical waste management practices in\n            Burundi and made general recommendations for improvements.\n            It noted that health care professionals have a very limited\n            understanding of the dangers of medical waste, and the\n            public information campaigns via radio and other channels do\n            not highlight the risks of poor medical waste management.\n            The most serious risk is the potential spread of HIV/AIDS\n            due to improperly handled and disposed medical waste (blood,\n            urine, syringes, sharps, bandages, laboratory waste etc.).\n            The main recommendations centered on the importance of\n            training health center personnel in safe medical waste\n            management and to ensure its safe disposal."}, "docdt": "2007-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
