    HIV/AIDS Project for Burundi were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: the Results-Based Financing (RBF)\n            scheme is a suitable tool to accelerate and/or maintain the\n            achievement of results even within weak health systems like\n            the one in a post-conflict country. The scaling up of the\n            RBF scheme at country level can contribute significantly to\n            achieving significant results in a relatively short period\n            of time. Close coordination and collaboration between\n            partners is necessary to ensure sustainability of achieved\n            results.
