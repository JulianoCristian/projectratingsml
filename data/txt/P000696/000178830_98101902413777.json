The project consists of two components:\n            (a) An exploration promotion component consisting of: (i)\n            technical assistance to the Ministry of Mines and Energy in\n            promoting Ethiopia's petroleum, assisting in the\n            negotiation of exploration contracts with oil companies, and\n            monitoring the activities of operating companies; (ii)\n            acquisition of about 800 line-km of offshore seismic data\n            and the reprocessing of about 3,000 line-km of existing\n            seismic data; (iii) training of key Ministry of Mines and\n            Energy staff; (iv) special studies, particularly on the\n            potential use of natural gas domestically; and (v) equipment\n            for the above. (b) A geothermal reconnaissance component\n            consisting of: (i) consulting services to evaluate the\n            feasibility of developing geothermal sites northeast of\n            Addis Ababa; (ii) assistance in developing an overall\n            strategy for geothermal development; and (iii) training and\n            equipment for the above."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
