Much has already been learned from the\n            project about the process of slum upgrading and the\n            provision of health and other social services. Particularly\n            notable is the process which has come to be known as\n            \"re-blocking\". This is the process of preparing a\n            subdivision layout as a basis for providing access and basic\n            services as well as for establishing land tenure. This\n            process involves formal and intensive planning with the\n            families living in Tondo, on a neighborhood by neighborhood\n            basis. This is described fully in this report and in annex\n            four. The re-blocking experience in Manila has already\n            influenced the design of subsequent urban projects financed\n            by the Bank."}, "docdt": "1977-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
