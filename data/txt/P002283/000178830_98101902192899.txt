INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO OFFICE DES POSTES ET TELECOMMUNICATIONS
DU SENEGAL
FOR A TELECOM4UNICATIONS PROJECT
IN SENEGAL
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Office des Postes et Telecommunications du Senegal (OPTS) with the
guarantee of the Republic of Senegal for the equivalent of US$6.25 million
to help finance a telecommunications project. The loan would have a term of
25 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report on the current economic position and prospects of Senegal
was distributed to the Executive Directors on January 10, 1970. A Bank
economic mission visited Senegal in March to assess the current economic
situation and prospects. The following paragraphs reflect the findings of
that mission. Country data are given in Annex II.
Economic Potential
3.        Endowed with few natural resources, Senegal has only limited
possibilities for economic development. Soils are generally light and poor
and rainfall is scarce and limited to only three to four months of the year.
In the northern half of the country where the bulk of the population lives,
millet and groundnuts are the only crops that can be grown without irrigation.
Irrigation is possible along the Senegal River. In the sparsely populated
south and southeast, the rural potential is somewhat greater (rice, cotton
and fruit), but lack of feeder roads and other infrastructure has so far
hampered development there. In spite of efforts to expand output of other
agricultural products, Senegal can still be called a one crop economy, as
groundnuts account for the cash income of the majority of the rural popula-
tion and for nearly half of the country's export earnings.
4.        Outside agriculture, the main possibilities for economic develop-
ment are fisheries, tourism and manufacturing. Thanks to rich resources off
the coast, fish production has been growing rapidly. International tourism
to Senegal has started to develop only in the recent years, but prospects for
further expansion of this sector are promising. Senegal developed its
industrial sectors earlier than did other West African countries and its indus-
trial labor force is one of the best in Africa. However, although there are
certain definite possibilities for development of new crops and new sectors,
diversification will at best be a lengthy process. For some time the
economy will remain affected by the vagaries of the weather and fluctuations
in the world market price of groundnuts.



-2-
Past Development
5.        During the 1960's, the first decade of independence, Senegal's
economy stagnated. GDP growth in real terms was minimal (1.4 percent a year)
and per capita income may have declined though at about US$250 it is above
that of other African countries.
6.        Two factors were responsible for the slow growth.   With independence,
Senegal lost its privileged position as the center of French West Africa.
This resulted in the loss of export markets for manufactures, as domestic
industries developed in other West African countries. At the same time,
demand for services and locally produced goods was depressed, following the
departure of most French civil and military personnel. In the second half
of the 1960's, a combination of bad weather and falling export prices affected
groundnut production which declined by 50 percent. At the same time production
of major food crops remained at a level insufficient to cover local demand.
7.        In the early years after independence, the government's response
to the country's difficult adjustment problems was slow. The heavy adminis-
trative apparatus, inherited from colonial times, did not respond quickly to
the new situation and government policies stressed administration rather than
development. The First Development Plan (1961-64) concentrated on investments
for social and transport infrastructure, including housing, urban water supply
and administrative buildings. Investments in rural sectors accounted for
less than 20 percent of total development outlays. In the modern sector,
however, the government succeeded in stimulating import substitution, which
partly offset the loss of export markets. Annual growth of manufacturing
output amounted to nearly 6 percent in an otherwise static economy.
8.        During the second half of the 1960's, the government's development
policy became more energetic.    The main aspect of the new government
policies has been a considerable increase in the public investment program,
which was made possible by substantial improvements in absorptive capacity
of the public sector. The investment program became more directly development-
oriented with the share of investments in productive sectors increasing to
45 percent during the Second and Third Plans. Rural investments more than
tripled between 1961-64 and 1968-71 and their quality has improved. Rural
diversification was successfully started, mainly for cotton, rice and tomatoes.
9.        The change in the government's development policy came too late
to have a significant impact on the economy in the late 1960's, when ground-
nut prices were reduced and groundnut output sharply declined. At the
beginning of 1971, the government took effective measures to stimulate
groundnut output. Sharp increases in world market prices after 1968 made
possible a 25 percent increase in producer prices which, together with
favorable weather helped restore groundnut production in 1971. This was
instrumental in bringing about a sizable growth of GDP (at current prices)
after four years of virtual stagnation. Over the 1968-1971 period, GDP
increased by over 8 percent per annum.



- 3 -
10.       The slight fall in rural production during 1964-70 had little ef-
fect on the modern sector of the economy, which expanded even more rapidly
than during the first half of the 1960's. This was mainly the result of a
14 percent annual increase in exports of manufactured products. By 1970,
20 percent of local manufacturing production was exported. This reflects
Senegal's improving external competitive position and, to some extent, its
relatively more developed industrial base compared to its neighbors. At
thie time of independence the country was plagued with a high cost structure
which seriously hampered economic growth. Since then Government policies
aimed at curtailing price and salary increases to about 3 percent per annum,
allowed such Senegalese industries as textiles and shoes to start competing
successfully in export markets.
Public Finance and Foreign'Aid
11.       The public finances reflect these overall economic trends.   The
condition of public finance deteriorated throughout the 1960's. Public
savings slowly but continuously declined to virtually zero by 1968/69. Rev-
enues stagnated because of the decline in imports, the most important element
of this tax base. Thus, keeping the tax ratio at roughly 20 percent of GDP
was quite an achievement. But current expenditures grew, albeit moderately,
at some 3 to 4 percent annually thus eroding the current account surplus.
12.       After 1968/69, better tax collection, increased tax rates and sub-
stantial surpluses of the groundnut stabilization fund following the rise in
groundnut export prices led to a recovery of public savings. In 1970/71,
public savings represented some 7 percent of current revenues. Yet locally-
financed public investment continued, as it had throughout the 1960's, to
exceed savings by a wide margin, resulting in a slow but continuous decline
of Treasury deposits.
13.       Senegal has been benefiting from a large inflow of foreign aid,
mostly on concessionary terms. Between 1966 and 1970, foreign aid financed
about 65 percent of the public capital program and averaged US$30 million
per year. This corresponds to US$8.0 per capita annually, mainly financed
by the European Economic Community (40 percent) and France (30 percent).
The World Bank Group and Germany contributed, respectively, 13 and 10 per-
cent of the total. Foreign aid programs concentrated on infrastructure and
on directly productive projects in the rural sector. Of importance also was
the technical assistance, mainly in education, which amounted to US$29 mil-
lion annually, mostly financed by the French Government.
Prospects
14.       In the coming years the economy will probably grow faster than in
the past decade largely as a result of on-going efforts to diversify agricul-
tural output and expand fisheries, tourism and industrial exports. Medium
term prospects would be more favorable, were it not that groundnut prices
were expected to fall from their present level of over ElOO/long ton to
E80/long ton by 1975.



- 4 -
15.       In view of the prospective fall in groundnut prices which is expected
to wipe out the surplus of the stabilization fund within two or three years,
some acceleration of economic growth will be essential to help improve the
public finances. The government is determined to keep the expansion of current
expenditures to a minimum and to improve the financial performance of public
enterprises. However, since tax rates are already relatively high, the
urgently needed revenue increases will have to come from a combination of
better collection and overall economic growth.
16.       Considering the need to diversify the economy, an increase in public
investment from US$60 million annually during the Third Plan (1969/73) to
US$80 million during the Fourth Plan appears essential. However, while such
a program is in line with the recent improvement in the government's capacity
to prepare and implement projects, the slow increase in public savings,
together with the limited possibilities of deficit financing without endanger-
ing the difficult foreign exchange situation or restricting credit to the
private sector, make financing of the Fourth Plan difficult. To offset the
expected shortfall in local resources associated with the deterioration of
terms of trade, foreign lenders will have to increase their share in the
financing of the Fourth Plan to about 85 percent of total development expend-
itures. Foreign aid is expected to continue to expand rapidly, based on the
programs of the European Communities (Third FED), bilateral aid donors (Canada,
Italy, Belgium, and oil producing countries in the Arab world) and the World
Bank Group. In view of Senegal's improved economic performance and absorptive
capacity, increased external assistance is warranted.
17.       External aid will have to continue to be on relatively soft terms
if it is not to create serious debt service problems. The proportion of
grant aid has declined from 85 percent in 1964-66 to 55 percent in 1969-71
and is likely to drop to about 40 percent of total foreign financial aid
during the period of the Fourth Plan. Although the foreign debt service
ratio is still low at 3-4 percent, financing of the remainder of foreign aid
on conventional terms would soon lead to unmanageable balance of payments and
budgetary difficulties. Projections indicate that at least half of non-grant
aid should be extended on concessionary terms if an excessive increase in
the debt service ratio is to be avoided. Budget constraints are even more
serious, as debt service charges are already projected to absorb one-half of
gross public savings by 1980. Any substantial hardening of the blend could
result in negative public savings.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
18.       The Bank Group has had nine operations in Senegal to date.    Total
lending amounts to US$46.7 million (net of cancellations), including seven
IDA credits, one Bank loan and one blend of Bank and IDA funds. The Bank
Group is now Senegal's third largest aid donor (after France and the European
Economic Communities) providing about 13 percent of Senegal's external capital
assistance. IFC has made investments totalling US$3.25 million in two projects



- 5 -
in Senegal. Annex. I contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments as of October 31, 1972, and notes on the execution of
on-going projects.
19.       Initially Bank Group lending in Senegal was limited to the trans-
port and groundnut sectors. A railway project financed in 1966 (Credit 96-SE)
was delayed and there were shortfalls in the railway's financial performance.
However, it eventually succeeded in strengthening the railway authority which,
with the assistance of a second project approved this year (Credit 314-SE
and Loan 835-SE) should soon be showing an operating surplus. A loan for
the Dakar port (Loan 493-SE) met with more immediate success and helped
improve the finances and administration of the Port Authority. Our first
operation in agriculture was an agricultural credit project (Loan 584-SE and
Credit 140-SE) which aimed at improving groundnut and millet cultivation.
It suffered at first from a sharp fall in groundnut output (paragraph 9)
causing a drop in demand for credit which led to the cancellation of the
Bank loan. In 1971, the government took strong action which with fair
weather permitted the recovery of groundnut production in 1971. The credit
is expected to be fully disbursed by the end of 1972 and a second project
is being appraised which would complete the institutional improvements which
the first project began. A credit made in 1970 for construction and main-
tenance of feeder roads in the groundnut basin (Credit 198-SE) has been
satisfactorily implemented.
20.       More prominence is now being given by the Government and the Bank
to the diversification of agricultural production and development of new pro-
ductive sectors. The Casamance Rice project (Credit 252-SE) approved in 1971
is helping stimulate rice production in the southern part of the country, while
the Terres Neuves project (Credit 254-SE), also of 1971, is enabling farmers
to leave the groundnut basin and cultivate a variety of crops in the loss
densely populated eastern region of tlhe counltry.  Thie River Polder project
for the production of rice and vegetables in the Northern Delta has just
been negotiated with the government and will be presented for consideration
by the Executive Directors later in this fiscal year.
21.       As Senegal's agricultural potential is limited, we are actively
exploring with the government other avenues for diversification. Perhaps the
most promising is tourism for which Senegal's pleasant climate and attractive
beaches constitute important assets. A Bank mission is currently in the field
reviewing the prospects of Senegalese tourism within the context of overall
tourism development of West Africa. The extension of Dakar airport, as
proposed in the airport project under consideration, will facilitate the
development of the sector. Other possibilities for diversification currently
being examined by the Bank include fisheries and manufacturing. The Government
has also asked the Bank to take the lead in assessing the viability of a large
tanker repair project and we are considering the possibility of an engineering
loan for the preparation of the project.



- 6 -
22.       Other sectors in which the Barnk is involved are urbanization in
which a Site and Services project (Credit 336-SE) was recently approved and
education, in which a general education project is being prepared following
a credit in 1971 (Credit 253-SE) for technical and agricultural education.
Institution building and improvement in the performance of public enterprises
and services will continue to be important themes in Bank Group lending in
Senegal.  Examples include the telecommunication project now under considera-
tion, a power project under preparation and a highway rehabilitation project
which has been appraised recently and will be submitted to the Executive
Directors this fiscal year.
PART III - THE'TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
23.       Senegal's communication network is well developed, compared to that
of most other West African countries. Hlowever, telecommunications services
are inadequate, unevenly distributed and very costly. Most telephones are
in Dakar leaving large gaps in the network for the rest of the country.
Moreover, the quality of service is low because local exchange lines are
very old and need replacement; long distance circuits are congested and
there are long waits before calls can be made. Fault rates are also high.
Tariffs in Senegal are roughly'in line with those in other French speaking
West African countries, but are more than twice those for similar services
in other developing countries. In short, the present telecommunications
network handicaps efficient organization of production, trade and public
administration.
24.       The Government has started to implement a nationwide investment
program to rehabilitate, modernize, and expand the principal local and long-
distance network to meet the expected detmind.  The first part of the
program whicil focussed on the southern provinces is expected to be completed
by June 1973. The proposed Bank Group project is the second part of the
program. It concentrates on rehabilitating the Dakar network and expanding
and modernizing it in the northern provinces of the country, where several
agricultural and agro-industrial projects are under way, and where prospects
for tourism are favorable.
25.       With the exception of the military, civil aviation, railway and
broadcasting services which have their own networks, all domestic telephone
telegraph and telex services are provided by the Office des Postes et
Telecommunications du Senegal, a Government-owned entity established in
1960. OPTS has radio links with the capitals of neighboring countries. All
other international services are provided by TELESENEGAL, in which the
Senegalese Government holds 40 percent of the capital. OPTS also operates
postal services, a nationwide public checking account service and the
national savings bank.



-7-
PART IV - TEE PROJECT
26.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a telecommunications Project
of the Office des Postes et Telecommunications du Senegal (OPTS)" (PU-101a)
is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. A loan and
project summary is provided at Annex III.
27.       The Government of Senegal has asked the Bank to help finance a
telecommunications project to be undertaken by OPTS. In April 1969, a
Bank mission identified a project which would be suitable for Bank financing.
The UNDP-financed feasibility studies were carried out by consultants in
accordance with terms of reference prepared by the Bank, which acted as
executing agency. The project was appraised in April 1972. Negotiations
took place from October 3 to 6 with a delegation headed by the Secretary of
State for Planning, Mr. Ousmane Seck.
28.       The project includes:
(i) the provision of automatic switching equipment for
8,300 lines (6,300 of which will be installed in the
Dakar area and 2,000 in the eight northern provincial
towns of Saint Louis, Louga, Richard Toll, Dagana,
Linguere, Kebemer, Podor and Matam); 2,400 of the new
lines to be provided in the Dakar area will replace
worn out switching equipment;
(ii)   the rehabilitation and extension of the existing cable
distribution networks in Dakar and the provincial
towns mentioned in (i);
(iii)   the construction of a microwave link between Dakar,
Thies, Saint Louis, and Richard Toll with associated
multiplexing equipment - initially for 140 channels
with switching equipment to provide subscriber trunk
dialing;
(iv)   the construction of a VHF/UHF link with ten spur links
along the Senegal River from Richard Toll to Bakel;
(v)   the rehabilitation of the open wire line and installation
of new carrier equipment between Louga and Linguere;
(vi)   the purchase of miscellaneous equipment including vehicles
and tools;
(vii)   the detailed engineering of the project.
(viii)   the employment of consultants for studies on tariff
and organization; and
(ix)   the implementation of comprehensive training programs.



- 8 -
29.       The total cost of the project is estimated to be US$8.9 million
exclusive of duties and taxes. The estimated foreign exchange component is
US$6.8 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$6.25 million would finance 71
percent of the total. The balance of US$2.6 million will come from OPTS's
own resources. Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that funds
needed for that part of the program to be financed from OPTS's internal
resources will be transferred quarterly in advance from OPTS's account with
the Treasury to an independent bank account outside Treasury control in order
to maintain balances sufficient to meet expenditures expected in the following
three months.
30.       OPTS does not now have the technical expertise to prepare the
specifications or to supervise execution of the main works. Assurances have
been obtained that OPTS would appoint consultants, in accordance with terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank, to advise on the preparation of the specifi-
cations and bidding documents, to assist in bid evaluation, and to supervise
execution of the works.
31.       The suppliers would construct the main works (installation of
exchanges, microwave and VHF/UHF links) under the supervision of the consult-
ants. Construction of buildings and civil works would be carried out by
local contractors, supervised by OPTS's staff. Rehabilitation of open wire
lines, cable-laying, and subscribers' installations would be carried out by
OPTS's staff. The installation and commissioning of all new plants are
expected to be completed by the end of June 1976.
32.       OPTS's accounting and auditing systems require improvement.
With the technical assistance under the proposed project, OPTS's staff will
review and update plant inventories, asset values, and where necessary
apportion all fixed assets between the various services. In accordance with
terms of reference approved by the Bank a consultant will study telecommunica-
tions tariffs.  An amount of US$25,000 equivalent has been included in the
proposed loan to finance this study. To ensure the maximum efficiency of
its postal and financial services, OPTS also intends to review the operations,
staffing and financing.   Given the inter-relationship between the tele-
communications and postal and financial services in Senegal, US$50,000 has
been included in the loan to cover the foreign costs of the review.
33.       OPTS's senior managment is competent.   However, it includes a
number of expatriate advisers. Some have been replaced over recent years
by nationals and the number of expatriate advisers has been reduced from 62
in 1962 to 14 at present. Although the Government has agreed to maintain
the existing technical assistance for the construction period of the proposed
project, training for Senegalese will have to be substantially accelerated
if OPTS is to replace the existing expatriates with adequately qualified
local staff. A sum of US$175,000 has therefore been included in the loan
to permit about 30 suitable candidates to obtain diploma-level training
outside Senegal. In addition, suppliers' contracts, which would cover in-
stallation and maintenance of the equipment, would also allow OPTS's staff
to participate in the execution of the works, and to gain experience in



- 9 -
installation, testing and maintenance. Finally, the national telecommunications
school and the multi-national school recently established at Rufisque, Senegal
by the UNDP and the Senegalese government will train technicians.
34.       All goods financed by the Bank would be procured through interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement.
Additional switching equipment required for extensions to the existing Penta-
conta exchanges and some vehicles, costing about US$0.5 million, will be
procured from existing suppliers, and will be financed by OPTS. Buildings
and civil works, at a cost of about US$0.6 million will be procured through
local competitive bidding.
35.       The proposed loan would be disbursed against the CIF cost of imported
equipment and the foreign cost of imported services. Any unused balance of
the loan would be made available, after consultation with the Bank, to
purchase additional goods and services, similar to those already procured
under the loan, needed for OPTS's ongoing expansion program.
36.       The project aims at providing the facilities to meet the future
demand, as well as improving the quality of service in Dakar and in the impor-
tant areas of northern Senegal. In these areas, inadequate telecommunications
facilities hamper economic development and administrative activities. In
Dakar, in addition to expanding the facilities, old and worn-out equipment--the
main cause of bad service in the capital--will be replaced. In the eight
important northern provincial centers, worn-out manual equipment will be
replaced and handling capacity will be expanded by automatic exchanges which
will be linked with each other and with Dakar by a microwave system providing
for subscriber trunk dialing facilities. At a later date, the microwave route
could be extended to provide good telecommunications with neighboring Mauritania.
37.       Based on OPTS' expected net revenues from the project, after elim-
inating taxes and duties, the capital invested in the project shows a return
of 14 percent. This return clearly underestimates the economic return because
(i) the prices charged do not measure the full benefits to the economy; (ii)
the costs include the full cost of extending service to new areas, even though
the full benefits of these extensions will be reaped only in the future when
additional lines are connected in these areas; and (iii) no account has been
taken of the benefits to TELESENEGAL.
38.       Surpluses from telecommunications operations are expected to con-
tinue to be satisfactory. During the construction period (1973-76) the rate
of return on net fixed assets would average about 15 percent. This would
enable OPTS to finance 46 percent of its investmeut program during the above
period and still contribute a surplus to the Treasury equivalent to an annual
dividend on the Government's equity in OPTS of 7 percent.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and OPTS, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Senegal and the Bank, the report
of the committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
40.       The draft agreement conforms to the normal pattern for loans for
telecommunications projects.
41.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI:  RECOMMIENDATION
42.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   Projects in Execution
First Railway Project (FY 1966) - Credit 96-SE
1.        The project was designed to put the Railways (Regie) on a sound
teclhinical and financial footing. All project items, mainly track material
and some rolling stock, have now been delivered and the project will be
completed by the end of 1972, about three years behind the original schedule.
Due to the Regie's internal administrative difficulties, lack of qualified
staff to prepare and issue tender documents and also to labor problems,
delivery of materials and equipment was delayed and, as a result, disburse-
menits were slow.
'.       Th.' fle niicial perfortikatice of the lHegLe duritng the first project
fell consid(lerably shtort of expectation, principally because traffic did not
increase as expected at the time of appraisal. Furthermore, the Regie's
effort to ctut personnel costs was largely offset by an increase in its material
costs. As a result the Regie is still operating at a loss as compared to a
target rate of return for 1969/70 of 4 percent as agreed in 1966. The short-
falls in the Regie's performance under Credit 96-SE must be viewed in the
light of the Senegalese and Plalian economies' failure to move ahead as rapidly
as expected. The recent economic recovery in both countries will assist in
improving the financial situation of the Regie.
Port of Dakar (FY 67) Credit 493-SE
3.        The first port project, which was approved in 1967, was to improve
Dakar port facilities by extending the wharves, reconstructing quay walls and
dredging various areas in the port. After slow but satisfactory execution,
the project should be completed by the end of 1972. Special loan covenants

helped to improve the finances and administration of the Port Authority.
The Port Authority, which has recently established a Master Plan for its
future development, is presently considering the extension of its fishing
port and ship repair facilities.
Agricultural Credit Project (FY69) - Credit 140-SE and Loan 584-SE
(Cancelled)
4.        This project is discussed in paras. 9 and 19 of the Presidentts
Report.
First Highway Project (FY 1970) - Credit 198-SE
5.        The first highway project provided for construction of feeder roads,
purchase of highway maintenance equipment and study on road improvement and
maintenance. Execution of the project has been satisfactory. Actual costs
are within appraisal estimates and surplus funds available are being used for
providing additional maintenance equipment. The credit is expected to be
fully disbursed by the closing date of December 31, 1972.
6.        Implementation of the maintenance program and rehabilitation of
existing paved roads as recommended by the road improvement and maintenance
study would be financed under a second highway project presently under
appraisal.
Casamance Rice Project (FY71) - Credit 252-SE
7.        Launched in early 1972 the project is about to complete its first
campaign. Targets for area under cultivation and production have been met
and the construction and marketing programs are on schedule. The quality of
management and extension services is good. There are some delays in the
chanelling of funds to the Project Unit but a,new arrangement is now being
discussed with the Government.
Education Project (FY71) - Credit 253-SE
8.        Construction of all Project schools is expected to be completed
by January 31, 1975 in accordance with the appraisal schedule. The project
is progressing satisfactorily except for the Merchant Marine School at Dakar,
where there has been a delay in the selection of a fisheries expert; it is
expected that this appointment will be made within six months.
Terres Neuves Resettlement Project (FY71) - Credit 254-SE
9.        Despite a late start due to delays in the establishment of the
project entities, the 1972 first year targets have generally been achieved:
Forty-two families settled in April 1972 and cultivated 100 hectares. Agri-
cultural results are satisfactory and the settlers express satisfaction with
the project. The preparation of a second phase project is well under way
and feasibility study should be ready by the end of 1973.

Second Railway Project (FY 1972) - Loan 835-SE and Credit 314-SE
10.       This project involves continuation of track renewal towards the
Mali border, modernization of workshops to increase efficiency and thus
improve availability of rolling stock, the purchase of locomotives, the
modernization of freight cars to reduce maintenance costs, technical ser-
vices and training. The terminal date for effectiveness of the Loan and
Credit has been extended from November 1, 1972 to December 29, 1972 to permit
the Borrower to furnish the requisite legal opinions. Ilowever, specifications
and tender documents for the main items have already been prepared by the
Regie and it may be expected that the project should proceed normally and
be completed according to schedule.
11.       In order to achieve full potential benefits of the Investment
Program and to allow the Regie to reach financial viability by 1975/76 a
Plan of Action has been agreed upon with Government and the Regie. This
Plan outlines measures to be adopted by the Regie to improve operations,
reduce staff and study certain branch lines which appear to be unprofitable.
Site and Services Project (FY72) - Credit 336-SE
12.       The Credit Agreement was not signed until September 29, 1972 and
is not yet effective. However, the executing agency, Office des Habitations
a Loyers tModeres is carrying out its reorganization and is about to begin
the detailed engineering for the first phase of the project.
