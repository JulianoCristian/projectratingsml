Government's efforts to intensify hydrocarbon\n            exploration and to establish planning for the energy sector.\n            The project includes: (a) an exploration component\n            comprising: (i) technical assistance to the Directorate of\n            Mines and Geology (DMG) (68 man-months) to promote\n            Mauritania's petroleum potential to oil companies, to\n            negotiate exploration contracts with oil companies and to\n            monitor the activities of operating companies; (ii) training\n            of DMG staff; and (iii) construction of DMG facilities; and\n            (b) energy studies. As a result of the exploration promotion\n            component, information on Mauritania's hydrocarbon\n            potential would be improved and the Government would be in a\n            stronger position to attract private foreign capital to\n            undertake intensive hydrocarbon exploration. The energy\n            studies would enhance the Government's capacity to\n            assess development priorities and to develop appropriate\n            policies for the energy sector."}, "docdt": "1981-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
