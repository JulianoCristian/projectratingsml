MEKORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPHENT ASSOCIAUION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR A PRE-INVESTMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Developmer.t Credit of SDR 3.9 (US$5.0 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms
with 40 years' maturity to the Republic of Togo, for a Pre-investment Project.
2.        Background and Strategy.   In the mid-1970s, Togo adopted a very
ambitious public investment program which peaked at 46Z of GDP and initially
boosted economic growth. However, many of the large investments then undertaken
(notably in parast3tal enterprises) failed to yield expected returns. By the
end of the decade, this unsatisfactory performance, combined with sharply reduced
prices for Togo's main export commodities of coffee, cocoa and phosphates,
triggered a debt service crisis which prompted the country to adopt IMF-supported
stabilization programs in 1979 and 1981. These programs were in themselves not
sufficient to create sustainable growth with equity, and in 1983 the Government
began a program bf basic reform which, supported by three Structural Adjustment
Credits and further DMF-supported programs, continues today. The current program
seeks to liberalize the economy, rationalize public investments, reinforce
agricultural production and bring public enterprises on a sound footing. The
combined effects of financial stabilization and structural reform have reversed
previous stagnation and led to growth in real terms in GDP since 1984, averaging
about 2.4Z annually.
Realizing that increasing size and improved quality of its investment
programs was one of the prerequisites to turn around the economic decline of the
country, the Government in 1983 adopted a system of three-year rolling investment
programming. The first of these programs covered the period 1984-86, and was
prepared with support from IDA-financed technical assistance undar the first
phase of the Government's structural adjustment program.   In parallel, the
Government started a major program to restructure the parapublic sector through
privatization,  liquidation  or  restructuring  of more  than  30  parapublic
enterprises.
4.        The introduction of the rolling investment program and the restructur-
ing of the parapublic sector were vehicles for significant changes in Togo's
public investment policy. The new development and investment strategies now aim
at rehabilitating and maintaining existing assets, and improving the efficiency
and profitability of productive investments already made. However, expenditure
and investment selection still were not systematically subjected to technical,
economic and financial analysis, and the entire decision process in this respect
still leaves much to be desired. To sustain economic growth, investments must
be optimized in terms of priorities, size and timing.
5.        Regular reviews of the Public Investment Program (PIP), undertaken
jointly by the Government and the Bank, are at the core of the process of
insuring quality in investment proposals. However, the depth of knowledge of
needs and priorities varies greatly between sectors, and proper justification
and preparation of investment projects has emerged as a major constraint on the
volume of potentially available external project financing, and on investments
actually undertaken. Accordingly, the Governme . has, over the last two years,
built up planning units in its sectoral ministries, to identify sectoral
priorities and specific investment projects as part of an investment programming



-2-
process. Together with the Directorate of Planning in the Miaistry of Plan and
Mines, these units constitute the institutional framework in which sectoral
priorities are identified and public investment decisions taken.
6.        The present PIP 1989-91 stands at about CFAF 170 billion (US$510 mill-
ion equivalent).  The total need for pre-investment work for this program is very
tentatively estimated at US$20 million equivalent. Of this, financing is assured
in the amount of about US$7.5 million.   Additionally,  the Government and
bilateral donors have budgeted funds of about US$3.S million equivalent. The
immediate need for pre-investment work that should be started up without delay,
and for which financing is r.ot assured, is about US$5 million equivalent.
Further into the PIP period, about US$4 million will be required in supplementary
financing to cover all pre-investment work needed.
7.        The most recent investment reviews carried out between the Government
and the Bank have concluded that there is ample room for additional public
investments in Togo consistent with IMF framework programs, provided that these
be of acceptable quality in terms of their financial conditions and economic
impact, and realistic in terms of the absorptive capacity of the relevant
sectors. The immediate bottleneck on the volume of public investments is the
dearth of properly justified and prepared investment project plans. For a donor
conference in June 1988, the Government proposed a series of actions to alleviate
this. The proposed Project is, together with a proposed UNDP-financed technical
assistance project (for which the Bank would be Executing Agency) in response
to this proposal. The Government is strongly committed to use its dialogue with
IDA ¢ti the investment program as a vehicle to insure high-quality project
selection and preparation, which it sees as essential to assure the external
financing required for investments needed to sustain the country's economic
growth.
8.        Proiect Objectives and Framework. The Project will have both immediate
and long-term objectives. Firstly, to immediately relieve the constraints on
investments caused by the present lack of properly prepared projects; and,
secondly, over the project period, reinforce the institutional capacity for
identifying investment proposals and processin& these through feasibility
studies, obtaining financing and establishing final project execution plans.
These objectives will require the project to (a) rapidly create and then sustain
a pipeline of investment proposals identified, formulated, justified and fully
prepared for project evaluation by potential investment agencies and ultimately
for final project execution; and (b) gradually build up the capacity of the
Government to continuously ioentify priority investment projects in all sectors
of the country's economy.
9.        Project Description.  The Project will provides
(a) the preparation of project feasibility studies and preliminary project
execution plans, in such detail as may be required by potential
financing agencies for the purpose of their investment decision;
(b)  the preparation of final project execution plans emanating from (a)
above;
(c)  studies of the investment needs of individual sectors of the Togolese
economy with a view to identifying, in all sectors, investment



-3-
possibilities leading to project formulation through (a) and (b) above;
and
(d)  training of Togolese staff to manage and supervise the studies under
(a) through (c) above after the Project period.
Through the provisions under (a) through (d) above, the Project will provide
strengthening of the local capacity to prepare and execute pre-investment work.
10.       Proiect Com onents.  The above will be provided through the following
Project Components:
(a)  an investment urelaration comnonent, in the form of feasibility studies
and detailed execution plans of projects included in the 1-vernment's
triennial Public Investment Program; this will permit bringing
initially identified investment ideas through the stage of feasibility
evaluation and preliminary costing, and final project execution plans
after financing has been secured; and
(b) a sectoral nriorities commonent, in the form of studies and training
to supplement present knowledge of sectoral investment priorities, such
studies to be carried out under, or such training to be provided to,
the planning units of the relevant technical ministries. The sector
studies would in turn lay the basis for identifying high-priority
investment proposals.
Overall project management would be the responsibility of the Ministry of Plan
and Mines which would delegate management of sector-specific studies and training
to the relevant technical ministries.
11.       Proiect Costs and Financing.   The total cost of the Project is
estimated at US$5.6 million equivalent, net of taxes and duties. The project
will be financed by the Government of Togo and IDA. The Government will provide
an 11? share of the cost of contracts for pre-investment work and sectoral
studies and, in kind, logistics support for training. The Government's share
of the cost of contracts will be part of its regular budget allocation to the
ministries concerned. The Government's total contribution to the project is
estimated at US$0.6 million equivalent, and the IDA contribution at US$5.0 mil-
lion equivalent.
12.       Rationale for IDA Involvement. The Project would support the economic
reforms of recent years and consolidate sectoral approaches initiated under
recent IDA lending in the transport and agricultural sectors. It would provide
a selection of investment opportunities for IDA as well as other donors
permitting timely investment reaction to changing economic conditions. It would,
in the course of analysis of project implementation capability, identify
additional reforms of institutional or regulatory nature which could improve
investment effectiveness. It would also consolidate institution-building efforts
undertaken through previous IDA-financed technical assistance projects. Finally,
project progress monitoring would be a source of continuous information on the
progress of investment preparation for use in the PIP review process.
13.       Aareements Reached.   During Credit negotiations, agreements were
reached with the Government on (a) framework Terms of Reference for feasibility
work, and specific project and sectoral items to be studied under the Project;



-4-
(b) reporting on Project progress as part of the PIP process; (c) the ot'tline
of the staff training program, and establishment, by August 31, 1969 of a
detailed program and candidates for training; and (d) reviews of tno environmn-
tal assessment of proposed investmnts.
14.       Justification and Risks. The consolidation of economic reform and of
improvemnts  in  the quality  of the  invstment program  constitute  ample
justification for the project. Additionally, the project would help Togo to take
charge of the development of this ptogram, both by strengthening the progrw r.g
institutions and processes, and Uy furthering local expertise through business
opportunities for the local consuAting profession and the employment of Togolese
experts for specific studies.  The only major risk to the project would be a
reversal of the present trends in the Government's management of the economy;
such a reversal is considered unlikely.
15.       EnviLronmental Imolicat!tons. There are no environmental issues directly
attached to the project, but Indirectly, through the nature and detailed
specifications of the pre-investment work which it will finance, the project may
have significantly positive environmental importance. All pre-investment work
to be done under the project will contain environmental assessments.
16.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed IDA Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreemont of the Association, and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
