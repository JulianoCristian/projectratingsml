The key lessons learned are: 1) No\n            project is likely to be implemented in accordance with plans\n            unless there is some government's ownership of the\n            project. 2) In order to be implemented successfully a\n            pre-investment project requires a minimum of organization\n            and staffing on the Borrower side, and preferably the\n            availability of an administrative and accounting manual to\n            facilitate procurement, contract administration, and\n            disbursement. 3) Bank supervision of a pre-investment\n            project represents a significant amount of work for\n            procurement, contract administration, and disbursement. 4)\n            Government counterpart contribution should be in cash,\n            rather than in kind, and based on a realistic assessment of\n            the Government willingness and ability to pay for studies\n            and similar activities. 5) The design of the project should\n            include a realistic assessment of demand for financing for\n            studies, preferably with the identification of studies and\n            training to be financed during the first year of project implementation."}, "docdt": "1998-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
