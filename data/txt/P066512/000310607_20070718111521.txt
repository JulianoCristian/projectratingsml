1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)
While Poland has made extensive progress in reforming its economy over the past 10-15
years, considerable structural rigidities remain, especially in the large capital intensive
industries. These industries with large employment and high losses are a drag on the
economy that must be addressed if Poland is to become a competitive member of the
European Union. Coal remains the largest of these industries. Annual losses for the coal
sector peaked at nearly US$1 billion in 1997. In 1998, the Government introduced a
five-year (1998-2002) Hard Coal Sector Reform Program to address the sector's
problems. The Program was successful in reducing employment from 248,000 at the
beginning of 1998 to about 140,000 at the end of 2002. (By comparison, the steel
industry, which suffered from similar problems, employed less than 40,000.) The sector
comprises of three mining holding companies - Kompania Weglowa (KW) with about;
the Katowki Holding Weglowy (KHW); and the Jastrzebska Coking Coal Company
(JSW - plus three individual mines (Budryk, Bogdanka and Jaworzno. At the appraisal
stage of the project, better performance of the sector was constrained by a combination of
physical factors, namely surplus employment and excess production capacity and
financial factors, including working cash shortages, poor cash flow and unmanageable
debt overhang. The situation was most severe at KW which was formed in 2003 by
merging the five weakest mining companies and as such inherited most of the excess
production capacity and surplus employment in the industry.

The hard coal sector has great political as well as social sensitivity, and is seen by many
in the country as one of the key indicators of the government's commitment to implement
structural changes in the economy. The Government had requested and the Bank had
provided two SECALs (Hard Coal SECAL l for US$ 300 million in June 1999 and Hard
Coal SECAL2 for US$ l00 million in August 2001) to support implementation of the
1998-2002 Hard Coal Reform Program. But, experience in other countries indicates that
"no quick fix" is possible and the Government recognized that it would require a further
multi-year effort to continue and deepen the reforms. The government had prepared and
was starting to implement a second Program of Restructuring of the Hard Coal Mining
Sector for 2003-2006 (2003-2006 Program). The Program was a multi-faceted approach
­ covering employment restructuring, capacity liquidation and financial restructuring, as
well as profound changes in the structure and management of the industry. In 2003, the
Government requested the Bank for further significant financial support and technical
advice to support employment restructuring aspects of the next phase of sector
restructuring from 2003-2006 and the Bank responded with the US$200 million Hard
Coal Social Mitigation loan which was approved March 30, 2004.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
Further support for coal sector reform was specifically identified in the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Poland under the pillar of enhancing private sector-led


                                              1

growth and employment creation through enterprise restructuring.        The overarching
Project Development Objective was to provide assistance to the borrower to reform the
hard coal industry to become a profitable sector that contributes to economic growth and
improved living standards in support of Poland's economic integration into the European
Union. The specific objective of the Project was to improve the efficiency of the hard
coal industry by supporting the implementation of the year 2004 of employment
restructuring of the 2003-2006 Hard Coal Sector Restructuring Program and on-going
commitments from the 1998-2002 Hard Coal Sector Reform Program. There are three
"pillars" of higher level objectives, namely (a) employment restructuring; to include
participating employers to hire surface workers and eligible mine workers to take
severance packages resulting in an employment reduction of 14,100 underground
workers and 8,600 surface workers from 2004-2006, (b) improving efficiency and
financial performance; KW, KHW and JSW mining companies improving efficiency,
adhering to a hard budget constraint and improving their balance sheets; and (c)
sustaining the reforms:    KHW and JSW mining companies taking steps towards
privatization.

The key indicators included (see Annex 2 for results):

Employment-related:
· Level of employment industry (surface, underground and total)
· Number of underground miners taking severance packages
· Number of surface workers accepting the package and leaving the industry.

Financial Performance:
· average labor cost per ton of coal produced
· average cost per ton of coal produced
· Actual/Due payments of financial obligations to government
· Short term receivables
· Short term payable
· profit/loss on overall business

Privatization

· Submission to the Bank of a report as to the readiness for privatization of KHW and
    JSW


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
There were no revisions to the Project Development Objectives or the key indicators.
However, the target numbers of workers to take up departure incentives was reduced. The
2003 ­ 2006 Program is the second phase of the reform of the coal sector. The Program,
as originally approved by the Council of Ministers on November 21, 2002 called for 7
mine closures and layoffs of 30,000 workers. But this was strongly opposed by the
workers and their trade unions because, unlike the 1998-2002 Program, it involved


                                           2

involuntary layoffs and had no special income support measures for mining industry
workers losing their jobs. This was at a time when unemployment has risen to around
20% both in Silesia and nationally (from about 6% when the reforms started in 1999). In
the face of strong protests, the Government substantially modified the Program and a new
2003-2006 Program was adopted by the Council of Ministers on January 28, 2003 with
voluntary (instead of involuntary) layoffs; a target of 27,200 (not 30,000) layoffs; a target
of four (not seven) mine closures and with income support measures for about 14,100
underground workers; and job creation incentives to create 8,600 jobs outside the coal
industry for surface workers leaving the coal industry.         These estimates were re-
confirmed during project preparation in late 2003, appraisal in January 2004 and
negotiations in February 2004. However, further modifications to the Program were
introduced in a revision that led to the 2004-2006 Program that was approved by the
Council of Ministers on April 27, 2004. These modifications, which took into account
rapidly increasing export coal prices, provided for a Base Scenario (if prices and profits
declined) and an Alternative Scenario, (based on prices being sustained at the new
higher levels) with targets shown in the table below.

Alternative Scenario

The primary reason for these changes was that the financial position of the mining
companies was improving after a sharp increase in the export price of coal in early 2004
(see Table 4, page 6). As a result, more workers were needed to maintain production
which had become shifted from loss making to profit making and fewer workers were
interested in taking the voluntary packages to retire early or leave the industry for
employment in other sectors. At the same time, after the changes in the pension law
allowing the miners to retire at 45 years old and 20 years of underground work, the
natural attrition was much greater that projected.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)
The main beneficiaries were those workers, as well as the families of the workers, who
participated in the early retirement and retraining incentives. The mining companies and
the owner (the Government of Poland) also benefited in that the reduction in labor costs
improved the financial position of the mining companies.

There were no revisions.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The project consists of three components:
    A. Severance Payments for underground workers under the 2003-2006 Program;
    B. Severance Payments, Reskilling and Reemployment for surface workers under the
        2003-2006 Program, including:
            a. Severance payments to surface workers;
            b. Reemployment incentives payments to employers hiring eligible
               redundant ex-surface workers;
    C. Severance payments commitments from previously implemented Miners' Social
        Packages under the 1998-2002 Program.

Component A provided support for Year 2004 costs for severance packages for
underground workers under the 2003-2006 Program to enable underground workers to
leave the industry with pre-retirement benefits of 75% of their wages until eligible for a
miners pension. A similar package was offered under the 1998-2002 Program and was
well received and widely accepted by the underground workers at that time.             The
estimated cost of Component A from 2003-2006 was 1.13 PLN billion ( about US$0.3
billion). The Loan allocation for this component was US$ 70.0 million approx (56.0
million Euro).

Component B provided support for Year 2004 costs for job creation incentives
(activating and adaptation instruments) for surface workers under the 2003-2006 Program
which provided them the opportunity to find assured alternative employment at a salary
of 75% of their present wages.     The estimated cost of Component A from 2003-2006
was 0.6 PLN billion ( about US$0.16 billion). The Loan allocation for this component
was US$ 10.0 million approx. (8 million Euro).

Component C provided support for Year 2004 costs for ongoing commitments for
severance payments from previously implemented Miners' Social Packages that were
provided under the 1998-2002 Program. These packages were provided for up to five
years. Thus, packages taken up in 2002 would require funding through 2007. The take
up of packages was one of the most successful aspects of the Year 1998-2002 Program
and was arguably the single most important factor in the industry moving from losses
approaching US1 billion in 1998 to a small profit on operations in 2001. The cost of the


                                             4

1998-2002 Program packages was estimated to be about US$2.35 billion over the period
1998-2007. US$1.5 billion was expended from 1998-2002 and the balance of US$0.85
billion (about 3.25 PLN billion) was being expended from 2003-2006. The Loan
allocation for this component was US$ 100.0 million approx. (80.0 million Euro).

1.6 Revised Components
No revisions were made.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

Table 2 below illustrates the planned and actual funding allocation. During the project
implementation two major reallocations were made. The main changes are that the
unused funds for surface workers (Component B) and the unallocated funds were
reallocated to fund the costs of new packages for underground workers (Component A)
and to fund the costs of 1998-2002 underground worker packages (Component C). The
rationale for these changes are presented in more detail in sections below.

The original closing date was December 31, 2005, but, due to changed economic
conditions in the sector the Borrower requested extending the closing date to December
31, 2006 to be able to implement the project. The Bank adhered to the Borrower's request.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)
The project design included the following features reflecting previous operations and
good practices:
    · it directly supported further restructuring of the industry using new employment
        restructuring measures;
    · it supported implementation of a broader comprehensive reform program
        designed to lead to sector sustainability through privatization;
    · it addressed the difficulties for displaced workers in finding new employment;



                                                5

    · it utilized the local labor services system including labor re-deployment,
        retraining, and small business assistance;
    · it included fast acting and targeted income support with demand driven labor re-
        deployment programs;
    · it was implemented through capable implementing agencies;
    · it was part of a multi-year program that was implemented by the mining
        companies' Human Resource Departments, the Mine Labor Agency (GAP), and
        the local labor offices of the Silesia Region; and
    · it was supported by a companion growth strategy for Silesia that facilitated
        growth of jobs by providing incentives to encourage and support new private
        sector investment and the creation of new private sector jobs.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)
Changes in the international coal market from 2004-2006 have had a profound impact on
implementation of the Restructuring Program. International coal prices rose strongly
from late 2003 to mid 2004 with Australian coal export prices (one of the international
coal "marker prices") more than doubling from USD27.5 per ton in October 2003 to
USD56.4 per ton in May 2004 and annual average Australian coal export prices rising
from USD26.1 per ton in 2003 to USD53.0 in 2004. Australian coal export prices
averaged USD47.6 per ton in 2005 and USD49.1 for 2006.                    The changes in the
international coal market reflect in large part increased demand for energy resources from
developing countries especially China and India and shift of energy demand away from
oil and gas, because of both high oil prices and concerns about possible shortages of oil
and gas supplies. The changes in international coal prices resulted in annual average
export prices for Polish hard coal mining companies increasing from 90 PLN per ton and
175 PLN per ton for steam coal and coking coal respectively in 2003 to 157 PLN per ton
and 313 PLN per ton in 2006 respectively.

These very substantial energy market changes were not anticipated neither by the Bank,
the Government nor any of the recognized energy and coal market forecasters at the time
of project preparation in 2003. However, the potential impact of the higher prices was
recognized by the Government as it finalized its 2004-2006 Coal Restructuring Program
in the April 2004 ­ hence the Base Scenario and the Alternative Scenario.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The Agency for Industrial Development (ARP) has the primary responsibility for
compiling data regarding employment, production and industry financial performance.
ARP produced comprehensive monthly reports for the Government which were also
provided to the Bank. The required monitoring information was submitted to the Bank
on a timely basis. Information received indicated that most workers were able to leave the
industry successfully because they left on a voluntary basis after reaching retirement or
with bridging payments to cover the period until they were eligible for pension payments.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)
Not applicable

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)
In December 2006 the Polish Parliament extended regulations guaranteeing continuation
of payment of carry-over costs from the 1998-2002 and 2003-2006 reforms. As of May
2007, the Government is at the final stage of consultation process with its Strategy for the
Hard Coal Sector for the period 2007-2015, which will help ensure completion of the
sector reforms.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)
The Project Development Objectives remained relevant and were government priorities
throughout the life of the program.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

The overarching Project Development Objective was to provide assistance to the
borrower to reform the hard coal industry to become a profitable sector that contributes to
economic growth and improved living standards in support of Poland's economic
integration into the European Union.



                                                 7

This objective has been met. In less than 20 years, the coal industry has gone from
employing roughly 400,000 people to around 120,000 in 2007.                     This project has
supported further progress on employment restructuring in the period 2003-2006 which
has helped reduce costs and contributed to the overall positive financial performance of
the sector.

1. Employment Pillar ­ Higher Level Objective: Downsize employment and redeploy
surplus labor using socially acceptable measures.

Project Development Objectives: Eligible participating underground mine workers to
leave the industry voluntarily and retire with mining industry pensions. Participating
employers hire surface workers.

The Project Development Objective concerning underground workers was met but at a
somewhat lower level than the level that was originally envisaged in the PAD and in the
subsequent revised targets submitted by the Government. The Project Development
Objective for surface workers was not met. While there were a considerable number of
employers interested in hiring surface workers, there was virtually no interest on behalf
of surface workers to accept the activating and adaptation instruments so participating
employers were not able to hire former surface miners.

2. Efficiency and Financial Pillar ­ Higher Level Objective: Improve efficiency and
achieve improved financial performance so that the sector is financially solvent.

Project Development Objective: KW, KHW, and JSW improve labor productivity,
adhere to a hard budget constraint and improve their respective balance sheets.

The Project Development Objective concerning labor productivity and financial
performance was fully met.

3. Sustainability Pillar ­ Higher Level Objective: Open the sector to full competition
and sustain the reform.

Project Development Objective: KHW and JSW take appropriate steps toward
privatization.

This project development objective has been partially met. While a pre-privatization
report was received for each company and the companies are in a much better position to
be privatized, only limited progress has been made with respect to adopting and
implementing a specific privatization strategy.


3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)




                                             8

The project had significant economic and financial benefits, although lower than
estimated at the appraisal. The main reason for lower performance was the smaller scale
of employment reduction that was anticipated at the appraisal. Due to the program
implementation mining companies benefited financially from reducing the number of
employees and the regional and national economy benefited from redeploying some of
workers in other sector, where their productivity is much higher than it was in the mining
sector.
                                 At Appraisal                     At completion
Financial NPV (10%)              US$ 857 million                  US$ 280 million

EIRR                             15%                              14%

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Overall Outcome is rated moderately satisfactory. The project development
objectives stayed relevant throughout the life of the project and industry employment was
substantially reduced, efficiency increased, financial performance improved and steps
taken towards privatization. Funds provided under the project were used efficiently and
brought substantial economic and financial benefits. However, employment reduction
was below the target, financial sustainability of the largest coal company (Kompania
Weglowa) is still at risk and none of the privatization transactions has been completed.
Hence the project us rated as moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

         Poverty Aspects Representatives from civil society have indicated that there are
pockets of severe poverty in some coal mining towns where several mining operations
have ceased. Certain communities, such as those in the Bytom area, have much higher
unemployment levels than the regional average and are characterized by social problems
including social exclusion, drug and alcohol addiction and family violence.          These
concerns are being partly address by both municipal governments and women's groups
(see next session) but new government initiatives are needed.

         (ii) Gender Aspects In order to mitigate the social affects of the restructuring of
the coal industry for the community as a whole, the Bank consulted local community
groups which led to a 2004 Women in Mining Conference with women's groups on the
impact of the coal restructuring program on the local communities. As an outcome of the
conference, the Bank helped provide Trust Funds to fund the training of 24 women
community leaders to help improve the functioning of non-profit organizations to provide
support and assistance to the neediest groups in communities most affected by mine
closures. Sometimes referred to as the "third sector" (as opposed to either Government


                                                9

or the private commercial sector), these non profits, which rely heavily on volunteers, are
crucial to the creation of a fully functioning civil society. Restructuring of an industry
can lead to a high unemployment "knock on" effect in terms of job losses in industries
supplying mining and in industries such as retail businesses which benefit from the
consumer expenditures of mining industry employees. Unemployment and financial
stress can lead to alcoholism and substance abuse and to family violence. The women
leaders who participated in the training were subsequently able to mobilize substantial
funding (including from domestic and from European Commission sources) to open
Women's Centers which today provide community services, complementing those
provided by the Government, such as shelters for women and children who are victims of
family violence, legal counseling for those who cannot pay for a lawyer, food and shelter
for the destitute and substance abuse counseling. All of the representatives of the non
profits met during the visit spoke highly of the leadership training they received without
which the Women's Centers would not have been conceived.

        Social Development With respect to the social dimension, the negative impacts
have been well mitigated for many of those who left the industry. For the most part,
those who left the industry went on an early retirement scheme. While there overall
incomes may have decreased, they are no longer subject to the harsh working conditions
associated with underground mining With regard to job creation to reduce
unemployment and poverty, a particularly successful program is being delivered by the
Silesian Fund, which provides credits to municipalities and to small, medium and micro
enterprises. This program has created more than 1,800 new jobs and helped to maintain
14,000 other jobs. The incentives to the private sector were well designed because of a
built in multiplier affect. The receiving company is required to provide 25% of project
costs, a commercial Bank is required to provide at least 50% of project costs (by way of a
loan to the company) and the Government, through the Silesian Fund, provides an
additional 25% by way of a loan, which is forgivable if the job created exists for at least 2
years. The end result is that the 25 million Euros invested in this manner has led to a
total investment in the region of 100 million Euros. This is a clear indication that the
Government has put in place an appropriate array of economic redevelopment measures
to create opportunities for those displaced from the mining industry.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The most significant institutional change was the strengthening of non profit
organizations to deliver support to needy communities. Other important improvement
include strengthening the capacity of the mining companies managements as they have
progressively become more commercially oriented, better monitoring capacity through
the activities of ARP and improved oversight of the industry by the Ministry of Economy.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The Women in Mining Program as presented in (Section 3.5 (a) (ii)).

The risk to sustaining the three main project development outcomes is assessed as
follows:


(i)      Reducing Employment: rating - Minimal /no risk

For the most part the employment restructuring is largely complete. KHW and JSW no
longer have a surplus of underground workers (and are in fact hiring new underground
workers to replace those who are leaving). Only Kompania Weglowa has a surplus of
surface workers which will come into balance through natural attrition over the next
several years. There is considered to be no risk that the companies will (a) re-hire
workers who have left the industry; or (b) hire unneeded workers.

(ii)     Improving       Efficiency       and      Financial   Performance:           rating:
Moderate/Substantial risk

There is considered to be moderate to significant risk that industry efficiency will decline.
While the number of workers may be appropriate for the level of production (at least by
Polish standards) this does not mean that the level of production is appropriate.
Decisions concerning the amount of coal being mined are based more on concerns over
job losses as opposed to sound economic principles. Kompania Weglowa, for example,
is still exporting some coal at a price which is well below the cost of production. There is
also considered to be moderate risk that KHW and JSW will see return to financial losses.
But in the case of Kompania Weglowa (KW) recent reductions to the price of coal have
led KW to a loss making position in 2006 (52 million PLN) and KW's financial position
is expected to deteriorate further in 2007 if coal prices continue to decline. Unless steps
are taken to reduce high cost capacity and place KW on a sound financial footing, KW
may be unable to return to profitability which will put at risk its ability to keep to a hard
budget constraint, in which case containing losses will ultimately be borne by the
Government and put further strain on the already high budgetary deficit. Thus, there is a
substantial risk that KW (which accounts for 60% of industry production) will be loss
making and viable to meet a hard budget constraint.

    (iii)   Privatization: rating: Substantial risk

KHW and JSW have taken considerable steps towards privatization in line with the
project PDO. However, it was made clear during meetings with representatives from
civil society that there is significant opposition to privatization. There is concern over
energy security, safety and migration of profits. It is clear that if the government wants



                                                11

the support of the general public, it will have to embark on a public education program to
exude the benefits of privatization (increased investment and the long term sustainability
of employment, better corporate governance, share ownership and possible profit sharing).
Thus, while the Government has expressed its support for privatization, concrete steps
have yet to be taken and there remains significant risk that the Government will further
delay implementation of privatization for the companies that are ready for privatization,
in particular, KHW, JSW and Weglokoks. .


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: satisfactory

The Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated satisfactory. The Bank
responded quickly to the request of the Government and took a pragmatic approach to the
project. In preparing the project, the Bank conducted in depth discussions with
representatives of the Government and mining companies to confirm assumptions of the
Reform targets as well as their commitment to implementing the Reform Program.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: satisfactory

Overall supervision is rated satisfactory. The Bank team conducted supervision visits at
least once per quarter including regular reviews of sector performance. The Bank also
conducted in depth follow up visits to monitor progress in implementing mining
companies' business plan. The Bank worked very closely and cooperatively with all its
counterparts in four ministries, three mining companies and the Agency for Industrial
Development (ARP). The Bank team designed a quarterly "scorecard" which was
completed by ARP and recorded performance on all aspects of the Program. The
scorecard allowed ready monitoring of employment, production, sales, financial and
environmental performance. It was very effective in focusing the discussion with all
counterparts on key performance issues and in analyzing actual to planned performance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: satisfactory

The Banks performance was rated satisfactory by representatives of mining company
management, government officials and representatives of civil society. The Bank's
performance in engaging with civil society groups, arranging funding for the women's
leadership training and staying engaged to support the activities of the women's groups
and women's centers was highly commended by the women's groups. There were also



                                                12

positive comments from mining company and government representatives regarding the
Bank's contribution for providing understanding the international perspective and helping
policy makers confront difficult issues. World Bank reporting requirements were not
considered onerous and were useful for general management purposes.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: moderately satisfactory

The borrower's performance was highly satisfactory in terms of implementing the
program with payments being made to eligible people at the right time for the correct
amount and with fully satisfactory reporting, monitoring and oversight. Reporting to the
Bank on loan disbursements and responding to suggested courses of action such as
undertaking the Optimal Employment Study in response to the lack of take up of
packages by surface workers was also satisfactory.            However, economic factors
associated with the rise in the price of coal and improved profitability affected the
Government's actions and it must also be recognized that the planned reductions of the
labor force were not achieved, Kompania Weglowa remains vulnerable to coal price
declines and privatization has not moved forward as fast as expected.

Taking into account all the above factors, the Government's performance is considered
moderately satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: satisfactory
Ministry of Economy and           Funds for severance payments were transferred timely
Labor                             and correctly. Program monitoring by ARP was
                                  satisfactorily. Required reports were provided in due
                                  time to the Bank.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Experience in other countries including industrialized countries such as United Kingdom
and transition economies such as Russian Federation, Ukraine and Romania indicate that
the restructuring, downsizing and privatizing a large State-owned coal mining industry is
an extremely difficult task that takes many years to accomplish. Thus far the Borrower
has made substantial achievements in terms of sector reform and Borrower performance
is considered moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Women's Groups can play a key role in social mitigation activities when given support.
The most unexpected lesson learned is that given modest support and encouragement,
women's non-profit organization can play a significant role in addressing the individual,
family and community-related impacts of large scale industry downsizing. The role of


                                             13

women's group was not envisaged in the original project design, and they have come to
play a very significant role in both helping to mitigate the negative impacts of the
industry downsizing (through help for the needy, counseling, providing shelter and
helping addressing issues of domestic violence, alcohol and substance abuse) and provide
empowerment and support to women seeking employment or even creating their own
businesses (through help for resume writing, job applications, identifying training courses,
accessing micro credits, and preparing small business plans).

Community Impacts Macro economic indicators at the regional level (such as changes
to GNP and levels of unemployment) may mask underlying problems in specific
communities. While the economic conditions in the Silesia region are more positive than
in Poland as a whole, there are still pockets of poverty in those areas where mining
operations have ceased which urgently need greater attention.

Economic Development Program             Government sponsored economic development
programs can help off-set the negative effects of industrial restructuring.

Engaging with Workers Long-term planning and early communication with affected
employees may mitigate hostility toward restructuring. If workers and trade unions are
given significant notice, say two years, that a mine is to close and if they are informed of
the specific reasons (e.g. seam is exhausted), they are fare more likely to accept the
inevitable and begin planning and adapting to the new reality.

Planning for and Responding to Different Scenarios          Taking into account different
scenarios of future primary energy prices will help organizations better plan for the future.
The borrower submitted two restructuring scenarios taking into account future coal
prices: high price scenario and low price scenario.      While the price of coal was even
higher that was envisaged in the higher scenario, the scenario planning exercise was a
useful tool in terms of predicting and shaping the possible level of restructuring needed.

Employment Restructuring Instruments         Governments should carefully monitor the
impact and relevance of departure incentives and be prepared to modify the design of
such incentives when warranted. Efforts should be made to avoid the paradox where
workers are accepting departure incentives from one company while at the same time
new employees are being hired by other companies.

Effectiveness of Voluntary Employment Restructuring Programs                   Without the
termination of an industrial activity (in this case a particular mine), voluntary departure
programs are unlikely to work, particularly when the employees present job pays more
than similar positions in the general labor market.

Privatization Workers, trade unions and the community at large must be made aware of
the benefits of privatization before they are likely to endorse it. A public education and
education program focusing on the benefits (such as share ownership and possible profit
sharing, improved transparency, increased investment and better corporate governance).

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

(i)    Achievement of PDOs

The Project Development Objective concerning underground workers was met but at a
somewhat lower level than the level that was originally envisaged in the PAD and in the
subsequent revised targets submitted by the Government. The Project Development
Objective for surface workers was not met. 5,373 underground workers and 67 surface
workers left the industry from 2004-2006 compared with targets for reduction of
employment of 14,100 underground workers and 8,600 surface workers in the project
document and 8,000 and 4,000 respectively in the Alternative Case. As a result, "other"
retirements and new departures were 11,702 for the period ­ compared with an estimate
of 9,500 in the Alternative Program and 4,500 for the project. Thus, the total decline in
industry employment was 17,142 (actual) compared with an estimated 21,500 under the
Alternative Program and 27,200 under the project. While the number of workers taking
packages was much lower that anticipated, many underground workers continued
working until reaching retirement age instead of taking pre-retirement benefits and some
surface workers left for other employment without using the activating and adaptation
instruments.

This Project Development Objective regarding improving efficiency and financial
performance was fully met. With respect to labor productivity from December 31, 2003
to December 31, 2006, KW improved from 3.45 tons per man shift to 3.8 tons, KHW
improved from 3.58 to 3.71 and JSW from 3.54 to 3.55. All three companies adhered to
a hard budget restraint in that current financial obligations have been fully paid to ZUS,
local and national governments and environmental funds. All three companies became
profitable in 2004. JSW and KHW should be able to sustain their profitability but KW
continues to operate same high cost mines and is returning to a loss making position in
2007 due to declining coal prices and cost rigidities. All three companies were profitable
from 2004-2006 achieved an improvement in their balance sheet and increased
shareholder equity.




                                            17

This project development objective that KHW and JSW take appropriate steps towards
privatization has been partially met. While the companies are in a much better position to
be privatized in that most of the employment downsizing has been completed, limited
progress has been made with respect to adopting and implementing a specific
privatization strategy. During project implementation, the Ministries of Economy and of
State Treasury, developed a policy to privatize the industry and the Strategy for the
Privatization of the Hard Coal Mining Sector was adopted by the Council of Ministers in
December 2004. Under this strategy privatizations advisors were appointed for KHW,
JSW and Weglokoks (the state owned coal export marketing company), pre-privatization,
(i.e. readiness for privatization) analyses were prepared, and eventually steps to privatize
KHW were taken. This however, came at the time of general elections, and the incoming
government put the process on hold. Thus, the good situation on the coal market was not
used to complete the privatization of KHW or to offer JSW or Weglokoks for
privatization with the result that access to capital remains a key issue for the industry.

While privatization has not yet occurred, very positive steps have been taken in this
regard in that much of the legal and financial work needed to prepare both companies for
privatization has been completed and KHW earned good profits in 2005 and 2006 and
JSW substantial profits in 2005 and good profits in 2006. The management of both
companies indicated that they are prepared to move forward with privatization but that
the decision is with the owner, the Government of Poland. The Ministry of Economy has
also indicated that it is now prepared to consider moving forward with privatization for
both companies and the draft 2007-2015 Plan for the Hard Coal Mining Sector also
makes reference to privatization through a partial equity sale (IPO) and a listing on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange sometime in 2008. But the hard coal trade unions remain
concerned over potential job losses and the public is concerned about transfer of profits
outside of the country if the companies are offered for privatization to foreign investors.
Privatization by listing on the stock exchange would resolve these concerns.

(ii)    Outputs by Components

Component A- Severance Payments for underground workers under the 2003-2006
Program

    During the period 2004-2006 5,372 underground workers took-up pre-retirement
    packages which were co-financed under this component.

At the time of appraisal, the Team was informed that the mining companies had surveyed
the roughly 15,000 eligible underground workers and had found that more than 6,000
underground workers had already expressed interest in accepting the underground
workers package which was essentially a pre-retirement package. The initial interest was
considered a positive indication and it was expected that the uptake would increase from
that level once the packages were being offered and as more workers became eligible
according to their retirement dates. The lower number of workers taking miners leave
packages is largely counterbalanced by higher natural attrition rates than planned and the
fact that the mining companies needed the workers to maintain production which made



                                              18

economic sense given the sharp rise in the price of coal that occurred in 2004 and 2005.
However, this has slowed the downsizing of high cost capacity at Kompania Weglowa
which is vulnerable to losses if coal prices decline.

    ·   Component B-Severance Payments, Reskilling and Reemployment for surface
        workers under the 2003-2006 Program

    During the period 2004-2006 67 surface workers took-up reskilling packages which
    were co-financed under this component and were later on reemployed.

At the time of appraisal, the Team was also informed that the mining companies had
surveyed the majority of the roughly 32,000 surface workers in the industry and that only
a few of the workers had then expressed interest in accepting the surface workers package
­ which consisted of either (a) activating instruments - severance payments to workers
voluntarily leaving the industry; or (b) adaptation instruments - incentives to employers
to hire surface workers leaving the industry. The companies advised the Bank team that a
major reason for the lack of apparent interest in the surface packages was that the details
of the scheme were still being finalized in early 2004 and thus were not well known. The
mining companies also considered that there would be much more interest once the exact
details were available to surface workers and their families and that some initial
successes would also serve as a catalyst to convince others that they too could retrain and
adjust to employment out of the mining industry.

Based on this information, the Bank team considered that it was then too early to
conclude that the surface workers component would not reach its target level. The Bank
team considered three options: (i) to delay processing the project until the situation was
clearer; (ii) to go ahead with the project but with the lower targets than those provided by
the mining companies and reduce the loan size; or (iii) to go ahead with the project with
the targets provided by the mining companies and leave the loan size unchanged. In
considering the first option, the team decided not to delay the project since it was
urgently wanted by the Government to fund expenditures included in the governments
2004 budget and allowing for scheduling steps the project would only be approved at
earliest in March 2004 and available for disbursement in April or May 2004.               In
considering the second option, the team was unsure as to how or how much to adjust the
targets and was cognizant that since the size of the surface worker component was only
5% of the loan (USD10 million) any adjustment would result in a largely inconsequential
(1-2%) change in the loan size. Thus, rather than attempting to find a basis for adjusting
the target and the agreed size of the surface worker component, the team determined to
take the third option and process the loan as appraised.

In light of the deliberations over the targets with their counterparts, the Bank team
considered that the take up of surface worker packages was the main risk facing the
project at the time of appraisal. The Bank team agreed with the Government that the
initial lack of interest in the surface workers package was a risk that needed to be
carefully monitored and addressed during project implementation.            As a result, the
Project Appraisal Document (PAD) identified the uptake of the surface workers packages



                                             19

as the main risk for the project and stated that the risk of low uptake would be mitigated
by the Ministry of Economy (MoE) closely monitoring uptake of the packages and, if
necessary, consider re-designing the packages to improve the uptake if the expected
number of acceptances was not being achieved by the end of 3rd quarter 2004.

The PAD also noted three other potentially controversial aspects. First, the project
supported surface employment restructuring at a time of high unemployment ­ which was
mitigated because the Program was voluntary and incentives were being provided to
employers outside the coal industry to hire the excess surface workers. Second, there was
a concern that if mine worker's unrest over mine closures was unresolved, program
implementation could be stalled. This was mitigated by Government actively engaging
with trade unions, by the generous social mitigation packages, and by the Government
public information campaign. Third, a key risk that was identified when the program was
being designed was the possibility of fraudulent payments being made (e.g. ex-
underground workers may return to the industry and receive a second package). This was
mitigated by procedures put in place by the mining companies as well as the monitoring
processes employed by ARP. Both proved to be fully adequate and there have been no
cases of fraudulent payments.

As project implementation started in early summer 2004, it became evident that the
unexpected changes in the coal market not only caused higher production than anticipated
under the Program, but there was no improvement in the interest on the part of surface
workers to take the voluntary packages to leave higher paying coal industry jobs and take
lower paying jobs outside the industry. Thus, there has been virtually no success in the
implementation of the activating and adaptation instruments for surface workers.

During project implementation, as the very low take-up of packages became apparent, the
Team discussed with the Government options to address this issue, including the need to
reconsider the design of these incentives. In response, the Government carried out in
2005 an Employment Optimization Study (using Trust Funds arranged by the Bank) that
looked at the optimal level of employment for each company to improve their efficiency
and ways to improve the take up of packages by the surface workers. KW also conducted
a survey of 2,300 surface workers to determine to what extent a modified package
consisting of a lump-sum of 40,000 PLN would encourage workers to voluntarily leave.
The survey indicated that only 43 workers or less than 2% would accept such an offer.
The survey indicates that the workers have a very strong attachment to their jobs and that
a much more substantial payment would have been required to entice people to leave
voluntarily.

The Employment Optimization Study also included a careful reassessment of the number
of excess surface workers talking into account the higher levels of production and the
actual number of surface workers retiring from the industry. In the case of KW, the
number of excess surface workers was estimated at about 1,800 ­ considerably less than
the estimates provided for the PAD. This latest estimate is considered more accurate ­
thus KW has a problem of excess surface workers that needs to be addressed but this
level is much lower than previously estimated. While this issue will slowly resolve itself



                                             20

through natural attrition, primarily retirement, it could take several years before optimal
employment levels are reached. The situation at KHW is much better in that in early
2007 the company estimated that it has only 50 excess surface workers. KHW believes
that by shifting some of the surplus workers to processing plants and through natural
attrition, an optimal employment level will be achieved sometime in 2007.              The
management of JSW indicate that they have already achieved optimal employment levels
of surface workers. They will continue to reduce the number of surface workers in a
gradual way as they retire (e.g. janitorial services) and plan to fulfill such services
through contractors.

The Team heard consistent explanations for the lack of interest from surface workers.
The most significant reason was that the surface workers generally do not believe that
mining companies will proceed with the planned reductions, particularly as the mining
companies, at least for now, are profitable. Another reason is that mine closures did not
proceed as planned. With regard to the availability of job opportunities, the Team was
informed by GAP throughout the implementation of the project that there had been
considerable interest on behalf of employers to participate in these active interventions
with requests to hire more than 1,000 former surface workers. This indicates that GAP
did an adequate job in promoting the Program, despite the fact that they provided these
employment counseling and job matching services with very limited resources.

The only other option would have been for the Government to shift from a voluntary to
an involuntary approach or forced lay-offs. However, the Government was not prepared
to take such an action given the very high level of unemployment (the largest in the EU).
None of the stakeholders met during the regular implementation review visits expressed
any support for an involuntary approach. The high unemployment rate coupled with the
lack of public support plays a legitimate fear of social unrest seemed to influence the
Government not to move in this direction.

    During the period 2004-2006 the state budget carried-over costs of the 5-years Miners
    Social Packages which were taken up under 1998-2002 Program. These packages
    were co-financed under this component.

    Results of performance indicators are presented overleaf; in most cases specific
    targets were not set but the general aim was to see
            · employment, short term receivables and short term liabilities reduced;
            · unit production costs and unit labor costs contained; and
            · increases in profitability and payments of government liabilities

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)
Cost and benefits: Economic NPV= 150 million US$; EIRR= 14%
                       Financial NPV= 280 million US$; FIRR= 21%

Hard Coal Sector Reform: Estimates of benefits of the Project have been prepared based
solely on labor benefits.

The Employment Restructuring (the Project): The economic benefits of the employment
downsizing is based on the earnings of the redundant employees, with the assumption that at the
margin their productivity in the coal sector was zero (i.e. they left the industry without any
adverse effect on production) and that current jobs have positive benefits for Silesian and Polish
GDP. Economic benefits have commenced when the redundant workers started new jobs and they
are measured by the wages earned by the workers. Economic benefits terminate when the worker
retires. Thus, the commencement of economic benefits will be based on the time each worker
stays employed and the worker's new wage. The contribution to GDP will be greater to the extent
that the jobs filled by redeployed workers are higher productivity jobs.

The analysis of benefits coming from the project is based on a detailed profile of the sector's
workers - broken down by occupation (underground, surface), sex, age and education attained.
This, along with location-specific labor market, has allowed the application of factors specific to
these variables in estimating the probability of long-term redeployment, expected wage and
length of time until normal retirement age.


Main assumptions:
The analysis has been prepared based on the spreadsheet model which includes three sections: 1)
Assumptions and analysis; 2) Pre-retirement programs (underground workers); 3) Re-
employment (surface workers).

The assumptions below (such as loading on salary for ZUS and salary growth rate) apply to all
sheets. The income tax rate applies to the economic analysis because this amount is immediately
deducted from benefits paid and is thus a reduction in the economic cost (but not the financial).
The assumptions regarding percent of employees finding interim jobs, interim wages and pre-
retirement period are based on information from the mining companies used in the pre-retirement
portfolio for underground workers calculations, GAP and local labor office. The re-employment
calculations include: the number of surface workers that took up the package, percent of current
wage earned by re-employed workers.

Following are the assumptions used in the base case:

Basic Assumptions or Variables:
Loading on salary for ZUS                                                                    22%

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

As part of the ICR process, a meeting was held in Katowice in November 2006 with
community representatives to solicit their views on the Government's social mitigation
efforts concerning restructuring of the coal mining industry. The meeting included
representatives of academia, trade unions, NGOs, and volunteer groups affected workers,
small business, and representatives of the local police force. Some of the main points
that came out of this meeting are as follows:

Community Impacts

     · Even though the packages available to those in the mining industry are more
          lucrative than those available for redundant workers in other sectors (under Polish
          Labor Law), most participants thought that the higher amounts paid to local
          workers were still fair particularly when taking into account the harsh working
          conditions and mortality rate.
     · The Silesia region has seen not only the downsizing of the coal industry but also
          contraction in other heavy industries such as steel.                While the participants
          generally acknowledged that the Silesian economy now has above average
          economic growth and a strong labor market,1 there are still localized areas which
          are doing very poorly (particularly where mining operations have ceased). The
          belief is that the national and regional Governments are not doing enough in these
          very depressed areas which are not only characterized by high unemployment but
          also by serious social problems such as high crime, domestic violence, alcoholism
          and drug abuse.        Some of the participants expressed skepticism over the
          effectiveness of government sponsored training programs to reduce the high
          unemployment.

Hard Coal Employment Downsizing

     · There is a general negative attitude to the Governments earlier initiative that
          allowed underground workers to take a lump-sum pay out. The general point of
          view expressed in the meeting was that these lump-sum payments were generally
          not wisely invested and instead were used for consumption purposes and, in the
          worst cases, helped feed drug and alcohol habits that left the recipients in a more
          negative position.2



1Economic conditions in Silesia have clearly improved. The unemployment rate as of August 2006 is
13.7% down from 17.5% in May 2004. This compares well to the country as a whole where the
unemployment rate is 15.5%. The decrease in unemployment can partially attributed to labour migration to
the West which became possible after EU integration, but most importantly to high economic growth over
the last few years (4 to 5% of GDP annually and b) the significant amount of development funding from the
European Union and Central Government.

2The general negative bias against lump-sum payments may be without grounds aaccording to surveys
completed by the Central Mining Institute (GIG) which indicate that most workers were satisfied with their


                                                   27

    · None of the stakeholders met during the regular implementation review visits
         expressed any support for an involuntary approach to industry downsizing. The
         high unemployment rate coupled with the lack of public support plays a legitimate
         fear of social unrest seemed to influence the Government not to move in this
         direction.
    · The meeting participants voiced general support for early retirement schemes and
         appeared unconcerned when challenged about Poland's already steep pension
         obligations.
    · The participants considered the reasons for the lack of success of the surface
         worker incentives to be well known: higher price of coal, less interest in
         downsizing and the lower wages offered outside of the coal industry.

Privatization

    · The participants expressed a great deal of opposition to privatization of the coal
         sector because of concern over energy security, worker safety, migration of
         profits and job losses. The potential benefits of privatization were not well known
         to the meeting participants.




decision to leave the industry and that the funding had a positive impact in their transition out of the mining
industry.

       Dear Sir

       In response to your letters of May 18 and 23, 2007, I would like to kindly thank
you for the enclosed reports on utilization of World Bank Hard Coal Mine Closure Loan
and Hard Coal Social Mitigation Loan. At the same time, I'd like to inform you that we
have no comments to the presented documents and the conclusions presented therein with
respect to the operation of hard coal mining sector are to a large extent the same as the
Ministry of Economy's conclusions with respect to implementation of the restructuring
program, as presented below.

     In the years 2004 ­ 2006 the program basis for the hard coal sector restructuring
was the document entitled "Restructuring of the hard coal mining sector during the period
2004 - 2006 and Strategy for the period 2007 - 2010", adopted by the Council of
Ministers on April 27th 2004. In light of dramatic supply/demand changes observed on
the external markets in the second half of 2003, differing from annual, cyclical market
fluctuations, in the document two scenarios were envisaged for the planned restructuring
processes:

     ­ the target model, assuming capacity reduction by 14 million tons and
         employment reduction by 25,5 thousand persons by the end of 2006,




                                              29

    ­ the alternative scenario, assuming reduction of capacity by 7,8 million tons and
        employment reduction by 19,5 thousand people by the end of 2006,
        implemented in case of continued good conditions on the coal market and
        meeting specific economic conditions by the mining companies.

     Due to good conditions on the coal market, and above all, mining companies
meeting the conditions specified in the program mentioned above, throughout the entire
period the alternative model was implemented. Nonetheless, during the implementation
of the restructuring process, certain deviations from the assumptions of the model took
place.

In the years 2004 ­ 2006 in Polish coal mining sector production capacity was being
reduced by 6,6 million tons/year, so 1,2 million tons less than assumed under the
program for the alternative restructuring scenario which was being implemented. So,
the level of execution of program assumptions was 84,6 percent. Among the basic
reasons for incomplete implementation of program assumptions in scope of capacity
reduction one should include the following:
    1)   In the years 2004 ­ 2006 favorable trends were observed on the coal markets,
         namely coal prices higher than previously projected as well as increased
         demand for coal;
    2)   Average selling price for has increased, in terms of current prices, from 143,17
         PLN per ton in 2003 to 183,62 PLN per ton in 2006. In 2005, the average
         selling price of coal was 191,69 PLN per ton. In 2006, the price, in spite of
         decline by 4,2 percent compared to 2005 prices, was 4,6 percent higher than
         average unit cost of coal sold. It has ensured the mining companies' profit from
         selling coal;
    3)   Hard coal sales on domestic market in 2006, which was on the level of 77,7
         million tons was 3,7 million tons higher than previously projected demand for
         coal. Under such conditions, the amount of coal exported by mining
         companies in 2006 was limited to 15,8 million tons (1,7 million tons less than
         assumed under the program). Coal was exported directly from the companies,
         almost exclusively by land;
    4)   Profit from coal sales achieved in the years 2004 ­ 2006 was the main factor
         underlying positive financial results of hard coal mining sector and ensuring
         means for current full payment of liabilities to the state as well as payment of
         due installments of restructured liabilities.
         Net financial results of the hard coal mining sector in the years 2004 ­ 2006
         were as follows:
         -   2004           2 594,6 million PLN,
         -   2005           1 170,6 million PLN,
         -   2006             404,6 million PLN.

         In the years 2004 ­ 2006 the mining companies have fully paid their current
         liabilities to the state in total amount of 20 627,0 million PLN.
    5)   In 2006, in some of the hard coal mines, unfavorable geotechnical phenomena
         have occurred, such as forced the management of the companies to reduce the


                                             30

             active production front, which resulted in total reduction of hard coal sector's
             capacity by 1,2 million tons/year, of which Kompania Wglowa S.A.'s by
             0,8 million tons/year and Katowicki Holding Wglowy S.A.'s by 0,4 million
             tons/year.



     As of 31.12.2006, staffing level in hard coal sector was 119,3 thousand persons and
was 2,3 thousand persons higher than specified under the program assumptions
(according to assumptions, staffing level as of end of 2006 should have been 117,0
thousand persons). Main reasons for incomplete execution of program assumptions include:
        1)   no reduction in capacity,
        2)   higher than assumed level of hiring in the coal sector,
        3)   low usage of benefits for employees leaving the mines, introduced by the Act
             on coal sector restructuring of November 28th, 2003;

   Higher than expected level of hiring in the coal sector has resulted from the need to fill
up the mining crews, in particular those working underground, since their numbers have
declined as a result of employment restructuring implemented in 1998 ­ 2002 as well as
natural attrition (retirement).

     The assumptions for employment restructuring in the period 2004 ­ 2006 in scope of
downsizing of underground workers has been executed in 138,6 percent, and in scope of
surface workers ­ in 1,7 percent.

     Lower than initially assumed take-up level of benefits for persons leaving the mines,
as introduced by the Act on coal sector restructuring of November 28th, 2003, has
resulted form following reasons:
             -   due to a good financial and economic standing of mining companies,
                proposed activization-adaptation instruments for surface workers (stipends
                or re-training contract) were not attractive;
             -   work in the mines, as a result of improved financial standing of the mining
                companies, has given the sense of social security to mine employees and
                their families.

         Moreover, the principle of leaving on a voluntary basis has caused the improving
financial and economic standing of the mining companies, as confirmed by increase of
average monthly salary, to be a factor with a negative influence on decisions about
leaving the industry.


         One of the elements intended to lead to an effective financial restructuring in the
years 2004 ­ 2006 was continued process of increasing capital of Kompania Wglowa S.A.
Means from increased capital were meant to be used to repay liabilities inherited by KW
S.A., such as were not written off in 2003, including timely repayment of restructured
liabilities to ZUS. The amount of increased capital in the abovementioned period was
planned on the level of 900,0 million PLN. Out of this amount, as of 31.12.2006, capital
increase of a total value of 484 million PLN was implemented.


                                              31

     Basic objectives of restructuring, as specified in the program assumptions, was for
the mining companies to achieve stable profitability and satisfactory level of liquidity.
           In the years 2004 ­ 2006 results form sales of hard coal were as follows:

           ­ 2004                                     3 005,7 million PLN,
           ­ 2005                                     1 992,2 million PLN,
           ­ 2006                                       754,5 million PLN.

    In the years 2004 ­ 2006 the amount of coal sold has decreased from 98,7 million
tons in 2004 through 94,1 million PLN in 2005, down to 93,4 million tons in 2006.
Deteriorating results from sales were definitely under the impact of increase of unit cost
of coal sold, from 157,44 PLN per ton in 2004, 170,52 PLN per ton in 2005 up to 175,54
PLN per ton in 2006. Increase of unit cost in 2006 as compared to 2004 was on the level
of 11,5 percent, and the average price in same period has decreased by 2,3 percent. The
measure of financial situation is in particular the current liquidity ratio, measured as ratio
of working assets to short-term liabilities. In the years 2004 - 2005 this ratio has remained
on the level of 0,89, and in 2006 it was 0,79. Thus, in the years 2004 ­ 2006 the ratio
remained on a level far from the desirable, specified as 1,2 ­ 2.

      One of the objectives of program assumptions for the years 2004 ­ 2006 was to
privatize the mining companies and create a Coal and Coke Group with Jastrzbska
Spólka Wglowa S.A. as dominating entity. Scope of privatization and transformation
was defined in the "Hard Coal Sector Privatization Strategy" adopted by Council of
Ministers on 20.12.2004 as integral part of the government privatization program. Jastrzbska
Spólka Wglowa S.A. has taken shares in Koksownia Przyja Sp. z o.o. coking plant
from Kompania Wglowa S.A. and Polskie Koleje Pastwowe S.A., thus becoming a
holder of 88,08 percent of its share capital. Further consolidation of Coal and Coke
Group was to include Treasury of State's contribution in kind to JSW S.A. in form of
shares of: Kombinat Koksochemiczny ,,Zabrze" S.A. and Zaklady Koksownicze
,,Walbrzych" S.A. as well as the Treasury's shares of Koksownia Przyja Sp. z o.o.
Privatization Advisor of the Treasury of State has also prepared an emission prospectus
for Jastrzbska Spólka Wglowa S.A., which has been submitted in the Ministry of
treasury of State in December 2005. As far as work on privatization of Katowicki
Holding Wglowy S.A. is concerned, in May 2005 the ministry of treasury of State has
approved privatization analyses, based on which in June 2005 the Minister of the
Treasury of State has made a decision to sell at least 10 percent of the shares owned by
the Treasury of State by way of negotiations based on a public invitation. In the
timeframe envisaged for submitting responses to the public invitation of the Ministry of
Treasury of State, i.e. until 27.10.2005, preliminary proposals were submitted by CES, a.s.
with principal seat in Prague (Czech Republic) and Bancroft Private Equity LLP with
principal seat in London (UK). In 2006, except for the works related to creation of the
Coal and Coke Group, no privatization works related to mining companies were
undertaken.

      Within the framework of program assumptions, basic effects of proekological
activities were specified for Kompania Wglowa S.A., Katowicka Grupa Kapitalowa and
Jastrzbska Spólka Wglowa S.A., and target values were set for 2010.
     Analyzing the current proecological activities in Kompania Wglowa S.A., including
completion of investment project currently implemented by Kompania Wglowa S.A.,
entitled "Hydrological protection of Vistula River with respect to saline waters of KWK
,,Piast" and KWK ,,Ziemowit", using shafts and workings of Ruch II KWK ,,Piast" ­
KWK ,,Piast" one should state, that target values assumed under the program are
realistically achievable.
     As far as KGK and JSW S.A. are concerned, it should be stated, that reaching
assumed target values for chlorides and sulphites load in unused mine water discharged
into surface waters will be difficult to achieve. Reasons for this include increased
mineralization of natural water inflow in the mines, resulting from works undertaken in
new, usually deeper, areas, as well as lesser scope of mining-geological activities
resulting from hydrological, geological and hydrogeological conditions of mining
companies.


     In spite of departures from the program assumptions as described above, the hard
coal mining sector restructuring, in implementation for many years, has brought on many
positive results. Deep changes in the Polish economy, commenced at the beginning of
1990's, based on foundations of market economy, competition and equal treatment for all
entities, have had an impact on enterprises in the mining sector as well. Transformation
of that sector was a particularly difficult task, as before transformation, the main focus of
the mining companies was how to increase the output. Less attention was paid to
production costs, economic and financial standing or financial results of the companies.
In light of emerging competition, this kind of approach had to change and forced the
mining companies to start fighting for their existence.

     Over the past years, organizational structure of the sector has changed. Production
capacity was consolidated. Number of active headings has decreased from 788 in 1990 to
130 as of end of 2006. There was also a significant increase in labor productivity, up to
793 t/empl/yr in 2006. Liabilities of the mining sector companies, as a result of
forgiveness of debts to the state in the amount of 18,1 billion PLN, applied in 2003, as of
end of 2006 was on the level of approx. 6,9 million PLN. Most of those liabilities are in
Kompania Wglowa S.A. The liabilities are being systematically repaid. One of the most
important effects achieved was a certain stabilization of economic condition of
enterprises in the mining sector, as exemplified by full, timely payments of current
liabilities. Another element is continuous improvement of organization of Polish coal
market, recently using state of the art IT technologies.

     The World Bank has played a significant role in adapting Polish mining sector to
operation under market economy conditions, providing both a substantial part of
financing for restructuring programs, as well as expert assistance. Thanks to cooperation
with the World Bank, institutions responsible for preparing the hard coal mining sector
reform, its implementation and monitoring were also strengthened. Due to
implementation of the last two loans, it was possible to increase effectiveness of the


                                              33

model preparing mines for liquidation, with particular emphasis on preventing negative
social and environmental impacts. I would like to thank you, Mr. Director, for particular
commitment and personal contribution to the process of reforming Polish coal sector. I
would like to ask you to pass my thanks to the Leader of Coal Experts team, Mr. John
Strongman, Ms Adriana Eftimie, Mr. Roman Palac, who worked directly with the
employees of the Ministry, as well as al the other employees of the World Bank, involved
in Polish hard coal mining sector restructuring process.
