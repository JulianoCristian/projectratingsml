Similarly, the second\n            component provides support for CY04 costs for severance\n            packages to surface workers, providing alternative\n            employment at a salary of 75 percent of present wages.\n            Finally, the third component supports CY04 costs for ongoing\n            commitments to severance payments from previous Miners'\n            Social Packages under the 1998-2002 Program, provided for up\n            to five years."}, "docdt": "2004-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
