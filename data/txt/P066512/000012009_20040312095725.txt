A. STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1. Countryissues

Country Assistance Strategy. The CAS for Poland (discussed by the Board on December 10, 2002
and covering FY03-05) identified a number o f structural problems in the economy, including a
suboptimal tight monetary, loose fiscal policy mix, inefficient allocation of public resources, and a
highfiscal deficit with unfavorable debt dynamics. The single lending scenario inthe CAS hinged
on one macroeconomic trigger, which was defined as follows: Publicfinances will remain on track
for an increase in central government savings of I percent of GDP over the period of the CAS,
startingfrom the estimated level of -4. I percent of GDPfor 2002. This would in addition entail
increases in central government savings eachyear of at least 0.25percent of GDP, and no evidence
of deterioration in recurrent balances of the rest of general government.

The general government deficit for 2003 is estimated at 6.3 percent o f GDP comparedto 6.4 percent
o f GDP in2002. The central government's saving balance improved from -4.1 percent o f GDP to -
3.4 percent o f GDP, thus meeting part o f the macroeconomic trigger for 2003.' However, there was
deterioration inthe recurrent balances o f the rest of general government. (See Table 1.)

The 2004 budget envisages further fiscal expansion largely linked to structural rigidities resulting
from the delay inimplementing public finance reforms. The general government deficit for 2004 i s
projected at around 8 percent of GDP, and the central government's savings-investment balance is



'The                           main focus of the trigger was on central government savings because the fiscal deterioration of 2001-02 took
place almost completely in the central government's recurrent balance. Based on currently available data, the central
government exceeded the minimum annual improvement set by the CAS trigger o f 0.25 percent o f GDP, while
preliminary data indicates that the deterioration in the recurrent balances o f the rest o f the general government was
small. A more definitive assessment will only be available in May 2004 given the lags inavailability of relevant data.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1

expected to deteriorate to -5.5      percent o f GDP. Based on this budget, the macroeconomic trigger
for 2004 will not be met.

Inaddition to somewhat weaker anticipated growth in2004 thanprojected inthe CAS, the fiscal
deterioration implied by the 2004 budget reflects a fiscal stimulus o f around 1% percent o f GDP
arising from roughly equal shares o f higher outlays relating to EUaccession, reduced corporate tax
rates, and higher current expenditures. The budget needs to be restructured to make room for
significant co-payments to utilize the EU's structural funds for developmental purposes while
substituting some own-spending with EU grants. Moreover, in the absence o f policy initiatives,
public debt will exceed the limits posed by the Public Finance Act as early as this year, In
particular, debt i s likely to exceed the 55 percent GDP threshold in 2004 (reflecting in part the
weakening o f the zloty), which--unless countered by significant additional adjustment or non-debt
financing--would trigger mandatory fiscal adjustment inthe context o f the 2006 budget.

As public debt approaches legal thresholds, a sense o f urgency has risen among policymakers. In
January 2004, the Government approved a plan o f administrative measures and social reforms
named after its author, Minister of Economy Hausner (the "Hausner" plan). If fully implemented,
the plan would be a decisive first step in reforming government finances. Over the medium term,
the plan could bringpermanent improvements in the budget equivalent to about 2 percent o f GDP
(including some additional planned revenue measures), thus contributing importantly to a gradual
reduction in the deficit from 2005 onwards and arresting the unsustainable debt dynamics. While
the CAS targets are unlikely to be met in2004 even with implementation o f the Hausner plan, they
could be met in 2005 if additional measures currently estimated at % to 1 percent o f GDP are
adopted.

Proposed Su~portfor Coal Sector. Notwithstanding, the status o f the CAS macroeconomic trigger,
it is considered especially important to proceed with the proposed Hard Coal Social Mitigation
operation at this time. Substantial coal sector reforms were undertaken in 1998-2001, but progress
slowed in 2002 and 2003 when unemployment increased to about 18 percent in Silesia and
nationwide. Nevertheless, further reform is essential, first, to comply with EUregulations regarding
state aide support and rules on competition and environment; and, second, to mitigate the risk that
remaining over employment and excess capacity could jeopardize the accomplishments so far and
create further renewed pressure from the coal sector on overall fiscal performance. Inthis situation,
notwithstanding the high level o f unemployment, the Government has now embarked on a new
round o f employment downsizing and mine closures starting inearly 2004. The proposedoperation
will directly support the year 2004 employmentdownsizing without which the subsequent stages o f
capacity reduction and medium term sustainability o f the sector through privatization cannot take
place. The project would support employment downsizing whichis being implemented following a
protracted and difficult period o f consultation with labor unions. The Government's year 2004
budget includes funds from the proposed operation to cover the bulk o f the funding for severance
payments. A delay inBank support couldjeopardize the implementation o f this important first stage
in2004. Further, buildingon the coal sector reforms, the successful implementation ofbroadbased
economic recovery in Silesia, would also facilitate receipt, from January 1, 2004, o f EU structural
and cohesion funds which, ifnot fully committed by the end o f 2006, would be lost. Although the
CAS envisioned a single large road sector operation in FY03, followed by a coal sector operation


 The precise amount of additional measuresrequired will depend onthe impact of the Hausner Planas eventually
passedby Parliament and could be either less or more than this current estimate.

anda social mitigationoperation inFY04 (for total lending of $800million over the two years), it is
now planned to proceed with a series of smaller operations, starting in FY04 with a Roads
operation, this Hard Coal Social Mitigation Project, and a Coal Mine Closure project (which is
beingprepared for approval in late FY04). These three operations would result intotal lending of
$425 million for FY03-FY04. Further support for both the coal sector and the roads sector through
Bank lending in FY05-FY06 will be proposed as part of a CAS Progress Report now planned for
FY05.

2. Sector Issues

While Poland has made extensive progress in reforming its economy over the past 10-15 years,
considerable structural rigidities remain, especially in the large capital intensive industries. These
industries with large employment andhighlosses are a drag on the economy that must be addressed
ifPolandistobecomeacompetitivememberoftheEuropeanUnion.Coalremainsthelargestof
these industries. Annual losses for the coal sector peaked at nearly US$1billion in 1997. In 1998,
the Government introduced a five-year (1998-2002) Hard Coal Sector Reform Program to address
the sector's problems. The Program was successful in reducing employment from 248,000 at the
beginning of 1998 to about 140,000 at the end of 2002. (By comparison, the steel industry, which
suffers from similar problems, employs less than 40,000.) The industry made a small profit on coal
operations in 2001, but losses returnedin 2002, when the pace o f reform slowed, prices declined
andcosts increased.

The sector comprises three mining holding companies - Kompania Weglowa (KW) with about
83,000 employees and 23 mines producing about 51 million tpy coal; the Katowki Holding
Weglowy (KHW) with about 25,000 employees and 9 mines producing about 19 million tpy coal;
and the Jastrzebska Coking Coal Company (JSW) with about 20,000 employees and 5 mines
producing about 14 million tpy coal - plus three individual mines (Budryk, Bogdanka and
Jaworzno) with about 8,500 employees betweenthemproducing about 11million tpy coal. There is
also a MineRestructuring Company (SRK), which is responsible for mineclosures andreclamation.
Further information on the structure of the sector is provided in Annex 1 Section (a) Better
performance of the sector i s constrained by a combination of physical factors, namely excess
production capacity and surplus employment and financial factors, including working cash
shortages, poor cash flow and unmanageable debt overhang. The situation i s most severe at KW,
which has most of the excess production capacity and surplus employment, is loss making and i s
unable to meet a hard budget comtrairzt @e., they pay all o f their obligations to Government and
environmental funds for current production). KHW andJSW are bothprofitable companies and able
to meet a hardbudget constraint.

Experience in other countries indicates that "no quick fix" is possible and the Government
recognizes that it will require a further multi-year effort to successfully complete the reforms. The
government has prepared and is now implementing a new Program o f Restructuring o f the Hard
Coal Mining Sector for 2003-2006 (2003-2006 Program). The Program is a multi-faceted approach
-covering employment restructuring, capacity liquidationandfinancial restructuring, as well as
profound changes in the structure and management o f the industry. But implementation o f the
Program will not be easy since unemployment is now about 18 percent nationally (compared to
about 6 percent in 1998 when the first Program started). Important characteristics of the 2003-2006
Program are that the workforce reduction i s on a voluntary basis and i s supported by specific job
creation incentives to help create new employment opportunities, especially for younger surface

                                                   3

workers leaving the coal industry. There is also a companion "Program of Alleviating Hard Coal
Mining Employment Restructuring Effects in the Region of Silesia" (the Silesia Economic Program)
which is aimed at job creation and economic recovery initiatives for the whole o f the SilesiaRegion
(not just the coal industry). The final stage in the Program is privatization of the industry. This
shouldensure sustainability o fthe reforms. KHW andJSW will be candidates for early privatization
once their balance sheets have been restructured, but substantial further downsizing will be needed
inorder for KWto become financially viable andreadyfor privatization.

3. Rationale for Bank involvement

As Poland willjoin the European Union on May 12004, it is clear that the World Bank's role, both
interms oflendingandadvisory services, will haveto evolve to adapt to anew situation. TheBank
has previously provided two SECALs (Hard Coal SECALl for US$ 300 million in June 1999 and
Hard Coal SECAL2 for US$lOO million inAugust 2001) to support implementation o f the 1998-
2002 Hard Coal Reform Program. The Government has requested the Bank for further significant
financial support and technical advice to support the next phase o f sector restructuring, because coal
i s one o f the larger sectors in the economy and downsizing in the coal sector reaches into many
other sectors of the economy impacting employment and income. The extent o f the impact o f coal
sector reform i s illustrated by a decline from an estimated 4 percent of GDP from the late 1980s to
about 2 percent o f GDP today. It is a sector that has great political as well as social sensitivity, and
is seen by many in the country as one o f the key indicators o f the government's commitment to
implement the structural changes inthe economy.

World Bank support is sought for its knowledge, expertise and experience inthe sector, in addition
to its financial support. More specifically, the Bank is expected to play a key role through this
project in providing support for the following areas: (i)   supporting design and implementation o f
social monitoring activities; (ii) reviewing the Year 2004 operating plans and cash flow for KW,
KHW and JSW to verify that they are responding in a responsible and efficient manner and that
they meet all their payment obligations on current liabilities to Government and environmental
funds; (iii) ensuring that appropriate implementation and monitoring arrangements are inplace; and
(iv) ensuringthat there is a public information campaign and that meetings are convenedwith local
communities so that they are informed about progress inimplementingthe Program.

4. Higher level objectives to which the Project contributes

A major pillar o fthe CAS is enhancing private sector-led growth and employment creation through
enterprise restructuring. Support for coal sector reform was included as a priority within that pillar
inthe CAS which includesthe followingassessment(paragraph 68 ofthe CAS):

         The Bank will assist Poland's enterprise restructuring plans primarily through
         continuation of the assistance to the coal reform program, which began in 1999.

Specifically, the CAS identified a US$200 million adjustment operation for FY04 (i.e. the proposed
Hard Coal Social Mitigation operation - HCSML). According to the CAS (paragraph 76) the
trigger for the proposed operation is:

        Adoption and initial implementation of a reform program whichfaces an ultimate
        privatization of the bulk of the sector and includes a time-bound plan for initial

                                                    4

        transactions, and which is consistent with EU requirements, and is accompanied by
        appropriatesocial support.

The 2003-2006 Program is considered to meet this trigger.                  The Government has subsequently
requested a series o f three investment operations to support implementation o f the 2003-2006 Coal
Restructuring Program. The first i s this operation (the US$200 million equivalent Hard Coal Social
MitigationLoan) which focuses on the most critical issue, i.e. reducingemployment and providing
alternative private sector employment for younger workers leaving the industry in Year 2004.
Section B.6 discusses the use o f an investment loan rather than adjustment lending. As noted
previously, the Government has also requested for FY04 a proposed US$lOO million approx. Hard
Coal Mine Closure Loan that will directly support the physical closure and reclamation o f excess
coal mine capacity from C Y 2004-2006. In addition, a possible US$200 million third investment
loan has been requested which would support further employment restructuring, social mitigation
and privatization in2005 and/or 2006.          Total costs o f the 2003-2006 Coal Restructuring Program
are estimated at PLN 6.2 billion (equivalent to US$ 1.55 billion at present exchange rates). Ifthe
three proposed Bank loans take place, Bank support would finance about 31 percent o f the 2003-
2006 program (Annex 5).

5. GovernmentCommitmentto the Project

The CAS discussions have clearly demonstrated that this is one o f the highest priorities for
Government. The Government commitment to implementing the program in 2004 is reflected first
by passage o f the new Coal Act o f November 2003 on Restructuring the Hard Coal Mining Sector
for 2003-2006, which contains the provisions for the new packages; second, by the inclusion o f full
finding o fthe programinthe Government's 2004 budget; third, bythe strong engagement with the
trade unions to garner their support for program implementation; and fourth, by the request for this
loan and the preparation o f a Letter o f Sector Development Policy.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

The H C M L is a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) whereby loan proceeds3 will be used to directly
mitigate financial hardship o f workers leaving the industry, in the form o f funding income support
payments for severance packages, and for severance related support to workers finding new
employment outside o f the coal industry through incentive payments to employers hiring ex-coal
industryworkers (see SectionB.4, pages 8-9 andAnnex 4, pages 46-48 for further details).

The borrower has selected a Euro-denominated loan because Poland is increasing the European
portion o f its foreign debt portfolio inlight o f its future accession to the EuropeanUnion (EU) and
strong economic relations with the members states o f the EU. Also, the Borrower considers these
terms would give a lower cost o f servicing the loan and debt repayment inthe future.

The Programenvisages the followingmaineconomic andsocial objectives:

0    the economic objective - to improve profitability and financial liquidity of the sector so it i s
     capable o fregular paymentsof its liabilitiesincludingpayments of environmental fees; and
0    the social objective- to mitigate the social consequences of program implementation and the
     proposed new sector restructuring.

The objectives are to be achieved by reform in the areas of industry structure; employment
restructuring; mine closure and liquidation; financial restructuring; andprivatization.

The 2003 - 2006 Program is the second phase of the reform of the coal sector. The Program, as
originally approved by the Council of Ministers on November 21, 2002 called for 7 mine closures
and layoffs of 30,000 workers, But this was strongly opposedby the workers andtheir trade unions
because, unlike the 1998-2002 Program, it involved involuntary layoffs and had no special income
support measures for mining industry workers losing their jobs. This was at a time when
unemployment has risen to around 20 percent in Silesia and 18 percent nationally (from about 6
percent when the reforms started in 1999). In the face of strong protests, the Government made
five substantial adjustments to the 2003-2006 Program, which were adopted by the Council o f
Ministers on January 28,2003:
     (i)     The layoff are now voluntary (instead of involuntary);
     (ii)    the number ofmine closures has beenreducedto four (from seven);
     (iii)    the size ofthe targetedlabor force reductionwas reduced(from 30,000 to 27,200);
     (iv)    income support measures were introduced for about 14,100 underground workers; and
     (v)    job creation incentives were introduced to create 8,600 jobs outside the coal industry for
             surface workers leaving the coal industry.

There are about 110,000 underground workers and 30,000 surface workers in the industry at
present, with almost the entire underground workforce being male but 47 percent o f the surface
workforce beingwomen. Thus the underground workforce would be reducedby about 13 percent
and the surface work force by about 29 percent - which reflects a significant excess proportionof
surface workers at present. The program timetable specifies that the industry would be fully
privatized by the end of 2006 inwhich case the reformwill havebeen completed. The main features
o fthe program andthe timetable are shown inAnnex I.     Section (b) The Government has prepared a
Letter o f Sector Development Policy (LSDP) which addresses overall energy sector policy;
employment and capacity restructuring aspects in 2004, privatization; environmental and
implementation andmonitoringaspects, includingpublic informationcampaign.

The estimatedcosts of the 2003-2006 Program are PLN 6.17 billion o f which: (i)      3.25 billion PLN
i s for carryover costs ("miners leave" redundancy payments) from the 1998-2002 Program; (ii)     2.88
billion PLN is for the New 2003 - 2006 Program consisting o f PLN 1.73 billion for new social
mitigation expenditures and        PLN 1.15 billion for capacity restructuring and liquidation o f
subsidence and other mining damages; and (iii)    PLN 0.04 billion for other costs. Further details are
given inAnnex 5.

The Ministry of Economy, Labor and Social Policy (MoELSP) has overall responsibility for
program implementation. MoELSP and Ministry o f Finance (MoF) will work closely together to
ensure that the Program is adequately funded throughout its life with transparency and clear
accountability and that the necessary arrangements are put in place to ensure satisfactory
coordination, implementation, monitoring and auditing for a Program o f this complexity and


                                                   6

challenge.    The Ministry o f State Treasury (MOST) i s responsible for implementation o f
privatization activities under the Program. The Ministry o f Environment (MoEN) is responsible for
overseeing environmental aspects o f the program. The Agency for Industrial Development (ARP)
is effectively the implementing and monitoring agency for the project and is responsible for
processing applications for and auditing the use o f funds for severance payments, and for
monitoring industryperformanceunder the Program. Further details are given inAnnex 6.

As with the 1998-2002 Reform Program, the implementation o f the pre-retirement measures, re-
training and re-employment initiatives will be the responsibility o f the Human Resource
Departments o f mining companies and SRK. In addition, the Mine Labor Agency (GAP),and the
MoESLP local labor offices o f the Katowice Region will provide counseling and other labor market
services as needed to mining company employees, as well as to unemployed workers in general.
With the exception o f the employment incentive scheme, all o f the activities under the HCSML
operation are a continuation o f activities that were undertaken in a fully satisfactory manner under
the 1998-2002 Program, which was supported by SECALs 1 and 2. The satisfactory experience o f
that first Program and the first two loans gives a strong basis for expecting satisfactory
implementation o f the 2003-2006 Program.            The respective implementing institutions are
considered to have adequate capacity

The "Program of Alleviating Hard Coal Mining Employment Restructuring Effects in the Region of
Silesia" was approved by the Council o f Ministers on January 28, 2003. The fundamental aim o f
this economic recovery program for Silesia is to attract new capital to support job creation in the
region and the program provides loans, loan guarantees and direct financial incentives to support
new projects. The program includes more than 20 different measures including the development o f
the infrastructure such as industrial parks and the regional roads system, revitalization o f degraded
areas and mine site reclamation, training and tourism development. Funding for the recovery
program comes from the state budget, the European Regional Development Fund, European Social
Fund and private resources. The recovery program envisages attracting as much as 710 million
PLNininvestments inthe Silesiaregionover the next three years.

3. Projectdevelopmentobjectiveandkeyindicators

The overall objective is to provide assistance to the borrower to reform the hard coal industry to
become a profitable sector that contributes to economic growth and improved living standards in
support o f Poland's economic integration into the European Union. The specific objective o f the
Project is to improve the efficiency o f the hard coal industry by supporting the implementation o f
the calendar year 2004 o f employment restructuring o f the 2003-2006 Hard Coal Sector
Restructuring Program and on-going commitments from the 1998-2002 Hard Coal Sector Reform
Program. There are three "pillars" o f higher level objectives, namely (a) employment restructuring,
(b) improvingefficiency and financial performance, and (c) sustaining the reform. Specific Project
Development Objectives (PDOs) include (a) participating employers hiring surface workers and
eligible mine workers taking severance packages; (b) KW, KHW and JSW mining companies
improving efficiency, adhering to a hard budget constraint and improving their balance sheets; and
(c) KHW and JSW taking steps towards privatization. Adhering to the hardbudget constraint and
achieving agreed progress steps on privatization will be conditions for continued disbursement o f
the loan. Further details are given in Table 1. Details with respect to monitoring and evaluation
indicators are provided inAnnex 3.

4. Project components

The project consists o f three components:

    A. Severance Payments for undergroundworkers underthe 2003-2006 Program;
    B. Severance Payments, Reskilling andReemployment for surface workers underthe 2003-
        2006 Program, including:
            a. Severance payments to surface workers;
            b. Reemployment incentives payments to employers hiring eligible redundant ex-
               surface workers;


                                                  8

    C. Severance payments commitments from previously implemented Miners' Social Packages
         under the 1998-2002 Program.

Component A provides support for Year 2004 costs for severance packages for underground
workers under the 2003-2006 Programwhich will enable undergroundworkers to leave the industry
with pre-retirement benefits o f 75 percent o f their wages for a period o fup to 3 years until eligible
for a miners pension. A similar package (but covering a longer period o f up to five years) was
offered under the 1998-2002 Program and was well received and widely accepted by the
underground workers at that time. More than 6,000 have already expressed interest in accepting the
new severance package as o f end January 2004. The estimated cost o f Component A from 2003-
2006 is 1.13 PLNbillion ( about US$0.3 billi~n).~

Component B provides support for Year 2004 costs for severance packages for surface workers
under the 2003-2006 Program which will provide them the opportunity to find assured altemative
employment at a salary o f 75 percent o f their present wages. There has not yet been strong interest
inthe surface packages but mining companies expect that interest will increase as experience with
the packages grows. The estimated cost of Component A from 2003-2006 is 0.6 PLN billion (
about US$O.16billion).

Component C provides support for Year 2004 costs for ongoing commitments for severance
payments from previously implemented Miners' Social Packages that were provided under the
1998-2002 Program. These severance packages were provided for up to five years. Thus, packages
taken up in 2002 will require funding through 2007. At that time, the Government was careful to
contain these generous packages to the miningsector on the basis that miningisa unique occupation
with hazards not found inother sectors. Since then, successive governments have been committed
to and successhl inpreventing contagion to other sectors. Thus, the packages have not become an
expensive precedent for severance elsewhere inthe economy. The take-up o f packages was one o f
the most successful aspects o f the Year 1998-2002 Program and was arguably the single most
important factor in the industry moving from losses approaching US$1 billion in 1998 to a small
profit on operations in2001. The use o f these funds was very closely monitored and audits confirm
that all hnds were properly used. The cost o f the 1998-2002 Program packages is estimated to be
about US$2.35 billion over the period 1998-2007. US$1.5 billion was expended from 1998-2002
and the balance o f US$0.85 billion (about 3.25 PLN billion) is being expended from 2003-2006.
Furtherdetails relatedto eachproject component areprovidedinAnnex 4.

While the industry returned to losses in2002 this was largely due to the pace o f reform slowing in
the face o f risingunemployment. The further employment downsizing supported by the 2003-2006
Program, together with the mine closures under the Program (which will be supported by the
proposedHardCoal Mine Closure operation), should ensure that the industry becomes profitable on
a sustained basis and i s then privatized.


~




 This is the highest cost package per worker and is equivalent to 75 percent o fthe miners' monthly income. Itis worth
an average 80,000 PLN per miner to be paid in monthly installments over a period o f nearly two-years (ie., about
40,000 PLN per miner per year for nearly two years). By comparison, overall per capita income in Poland is about
 17,400 PLNper year. The legal minimumseverancebenefits inPoland are 1- 3 months o f wages depending on length
o f service. Unemployed workers also benefit from a comprehensive set o f labor market services through MOELSP
regional and local labor offices.

The Project Completion date is June 30, 2005 and Project Closing date is December 31, 2005.

5. Lessonslearnedandreflectedinthe projectdesign

The project design includes the following features reflecting previous operations and good
practices:
0   it directly supports further restructuring of the industry using new employment restructuring
    measures;
0   it supports implementation o f a broader comprehensive reform program that will lead to sector
    sustainability through privatization;
0   it addresses the difficulties for displaced workers o ffindingnew employment;

0   it utilizes the local labor services system including labor re-deployment, retraining, and small
    business assistance;
e   it includes fast acting and targeted income support with demand driven labor re-deployment
    programs;
0   itwill beimplementedthrough capable implementingagencies;

0   it is part of a multi-year program by the miningcompanies' HumanResource Departments, the
    Mine Labor Agency (GAP), and the MoESLP local labor offices of the Katowice Region; and
0   it is supported by a companiongrowth strategy for Silesiathat facilitates growth o fjobs.

6. Alternativesconsideredandreasonsfor rejection

The Government has encountered extensive opposition from the workers and trade unions to the
design and implementation o f its 2003-2006 Program.           Instead o f continuing support for the
Program with a broad-based adjustment operation as was proposed in the CAS that would provide
financial support to the budget, the Government have requested that the Bank continues its support
for coal sector reform with an investment loan so that there will be direct Bank support for the
social mitigation aspects o f program implementation. (see Annex 4).            Very importantly an
investment operationprovidesa direct linkage betweenthe Bank andthe miningcompanies who are
the beneficiaries o f the loan which will give the Bank regular and detailed insight into the
operations and performance o f KW, KHW and JSW which will be cmcial to the successful
implementation of 2003-2006 Program including the mining companies meeting a hard budget
constraint. It is anticipated that this oversight o f the mining companies will be extended through
conditionality for the proposedHard Coal MineClosure operation.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements

There is no direct financing of the project by other agencies. The Council o f Europe Development
(CEBD) is providing financial support for implementing the parallel Silesia Economic Program
with a loano f25 millionEuro to SRK inOctober 2003.




                                                   10

2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

The Ministry of Economy, Labor and Social Protection (MoELSP) has overall responsibility for
program implementation. MoELSP and Ministry o f Finance (MoF) will work closely together to
ensure that the Program is adequately funded throughout its life with transparency and clear
accountability and that the necessary arrangements are put in place to ensure satisfactory
coordination, implementation, monitoring and auditing for a Program.

The Agency for Industrial Restructuring (Am) i s effectively the implementing and monitoring
agency for the project. On the basis o f the law and agreement with MoELSP, ARP acts as
monitoring body o f the coal sector. ARF'         is responsible for processing mining companies
applications for support for severance payments for new miners leaves, carry-over o f previously
approved miners leaves and the schemes for surface workers. ARP will also undertake field control
reviews o f mining companies use of severance payment funds.           ARP is also responsible for
monitoring industry performance under the Program. This monitoring will cover both company
performance, as well as the aggregate sector performance, and will be based on the performance
targets included as part o f company business plans and associated employment contracts.
Monitoring was previously been undertaken by the PARG which was transformed into KW at the
start o f the 2003-2006 Program.

Strengths and weaknesses. The strengths that provide a basis o f reliance on the project financial
management system include: (i)    the experience o f MoELSP and the coal companies since 1998 in
implementing the Coal Reform Programs and o f ARP since 2003 inmonitoring government support
for hard coal sector; and (ii)   overall strong organizational and financial capacity o f ARP as a
monitoring and reporting entity including its strong program audit section. The weakness o f the
system is in the quality o f the coal companies' external auditors. However, this will be mitigated
for the project by requiring the auditor o f the project to be acceptable to the World Bank. In
addition, the Bank will, upon the request o f the coal companies' Supervisory Boards, provide advice
on best-practice procedures to select appropriate independent auditors.

Flow of funds.     Fundswill flow from the MoF, to the MoELSP, to the MiningCompanies, to the
mines and finally to eligible workers in accordance with the financial arrangements documented in
the Project Operational Manual. ARP will receive applications for funds from coal companies on a
monthly basis and, after verification and consolidation, will forward an aggregate application to the
MoELSP which inturn will approve and initiate a transfer o f finds directly to the coal companies.
The MoELSP will receive loan funds from the Special Account held by M o F through regular
budgetary channels. Inaddition, inrespect o f component B (the severance payments, re-skilling and
re-employment for surface workers), funds will flow from the mining companies to the employers
outside the mining industry who have hired eligible ex surface workers. The MiningCompanies
will recordthe funds received from the government as a subsidy andthe benefit relatedpayments as
costs intheir accountingbooks andrecords inaccordance with standard accounting regulations.

Disbursement Arrangements.        Loan finds would be disbursed quarterly or bi-monthly based on
satisfactory documentation, being the receipt o f Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) providing
information on planned and forecast project expenditures. The MOELSP, through the ARP: (i)      will
prepare Financial MonitoringReports and disbursement applications; (ii) monitor take up o fthe
                                                                          will
packages and will arrange regular program audit visits to ensure that funds have been provided in


                                                   11

 the correct amounts to the appropriate entities and individuals; and (iii) initiate corrective
                                                                             will
 action whenever they uncover anomalies. The actual take-up will be monitored on the basis o f ARP
 monthly reports submitted to the World Bank. There will be an audit of CY2004 project financial
 statements, FMRs and the Special Account and a final audit to cover any payments that take place
 in2005 inthe event that the take up ofnew packages is slower than anticipated. Since the operation
 is financing the 2004 "time slice'' o f the 2003-2006 program, disbursement o f the funds would also
 be conditioned on satisfactory progress regarding adherence to a hard budget constraint by the
 companies and implementation o f next steps towards industry privatization.).       Disbursement o f
 loan funds based on receipt o fFMRs on an ex ante basis is expected as shown inTable 2.

 Retroactive Financing.       The first disbursement will be based on actual expenditures for
 documented eligible payments incurred in the period January 1, 2004 through to loan signing and
 retroactive funding will be provided up to an aggregate amount o f  40 million (approximately
 US$50 million). The level o f retroactive financing (25 percent) is considered warranted since the
 objective is to support reforms in Year 2004 and Board presentation is in late March 2004.
 Originally, Board presentation was expected inlate 2003, but loan preparation was delayed because
 details o f the reform program in general and the packages inparticular were extensively debated in
 Parliament inNovember 2003 and the packages were only finalized when the Law was approved by
 Parliament inDecember 2003. The loan was then appraised inlate January 2004 when the mining
 companies could provide initial reactions from the miners. The Government had included full
 disbursement o f the proposed loan in its Year 2004 budget which was originally prepared in mid
 2003 and approved at the end o f 2003. The loan will help Government restart the reform process
 which stalled in 2002 and 2003 due to strong trade union opposition to further downsizing as
 unemployment rose to 18-20 percent. Thus the exception to the normal 10 percent ceiling for
 retroactive payments i s proposed.

 3. Monitoringand evaluation of outcomes/results

 The Government, together with the Bank, closely monitored the use o f severance funds under the
 1998-2002 Program. The flow o f severance funds (as well as the flow o f funds for mine closure)
 was audited and monitoredby various authorities including the coal miningcompanies auditors, the
 Supreme Chamber o f Control (NIK)and the Katowice Tax Office. These audits all confirmed that
 funds were properly used and similar procedures are being continued for the 2003-2006 Program.


                                                   12

The Agency for Industrial Development (ARP)has the responsibility for compiling data regarding
employment, production and industry financial performance. ARP has demonstrated capability to
do this and presently produces a comprehensive set o f monthly monitoring reports for the sector.
The source data comes from the employment records and financial accounts o f the mining
companies and SRK who also have a demonstrated capability to do this.               MoELSP will also
contract social surveys to be undertaken and will address impacts on the communities. The only
anticipated additional cost will be for the social survey and it is expected that the cost o f the survey
would be covered from a proposed PHRD grant, which i s expected to be provided for preparation o f
the proposed third coal investment operation. The indicators will be used by the ARP to assess
progress in implementing the Project and the Program. They will also be provided on a monthly,
quarterly and semi-annual basis as appropriate to the Inter Ministerial Coal MonitoringCommittee
(IMCMC) who will review them at meetings which will take place every two months or more
frequently to assess both the project andProgram effectiveness.

4. Sustainability
The are three important factors for sustainability o f the HCSML project. The first i s the support o f
the trade unions for coal sector downsizing at a time o f high unemployment. To this end, the
Government has engaged extensively inrecent months with the trade unions, and this has resulted
inthe design of an attractive package of measures. The Government is also undertaking a public
information campaign to disseminate the information. Second is the continued implementation o f
the Government's 2003-2006 coal sector restructuring program, moving from employment
downsizing to mine closure and then to privatization, to ensure that the coal sector will not return to
being a drainon public resources inthe future. Over the longer term, privatization ofthe industry i s
the key to sector sustainability since private owners will ensure that the industry operates according
to competitive market conditions, and any further adjustment would then be undertaken by private
sector owners, not government. The third most important factor for program sustainability would
be improvement inoverall growth andjob creation which would lead to a lower unemployment rate
and facilitate the absorption into other sectors o fworkers leaving the miningsector.

5. Critical risksandpossible controversial aspects

The proposedproject i s considered as a moderate risk operation as shown inthe Risk Table below.
The main risk related to achieving the component results is that uptake o f severance packages by
surface workers may be slower than originally anticipated. This will be mitigated by MOELSP's
close monitoring o f uptake o f the packages and, ifnecessary, re-design o f the severance packages to
improve uptake.     There are two potentially controversial aspects.       First, the project supports
employment restructuring at a time o f highunemployment. This is mitigated because the Program
is voluntary and incentives are being provided to employers outside the coal industry to hire
redundant surface workers. Second, miners' unrest over mine closures i s unresolved, and program
implementation could be stalled. This is mitigated by Government's active engagement with trade
unions, by the generous social mitigation packages, and by the Government-Bank public
information campaign.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financialanalyses

This is the third in a series o f Bank loans supporting coal sector reforms that started in the 1998-
2002 Program and are continuing inthe subsequent 2003-2006 Programinterms o f

       Proven reduction o f production capacity (from 143 million tons per year in 1998 to 100
       million tons per year today andtarget o f 88 million tpy by end 2006 (PAD Annex 1).
    0  Proven reduction o f industry labor force (from 248,000 in 1998 to 140,000 today and target
       of 110,000 by end 2006 (PAD Annex 1).
       Increases inproductivity from 520 tons/coal per worker in 1998 to 735 tonshoal per worker
       today and an estimated 820 tons/coal per worker target in2006; (derived from employment
       andproductivity/capacitydata inAnnex 1).

The financial rate o f retum for the project is estimated at about 25 percent andthe economic rate o f
retum at about 15 percent (see Annex 9).

2. Technical

The main technical design issue is the design o f the social packages. These are more generous than
normally found in intemational practice as well as the legal minimum benefits in Poland.
However, the packages are considered appropriate given the need to downsize the industry at a time
of very highregional andnational unemployment.

3. Fiduciary

A Bank assessment o f the project's financial management arrangements confirmed that these
arrangements are acceptable to the Bank with the exception o f the IT system to manage the
component, Severance Payments, Reskilling and Reemployment for Surface Workers, which will
need to be readyprior to any disbursements for this component. The country financial management


                                                    16

issues identified in the Bank's Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) o f Poland o f
1999, particularly with respect to the need to modernize accounting and reporting functions, have
been addressed through the use o f the program-specific financial management arrangements at the
ARP (Annex 7). A procurement assessment was not undertaken since there will be no procurement
o fworks, goods or services to be financedwith Bank funding (Annex 8).

4. Social

SeverancePackages. The incentive scheme to encourage undergroundworkers to leave the industry
is considered highly likely to succeed.      Underground workers are to receive 75 percent o f their
previous salary untilthey are eligible for a retirement pension. Given that salaries for underground
workers are significantly higher than the national average, it is likely that they will still be able to
maintain a good standard o f living. In light o f the fact that working conditions underground are
often harsh and taking into consideration the cumulative damage to workers' respiratory systems,
many individuals may actually have a better quality o f life upon accepting the package. But, there
is less certainty with respect to the degree of take-up ofpackages by surface workers, at least for the
present time, in that it remains to be seen (a) how many surface workers will want to take the
severance package since it will result in a 25 percent decrease in wages; and (b) how many
employers outside the coal industry will offer new jobs to surface workers. Full details o f the
surface worker package were not available until the end o f 2003. Since then, the companies have
been actively engaging with the surface workers and potential employers through a public
information campaign and social assessment to explain the incentives and encourage workers and
employers to avail themselves o f the measures while they are available.

Consultation with civil society and media reports indicate that the public perception i s that
something needs to be done to stem the losses of the mining industry and reduce the discontent o f
the miners and the Government program achieves a reasonable balance between special treatment to
the miners and the needs o f the unemployed at large. The workers in the mining industry will
receive special packages which are not available to workers inother sectors o f the economy. While
this results in a somewhat inequitable situation, the Government approach is considered warranted
under the compelling circumstances o f needing to downsize the industry at a time o f very high
unemployment inorder to place the industry on a sound financial footing and prevent further losses
which would need to be coveredby the Government budget.

Social monitoring. The Government is committed to a continuing program o f social monitoring to
track the social impact o f the coal restructuring program and MOELSP will contract for similar
surveys to be undertaken as for the 1998-2002 Program using a similar but redesigned and simpler
questionnaire.    The social monitoring process which will include ongoing analysis o f the labor
market, income levels and poverty measures; short-term projection o f economic and labor market
conditions; highlights o f the implications o f the projected changes in economic and labor market
conditions for employment and unemployment; and tracer surveys to determine the specific impact
of the redeployment schemes on affected employees. This information will be publicly available to
all o fthe stakeholders. Social monitoring reports which cover the above issues andmeasure overall
compliance with the social impact indicators will also be submitted to the Bank andthe I M C M C on
a semi-annual basis.

5. Environment

Since this i s a social mitigation project, there are no environmental issues that are considered
relevant for this project. To the extent that environmental issues arise, they relate to mine closure
and broader program issues and will be addressed in a second investment loan now under
preparation (the proposed HardCoal Mine Closure loan).

consultations influence project design?
      The project does not trigger any o f the safeguards per se (Annex 10). However, it is rated S2
      (limited impact) because, despite the voluntary nature o f the packages and their attractive
      financial terms, the implementation of the program at a time o fhighunemployment may result
      in trade union unrest which could delay program and project implementation. The risk is
     mitigated by the consultation that has taken place not only between the mining companies and
     their workers but also between the Government, the Bank and the mining communities. The
     Bank has a long history of working with the relevant stakeholders including a major
      stakeholder workshop in June 2000 on completion o f SECAL1. With regard to the present
     project, in early 2003 the Bank organized an initial consultative meeting with NGOs in
      Katowice and has held smaller follow up meetings since. The NGOs consulted include the
     Association o f Polish Women over 40, Polish Ecological Club, Silesia Forum o f Social
      Organizations, the Krakow Energy Agency, Polish Ecological Club, Silesian Forum of Social
      Organizations, Association of             Silesian Women and their Families, and The Silesian

     EntrepreneurshipDevelopment Foundation. These groups had concerns that related mostly to
     social impacts andpartlyto environmental impacts.

     InJune 2003, the Bank andthe Government conducted a muchlargerjoint public consultation
     process in Katowice (which is the largest urban center inPoland's coal miningregion). Some
     of the key issues raised with respect to the design of the project included: the need for more
     active labor market interventions, inadequate funding for regional economic development
     activities, the need for better social monitoring to monitor the impact on reform of local
     communities, concerns over the planned mine closures, and privatization (what type o f new
     owner would their be), and environmental concems particularlyregarding site reclamation. The
     June 2003 Katowice consultation verified that the project design was focused on the most
     important issues and that the packages were warranted. An effective Public Information
     Campaign (PIC) was developed by the MoELSP communication unit to support program
     implementation, and in particular, to inform the workers and their families of the need to
     reform the sector and the social mitigation measures and income support services available to
     workers leaving the industry. A workshop on the PIC convened by the MoELSP
     communications unit was carried out on              January 22, 2004. The audience consisted of
     designated public information staff of the mining companies (KW, KHW), GAP and Voivod.
     The workshop demonstratedthat some steps forward are being made, which are considered as
     very encouraging interms ofpromotingthe reformprograminthe Silesia.

Industry Structure. Hard coal, which accounts for about 2 percent of Poland's GDP, represents
the backbone o f the Polish, around 50 percent o f electrical energy in Poland i s generated using
hard coal as fuel. In2002, the sector consisted of seven coal miningholding companies (see Table

Industry Consolidation. As part of the 2003-2006 Program in February 2003 the mines of five
weaker companies (Bytomska S.W. (BSW), Rudzka S.W. (RuSW), Gliwicka S.W. (GSW),
Nadwislanska S.W. (NSW), and Rybnicka S.W. (RySW)) were consolidated into one new coal
holding company - Kompania Weglowa (KW). Thus, the sector today comprises three mining
holding companies - Kompania Weglowa (KW) with about 83,000 employees and 23 mines
producing about 51 million tpy coal; the Katowicki Holding Weglowy (KHW) with about 26,000
employees and 9 mines producing about 19 million tpy coal; and the Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa
(JSW) with about 20,000 employees and 5 mines producing about 14 million tpy coal, plus the
three individual mines with about 8,500 employees producing about 11million tpy coal as shown
above. Table A1.2 provides details o f sales, prices, costs, profit/loss and employment for the
industryonaggregatefor 1998-2003.

Employment. Employment has been reduced from 244,000 year end 1997 to 136,500 year end
2003 (Table A1.3). The decline was very rapid in 1998 and 1999, but slowed sharply in 2001 and
2002, largely due to a deterioration in the Upper Silesian employment market (where
unemployment has increased from about 6 percent at the start o f the program to 20 percent in
2003). Nevertheless, labor productivity remains very low averaging about 0.7 tons per manshift,

                                                20

compared with about 2 tons per manshift in underground coal mines in the UK and 4 tons per
manshiftinhighlymechanizedmines inthe USAandAustralia.

Mine Production Capacity. From year end 1997 to year end 2003 production was terminated and
liquidation started at 14 mines with just over 12 million tons of annual capacity. In addition,
significant reduction ofproduction capacity was implemented through closure o fpartsofmines. By
the endof 2003 production capacity was reducedby about 34,52 million tpy intotal due to closures
since the year endof 1997 (Table Al.4).

Demand and Sales. Total coal sales have declined from about 200 milliontpy inthe early 1980sto
98,5 million tpy in 2003. Domestic demand has declined over the past decade due to ongoing
changes in energy efficiency and energy substitution (e.g. gas for coal), which reflects inpart the
restructuring away from heavy industries to lighter industries and services. Exports have also
declined over the past decadereflecting a combination of a depressed global coal market, low prices

and lack of competitiveness. In 2003, domestic sales and exports were 78,5 million tons and 20
million tons, respectively. Domestic prices averaged 153 PLN per ton but export prices averaged
only 106PLNper ton comparedwith average direct costsper ton sold of 142PLNper ton.

Coal Imports In order to support stability and predictability in the domestic market, which aids
implementation o f reforms, the Government has had to resolve a problem related to imports o f coal
from Russia. Transported from Siberia on rail, Russiancoal imports are reportedly sold to Poland at
well below estimated economic costs. Based on the Law on Market Protection, the Government
imposed import quotas on coal imports fi-om Russia in 1998 for a period o f three years. The
Government has decided to continue the quotas to support implementation of the 2003-2006
reforms and, based on a new Law on Foreign Trade, the Government set new quotas for year 2003
for imports o f coal from Russia (1.72 million tons), from the Czech Republic (0.5 million tons) and
from Kazakhstan (0.1 million tons). The Letter of Sector Development Policy (LSDP) contains
assurances that from 2004, any trade regulations will be fully consistent with the rules and
regulations o f the EU. The World Trade Organization has not taken any position on these issues
since Russia i s not a member of this organization and the matter i s consideredprimarily a bi-lateral
trade issuebetween Poland andRussia, rather than abroader trade issue.

Poland Energy Market. There has been considerable reform and liberalization o f the Polish
energy market including privatization of part of the power sector. In the 1990's Poland made
extensive investments to improve its state owned power generators and substantial gas import
contracts, especially from Russia. In general, Poland currently faces excess capacity not only in
coal but also inpower generation and natural gas imports. Despite recent reductions, contracted gas
imports are likely to exceeddomestic demandby about 20 percent for the next 3-5 years.

Polish Energy Prices. Coal remains a low price fuel compared to alternative fuels (Table A1.5).
From January 1998 to end 2000, Polish coal prices for households increased by 12 percent
comparedto 27 percent and 64 percent for natural gas and fuel oil, respectively. Electricityprices
also increased by about 40 percent over the period, indicating that coal fired power plants have
been benefiting from much higher sales whereas the cost o f the feedstock (coal) has only slightly
increased.

International Coal Prices When compared to costs o f coal in Europe, between 1999 and 2003
European consumers have seen the price o f imported coal increase from 1.21 USD/GJ to 1.42 per
GJ whereas the price o f coal in Poland has decreased over the same period from 1.51 USD/GJ to
1.38 USD/GJ. Inthe international coal trade, buyers are able to exert strong influence over prices
and coal contract prices (after adjustment for coal quality, burning characteristics and sulfur
content) tendto bevery similar on aheat unit basis for major customers.


                                                 23

Unit Cost Reduction. Facedby difficult coal sales and low prices, the coal companies have made
considerable progress inreducing both labor and non-labor costs. From 1998 to 2003, the industry
has reduced unit labor by about 4 percent (from 76 PLN per ton to 73 PLN per ton) in nominal
terms (equivalent to about 25 percent inreal terms). Non-labor unit costs increased from 68 P L N
per ton to 69 PLN per ton in nominal terms over the same period which is an equivalent to 16
percent cost reduction inreal terms. Overall, total unit production costs (including both labor and
non-labor costs) were reduced by 1,5 percent innominal terms (or 23 percent inreal terms) for the
period 1998-2003.

Profit/Loss. The companies have turned an overall net loss (due to high financial costs, non-coal
operational charges and charges for certain severance costs and mine closure costs which are paid
from the companies own funds and not from budgetary funds) into a small profit. Aggregate net
losses o f the sector have improved from PLN 4.2 billion (equivalent to about US$1.2 billion) in
1998 to a positive net income o f 0.5 billion PLN (about US$O.l billion) in2002. While KHW and
JSW have been profitable in 2003, KW has experienced significant losses in 2003 o f around
US$100million    .

Cash Shortages and Liabilities. Because of the highlosses, the companies have faced severe cash
shortages. They have been able to stay current on wage payments, but in doing so have had
difficulty  in meeting their current obligations to the Government (taxes, social security,
environmental fees and fines) in recent years. The payment o f current tax and fees has improved
considerably inyear 2001, 2002 an 2003. The shortfall to social security (ZUS), value added taxes
(VAT), workers' personal income taxes (PIT), other taxes, environmental fees and fines for current
operations has been reduced from about PLN 145 million per month in 2000 to about PLN 40
million per month in2002. KHW and JSW were current on their payments to government in2002
but the other five holding companies (GSW, NSW, RuSW, RySW and BSW - the predecessors to
KW) were not able to meet all o fthe payments incurred by their current operations. In2003 current
payments o f the mining sector were regulatedinabout 90 percent .

Financial Restructuring. While the 1998-2002 plan specified that about PLN 13.4 billion in
liabilities would be eligible for restructuring or forgiveness, the companies have had difficulty in
meeting the provisions for financial restructuring due to poorer than expected financial
performance. As o f December 31,2002, rescheduling and forgiveness o f debt amounted to about 3
billion PLNand 2 billion PLN, respectively, representing about 38 percent o fthe expected amounts
As the part o f Program o f restructuring o f hard coal sector 2003-2006 on December 31, 2004 total
accumulated liabilities o f about 19 billion PLN were forgiven and 4 billion PLN were rescheduled
following passageo fthe new Coal Act

Social Assets. The industry has made substantial progress in divesting itself o f social assets: (a)
hospitals and clinics have been merged into the general health care system and, under the
Government's new national health care insurance system that was introduced on January 1, 1999,
workers are able to select the services they need from different health care providers; (b) schools
and kindergartens have been turned over to local administrations (Gminas), schools have been
rationalized where there is duplication, and a mix o f Gmina fbnding and user fees has been
developed for kindergartens; (c) sports and cultural facilities have been turned over to Gminas or

                                                   24

leased to clubs; and (d) there are multiple approaches being used to divest housing, including
transferring housing to tenant cooperatives. All companies have non-coal commercial subsidiaries
which typically are used as vehicles to provide alternative employment for miners upon mine
closure. The remaining non-coal commercial subsidiaries are also beingprogressively divested.

Environment. Miningoperations inPoland have been a significant source o f water pollution, land
degradation, and to a lesser extent air pollution problems. From 1998-2002, the industry reduced
the two most critical discharges identified by a 2000 Sector Environmental Analysis (SEA): (a) salt
water discharges into surface waters were reduced by 25 percent , and (b) waste disposal from
mining operations and coal preparation plants was reduced by 30 percent . Poland has a well
articulated environmental regulatory and institutional framework in place to manage these issues
based on user fees for environmental discharges. As part o f the hard budget constraint, the mining
companies will be required to stay current on all payments to environmental authorities for current
production..

Saline Water Discharges. Rather than investing public funds inlarge desalinationplants, the SEA
identified less costly but effective options for addressing the problems o f saline water discharge.
Such options, which have been effectively applied at other mines, include selective mining
techniques, shifting production away from mines with the highest saline water discharges, sealing
closed workings to prevent flow o f salt water from the mines, and salt water treatment by re-
injection or re-direction o f water into underground sedimentation reservoirs for chemical
precipitation o f salt.

Coal Privatization. The Government has prepared two individual mines for privatization -
Bogdanka and Budryk. Thus far, attempts to sell Bogdanka have proven quite difficult, despite the
fact that it i s one o f the youngest, best equipped, lowest cost mines with little inthe way of historic
environmental and health liabilities and less over-employment than other mines. A privatization
advisor was appointed and the mine offered for privatization. The first offering resulted in a
preferred bidder being selected but the sale was not completed because the preferred bidder could
not complete the financing package. A second offering resulted inthree bids being received inlate
2002. The Ministry o f State Treasury (MOST) has decided to withdraw Bogdanka from possible sale
due to the lack o f suitable bids. A privatization advisor was also appointed for the Budryk mine,
but the minehas not yet been offered for sale due to difficulties in verifying legal title to much o f
the mine's asset base. A privatization advisor was appointed for the KHW, and the report on
readiness for privatization will be prepared by end September 2004. A privatization advisor for JSW
will be appointed in the coming months             and the report on readiness o f the company for
privatizationwill havebeen completed by the end o f 2004.

B 2003-2006 HardCoal Sector Restructuring:Program

Original Program.            The original 1998 -2002 Program was drafted and finalized with the
participation o f the Trade Unions who were willing to support the Program partly due to the
relatively generous severance packages included in the Program.            Initially, the Trade Unions
opposed fbrther industry restructuring and rejected the Government's proposal to prepare a new
2003-2006 Program. The 2003-2006 Program, as originally approved by the Council of Ministers
on November 21, 2002 called for 7 mine closures and layoffs o f 30,000 workers, But this was
strongly opposed by the workers and their trade unions because, unlike the 1998-2002 Program, it
involved involuntary layoffs and had no special income support measures for mining industry

                                                     25

workers losing theirjobs. This was at a time when unemployment has risento around or 18 percent
both inSilesia andnationally (from about 6 percent when the reforms started in 1999). Inthe face
of strong protests, the Government made five substantial adjustments to the 2003-2006 Program,
which were adopted by the Council of Ministers on January 28, 2003): (i)           The layoff are now
voluntary (instead o f involuntary); (ii)the number of mine closures has been reduced to four (from
seven); (iii) size o f the targetedlabor force reduction has beenreduced (from 30,000 to 27,200);
              the
(iv) income support measures were introduced for about 14,100 underground workers and job
creation incentives were introduced to create 8,600 jobs outside the coal industry for surface
workers leaving the coal industry. The 2003 - 2006 Program is the next phase of the reform o f the
coal sector. The program timetable specifies that that industrywould be fully privatizedby the end
o f2006 inwhich case the reformwill havebeen completed.

Amended Program. The Program was amended accordingly and the Amended Program was
approved by the Council o f Ministers on January 28, 2003 - Programfor Restructuring Hard Coal
Mining in Poland in the Years 2003-2006with the Application of Anti-crisis Laws and Initiation of
Privatization of Certain Mines originally accepted November 20, 2002, and Amended Version
accepted January 28, 2003 by the Council of Ministers. The Program envisagesthe following main
economic and social objectives:
0                the economic objective- to improve profitability andfinancialliquidityofthe sector
    so it i s capable o f regular payments of its liabilities including payments of environmental fees;
    and
0                the social objective-to mitigate the social consequences ofprogramimplementation
    and the proposednew sector restructuring.

The objectives are to be achieved by reform in the areas of industry structure; employment
restructuring; mine closure and liquidation; financial restructuring; and privatization. According to
thisProgramprivatizationofthe industryis to becompletedbyend2006.

Government Support for the Program. To achieve these objectives, the Government i s
committed to fund the Program, to provide strong support for affected workers and communities,
and to maintain effective monitoring and auditing arrangements. It i s also committed to maintain a
hard budget constraint on the industry whereby there will be no non-Program subsidies or
guarantees and/or repayments by Government o f commercial debts of miningcompanies.

Employment Restructuringand Social Mitigation Program. The Government objective is to
reduce employment by about 28,000 workers over the period 2003-2006, in a socially responsible
manner. The Program envisages that about 22,700 workers will be severancebenefits to leave the
sector andthat another 7,000 workers will leave the sector through natural attrition from 2003-2006.

Benefits and Assistance for RedundantWorkers. Workers affected by the restructuring will be
offered a cash severance pay and unemployment benefit or pre-retirement allowance as per general
Polishlabor law. Inaddition, a scholarship for retraining will beprovided; and also a reemployment
incentive payments were established to encourage employment of surface miners. Workers will
receivejob counselling services; training needs assessment and organization o f appropriate training;
small business support through business incubators and loans for self employment activities.
Regional development will be assisted under the,,The Programme o f Mitigation o f Effects o f
Employment Restructuring in the Hard Coal Mining sector in Silesia" through enterprise


                                                    26

development, infrastructure development, environmental improvement and redevelopment o f post-
industrial areas and tourism. The "Program of Alleviating Hard Coal Mining Employment
Restructuring Effects in the Region of Silesia" will target support from institutions supporting Small
andMediumEnterprise(SME) development andstructuralEUfunds.

CapacityRestructuringCurrently there is highovercapacity inthe Polishhard coal miningsector.
To balance the market there i s a strong need to reduce sector capacity o f about 12 million tone. The
Programme o f Hard Coal Mining Sector Restructuring during the Period 2003 - 2006 assumes
reduction o f production capacity, due to complete liquidation o f mines, at the level o f 12.7 million
tones, The effects o f capacity downsizing and closure o f inefficient mines should bring the sector
financial stability. The Government program estimates that the cost o f physical closure o f mines
under the Program will be about PLN800 million (about US$200 million).

Financial Restructuring. The process of financial restructuring under the 2003-2006 Program
took place on December 31,2003 under the Act ofNovember 28,2003 on restructuring o f hard coal
sector for 2003-2006. Total accumulated liabilities o f about 18 billion PLN were forgiven and 4
billion PLN were rescheduled. This helped partially rebuild the mining companies balance sheets
andwill prevent the bankruptcies based inthe negative equity o fthe companies.

Environmental Improvements. The amended program notes that environmental improvement
will be a key objective for the program, but specifies no measures or activities.

PrivatizationWhen the 1998-2002 Program was originally developed the Government had little
interest in privatization. Since that time, considerable work has been undertaken regarding the
benefits and feasibility o f privatization, such that Government is now firmly committed to
privatization as the outcome o f the 2003-2006 Program. The 2003-2006 Program specifically states
that Program Implementation will include privatization o f the whole sector by 2006. The program
sets out the following objectives for privatization:

(i)     to raise the efficiency o f enterprises dealing with coal production;
(ii)    to acquire capital from the outside for carrying out rehabilitation and modernization
        investments; and
(iii)   to reduce the involvement of the state from the hard coal mining sector as a whole, as well
        as from the coal companies specifically.

Consultationwith RegionalAuthorities. The Government has addressed the social impacts o f
industrial restructuring and employment downsizing and the Program emphasizes the need for a
coordinated approach towards restructuring o f the hard coal sector in the context o f regional
development o f Upper Silesia. To ensure strong coordination with regional authorities,
representatives o f the Katowice Voivodship and the Malopolska Voivodship were members of the
Committee that produced the "Program of Alleviating Hard Coal Mining Employment
Restructuring Effects in the Region of Silesia" which was accepted by the Council o f Ministers on
January 28,2003.

LocalAuthorities. The Program also fosters cooperation between the mining companies and the
local administration (Gmina) in respect to dealing with past liabilities to the gmina as well as
opportunities arising from the closure o f mines and the reclamation o f abandoned mine sites. The

government has coordinated Program implementation with new powiats (county governments)
which were established effective January 1, 1999, as part of the regional administrative reform.

   1.       INTRODUCTION

   The Governmentof the Republicof Poland has been continuing reforms of the hard coal
mining sector commenced in the beginningof the nineties.


                                                 28

       Implementationof the Government ,,I  998-2002 Hard Coal Mining Reform Program" adopted
by the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Poland on 30 June, 1998, including corrections
thereto, as adopted by the Council of Ministers on 21 December, 1999 has been completed.
Following completion of implementationof the said Program,the new "Program of Restructuring of
the Hard Coal Mining Sector for 2003-2006 using Provisions of the Anti-Crisis Laws and Initiating
Privatizationof Certain Mines" was developed and its implementationwas commenced, following
adoption by the Council of Ministers on 20 November, 2002 (including corrections incorporated
following the Agreement concluded by the Government with the Trade Unions of 11 December,
2002 and corrections resulting from the legal status of the sector, as on 10 January, 2003.) The
Correctionsto the Programwere adopted by the Council of Ministers on 28 January, 2003.

       The current activities under the Hard Coal Sector RestructuringProcess are based upon, as
follows:
       -   the aforementioned Government Program, as adopted by the Council of Ministers on 28
           January, 2003.;
       -    information on the Program implementation including also methods and ways to
           overcome barriersto the restructuring process, as approved, directionally, by the Council
       -   of Ministerson 17 June, 2003;
           operational programs provided by individualmining enterprises.

Implementationof the Restructuring Program is supported by provisionsof the Act of 28
November, 2003 on Restructuring of the Hard Coal Mining Sector for 2003-2006.
     Primary restructuring objectives, as defined under the Program of January, 2003 remain
unchanged. However, under new circumstances including, in particular, enactment of the Act on
Restructuring of the Hard Coal Mining Sector for 2003-2006 new elements are brought into the
restructuring activities. It is also extremely important to prepare documents important for the
EuropeanCommission includingthe plan of access to coal resourcesand the mine liquidationplan
determining the level and purpose of the public finance assistance designated for the coal mining
sector. It is, therefore, necessary for the mining enterprises to develop their own individual action
plans determining basic principles and rules of operations of such enterprises and their production
units as well as actions necessary to be undertaken in the nearest future. The above documents
will facilitate development of a comprehensive "Strategy of Development and Restructuring of the
Hard Coal Mining Sector in Poland until 2010",

      II. EFFECTS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF 1998-2002HARD COAL MINING REFORM
PROGRAM

    The miningsectorwas undergoingrestructuringat that time on the basis of the Government"1998-
2002 Hard Coal Mining Reform Program"as adopted bythe Councilof Ministerson 30 June, 1998as
well as, since the year 2000 - "The Corrected Government 1998-2002 Hard Coal Mining Reform
Program",as adopted by the Councilof Ministerson 21 December,1999.
         The process of Reform implementation was supported by the Act of 26 November, 1998 on
Adjustment of the Hard Coal Mining Sector to Operation under Conditions of the Market Economy
and Specific Rights and Objectives of the Mining Gminas, which entered into force on 14 January,
1999.



    1. Reformobiectives.

    The general objectives of the hard coal mining Reform Program and the corrected hard coal
mining reform have been defined as follows:

                                                 29

               1) adjustmentof businessentitiesoperatinginthe hard coal miningsector to operation
                   under conditions of marketeconomy and retainingthe competitiveadvantageof the
                   Polishcoal on domesticmarkets;
               2) meeting, until the year 2010, of the domestic coal demand and economically
                   justified exports in compliance with requirements of environment protectionand
                   competitiveness under conditions determined by the European Union assuming
                   opening of the markets of all energy carriers while maintaining the principle of
                   bilateral advantage.
        Deterioration of the hard coal position on the market during the period 1998 - 1999, as
expressed by exceeding, significantly, the levels of hard coal sales, as assumed under the Reform
Program and decline of the coal prices, created the need to develop correctionsto the Government
Program, as adopted by the Council of Ministerson 21 December, 1999.
        The Corrected Government Reform Program assumed the following goals to be
implementedto ensure achievement of general objectives, as determined under the Program:
                   miningcompanieswill ceaseto generate losson coalsales not laterthan bi2001,
                   in 2002 mining companies will achieve a positivefinancial result (net);
                   the hard coal mining sector production capacity will be reduced by 2002 by ca.
                   36 million in terms of annual output;
                   during the period 2000 - 2002 the employment in the mining sector will be
                   reduced by ca. 48 thousand persons i.e. to reach the levelof ca. 128thousand;
                   the impact of mining upon the naturalenvironment will be reduced as well as the
                   levelof damages to the environment thereby ensuring, by 2005, compliance with
                   the environmental requirementsby the entire mining sector.
                   The corrected Reform Program providesfor the following activities assisting the
                   mining sector to achieve profitabilityas of the beginning of 2001:
                   additional employment reductionin mines by ca. 10 thousand;
                   accelerating termination of production in mines designated for liquidation in
                   order to complete their liquidationone year earlier than originally planned;
                   shortening of the mine liquidationperiods - by 3 monthson the average;
                   additional surplus capacity reduction by liquidation of ineffective and surplus -
                   given decline in output -fields, areas and productionlevels;
                   introductionof changes to the assumptions of the Miners'Social Package (MSP)
                   to reduce employment restructuring costs and increase attractiveness of social
                   allowances;
                   establishment of mine restructuring company-Spolka Restrukturyzacji Kopaln
                   S.A. (SRK)- to ensure more effective mine liquidation process and more
                   effective managementand disposal of assets of liquidatedmines;
                   undertaking various other remedial actions to ensure further reduction of costs
                   of operationsof businessentities operating in the hard coal mining sector.
        As a consequence of the changes introducedto the Programthe Act of 26 November, 1998
on Adjustment of the Hard Coal Mining Sector to Operation under Conditions of the Market
Economy and Specific Rights and Objectives of the Mining Gminas was amended by the
Parliament. The amendments were adopted by way of the Act of 15 December, 2000 that came
into force on 8 February,2001.




                                                  30

     2. CaDacity licluidation

     During the period 1998 - 2002 overall production capacity was reduced by 34.52 million
tonedyear. Complete liquidation of mines reduced overall capacity by 13.9 million tonedyear,
while partial liquidation contributed further 7.6 million tonedyear. Liquidation of areas, fields and
levels and reduction of the length of operational long walls contributed to capacity reduction by
further 7.39 milliontoneslyear and 5.63 milliontonedyear respectively.

       During the years 1998 - 2002, production was terminated in 13 totally liquidated mines and,
due to liquidationof movements, in 10 partially liquidatedmines.


       3. EmDloymentrestructurinq

       During the period 1998-2002 the level of employment in the hard coal mining sector was
reducedfrom 243,304 employees to 140,717 i.e. the employment was reduced during the five year
period of Programimplementation by 102,587persons Le. 42.2%.

      The Miners' Social Package (MSP) constituted the main instrument of the employment
restructuring process, conducted without any social unrest. During the period 1998 - 2002 the
MSP was used by the 67.0 thousand mine employees Le. by ca. 1.4 thousand more than originally
assumed under the Government Program. From the entire list of MSP measures, miner leaves
were the most popular, used by 36.9 thousand employees. One-time unconditional severance
payments were used by 29.7 thousand employees. Contribution of social allowances to
employment restructuringwas marginal-taken by 419 personsonly.
      4. Financialrestructurinq

       As at the end of 1997the total liabilitiesof the hard coal mining sector amounted to PLN 13.3
billion. In the course of 1998 liabilities increased by further PLN 3.2 billionto reach the total of PLN
16.5 billionat the end of the year.

       The Government Program assumed, for the period 1998 - 2002, restructuring of liabilities
due to the State Treasury, the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS), the Labor Fund, The Fund for
Guaranteed Employee Benefits and the National Fundfor Rehabilitationof the Disabled (PFRON),
as well as Voivodship Fundsfor Environment Protectionand Water Management and Gminas.
       However, the effects of the debt restructuring process conducted in 1999 - 2000 under
provisions of the Act of 26 November, 1998 on Adjustment of the Hard Coal Mining Sector to
Operation under Conditions of the Market Economy and Specific Rights and Objectives of the
Mining Gminas were not satisfactory. Difficulties experienced by mines and mining companies in
remaining current, as of 1 January, 1999, in execution of payments due to ZUS, the Labor Fund
and the Fund for Guaranteed Employee benefits constituted a major obstacle to increase the
number of debt restructuring agreements concluded. The need to remain current in payment of
current liabilities constituted one of the pre-conditions of implementation of debt restructuring
proceedings.
      Amendments to the said law, introduced by the Act of 15 December, 2000, provided an
opportunity to regulate payment of accounts payable due to ZUS, the Labor Fund and the Fundfor
Guaranteed Employee benefits, as of 1 January, 1999, by provisions of agreements concluded by
and betweendebtors and ZUS. Furthermore, amended law provided the mining enterprises with an
opportunity to correct the results of the debt restructuringprocess by extending, by 2 years i.e. until
the end of 2002, the period during which the debt restructuringcould be conducted. In addition, the
deadline for deferral of payment of liabilities was also extended by 2 years i.e. until the end of
2002. Debt restructuring application could be submitted also by mining enterprises established


                                                    31

after 30 June, 1999 Le. after the deadline for application submission provided for in the Act of 26
November, 1998 on Adjustment of the Hard Coal Mining Sector to Operation under Conditions of
the Market Economy and Specific Rights and Objectives of the Mining Gminas. The opportunity
was used by Spolka Restrukturyzacji Kopaln S.A. (SRK), Bytomska Spolka Restrukturyzacji
Kopaln Sp. z 0.0. (BSRK /limited liability company/) and four mining plants - subsidiaries of the
Bytomska Spolka Weglowa S.A. (BSW)
      Besides the solutions describedabove, the amended Act provided also for debt forgiveness
relativeto liabilities of totally liquidated mines, upon transfer of such mines to a mine restructuring
company. Debtforgiven could include liabilities due to ZUS, the Laborfund and the Fundfor
Guaranteed Employee Benefits incurred prior to 1 January, 1999 and liabilitiesdue to other
creditors incurred by the end of 1999.
      In effect of the financial restructuring process conducted during the period 1999- 2002 under
the Act of 26 November, 1998 the debt forgiveness covered the total of PLN 2.6 million of debt of
completely liquidated mines transferred to mine restructuring companies. In addition, liabilities in
the amount of PLN 442.0 million remained for restructuring, including PLN 385.3 to be repaid in
installments, remainedfor restructuring after 2002.
    The Act of 26 November, 1998 on adjustment has failed to achieve effective debt restructuring
by the end of 2002, since only PLN 3.0 billion Le. 18.9% of debt was restructured by the end of
2002 out of the total amount of debt offered for restructuringof PLN 15.9 billion.

      5. Environment protection

       Activities undertaken by mining companies regarding reduction of their negative
environmental impact in the course of five years of reform implementationgenerated the following
results:
                          reduction, relativeto the levels of 1997, of discharge of chloride and sulphate
                          loads, in unused undergroundwaters, to surface waters, by ca. 406,900
                          tonedyear (ca. 90% of the total effect assumedfor the Program);
    -   reclamation and re-use of 976 ha of post-industrial land (exceeding the effects assumed
    -   under the Programby ca. 33%);
        underground utilization, in 2002 by mines, of coal wastes generated by these mines in the
        total volume of 1,948 thousand tones.
    Inthe course of the Government Reform Programimplementationthe hard coal mining sector
significantly reduced- in 2002 relativeto 1997-the volume of mining wastes stored on the
surface by ca. 88%. At the same time, duringthe period 1998-2002 the share of commercial
surface utilizationof mining waste relativeto the total mining waste generated increasedfrom ca.
52% in 1997to ca. 88% in 2002. These wastes were primarily utilized in civil engineering and
hydro-technicalworks (including:land levelingand reclamation, constructionof roads and railways,
constructionof flood protectingwalls on rivers and water flows in areas of mining operation).

6. Changes in oraanizationalstructure

Inthe beginningof 1998the structureof the hard coal miningsector includedseven miningcompanies
operatingthe total of 53 mines.Therewere also 8 independentmineswith the legalstatus of joint stock
companiesand two state ownedenterprises.Overall,the hard coal miningsectorwas made up of 63
minesincluding57 producers.
        Following amendment of the Act of 26 November, 1998the following entitieswere
established: Bytomska Spolka RestrukturyzcjiKopaln Sp. z 0.0. (BSRK) and Spolka
RestrukturyzacjiKopln S.A. (SRK) to group liquidated mines. Thus, the mine liquidationprocess
was separatedfrom remedialand turnaround processescovering the remaining mines.




                                                     32

        As on 31 December,2002the hardcoal miningsector included7 miningcompanies, 3 independent
mines(two inthe formofjoint stock companyand one limited liability company)and 2 minerestructuring
companies. There were 41 active producers inthe sector.
        Withinthe framework of actions designatedto streamlinetheorganizational structure ofthe sector,
consolidationprojectswere developed in2002to establish 3 miningconglomerates, butdueto strong
resistanceonthe partof unionstakeholders the projectswas notcarried out.


7. Privatization

Privatizationrelatedactivities included actions undertaken relativeto two independentmines
owned by the State treasury: LubelskiWegiel "Bodganka" S.A. and KWK "Budryk" S.A. However,
relevantauthoritiesfailed to select a potentialinvestorfor LW "Bodganka" S.A. by the end of 2002,
while privatizationrelated activities involving KWK "Budgryk S.A. were suspended untilthe mine
regulatesthe legal status of all its assets.
Inthe area of capitalalliances betweenthe mining sector and the power sector Nadwislanska
SpolkaWeglowa (NSW) S.A. acting together with the Power Plant JAWORZNO Illset up a
commercialcode company Zaklad Gorniczo-Energetyczny"Sobieski-Jaworzno111" Sp. z 0.0.
(mining and power generating plant SOBIESKI-JAWORZNOIll Itd.).
No privatizationrelated activities were conducted relativeto any other hard coal mining sector
entities.

        8. Proaram financing

      During the Program implementation period relevant State Budget expenses amounted to the
total of PLN 6.5 billion. The highest amounts of resourceswere spent during the first three years of
implementation; in 1998- 2000 budgetarysupport amounted to PLN 4.3 billion (including66.7% of
total resourcesgranted by the State Budget).

The greatest share of funds was allocated to employment restructuringcomponent of the Program
-PLN4,312.8millionLe.66.0%ofthetotalbudgetfunds,withhighestexpendituresmadein1999.
Duringthe same period, funds allocated to finance mine liquidationaccountedto 21-8%of the total
i.e. PLN 1,422.6 million.
        9. Restructuringresults

      In the course of 1998 - 2002 the level of domestic market demand for coal gradually
declined. The decline was deeper than originally assumed under the Government Reform
Program. Lower level of domestic coal sales forced mining companies to increase export sales
over and above the levels assumed under the Program throughout the entire period of 1998 -
2002, excluding the year 2000. Thus the export sale reductionrate was slower in 1998- 2002 than
assumed underthe Government Reform Program.

      Lower domestic sales relativeto the Program assumptions combined with higher export sales
resulted in reduction of sales revenue in 1998 - 2002 thereby deteriorating an already very
precariousfinancial situationof individualcompanies and the entire hard coal mining sector.
      Reduction of coal demand resulted in a significant decrease of the average coal price in 1998
-1999.
      In 1998 the average coal price was 121.55 PLN/tone and was higher than in 1997 only by a
factor of 1.7%, assuming average annual inflation rate at 11.8%. In 1999 average coal price
declined to 117.80 PLN/tone Le. below the 1997 level. The year 2000 brought about an increase in



                                                  33

coal prices to the level of 131.91 PLN/tone and subsequently in 2001 - to 144.16 PLN/tone. In
2002, again the price decline was registeredto the level of 142.55 PLN/tone.
      Systematic reduction of unit sales costs from the level of 144.16 PLN/tone in 1998 to 129.54
PLN/tone in 2000 helped the hard coal mining sector to generate a positive unit result on coal
sales at 2.37 PLN/tone. Thus, the positive result was achieved one year earlier than originally
assumed under the Program.
      In spite of improvement in terms of financial results and commencement of the debt
restructuring and forgiveness procedures, the sector failed to achieve one of the Program
objectives i.e. achievement of the positive net financial result in 2002. The mining sector
registered, for the year 2002, a loss in the amount of PLN (-)608.7 million, against the profit, as
expected under the Program, of PLN 568.5 million.
      In general, it is clear that in spite of doubtless progress in restructuring process achieved in
certain areas, specifically in capacity and employment reduction - the overall objectives of the
Program have not been achieved. Partial objectives achieved failed to resolve major problems of
the hard coal mining sector including, in particular, the high level of outstanding debt and lack of
financial liquidity.

    II.     THE NEW PROGRAM OF RESTRUCTURING OF THE HARD COAL MINING
            SECTOR FOR 2003-2006.

            1. Energy policy

        In keeping with provisions of the "Assumptions of the Poland's energy policy for the period
until the year 2020" hard coal is and will remain in the near future the primary energy carrier in
Poland.
During the coming more than ten years, there will be no significant changes in the structure of fuel
consumption by the utility power sector; coal will remain its primaryfuel. Increasein consumption
of gas as a primaryfuel can be achieved only after the results of the analysis of multi-year liabilities
and the level of evening up of the balance of payment are fully confirmed.Thus, the investment
efforts undertaken during the recent years (and continuedto be undertaken) to expand the existing
potentialand environmentprotectioninstallationsin power plants and coal handling plants can be
properly discounted.
        Considering the importanceof hard coal in the energy balance of Poland (ca. 50% of
electricalenergy is generated using hard coal as fuel), it is necessaryto continue the process of
hard coal mining reformto achieve full financial stability of the sector's operations by adjusting
productioncapacity to market needs.

            2. Program objectives

      On 28 January, 2003 the Council of Ministersadopted ,,Programof Restructuring of the Hard
Coal Mining Sector for 2003-2006 using Provisions of the Anti-Crisis Laws and Initiating
Privatization of Certain Mines (including corrections resulting from Agreement concluded with the
Trade Unions of 11 December, 2002 and corrections required by the legal status of the sector, as
on 10 January, 2003)", with the following objectives:
      - economic-financial objective: achievement of profitability and systematic reduction of
          overdue liabilities of the entire sector and ensuring that the sector remains current in
          paymentof all accounts payable; includingenvironmentalcharges;
      - socialobjectives:mitigationofeffectsofemploymentrestructuring,carriedoutto-dateand
          infuture, by creationof newjobs implemented, infer alia, under regional programs.

The list of basictasks to be performed includes,as follows:


                                                    34

      -   implementationof organizationaland structuralchanges;
      -   carrying out financial restructuringand improvementof sector'sfinancial liquidity;
      -   adjustmentof productioncapacityto market needsand adjustmentof employmentto such adjusted
          capacity.
      With respect to structural and or anizational changes the following are considered the most
important: establishment, during the Is of 2003, of KompaniaWeglowa S.A. (KW S.A.) by
                                         ?quarter
way of contribution of 23 mines and 9 mining plants previously operating within structures of:
Gliwicka Spolka Weglowa, Nadwislanska Spolka Weglowa, Rudzka Spolka Weglowa, Rybnicka
Spolka Weglowa and 4 mining plants of the Bytomska Grupa Kapitalowa, as required to conduct
productionoperations.
      With respectto financial restructuringand improvementof financial liquidity, the generally
applicable laws and regulationsare assumedto be applied including, in particular, as follows:

      The Program assumed re-capitalization of KW S.A. by injection of funds in the amount of
PLN 3,500 million to be used, infer alia, for repayment of liabilities,of mining companies, including
debt not subject to restructuring under the law on restructuring of certain liabilities due to public
entitiesfrom businesses.
      In the area of adjustment of production capacity to market needs as well as adjustment of
employment levelto such adjusted capacity, the following has been assumed:
      -  reduction of production capacity by complete liquidationof mines during the period 2003 -
            2006 will amount to 12.7 milliontones;
      -   during the period 2003 - 2006 employment is estimated to be reduced by 27.2 thousand
          employees including reduction in KW S.A. by 18.8 thousand employees; the results
          should be achieved primarily though natural attrition and termination of employment for
          reasons on the part of the employee, assuming that all underground employees and
          employees of mechanical coal processingwill find jobs in active mines.

Overall progresstowards meetingthe targets will be reviewed in early 2005.

The sector restructuringprocess will be supported by companion "Program of Alleviating Hard
Coal Mining Employment Restructuring Effects in the Region of Silesia" which expects to
mobilize ca. PLN 700 million in investment outlays in Silesian region during the period 2004 -
2006.

            3. The Act on Restructuringof Hard Coal MiningSector

      On 28 November,2003 the Parliament adopted the Act on Restructuringof Hard Coal Mining
Sectorfor 2003 - 2006. The Act entered intoforce on 29 December, 2003.
        The Act provides for measures requiredto achievethe hard coal mining reform and
restructuringobjectives, including as follows:
      -   opportunity to achieve a comprehensive debt forgiveness and restructuring by offering
          repayment in installments (until 2010) of liabilities with respect to retirement premiums,
          social insurance premiums payable by the insured person and social insurance
          premiums;
      -   mitigation as well as activization and adaptation package for employees of mining
          enterprises;



                                                   35

      -   guarantees of employment of to undergroundand mechanical coal processing employees
          in active mines in case they decide not to take up the said package
      -   undertaking, by the State Budget, and continuous coverage, until expiry, of costs of
          previously introduced MSP, borneto date by mining companies;
      -   financing, by the State Budget, of costs of capacity reduction and related costs (mining
          damages land reclamation, protecting againstflooding etc.).
      The Law also provides for the KW S.A. to take up not forgiven debt of mining companies,
which contributed their mines and mining plants to KW S.A. Thus, KW S.A. will become a party to
further financial restructuring proceedings. Under the circumstances described above there is no
longer any justification for operation of these mining companies within the hard coal mining sector
structures.

            4. Capacity reduction
      At present, production capacity of the hard coal mining sector in Poland is estimated at the
total of 103 million toneslyear, including power coal at around 88 million tones and coking coal at
15 million tonedyear. This breakdown based on current production plans is relatively artificial in
view of certain flexibility of the mines in selection of deposits developed and various ways the coal
type 34 (gas-coking coal) is used. Certain types of this coal may be used both as a fuel for power
sector and as coking coal.
      The hard coal mining sector capacity reduction is planned to match supply and demand.
      The Program of Restructuring of Hard Coal Mining Sector for 2003-2006 assumes reduction
of productioncapacity, due to complete liquidationof mines, at the level of 12.7 milliontones.
      In view of favorable trends on the hard coal market and social situation in Silesia the capacity
reduction process will be spread over the periodof 2004 - 2006.
      The capacity reduction schedules are included in business plans developed by individual
mining companies with 4.3 milliontpy of capacity closing in 2004.

            5. Employment restructurinq

      At present, the hard coal mining sector employs 137.4 thousand persons, including 76.8%
employed underground and 23.2% of surface employees.
      In spite of a significant employment reduction achieved during the previous years there is a
need of further employment reduction in order to cut costs, improve productivity and, thereby,
ensure profitabilityof the sector's operations.
      The Program of Restructuring of Hard Coal Mining Sector for 2003-2006 assumes
employment reductionin the hard coal mining sector by 27.2 thousand employees.
      The mitigation as well as activization and adaptation measures provided for in the Act on
Restructuringof Hard Coal Mining Sector well respondto the current social situation in Silesia. The
Government recognizes that further employment restructuring is taking place at a time of much
higher unemployment that at the start of the 1998-2002 Reform Program. Accordingly and
following discussions with social partners, the Act provides for voluntary take up of these
measures. Variety of measures and relevant provision levels should ensure achievement of the
Program'sobjectives in the area of employment restructuring.
      Effectiveness of individual mitigation and activization measures will be subject to ongoing
monitoringefforts and relevant conclusions regardingeffectivenesswill be developed by the end of
the 3rdquarter of 2004.
        As in the case of capacity reduction, the employment reduction schedules have been
included in business plans developed by individual mining companies with an employment
reduction, based on present expectations, of nearly 11,000 in 2004 of which about two thirds are
expected to leave using severance instruments under the Act on Restructuringof Hard Coal Mining
Sector.

            6. Oraanizationaland structuralchanqes

      At present, there are 6 coal-producing entities within the hard coal mining sector. Three
companiesgroup in total 37 operational mines, including:
                      0   KompaniaWeglowa S.A. - 23 mines,
                      0   KatowickaGrupa Kapitalowa(KGK) -9 mines (including 1 mine having the
                         limited liability company status),
                      0  JSW S.A. - 5 mines.
      Three mines: KWK ,,Budryk S.A., KWK Lubelski Wegiel ,,Bogdanka" S.A., Zaklad Gorniczo
Energetyczny ,,Sobieski-Jaworzno 111"      Sp. z 0.0. operate outside of the structures of the above
mentioned mining companies.
      Furthermore, there are two restructuringcompanies in the sector: SRK S.A. and BSRK Sp. z
0.0. grouping mines under liquidation.
      KW S.A. was established on 1 February, 2003 by way of contribution by: RSW, GSW, NSW
and Rybnicka SW and four mining limited liability companies wholly held by BSK SA (ZG Bytom Ill,
ZG Centrum, ZG Piekary, ZG Bytom II),of enterprisesunder provisionsof art. 55' of the Civil Code.
In returnfor contribution of enterprises,the KW S.A. undertook to provide all benefits under liabilities
relating to operationsof such enterprise (indemnificationcommitment) to the amount 5% higher than
the value of respectiveenterprise.
Furthermore,activities relativeto:
      -   transfer of supervision over shares of Weglozbyt S.A. to KW S.A.,
      -   establishmentof a commercial code company by KW S.A. and PKE S.A. under a merger

      -   process-,,KWK Janina Sp. z o.o.",
          analysing of a joint venture with participationof KWK Boleslaw Smialy, Huta Laziska S.A.
          (Laziskasteel plant) and ElektrowniaLaziska S.A. (Laziska Power Plant),
      -   incorporationto KW S.A. or liquidation of mining companies that contributed their mines
          to KW S.A.
will be continued.

            7. Financialrestructuring

      The process of financial restructuringcontinued to date failed to achieve significant reduction
of debt of mining enterprises. As at the end of the period of 11 months of 2003 the Profit and Loss
Accounts have shown forgiveness of debt in the amount of only PLN 844.7 million. The said debt
was forgiven exclusively on the basis of the previous mining sector restructuring law.
      The Act on hard coal mining sector restructuring during the period 2003 - 2006 provides for
extension, relative to the previous applicable laws and regulations, of the scope of forgiveness of
debt outstanding to public entities, including interest, and the relevant debt is forgiven by the ex
officio,upon entry of the Act intoforce.
      The Act provides also for deferral of payment, until 31 December, 2004 and, subsequently
repayment by 31 December, 2010, of liabilities of mining enterprises regarding retirement pension
premiums, social insurance premiums in part payable by the insured person and premiumsto health
insurance.
      The restructuring conducted on the basis of the Act of 28 November, 2003 is estimated to
includethe debt in the total amount of PLN 20.1 billion includingdebt to be forgiven in the amount of
PLN 18.0 billion while deferred repayment is expected to apply to the amount of PLN 2.1 billion. The
above amounts include also amounts of debt subject to debt restructuring process under the
packageof the Anti-Crisis Laws.
      Debt forgiveness, in the amount of PLN 18.0 billion, will ensure reductionof total debt of the
hard coal mining sector to the level of ca. PLN 3.6 billion.This debt, following conclusionof


                                                   37

conciliation agreementswith creditors,will be subject to deferred repaymentin installments. Debt
restructuringand forgiveness proceedingsconducted under the Act of 30 August, 2002 and the Act
of 26 November, 1998with respectto liabilitiessubject to financial restructuringunder the Act of 28
November,2003 on Restructuringof Hard Coal Mining Sector for 2003 - 2006 are subject to
discontinuation by the virtue of the law. Uponforgiveness of debt of mining enterprises security
against such debt repayment, as established upon the assets or rights of such mining enterprises
will also expire.
       In effect of conclusionof the financial restructuring process, the sector will establish proper
basis for profitableoperations. Positive resultsof the financial restructuringprocesswill be secured
by improvementof corporate governance, including:
    0   maintainingstrict budgetary discipline by mining enterprises;
        public release of auditedaccounts and notes;
     0  improvementof the internal audit and control systems;
     0  introductionof effective managementmechanisms.
Appropriate audit and monitoringof financial standings of mining enterpriseswill be ensured by
highquality auditors.
        The Government is committed to the mining companies adhering to a hard budget
constraint and pay all liabilities due to Government for current production while improving their
overalI balance sheet.

             8. Environmentprotection

       Pursuant to the Program Restructuring of Hard Coal Mining Sector for 2003 - 2006 four
mining companies i.e. KW S.A., KHW S.A., JSW S.A., and SRK S.A. have a duty to develop, in
collaboration and agreement with the Ministry of Environment, appropriate ecological and
                                             '
environment protection program and have prepared draft environment protection program for the
mines and plantsfor the period 2004-2006 which are presently beingfinalized.

       KW S.A. developed a working document entitled ,,Environment Protection Program for the
Mines and Plants Operating in the Structures of KW S.A. for the Period 2003 - 2006". Currently,
the document is under verification in view of updating of feasibility studies of KW S.A. mines and
plants, KW S.A. expects the following environmental effects to be achieved:
                 reduction of general volume of sewage discharged to surface waters including
                 general sewage and saline undergroundwaters;
             0   maximum re-use, for commercial purposes, of mining wastes (civil engineering
                 works, land reclamation);
             0   gradual implementationof land reclamationprojectsand re-useof degraded land;
             0   monitoringof environmental impact of coal heaps;
             0   liquidationof unnecessary emissions;
             0   elimination of self-ignitiondanger regardingminingwaste dumps;
             0   boiler equipment modernization;
             0   reductionof excessive noise emissions.
        The KW S.A. environment protection program includes minimizing negative impact on
surface objects and landscape by conducting mining operations in a manner limiting land surface
deformation and provides for introduction of preventive measures in construction works to reduce
mining damages.

       KHW S.A. has developed an ecology and environment protection program. According to this
document KHW S.A. will implement, in the course of 2003 - 2006, environmental projects in the
following areas: protectionof surface waters, reductionof gaseous emissions, waste management,


                                                    38

protectionagainst noise emissionsand reclamationof post-mining land. Simultaneously, KHW S.A.
mines are introducing the EnvironmentManagementSystem in keepingwith IS0 14001standard.

        JSW S.A. expects the following environmental effects to be achieved:

             0   reductionof the impact of undergroundwater discharge upon surface waters;
             0   reductionin volumes of mining waste generated underground and increase in waste
                 utilization;
             0   reductionof fly ash and gaseous emission levels;
             0   reductionof methaneemissions by utilizing methanefor energy generation;
             0   reclamationand re-useof mining waste dumps;
             0   remedying mining damages.

     SRK S.A. is currently in the processof developing its program. The Company has conducted stock
taking exercise regarding land of liquidated mines requiring reclamationworks, including lands available
for future investments(so-calledindustrialparks).

             9. Privatization

       The conceptual document regarding privatizationof the hard coal mining sector, as
developed by the Ministerof StateTreasury,expects the change of ownership structureto ensure
maintainingappropriate level of competitiveness by mining enterprises and ensure effectivenessof
their operationson domestic markets as well as ensure competitive advantage on the export
markets. According to the assumptions, privatizationactivities regarding all mining sector
companies: KHW S.A., JSW S.A., KW S.A., LW "Bogdanka" S.A., and KWK "Budryk will
commence for each of these companies or their successorcompanies in 2006. At present,the
Polish Governmenthas entered the stage of preparationof the sector's privatizationstrategy to
determine possible privatization scenarios for the above-mentioned entities.
       The KHW S.A. privatization process is already under way with the first stage involving hiring
of the privatizationadvisor. Decisionon KHW S.A. privatizationpathwill be madefollowing
submissionof the advisor's report by end of the 3rdquarter of 2004.
       The next step for JSW will be to hire the privatizationadvisor and on the basis of the
advisor's report, the detailed privatizationpathwill be determined in 2005.
       KW S.A., due to the scale of restructuringprogramand the size of the entity,will require more
time and preparationsbefore privatizationprocesscommencement. Inview of the above, the year
2005 seems to be an optimumtime scale to select privatizationadvisor for KW S.A. Hence,the
privatizationpathwould be determined before the end of 2006 on the basis of the advisor's report.
       Detailedactions regarding the organizationaland ownershipstructuresof LubelskiWegiel
Bogdanka S.A. and KWK Budryk will be defined before the end of the 3rd quarter of 2004.

             10. Proqram introductionand implementationmonitoring

            11. Information campaign

      Considering the impact of reforms on the communities in Silesia, the problem of appropriate
provision of information on the purpose of activities undertaken to the public in the region is
extremely important. Special focus should be directed at social groups affected by the reform
results.
      The information campaign has been launched in order to promote knowledge of issues
relatedto the hard coal mining reform among the public. The campaignobjectives are as follows:
      -   provision of complete and exhaustive informationto the public regarding activities carried

ANNEX 2: Major RelatedProjectsFinancedby the Bankand/or other Agencies


The project directly addresses one of the four key issues identified in Section A.1 - namely surplus
employment. As surplus employment is reduced, the project will also indirectly addressthe other two issues
as follows. First, by reducing the surplus employment, the project will help the miningindustry reduce its
cash operating costs which will support the industryin improving its cash flow and reduce losses /increase
profitability. Second, by reducing surplus labor the project will help overcome one o f the major obstaclesto
reducing excess production capacity. By addressing all three main issues (surplus employment, excess
capacity andpoor financial performance) the project will also help move the industrytowards privatization.

Lessonslearnedandreflectedinthe projectdesign
The project design buildson the following lessons leamed from SECAL 2 inthat it directly supports further
restructuring o f the industryusingnew employment restructuringmeasures. The project design also reflects
the broader lessons leamed from SECAL 2, in that it supports implementation o f a comprehensive reform
program that will lead to privatization. The project design also reflects the outcome of a consultation with
mining community representatives, workers, companies and Govemment officials which was held in
Katowice inJune 2003 where employment restructuringand the difficulties o f findingnew employment was
raised as a dominant issue. The project design also utilizes the local labor services system including labor
re-deployment, retraining, and small business assistance, which were supported by the Employment
Promotion and Services Project (Loan 3338-P0L), which had a special focus on Upper Silesia, and
introduced modem labor re-deployment programs throughout Poland.              Further valuable lessons for
actionable programs, and notably the importance of fast acting and targeted income support with demand
driven labor re-deployment programs have been derived from other labor re-deployment operations in the
ECARegion, includingthe PolandRuralDevelopmentOperationandother operations with direct linkages to
privatization in Macedonia, Romania and Turkey. These operations show that the selection of capable
implementing agencies i s crucial. This has been achieved inthe project design through close cooperation in
implementing the 1998-2002 Program between the mining companies' Human Resource Departments, the
Mine Labor Agency (GAP), and the MoESLP local labor offices o f the Katowice Region. The project design
also reflects the experience with the Russia and Uhaine Coal SECAL operations, as well as the Romanian
Government's experience with mining industry restructuring and severance payments.               The Bank's
experience with coal SECALs in the ECA Region has been that implementing coal sector reform is highly
dependenton overall macroeconomic conditions and that a highlevel o f commitment i s requiredover several
years to achieve sustained change in an industry such as coal. The companion growth strategy for Silesia
also recognizes the lessons from Russia and Ukraine that facilitating growth o fjobs at larger enterprises or
through larger investments could also be particularly helpfulinre-integrating into labor force the vulnerable
groups that are least able to compete inthese contracted labor markets.

The OED review of SECAL 2 notedthat the reduction inemployment and costs were significant outcomes o f
the project that slow progress on privatization and modest institutional development impacts were


                                                     43

shortcomings o f the two projects. The HCSML operation will help reduce surplus employment, which i s one
o f the pre-conditions for privatization to take place. It is expected that Bank supervision of the project will
help ensure strong implementation of the employment restructuring activities, which will contribute to
additional institutional development.

OED also commented (in Volume I1Extractive Industries and Sustainable Development) that "A notable
feature of Poland's Hard Coal SECALsIand IIwas that "A notablefeature of Poland's Hard Coal SECALs
IandIIwas that succeededin reducing uneconomicalproduction levels and excess employment without
much social stress. However,    .............attemptsat generating alternative employmentfor laid-off workers in
other sectors and through encouraging small industries fell far short of expectations. This implies that the
complexity of large rehabilitation/closureprojects does not permit adequate attention to the demanding task
of generating alternative employment, which should be the focus of projects outside of the extractive
industries sectors. "



The assistance provided by Bank staff and consultants in supporting implementation of the Government's
Coal Sector Reform Programs has been financially supported by a number o f bilateral agencies including
those o f EU Phare, Canada, the UK, and the US.               The Bank has maintained regular contact with
representatives from the EU and bilateral institutions to keep them informed about progress in Program
preparation. The Council of Europe DevelopmentBank i s helpingfinance regional development/job creation
initiatives through an E 25 million loan to SRK.           The EU has undertaken operations to assist local
committees affectedby support coal sector reform; and following EUmembership, further EUsupport o f the
sector as well as for regional development in Upper Silesia i s envisaged through the Cohesion Fund, In
addition, EBRD has expressed an interest in considering financing or equity contributions as mines and/or
miningcompanies areprivatized.

ANNEX 4: DetailedProjectDescription


The project consists of three broad components: 1) Severance Benefit for Underground Workers (pre-
retirement benefits), 2) Severance Payments, Re-skilling and Employment or Business Start-up Incentives
for Surface Workers, and 3) ongoing commitments from previously implemented Underground Miners'
SeverancePackages.

Component A. Severance Benefit for Underground Workers (1,130 millionPLN)                 -- i s a type of pre-
retirement benefit paid at 75 percent of the workers previous wage for up to a 3 year period or until the
worker qualifies for a miners old age pension (prior to January 1, 2007).           If the affected employee
subsequently decides to accept employment outside o f the mining industry, he/she would be entitledto 50
percent o f the above notedbenefit. Underground workers from liquidated mines who chose not to take this
option are entitled to a permanentjob offer from a mine that i s still operational.

The Government estimates that 14,130 underground miners will accept the Pre-retirement Benefit at an
average cost o f 80,000 PLN per miner. The state owned mining companies are to pay this benefit to
affected employees on a monthly basis. The mining companies are also to pay social security contributions
and the time spent collecting the mining benefit counts as employment in terms of future pension
entitlements. While the maximum duration i s 3 years, the average expected duration i s 22 months (because
o f the varying lengthso f time to reachretirement age).

Component B. Severance Payments, Re-skillingand Re-Employment Incentives for Surface Workers
(605.2 millionPLN)      - i s a severance and redeployment scheme which provides up to 6 months o f training
followed by incentives to encourage employers outside the miningindustryto hire former surface workers or
for former surface workers to start their own businesses. The employee's wage i s set at a maximum of 75
percent o f hisher previous wage while undergoing training and no lower than 75 percent when they
commence employment outside of the miningindustry. If the affected employee has a firmjob offer, the
new employer would organize the training and ifnot, the miningcompany would assume this responsibility.
Ifthe employerorganizes the training, the costsofthe training andthe training wage wouldbereimbursedby
the miningcompany pursuant to an agreement between the employer and the miningcompany. Ifthe mining
company organizes the training, it wouldpay the training wage and training costs directly. When the training
i s employer organized, the maximum duration of the training period i s 3 months whereas when the mining
company i s responsible, the maximum duration is 6 months. The shorter duration for employers takes into
account the on-the-job training aspect o f the training period and the corresponding benefits for the
employers.

A total of 8,600 surface workers are expected to accept this component at an averagecost of 70,000 PLNper
person.    The Severance Payments, Re-Skdling and Re-Employment Incentives for Surface Workers
Component is an option designed for:

(i)oldersurfaceworkers (whoare24-36monthsawayfromretirement). (Itwouldnotappealtothosewho
are less than 2 years from retirement age given that the Collective Agreement prohibits termination in such
cases). The Government expects that 2,500 individuals will accept this option. This sub-component consists
o f either 6 months or 3 months o f training (described above) followed by a permanent job offer (with a
guarantee o f 3 years). The employer has to make a commitment to employ the individual for up to 3 years
and inreturnwill receive 100percent reimbursement o f wages for up to 18 months. The scheme i s designed
so that the maximum wage reimbursement for the employment period i s 50 percent . For example, if after
the training period the employee i s 24 months from retirement, the employer would be reimbursed for the
first 12 months and not for the remaining 12. If an employee i s laid off during this period for a reason not
attributable to the employee, the employer will be requiredto reimbursethe miningcompany the subsidy that
it has received



                                                      47

There are two other types of costs that can be includedinthe agreementwith the employer: training costs of
up to 3,000 PLNper personand capital or fixed costs for tools and equipment necessaryfor the employee to
complete the new tasks of up to 20,000 PLN. The maximum costs per individual are around 81,500 PLN (6
months o f training at 100percent of their previous salary (average wage i s about 3,000 PLNper month) plus
18 months of wage reimbursement at 75 percent of their previous salary plus 3,000 PLN for training and
20,000 PLNfor capital costs).

(ii)youngsurfaceworkers(whoaremorethan36monthsawayfromretirement). Thissub-component
consists of either 6 months or 3 months of training (described above) followed by a permanent job offer
(with a guarantee of 2 years). The Government expects that 6,100 people will accept this option. As inthe
situation with older workers, the scheme is designed so that the maximum wage reimbursement for the
employment period is 50 percent . Inthis case the contracted employment period will always be 24 months
inwhich the employer would be reimbursed for the first 12 months. If employer does not employ the
                                                                           the
individual for the contracted period, they wouldbe requiredto reimburse the subsidy that they have received.

There are two other types of costs that can be included inthe agreementwith the employer: training costs of
up to 3,000 PLNper person and capital or fixed costs for tools and equipment necessary for the employee to
complete the new tasks of up to 20,000 PLN. The maximum costs per individual are around 68,000 PLN (6
months of training o f their previous salary,(average wage i s about 3,000 PLNper month) plus 12months of
wage reimbursement at 75 percent of the previous salary, plus 3,000 PLN for training and 20,000 PLN for
capital costs).

Component C. OngoingCommitmentsfor Underground Miners Severance Packagesfrom the 1998-
2002 Program(3,250 millionPLN)

The previous Miners Socialpackages implementedbetween 1998 and 2002 provided a type o f pre-retirement
incentives with expenditure commitments up to five years. Based on the funding structure agreed to at that
time, a certain set of packages became the responsibility of the Government and a certain set became the
responsibility o f the companies.

The components were selected reflecting the main social mitigation-related activities from the 2003 - 2006
Program as well as the carryover activities under the 1998 - 2002 Hard Coal Reform Program. These
activities are considered high priority and feasible in a difficult labor market and challenging social and
political situation.

The main target group for Component A are the underground workers who will take pre-retirement under the
2003 -2006 Programand their dependents. The mainproject-related outcome for this group i s that they are
able to exit the miningindustryreceiving their retirement payments in a full and timely manner so that they
are able to get on with their lives outside the coal industry. The main target group for Component B (a) are
the surface workers who will leave the coal industry and obtain new employment outside the coal industry.
The main outcome for this group is that they will be able to enter the job market and will be assured of at
least three years employment for B (a) (i)    and at least two years employment for B (a) (ii) reasonable
                                                                                                 at
income levels inrelation to their earnings in the coal industry. The main target group for Component B (b)
are a small group o f surface workers interested in starting their own businesses. The main outcome i s that
they will have the equivalent o f about one year's working capital to establish their business. The main target
group for Component C is undergroundminers who have previously taken pre-retirement (under the 1998 -
2002 Program) and their dependents. The main project-related outcome i s that they receive their retirement
payments ina full and timely manner so that they are able to get on with their lives outside the coal industry.
The population ofthe miningregionwill also benefit fiom the broader economic developments inthe Silesia
Economic Recovery Plan which are aimed at creatingjobs at a time o f significant unemployment inboththe
region and the country. The workers who stay in the mining industry will benefit from more stable job


                                                       48

conditions once the industry reform i s completed. The Polish people at large will benefit from improved
financial performance of the industryas it will be fully able to make its payments to Government instead of
Government revenues beingused to prop up a loss-making industry.

Key inputsfor all o fthe components are (i)  information dissemination about the packages; (ii) rules and
                                                                                                 clear
procedures for administering the packages; (iii)competent staff and adequate information and financial
systems to implement the packages; and (iv) adequate funding. The rules, procedures, staff and systems are
already in place - as demonstrated by fully satisfactory implementation o f the retirement packages carried
over from the 1998-2002 Program. A satisfactory information dissemination programfor the new packages
under the 2003-2006 Program i s being introduced. With regard to the third component, the voluntary
departure, training and re-employment outside the mining industry o f surface workers, an Operational
Manual will be prepared that provides for information dissemination, application and acceptance of workers,
training arrangements, application and selection of employers, matching o f workers and job opportunities,
payments to workers, payments to employers, monitoring and verification of employment and completion of
the two years generated employment for each"younger" surface worker leavingthe industry.

The project directly addresses one of the three key issues identified in Section A.l - namely surplus
employment. As surplus employment i s reduced, the project will also indirectly address the other two issues
as follows. First, by reducing the surplus employment, the project will help the mining industry (and, in
particular, KW) reduce its cash operating costs which will support the industry in improving its cash flow
and reduce losses /increase profitability. Second, by reducing surplus labor the project will help overcome
one of the major obstacles to reducing excess production capacity. By addressing all three main issues
(surplus employment, excess capacity and poor financial performance) the project will also help move the
industrytowards privatization.

Alternatives Considered. There were two main alternatives considered for Bank Lending. The first
alternative was one or more further SECAL's. The main disadvantage was that it would be very difficult to
set the tranche release conditionality for the latter stages o f the program, especially since further as yet
undefined employment and capacity restructuring may be needed. The MoF was also concerned that (a)
there would be a potentially large front-end fee and (b) it would be difficult to synchronize the release o f
funds (which are largely needed at the front-endbecauseof the timingof the mineclosure andredundancies,
as well as the time profile of the carryover costs) with the completion of key actions taking place towards the
end o f the program. The second alternative was to undertake programmatic lending approach which could
have been well suited to address this type of situation through the identification of an overall up-front policy
framework for all o f the operations plus specific triggers for later operations. However, strong opposition of
the trade unions to further employment reductions and mine closures meant that it would be difficult to
define triggers on a comprehensive basis. Instead the preferred approach i s for a narrow focus and an
investment operation that provides direct linkage o f Bank financing to the social mitigation expenditures,
which i s the foremost issue at present.

ANNEX 5: Project Costs

Total employment restructuringcosts are estimated at 1859PLNin2004 o f which 1105 million (PLN59
percent ) are estimated to bepayments receivedbyworkers which would be eligible for Bank financing
under the HCSML and 74 million PLN(41 percent ) are payments for (a) income taxes; (b) employers
share of social security (ZUS) payments; (c) training costs, capital allowances which would not be eligible
for Bank financing. The HCSML loan o f an estimated value of USD200 millionequivalent (approximately
800 million PLN)will cover an estimated 43 percent of the expected employment restructuring costs (of

ANNEX 6: ImplementationArrangements


Management Arrangements The ReformProgram will be largely implementedby the miningcompanies.
The mining companies operate as autonomous, independent companies supervised by independent
Supervisory Boards (Board of Directors) appointed by the shareholder. As part of the Program, annual
operating plans are prepared for eachminingcompany covering planned production, production costs, sales,
capacity closures, employment and employment reduction plans, investments, productivity, projected
environmental improvements, etc. and providing pro forma income statements, balance sheets and cash flow
statementsfor the period.

Ministry of Economy, Labor and Social Policy (MoELSP).           Under the Program and enabling law, the
ownership functions of the Government for the mining companies have been transferred from MoST
(previously the owner) to the Ministry of Economy, Labor and Social Policy (MoELSP).             Therefore,
MoELSP i s responsible for producing the Program and coordinated inputs from other interested parties
(ministries, regional authorities, agencies and NGOs). However, MoST retained the responsibility for
privatization o f mining companies. The Ministry o f Finance (MoF) was responsible for providing finance
for the Program. The labor and social policy staff of MoELSP are heavily involved inensuringthat there are
adequate employment services available to support miners leaving the industry. In addition, they are
responsible for overseeing a Public Information Campaign, and for social monitoring and provision of
employment services for miners.

Ministry of EnvironmentalProtection (MoEN). The Ministry of Environmental Protection (MoEN) was
responsible for managing preparation o f the Sector Environmental Assessment (SEA). The National Fund
for Environmental Protection and Water Management (National Fund) and Voivodship Environmental
Departments will provide advice to the MoEN, as well as the Mining Companies on environmental matters.
Furthermore, MoEN, in conjunction with the Voivodship Environmental Department, will monitor
implementation o f the environmental aspects of miningcompany business plans.

Inter-Ministerial Coal Monitoring Committee (IMCMC)             . An    Inter Ministerial Coal Monitoring
Committee (IMCMC) appointed by the Prime Minister and reporting to the Council of Ministers is
overseeing Program implementation.       The IMCMC consists of Deputy Ministers from four ministries
(namely Ministries of Finance; Economy, Labor and Social Policy; Environment; and State Treasury).

Agency for IndustrialRestructuring (ARP). The Agency for IndustrialRestructuring(ARP) is effectively
the implementing and monitoring agency for the project. ARP i s responsible for processing mining
companies applications for funding support for severance payments for new miners leaves, carry-over of
previously approved miners leaves and the schemes for surface workers. ARP will also undertake field
control visits o f mining companies use o f severance payment funding. ARP i s also responsible for
monitoring industryperformance under the Program. This monitoring will cover both company performance,
as well as the aggregate sector performance and, will be based on the performance targets included as part of
company business plans and associatedemployment contracts. Monitoring was previously been undertaken
by the State Hard Coal RestructuringAgency (PARG) which was transformed into KW at the start of the
2003-2006Program.

Mine RestructuringCompany (SRK). A Mine Restructuring Company (SRK) was established in August
2000 as a separate entity. The objectives of the SRK are: (i)  liquidation of mines assets more effectively
through reducing closure costs and shortening closure time, (ii)
                                                               more transparent and effective use o f closure
funds, and (iii)  management a and disposal of mines assets. The SRK is also undertaking employment
creation initiatives. The SRK will not produce any coal. Costs for closure of entire mines by SRK will be
financed from the state budget, but the companies must finance partial mine closure from their own

resources. The SRK will take over from the existing mining companies the assets and liabilities of mines
where productionhas beenterminated. Liabilities to Government entities will be written o f f inthe SRK.

ANNEX 7: FinancialManagement andDisbursementArrangements


The Bank assessed the project's financial management arrangementsinNovember 2003 and also duringthe
appraisal mission in January 2004. The financial management arrangements of the project are acceptable to
the Bank with exception of the IT system for the management of the Severance Payments, Reskilling and
Reemployment for Surface Workers component which is not yet completed.                Disbursement of     this
component will not start untilthe IT systemi s ready and inplace.

Country Issues. The country financial management issues identified in the Bank's Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) of Poland of 1999, particularly with respect to the need to modemize
accounting and reporting functions, have been addressed through the use o f the program-specific financial
management arrangements at the ARP. InSeptember 2003 the Bank initiated a new CFAA for Poland to
provide updated information on public sector financial accountability arrangements and help to develop a
programfor reforms and capacity buildingto improve transparency and accountability with respect to the use
of public funds. The report i s expected to be issued inthe first half o f 2004.

In2002, the Bankconducted aROSCAccounting &Auditingreview. The ROSCreport onAccounting &
Auditing provides a description and overview of standards and practices in Poland. While there is no
regulatory obligation inPoland to apply InternationalAccounting Standards, the amendedPolishAccounting
Regulations (PAR) inforce commencing2002 have movedto be more inline with InternationalAccounting
Standards (US). However there are still some differences. The application and enforcement of accounting
standards in some public entities should be improved and so that the entities can present reliable financial
results for investors and other users. The implementation of amended Accounting Act effective January 1,
2002 introducingnewrequirements more inline with Intemational Accounting Standards should be carefully
monitored. Past experience shows that the proper application o f the accounting regulations has not always
been fully achieved. The quality o f the audits is unequal and insome cases unsatisfactory. These risks will be
taken into account while designing the auditing arrangement for the loan funds as they move to and are
disbursed by the mining companies and reach the worker who is the final recipient. Inaddition, the Bank
will, uponthe request o fthe coal companies' Supervisory Boards, provide advice onbest-practice procedures
to select appropriate independent auditors.

Strengths and Weaknesses. The strengths that provide a basis of reliance on the project financial
management system include: (i)the experience of MoELSP and the coal companies since 1998 in
implementing the Coal Reform Programs and of ARP since 2003 inmonitoring government support for hard
coal sector; and (ii)overall strong organizational and financial capacity o f ARP as monitoring and reporting
entity.

The weakness of the system i s inthe quality of the extemal auditors o f the coal companies. However, this
will bemitigated for the projectbyrequiring the audit of the project to be performedbyan auditor acceptable
to the World Bank. With regardto the coal companies' financial statements, it has been agreedthat the coal
companies would prepare entity-level and consolidated financial statements in accordance with relevant
Polish accounting regulations .It was further agreed that these entity-level and consolidated financial
statements would be audited in accordance with International Standards on Auditing issued by the
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board o f the International Federation o f Accountants or in
accordance with Polish Auditing Standardsissuedby the National Board of Certified Auditors inPoland and
that the said audited financial statements and audit opinion would be made publicly available, infull, by use
of the intemet and possibly also local newspapers. Finally, the Bank will, upon the request o f the coal
companies' Supervisory Boards, provide advice on best-practice procedures to select appropriate
independent auditors.




                                                       54

Implementing entities.

The Ministry of Economy, Labor and Social Protection (MoELSP) has overall responsibility for program
implementation. MoELSP and Ministry of Finance (MoF) will work closely together to ensure that the
Program i s adequately funded throughout its life with transparency and clear accountability and that the
necessary arrangements are put inplace to ensure satisfactory coordination, implementation, monitoring and
auditing for a Program.

The Agency for Industrial Restructuring (Am) is effectively the implementingand monitoring agency for
the project. ARP i s a joint stock company 100 percent owned by the state that was created in 1990by the
Parliament on the basis of liquidated special funds. The overall objective o f the Agency's activity i s to
support the process of transformation of the Polish enterprises into efficient entities capable of functioning in
free market economy conditions. InMarch 2003 ARP created a new branch in Katowice to undertake the
restructuring role previously undertaken by the now liquidated PARG (State Agency for Restructuring of
Coal Mining). On the basis of the law and agreement with MoELSP, ARP acts as monitoring body of the
coal sector. ARP is responsible for processing mining companies applications for support for severance
payments for new miners leaves, carry-over o f previously approved miners leaves and the schemes for
surface workers. ARP will also undertake program field financial tests of the mining companies' use of
severance payment funds. ARP i s also responsible for monitoring industryperformance under the Program.
This monitoringwill cover bothcompany performance, as well as the aggregate sectorperformance and, will
be based on the performance targets included as part of company business plans and associated employment
contracts.

Flow of Funds. Fundswill flow from the MoF, to the MoELSP, to the Mining Companies, to the mines and
finally to eligible workers in accordance with the financial arrangements documented in the Project
Operational Manual. ARP will receive applications for funds from the coal companies on a monthly basis
and, after verification and consolidation, will forward aggregate applications to the MoELSP for approval
and the transfer of funds directly to the coal companies. The MoELSP will receive loan funds from the
Special Account held by MoF through regular budgetary channels. Inaddition, in respect o f component B
(the severance payments, re-skilling and re-employment for surface workers), funds will flow from the
mining companies to the employers outside the mining industry who will have hired eligible ex surface
workers. The Mining Companies will record the funds received from the government as a subsidy and the
benefit related payments as costs in their accounting books and records in accordance with standard
accounting regulations.

Staffing. The project will utilize the existing staff in MoELSP, MoF, ARP and coal companies. Staff in the
Katowice branch of the ARP will be responsible for the collection of individual reports from the coal
companies and its verification and consolidation. The ARP has assigned 44 staff (including 32 staff taken
over from PARG) to perform monitoring o f the hard coal sector including 9 persons monitoring the labor
restructuring. In addition, the MoELSP in'Warsaw has one ARP employee permanently located in the
ministryresponsible for the reconciliation of the funds sent to the coal mines. The MoELSP and ARP staff
have proven experience to carry out their functions under this project.

Accounting Policies and Procedures. The project accounting and reporting will be on a cash basis in line
with the budgetary reporting requirements. ARP already had in place a set of reporting procedures and
internal controls relating to ex-post verification o f expenditures directly in coal companies.            These
procedures have been expanded to cover the new types o f benefits and additional systemic computer controls
have been added.




                                                       55

The MoELSP and ARP updated the procedures applicable to new components including payments to
employers. These have been included inthe project financial-accounting section inthe Operational Manual
including the roles and the responsibilities of the staff, procedures for collection, verification and
consolidationo f information, the agreedformats ofthe FMRs, and ex post audit procedures.

There i s a strong programaudit department inthe ARP which performs field financial tests of the coal mines
in respect of their receipts of these program subsidies. On the basis of an agreement signed with the
MOELSP to perform such field financial tests as well as a work planprepared and approved by the Director
o f the Katowice branchof the ARP, the programaudit department of the ARP visits each coal minereceiving
subsidies at least once every year. A program audit visit includes the following: (i)     reconciliation of eligible
beneficiaries as included inARP data bases to the coal mines' payroll list; (ii)     sample substantive testing of
the eligibility o f the expenditures; (iii)a review o f source documentation; and a (iv) follow-up on
recommendations from previous visits. On quarterly basis, the ARP provides the MOELSP with a summary
o f the results o f its program field financial tests . The results of ARP's program field financial tests will be
sharedwith the Bank and the project's external auditors.

Internal Audit The internal audit departments operating in the coal companies and at the ARP do not
                    .
directly constitute part of the internal control system of the project. However, and as described above, the
ARP has a strong program audit department which performs on-site field financial tests o f the coal mines in
respect of their receipt of program subsidies.

ExternalAudit. The Polish Supreme Audit Institution, the Najwyzsza Izba Kontorli (NIK),performs an
annual audit o f the state budget. The subsidies provided to the coal sector are included in the budget o f the
MoELSP and as such are auditedby NIK.The coal companies, beingstate owned entities, are also subject to
inspections and audits by the tax authorities, Treasury Control and Regional Control Chambers. The financial
statements of coal companies are also audited by the private auditors for statutory purposes in accordance
with Polish accounting and auditing regulations. It has been agreed that the coal companies would prepare
entity-level and consolidated financial statements in accordance with relevant Polish accounting regulations
.It was further agreed that these entity-level and consolidated financial statements would be audited in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing issued by the International Auditing and Assurance
Standards Board of the International Federation of Accountants or in accordance with Polish Auditing
Standards issued by the National Board of Certified Auditors in Poland and that the said audited financial
statements and audit opinion would be made publicly available, in full, by use o f the internet and possibly
also local newspapers. Finally, the Bank will, upon the request of the coal companies' Supervisory Boards,
provide advice on best-practice procedures to ,selectappropriate independent auditors.

The project will be auditedby independent auditors, in accordance with auditing standards, and on terms of
reference, all of which acceptable to the World Bank. It was agreed during negotiations that NIK would be
an auditor acceptableto the Bank.

The following table identifies the audit reports that will be required to be submitted by the project
implementationagency together with the due date for submission.

Reportingand Monitoring.Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) will be usedfor project monitoring and
supervisionand the formats of these are includedinthe Operational Manual, The ARP will produce a full set
o f FMRs every three months throughout the life of the project and within 45 days of the end o f the quarter.
FMRs will also serve as a tool for disbursement purposes. In addition, the World Bank will monitor the
financial results of the coal companies on a monthly basis.

InformationTechnology (IT) Systems. The ARP uses an in-house developed IT system to monitor the
government subsidies to and financial situation of the coal sector. The system i s fed with the information
received fiom coal companies and after verification the aggregatereports are generatedand sent to MoELSP
(inpaper and electronic form). For the purposes of the project, the ARP will update the IT system inorder
that it can account for and monitor the subsidies to be provided under the Severance Payments, Reslulling
and Reemployment for Surface Workers component. Additionally, the ARP will prepare a user manual as
well as a systems manual by April 30, 2004 and thereafter the ARP will train two additional staff to operate
the system by June 30,2004.

DisbursementArrangements. Bank funds will be disbursed usingreport based disbursement. Supporting
documentation for report based disbursement will be retainedby MoELSP, MoF, and coal companies which
receive the government subsidies and make payments to final beneficiaries i.e. eligible employees and
eligible employees o f ex-surface miners. The MoF will open a Special Account at the National Bank of
Poland or at a commercial bank acceptable to the World Bank. Loan funds will be transferred to the
MoELSP and Coal Companies on the basis of application for funds processed in accordance with existing
government procedures. Withdrawal applications (together with the FMRs, Disbursement Reporting and
Special Account Bank statement) for the replenishments of the SA will be sent to the World Bank every
three months (or inother intervals as agreedwith the World Bank). The first disbursement will be based on
actual expenditures for the documented eligible payments incurred inthe period January 1, 2004 through to
loan effectiveness up to aggregate amount o f  40 million. Subsequent disbursements will be based on
projectedcash forecast to fundexpected eligible expenditures.

Action Plan. As agreed at negotiations, the financial management arrangements of the project will be
strengthened prior to disbursements for Component B (the Severance Payments, Reslulling and
Reemployment for Surface Workers component).

Supervision Plan. During project implementation, the World Bank will review the project's financial
management arrangements in two main ways: (i)review the project's quarterly financial management
reports, periodic financial information of the coal companies including information on meeting hard budget
constrains, as well as the entity's annual audited financial statements and auditor's management letter; and
the annual report o f NIK on the government funds utilized in the coal sector; and (ii) the World
                                                                                          during
Bank's missions, review the project's financial management and disbursement arrangements to ensure
compliance with the World Bank's requirements. A Bank-accredited Financial Management Specialist will
assist inthe supervision process.

HardCoalSector Reform: Estimateofexpectedbenefits ofthe Projecthavebeenprepared (as withthe
PolandPKP Railway Loan) based solely on labor benefits -which suggest what the lower endof the range
mightbe.

TheEmploymentRestructuring(theProject):The economic benefitsofthe employment downsizing is
basedon the future eamings of the redundant employees, with the assumption that at the margin their current
productivity i s zero (i.e. they can leave the industrywithout any adverse effect on production) and that their
future jobs will have positivebenefits for Silesian and Polish GDP. Economic benefits commence when the
redundant workers start newjobs and they are measuredby the wages eamed bythe workers. Economic
benefits terminate when the worker retires. Thus, the commencement o f economic benefits will be basedon
the time each worker stays employedandthe worker's new wage. The contribution to GDP will be greater to
the extent that the jobs filled by redeployed workers are higher productivityjobs. The specialized counseling,
re-qualification training andjob advisory services to beprovidedby the GAP and coal companies aimto
raise productivity by bringingmore efficient matching ofjob seekers and slull requirements of vacancies to
be filled.

Thepreliminary analysis ofbenefits coming fi-om the project arebasedona detailed profile of the sector's
workers (eligible for the program)- broken down by occupation (underground, surface), sex, age and
education attained. This, along with location-specific labor market, has allowed the application of factors
specific to this variables inestimating the probability o f long-termredeployment, expected wage and length
of time untilnormal retirement age.


Mainassumptions:
The analysis hasbeenpreparedbasedonthe spreadsheet model which includes three sections: 1)
Assumptions and analysis; 2) Pre-retirement programs (underground workers); 3) Re-employment (surface
workers).

The assumptionsbelow (such as loadingon salary for ZUS andassumedsalary growthrate) apply to all
sheets. The income tax rate applies to the economic analysis becausethis amount i s immediately deducted
from benefits paid and i s thus a reduction inthe economic cost (butnot the financial). The assumptions
regardingtake-up rate, percent o f employees finding interimjobs, interimwages andpre-retirement period
are basedon information from the miningcompanies used inthe pre-retirement portfolio for underground
workers calculations. The Re-employment calculations include: the number o f surface workers eligible for
the program, take-up rate, percent o f current wage eamed by re-employedworkers.

Followingare the assumptions used inthe base case:
