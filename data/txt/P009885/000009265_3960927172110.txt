MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON PROPOSED LOANS TO INDIA
AND INDIAN PETROCHEMICAL CORPORATION LTD.
FOR A SECOND PETROCHEMICALS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on proposed Bank loans of
US$12 million to India and US$233 million to the Indian Petrochemical Corpora-
tion Ltd. (IPCL) is submitted for approval. The proposed loans would be for
20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate and would help finance the Second Petrochemicals Development Project.
2.       Background.  The Bank's first loan in the petrochemical sector (Loan
2505-IN) made in 1985 is financing the construction of the Maharashtra Gas
Cracker Complex (MGCC), which will be the first such facility in India of
international scale and technology. IPCL, one of the most efficient public
enterprises in India, is implementing this project, which is progressing
according to schedule. Per capita consumption in India of polyolefins is
among the lowest in the world but domestic consumption and imports have been
increasing rapidly. The Government has decided that additional petrochemical
capacity is needed and foresees the possibility of investments amounting to
US$6-8 billion over the next ten years. This future expansion in petro-
chemical production capacity is based on: (a) the projected strong growth of
the domestic market for petrochemicals; (b) the improved availability of
feedstock (ethane/propane fractions) in India; and (c) concern about the large
and growing dependence on imports of commodity plastics.
3.       The Government approached the Bank to review the planned investments
in the sector and where justified to finance some of the projects. The Bank
has completed this review and concluded that additional investments in the
sector are warranted in view of India's capacity for economic production of
petrochemicals. The Bank has also advised, however, that the level of future
investments should be lower than that presently under consideration because of
uncertainties about future trends in domestic and international markets and
that each major investment would need to be carefully scrutinized to ensure
economic viability.
4.       Rationale For Bank Involvement:  The petrochemical sector is
important both because of the size of planned future investments and because
of the role the industry can play in lowering costs of basic petrochemical
inputs to downstream industries. The Government is making progress in
reforming policies to increase competition and efficiency in the sector. The
policy reforms already implemented include reduction of nominal and effective
protection levels for local production of commodity plastics, insistence on
world scale and technology standards )r new investments, bringing feedstock
prices more in line with world prices, and encouragement of the private sector
to compete actively and play a major role in future development of the
industry. The proposed project would enable the Bank to continue to assist
GOI in improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the sector by
supporting economically attractive investments and by strengthening technical
and managerial expertise in the plastic processing industry. The project
would also enable the Bank to continue its ongoing dialogue on industrial
policy reform, particularly as it pertains to the petrochemicals sector. In
this respect, the proposed project fits in well with the Bank's overall



strategy of supporting subsector projects to address outstanding policy issues
and help reduce the cost of basic raw materials as a basis for lowering
currently very high manufactured product costs in India.
5.       Project Objectives.  The objectives of the project are to: (i) expand
capacity to produce basic petrochemicals economically; and (ii) improve
efficiency and quality of downstream plastic products. In addition, the
project would support the CovermiLent in its efforts to further Improve the
incentive framework for the sizable investments being considered for the
petrochemical sector.
6.       Proiect Description, Cost and Financing.  The proposed project
consuists of three components: (a) Investments Component: expansion or
modernization of IPCL's plastics production capacity through (i) expansion of
the MGCC cracker from 300,000 to 400,000 tons per year (tpy) of ethylene and
expansion of the LLDPE/HDPE plant to include an additional 75,000 tpy HDPE
train using ethylene from the proposed expansion; (ii) construction of a
second phase 12,500 tpy wires/cables pc,lyethylene compounding unit at
Nagothane; (iii) establishment of a new 7,500 tpy polycarbonate and
polyphenylene oxide unit; (iv) setting up of a new 60,000 tpy polypropylene
plant; (v) the revamping and expansion to 50,000 tpy of IPCL's existing
butadiene extraction and polybutadiene rubber manufacturing complex in
Vadodara; and (vi) implementation of six minor de-bottlenecking and equipment
modernization schemes at Vadodara and Nagothane. The proposed project
investments involve the least cost cxpansion of production capacities of basic
petrochemicals and will help optimize the use of the existing infrastructure
in IPCL's operations ir. these complexes, enhancing the economics of both
units. (b) Market Development Component: carrying out of a plan of
preproduction imports of polymers for the purpose of developing a market for
products that will be produced by MGCC and the proposed project for the first
time in India; and (c) Technical Assistance Component: a loan of US$12
million for the Central Institute of Plastics and Engineering Technology
(CIPET) for financing testin6 and training equipment and overseas training of
key personnel. This component would help upgrade the technical base of the
plastic processing subsector, promoting new products and improving product
design and quality. It will also help spread the benefits arising from the
expansion of domestic production of petrochemicals to the small scale sector.
7.        The total cost of the project is US$587.0 million equivalent, of
which the Bank would finance most (97%) of the foreign exchange component, or
US$245 million. This would consist of a loan of US$233 million to IPCL (with
the GOI as guarantor) to finance the foreign exchange cost of equipment for
project investments, imports of commodity plastics for market seeding
purposes, incremental working capital and interest during construction on the
Bank loan. Another Bank loan of US$12 million to the Government would finance
analytical equipment and foreign training of staff of CIPET   Schedule A shows
the estimated capital costs and the financing plan; Schedule B gives details
of the amounts and method of procurement and disbursements; Schedule C shows a
time table of key project processing events; and Schedule D gives the status
of Bank Group operations in India. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7688-IN is
being distributed separatcly.
8.       Agreed Actions:  The Government has agreed to: (a) inform the Bank of
any changes proposed in the price of ethane/propane (C2/C3, the feedstock for
the production of petrochemicals), which has recently been set at Rs. 3,300
per ton, and afford the Bank an opportunity to comment on these changes; (b)
review periodically, commencing in calendar year 1991 and every two years



- 3 -
thereafter, the progress of planned investments in Olefins and Aromatic
complexes to assess their economic viability and discuss the results of these
reviews with the Bank; (c) review periodically the minimum economic size
criteria established for petrochemical products and intermediates taking into
account ongoing technological developments; (d) arrange for the timely supply
of adequate quantities of feedstock to IPCL for the purpoFe of the project;
and (e) cause CIPET to furnish to the Bank each year its rolling annual
training and extension program starting June 30, 1991 and to arrange t _Ing
with overseas institutions satisfactory to the Bank.
9.       IPCL has prepared Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) reports for
all project components at both the Nagothane and Vadodara complexes. These
reports were reviewed and found to be satisfactory by the Bank. IPCL has
agreed to build and operate project facilities in accordance with
environmental standards satisfactory to the Bank and carry out a detailed
safety audit by qualified consultants prior to commissioning of the project
facilities to assess the impact of risk to the project area and the
surrounding community. This safety audit is to be completed by December 31,
1990 for the Nagothane complex and by September 30, 1991 for the Vadodara
complex. It was also agreed that IPCL would continue to monitor its
operations to ensure that affluent streams and ambient air quality remain
within Indian standards and take corrective measures when needed. In
addition, IPCL agreed to implement its revised market development plan
furnished to the Bank for LLDPE, HDPE, PBR, PP and such other products as may
be agreed to by the Bank.
10.      Economic Benefits:  The project would support future development of
an economically efficient petrochemicals industry in India. The proposed
project investments have high economic rates of return because they are
largely expansion and debottlenecking of existing facilities. Project
benefits would come from: (a) production of olefins and derivatives at
economically competitive costs to meet India's growing demand; (b) the
introduction and production of durable, high-value engineering plastics; (c)
the modernization and improvement in the technology base of the domestic
plastic processing industry, resulting in improved product design and quality;
and (d) the expansion of the domestic market for new products through improved
availability of raw material supply to plastic processors. The project would
result in annual savings of about US$260 million in foreign exchange over the
estimated productive life of its investment components. It would create
direct employment for about 680 people during the peak project implementation,
of which around 340 would become permanent. It involves valuable know-how and
technology transfer arrangements, which are useful for future development of
the Indian petrochemical sector. The overall economic return for the
investments component is over 37%, with the return cf each component in excess
of 20%.
11.      Risks.  No unusual risks are involved in the specific project
investments. All contracted technologies are proven and IPCL has the
technical and institutional capability to absorb and manage the large and
complex mix of technologies. There is, however, a minor risk that the
domestic market for petrochemicals may not grow as currently envisaged and
that some overcapacity could develop in the late 1990s. The risk would
increase if the level of future investments is not carefully monitored and
domestic prices of the project's outputs were to increase significantly due to
increases in taxes or high feedstock costs. The probability of this happening
is, however, considered low. The Government has agreed with the Bank to
review periodically its sectoral investment strategy to avoid overcapacity
from developing and discuss the results of these reviews with the Bank. With



-4-
regard to domestic prices, the Government is committed to lowering the cost of
manufactured products throug3 gradual policy reforms and rationalization of
basic input prices. The Bank. would through its policy dialogue continue to
encourage the Government to adopt appropriate feedstock prices and reduce
further protection levels as a basis of achieving its objectives.
13.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve them.
