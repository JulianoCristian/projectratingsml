The main objectives of the project\n            are to : i) expand capacity to produce basic petrochemicals\n            economically; ii) improve efficiency and quality of\n            downstream plastic products; and iii) support the Government\n            in its efforts to further improve the incentive framework\n            for sizable investments being considered for the\n            petrochemical sector. The project consists of the following\n            three components : a) investments : i) expansion of\n            Maharashtra Gas Cracker Complex (MGCC) cracker at Nagothane\n            from 300 to 400 thousand tpy of ethylene capacity; ii)\n            setting up a second phase 12,500 tpy wires/cables\n            polyethylene compounding unit at Nagothane; iii) setting up\n            a new 60,000 tpy polypropylene unit at the Valodara complex;\n            and v) setting up a new 7,500 tpy engineering plastics unit\n            at Valodara; and v) implementation of debottlenecking and\n            equipment modernization schemes; b) technical assistance :\n            strengthening of Central Institute of Plastic Engineering\n            & Technology (CIPET) through financing imports of\n            testing and training equipment and through training of key\n            personnel who will teach sponsored courses; and c) market development."}, "docdt": "1990-08-22T00:00:00Z"}
