performance was partly satisfactory and partly\n            highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned include: subsector\n            approaches are not effective ways of addressing distortions\n            in a sub-sector; pricing covenants should state the\n            principles on price calculation; upgrading the technological\n            basis of institutions merits Bank support to optimize the\n            financial return of the project; expansion investments\n            should not be approved until production of existing plants\n            has stabilized, or started; requirements for well-prepared\n            timely environmental impact assessment (EIA) strengthen and\n            modernize environmental and safety systems; and government\n            approval should be required for board presentation."}, "docdt": "1998-09-02T00:00:00Z"}
