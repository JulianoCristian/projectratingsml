Development Project in\n            Madgascar was implemented. The Bank failed to see that the\n            increase in production through area expansion had\n            excessively stretched the Hasy Madgascar, Cotton Marketing\n            Parastatal (HASYMA) supervision capacities, which affected\n            yields and farmers' repayments. The Borrower has been\n            fairly supportive of the project, particularly during the\n            expansion phase. The project is rated as unsatisfactory. The\n            project failed to set up a viable institution for the cotton\n            sub-sector, as the financial situation of HASYMA has\n            considerably worsened during the project period and this\n            parastatal is still technically insolvent. The experience\n            from this project shows that: the project was aimed from the\n            beginning at providing more domestically produced cotton\n            fiber to the local textile mills, as such, it fitted with\n            the prevailing self-sufficiency and exchange rate policies.\n            The continuous presence of a cotton specialist in\n            supervision missions could have detected these deficiencies\n            at an earlier stage; and In-depth studies were carried out\n            on the restructuring of HASYMA following the 1986-1987\n            events, with few results despite donor pressure for change.\n            It was agreed, however, that HASYMA could take independent\n            marketing decisions for its fiber, and export cotton if it\n            could obtain better prices."}, "docdt": "1992-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
