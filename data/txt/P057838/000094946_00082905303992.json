    accessible, and efficient judiciary, essential to\n            governance, the rule of law, and an investment climate.

Improved legislative framework will be\n            enhanced through advisory services, and study tours; 2)\n            ensure the rehabilitation of court facilities, enhance\n            security, and improve access to the courts. Construction,\n            and rehabilitation of court buildings, include design,\n            engineering, and supervision costs, as well as equipment,\n            and furniture supply; 3) provide assistance to the Judicial\n            Training Center, in coordination with other donors, in\n            particular, the European Union. Training techniques, and\n            curricula will be developed, and monitoring and evaluation\n            processes will be designed through technical assistance\n            provision; 4) improve enforcement of court decisions, aiming\n            at strengthening the Enforcement Service capacity, the\n            professional development of its staff, and, includes\n            automation services; 5) develop a comprehensive strategy for\n            information dissemination, and improve access to legal\n            information by courts, through technical assistance, and the\n            establishment of an electronic database; and, 6) develop\n            public awareness, and education campaigns, through public\n            relations strategies for the judiciary, and adequate\n            training to journalists in legal issues. Judicial surveys\n            will be conducted at preparation, to seek the current public\n            awareness towards legal institutions in the country."}, "docdt": "2000-08-21T00:00:00Z"}
