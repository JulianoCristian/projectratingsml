Re: Armenia:  Credit No. 3417 AM (Judicial Reform Project) 
Amendment to Increase in Authorized Allocation of the Special Account
Dear Mr. Minister: 
 
We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) (Armenia Judicial Reform 
Project), dated December 14, 2002, between the Republic of Armenia (the Borrower) and the 
International Development Association (the Association). We also refer to your letter of August 
5, 2003 to the Association requesting an increase of the authorized allocation for the Special 
Account. We are pleased to inform you that the Association has agreed to your request and 
paragraph 1 of Annex A to Schedule 1 to the DCA has been amended as follows: 
 
“For the purposes of this Annex, the term “Authorized Allocation” means an amount 
equivalent to $500,000 to be withdrawn from the Credit Account and deposited in the Special 
Account pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule”. 
 
All the terms and conditions of the Development Credit Agreement, as amended hereby, 
shall remain in full force and effect. 
 
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing, dating and 
returning to us the attached copy of this letter. This amendment will become effective as of the 
date of countersignature upon receipt by the Bank of the countersigned copy of this letter. 
 
Sincerely,
