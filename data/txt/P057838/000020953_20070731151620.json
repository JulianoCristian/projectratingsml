Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned included: 1) Strong and\n            Sustained Political Leadership and Strong Reform Champions\n            are Essential. The project benefited significantly from the\n            fact that the same Minister of Justice was responsible for\n            the project during the entire period of its implementation;\n            2) While reforms in the justice sector require political\n            consensus and commitment, the role of outside donors and\n            assistance providers can be critical in \"jump\n            starting\" and sustaining reforms in the initial stages;\n            3 The project introduced several automated systems aimed at\n            the improvement of the efficiency and effectiveness of\n            several key judicial institutions; 4) Linking a whole\n            project component with other donor projects is highly risky\n            and can create serious problems for the achievement of\n            project objectives in those specific areas; 5) Placing the\n            implementation of the first judicial reform project under\n            the leadership of the MOJ proved to be effective in\n            countering weak judicial leadership and limited capacity for\n            project implementation; and 6) More reliable and accessible\n            sources for data are necessary to use in M&E system for\n            improved measurement of progress against the achievement of\n            project objectives during implementation."}, "docdt": "2007-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
