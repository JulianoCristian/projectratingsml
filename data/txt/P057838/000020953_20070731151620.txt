F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The development objective of the project is to assist in the development of an
independent, accessible and efficient judiciary in the Republic of Armenia, which is
essential to governance, rule of law, and investment climate.

  Within this broader Development Objective the Project aimed at the following
outcome: (i) strengthening judicial self-governance through support to the Council of
Court Chairmen (CCC); (ii) improvement of court administration and case management
procedures; (iii) development of a comprehensive institutional base for continuing
education for judges and court personnel; (iv) strengthening the service for enforcement
of court decisions; (v) development of a comprehensive legal information system
accessible to judges, legal professionals, business community and citizens; and (vi)
promotion of public awareness of laws and legal institutions.



                                              ii

  For monitoring the progress of the Project implementation and achievement of the
Project objectives the following indicators were identified: (i) development within the
CCC of the capacity to manage efficiently and effectively the first-instance and appellate
courts (i.e. effective governance of the judiciary by the CCC); (ii) adoption of new court
administration and case management procedures by courts; (iii) development of new
professionals within the court system including court administrators, judicial assistants
and financial officers; (iv) more consolidated and rationalized court structure (judges and
other scarce judicial resources are allocated appropriately; staffing levels are determined
to allow the courts to discharge their assigned functions); (v) a well-functioning Judicial
Training Center (JTC) resulting in better trained and more competent judicial system
professionals; (vi) improved court decisions enforcement mechanism; (vii) improved
access by judges, legal professionals, business community and general public to more
reliable, comprehensive and up-to-date legal information; and (viii) establishment of a
comprehensive public education program to overcome the widespread distrust and
suspicion of the judiciary.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)
Armenia's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 was accompanied by dramatic
economic, social and political challenges. The devastating effects of the 1988 earthquake,
war with neighboring Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, an energy crisis and economic
blockade resulted in more than a 50% reduction in the economic output, hyperinflation
and unemployment during the early years of independence. Once a prosperous republic
within the Soviet Union, Armenia entered the transition period with a huge burden of
unresolved social and economic problems and found itself a poor, isolated country with
about 60% of the population living below the poverty line. After the 1994 ceasefire
agreement with Azerbaijan, the government retargeted its efforts towards addressing
urgent economic and social problems, initiating and implementing a remarkable
macroeconomic stabilization and economic liberalization program that resulted in stable
economic growth which continued for the next decade.

With the adoption of its first post-independence Constitution in 1995, Armenia started a
difficult process of establishing a new institutional and legal framework for its judicial
sector to effectively tackle the new challenges of the transition period and create enabling
conditions for private sector development. The new Constitution subscribed to a principle
of a clear separation of the three branches of the government and introduced the Council
of Justice (COJ), as the highest body responsible for important decisions in the judiciary,
including making recommendations on appointment and removal of judges. The
Constitution also established the Constitutional Court of Armenia.

In 1996, a State Commission on Legal and Judicial Reforms established by the President,
initiated development of the Judicial and Legal Reforms Concept Paper (Concept Paper
or CP). It was a comprehensive program that elaborated the principles and paths of
transforming the old Soviet Armenian judiciary, which was heavily dependent on the
executive branch and the communist party of the Soviet Union. During Armenia's early
post-independent period the courts continued to depend heavily on the executive branch
both in terms of court administration, recruitment and removal of judges, court personnel
management and other areas. Moreover, insufficient funding of the court system over the
past decade has left many courts in Armenia deprived of minimal working conditions,
including deteriorated buildings and very limited operational budget.

The World Bank, together with the IMF, European Union, Russia and the United States,
were among the first donors supporting the Armenian economic and social
transformation in the early years of independence. The Bank's strategy initially focused
on providing assistance towards overall economic reforms and institution building,
rehabilitation of critical infrastructure and social protection mechanisms. The judicial
sector as an area for potential intervention did not emerge in the Bank's assistance
strategy for Armenia until late 1990s. This was due to the absence of necessary



                                               1

constitutional and legal framework for initiating a comprehensive judicial and legal
sector reforms. In addition, the Armenian authorities were not ready at that time to
initiate politically sensitive and difficult reforms in this sector.

With the adoption of the Concept Paper the Armenian authorities declared a policy goal
of establishing an independent, effective and well regarded judicial system in Armenia
that would effectively serve the society and the economy under new political and market
economy conditions. The CP had a clear plan of action and list of legislative acts to be
adopted within a constitutionally mandated timeline. The reform goals expressed in the
CP closely aligned with the Bank's reform strategy for judicial sector, which was a new
area for the Bank's intervention in the ECA region in late 1990s.

During 1997-98, a set of important legislative acts were enacted by the Armenian
Parliament including the Laws on Judiciary, Status of Judges, Procuracy and
Compulsory Enforcement of the Judicial Decisions. These laws drew the general contour
of the new judicial system of Armenia and established key judicial institutions. For long
term sustainability of the reforms the government realized the importance of significant
investments in the sector and approached the World Bank to become its primary partner
in reforming the judiciary.

The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Armenia in late 1990s highlighted the
importance of strengthening the legal and judicial framework for fostering rapid private
sector development in the country. The Bank had been invited to provide advice and
recommendations on the Concept Paper and draft laws that were being prepared. The
First and Second Structural Adjustment Technical Assistance Credits (SATAC in FY 97
and FY 98, respectively), together with direct policy dialogue, were among the initial
instruments through which the Bank extended some consultancy support to the Armenian
government in this area. In 1997, the Bank initiated preparation of the Judicial Sector
Assessment (JSA) of Armenia which became an important instrument for strengthening
the ongoing policy dialogue and was critical in starting the formal discussions on the
design and direction of a potential Bank project in this area.

Several important political changes occurred in the late 1990s that had an impact on the
pace of reforms for the next decade. The election of the President Kocharyan and
formation of a new government in 1998 brought a reform-oriented Minister of Justice
into power. Mr. Harutyunyan until recently was one of the two longest serving Cabinet
members in Armenia serving as Justice Minister for about nine years. This factor played
an important role in successful implementation of important reform initiatives in the
judiciary.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The overall goal of the Judicial Reform Project (JRP) was to assist in the development of
an independent, accessible and efficient judiciary in the Republic of Armenia, which is
essential to governance, rule of law, and the investment climate.




                                                2

Within this broader Development Objective, the Project aimed at the following outcomes:
(i) strengthening judicial self-governance through support to the Council of Court
Chairmen (CCC); (ii) improvement of court administration and case management
procedures;(iii) development of a comprehensive institutional base for continuing
education for judges and court personnel; (iv) strengthening the service for enforcement
of court decisions; (v) development of a comprehensive legal information system
accessible to judges, legal professionals, business community and citizens; and (vi)
promotion of public awareness of laws and legal institutions.

For monitoring the progress of the Project implementation and achievement of the
objectives the following indicators were identified: (i) development within the CCC of
the capacity to manage efficiently and effectively the first-instance and appellate courts
(i.e. effective governance of the judiciary by the CCC); (ii) adoption of new court
administration and case management procedures by courts; (iii) development of new
professionals within the court system including court administrators, judicial assistants
and financial officers; (iv) more consolidated and rationalized court structure (judges and
other scarce judicial resources are allocated appropriately; staffing levels are determined
to allow the courts to discharge their assigned functions); (v) a well-functioning Judicial
Training Center (JTC) resulting in better trained and more competent judicial system
professionals; (vi) improved court decisions enforcement mechanism; (vii) improved
access by judges, legal professionals, business community and general public to more
reliable, comprehensive and up-to-date legal information; and (viii) establishment of a
comprehensive public education program to overcome the widespread distrust and
suspicion of the judiciary.

Project objectives were fully consistent with one of the key goals of the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy (1997) for Armenia of "fostering the rapid development of the
private sector by promoting further structural reforms, strengthening the financial system
and the legal and regulatory framework".

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The objectives and indicators of the Project were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)
According to the PAD the Project was anticipated to have a wide range of beneficiaries
both within and outside the judicial sector. Both domestic and foreign investors were
expected to benefit from an efficient, independent and impartial judiciary thus promoting
private sector development and economic growth in Armenia. Judges and court personnel
were expected to benefit "in terms of enhanced professional training, administrative
independences and security, improved working conditions and better access to legal
information". The general public and legal professionals would benefit from improved



                                              3

access to the courts and legal information, and impartial and professional functioning of
the judiciary.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The Project had seven components.

Component 1-Strengthening the Institutional Capacity of the Judiciary (US$ 2.63
million)

The component aimed at: (i) development of self-governing bodies of the judiciary
(specifically, the Council of Court Chairmen (CCC) and its Administrative Office); (ii)
development of a modern court administration system; (iii) design and implementation of
new case management models; and (iv) automation of courts.

Component 2 - Infrastructure Rehabilitation (US$ 5.66 million)

The objective of the component was to improve the physical condition of courts, through
rehabilitation and construction of selected courthouses that meet efficient and modern
court design and engineering standards, ensure improved working conditions for judges
and court personnel, as well as ease access to courts by general public. The PAD lists 20
courts as primary targets of this component. Seven pilot courts were expected to further
benefit from the Project from the supply of modern court equipment and furniture,
including audio recording, security and fire alarm systems and other goods.

Component 3 - Training of Judges and Court Personnel (US$ 0.53 million)

The component focused on providing assistance in establishing the Judicial Training
Center (JTC) through: (i) provision of technical assistance and training for developing the
management structure of the JTC; (ii) organization of a conference with participation of
judges, government officials and representatives of the legal community for the
discussion and endorsement of a strategic approach for the development of continuing
judicial education in Armenia; (iii) assistance in curriculum development; (iv) provision
of required equipment for the Center.

Component 4 - Improving Enforcement of Court Decisions (US$0.59 million)

The objective of the component was to improve the Enforcement of Court Decisions
through: (i) institutional strengthening of the Enforcement Service; (ii) professional
development of the Enforcement Service staff; and (iii) automation of the Enforcement
Service.

Component 5 - Legal Information (US$0.69 million)

The component aimed to develop a new legal information regime by providing assistance
in: (i) strengthening the institutional and operational capacity of agencies responsible for
maintaining authoritative texts of official legal materials, their systematization and
codification; (ii) developing an electronic legal database; (iii) developing a Government


                                              4

strategy for facilitating competitive and effective dissemination of legal information; and
(iv) improving access to essential legal information by judges and other legal
professionals.

Component 6 - Public Awareness and Public Education Campaign (US$0.75 million)

The component's objective was to accomplish a qualitative breakthrough in public
attitudes toward the rule of law in Armenia by making the public aware about the
ongoing judicial reforms, educating them about legal rights and the judicial system and
encouraging the public's active participation in the reform process.

Component 7 - Project Management (US$0.53 million)

The last component was to support overall Project Management by establishing and
financing the activities of a Judicial Reform Project Implementation Unit (JRPIU).

1.6 Revised Components
While the Project components and their objectives were not formally revised, several
changes did take place in project activities during implementation. In particular, the
credit documents suggested that in total 20 courts would benefit from the Infrastructure
Rehabilitation Component, with only one courthouse to be newly, constructed (in
Gyumri). However, several unforeseen factors, mainly the unexpected rise in the
construction cost during the project , the need for full construction (instead of
rehabilitation) of three court buildings in Yerevan, combined with generally low PAD
cost estimates for reconstruction activities necessitated a revision in the number of the
rehabilitated and constructed courthouses. As a result, the total number of courts
benefiting from the component was decreased to 14 (including construction of four new
buildings). These revisions were mutually agreed between the Government and the Bank
during the supervision missions as reflected in the Bank's Aide Memoires and other
supervision documents.

Additionally, during the project mid-term review conducted in September, 2003 some of
the activities (journalism trainings, publication of brochures, development of a PR
strategy under the Component 6, and organization of conferences under Component 1)
were dropped because of the availability of other donor resources for these types of
activities. Similarly, during the implementation of the Public Awareness component a
decision was made not to organize radio programs and use only television for public
education purposes. These changes were thoroughly discussed and agreed between the
Bank and Government during the supervision mission and did not materially affect the
achievement of the objectives of the components and the overall project goal.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)
There were several important changes in the project scope and scale, implementation
schedule and timing of the activities.



                                              5

First, the Closing Date of the Project was extended three times, from December 31, 2004
to December 31, 2006. All the extensions were requested by the government to allow the
completion of works under the Rehabilitation Component which was delayed because of
factors outside the Project's control. The construction of two courthouses in Yerevan
(Center-Nork Marash and Shengavit) was initially delayed because a closer examination
of the buildings initially designated for rehabilitation found them to be unfit and did not
economically justify rehabilitation work. As a result, decisions were made to construct
new buildings for these courts, which involved a lengthy process of land search and
allocation by the government, preparation of new designs and other preparatory works.
The last two extensions for four and two months respectively from June 30, 2006 to
December 31, 2006, were done to allow the completion of Shengavit courthouse which
experienced construction delays due the need to relocate high voltage electrical cables on
the construction site, as well as unusually heavy snows in the winter of 2005.

Second, in September 2004 and February 2006, there were two reallocations among
disbursement categories and components that aimed to promote smooth and effective
implementation of the Project activities. In both cases the main reason for reallocation
was to allow sufficient funds for the completion of the construction of selected
courthouses, and provision of necessary equipment for the remaining court houses. The
rehabilitation component budget was significantly affected by the fluctuations in the
currency exchange rate between US dollars and Armenian drams. As a result of the
reallocations, the "works" category allocation has increased more than 52% over the
original estimate during the project implementation.

                                         Allocation   Reallocation, Reallocation  to Original (%)
                                          (SDR)         (SDR)         (SDR)
(1) Goods                                    2,051,000    1,597,000     2,064,900              0.7%
(2) Works                                    3,021,000    4,321,000     4,592,000            52.0%
(3) Consultants' Services and training       2,789,000    2,253,000     1,530,000           -45.1%
(4) Incremental costs of the PIU              383,000       383,000       368,000             -3.9%
(5) Refunding of Advance                      356,000         46,000       45,100           -87.3%

In both cases, the reallocation of the funds between the categories did not affect the
successful implementation of project components and achievement of the anticipated
objectives.

In November 2004, the authorized allocation for the Special Account was increased from
USD 500,000 to USD 1,000,000, to allow the JRPIU more effective financial
management of large civil works contracts, thus contributing to smoother implementation
of the Project. Additionally, in September 2004, the procurement thresholds for National
Competitive Bidding, International and National Shopping were also increased from
$2,940,000 for NCB, $407,000 for International Shopping and $126,000 for National
Shopping to an aggregate amount not to exceed $3,100,000 for NCB, $500,000 for
International Shopping and $500,000 for National Shopping.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) reviewed the Quality at Entry of the Project in
April 2001, and rated it as Highly Satisfactory.

This ICR agrees with the QAG evaluation, and rates the Project's Quality at Entry as
Highly Satisfactory in recognition of the high quality preparatory work, high level and
effective dialogue with the government, and relevance of the selected intervention areas
to the Country Assistance strategy and sector priorities.

Significant analytical and preparatory work was done by the Bank and the government
for identification, preparation and appraisal of the project. A Judicial Sector Assessment
was prepared and presented in April 1998. Later an Assessment of Court Administration
and Case Management systems was completed under a Bank-administered Japanese
PHRD grant for the preparation of the project. A preliminary assessment of the
conditions of existing courthouses during the preparation phase confirmed the extremely
poor conditions that many courts were operating in throughout Armenia and helped to
develop the Rehabilitation component of the project.

The PHRD grant also funded a baseline survey on Public Awareness on Judicial Reforms
(Baseline Survey) which, among other things, revealed an extremely low level of legal
knowledge and understanding about judicial reforms among the population. The findings
of the survey were used in designing the Public Awareness component of the Project.

Finally, there was a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) which was established in the
amount of USD 470,000 to support the creation and staffing of the Judicial Reform
Project Implementation Unit (JRPIU) and initiate the design works under the
Rehabilitation component.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)
Several factors influenced the overall pace of Armenia's judicial reforms and thus JRP
implementation during the life of the project. The assassination of the Prime Minister,
the Speaker of the National Assembly and other government officials in October 1999
had an indirect negative impact on the pace of JRP implementation, particularly in the
beginning of the project. These events triggered a multi-year, high profile, criminal case
that decreased the reform momentum that had picked up significantly in 1997-98.
However, stability in the Justice Ministry leadership ensured the government's continued
commitment and consistency which were crucial in mitigating the negative impact of a
slow down in reform in the long run. The Project benefited from having the same
Minister of Justice leading the Project Administrative Council (PAC) during the whole
implementation period.


                                                7

The constitutional reform process in Armenia was another important factor that affected
judicial and legal reform processes in Armenia, particularly in relation to changes in
judicial governance. As part of its Council of Europe membership Armenia committed
in 2001 to bring its main laws into accordance with European standards, including
changing the Constitution so that it would allow more independence for the judiciary.
This specifically related to reforms in the formation and composition of the Council of
Justice (COJ), as the highest judicial governing body.

The adoption of constitutional amendments, however, was a challenging task for the
authorities. After the first unsuccessful attempt in 2003, the government was able to
secure a successful outcome in November 2005. The revised Constitution brought full
constitutional independence to the COJ. The President, the Minister of Justice and the
Prosecutor General were removed from the COJ whose membership now includes only
judges elected by the General Assembly of Judges.

Also in 2005 the reform oriented Chairman of the Economic Court was promoted to
become the Chairman of the Court of Cassation and Council of Court Chairmen (CCC)
which helped to further strengthen Project implementation. More specifically, the new
CCC Chairman moved quickly to reform the judicial administrative system by supporting
the creation of a centralized Judicial Department (based on advice from Project
consultants). The Chairman also reenergized the effort to create a sound institutional
foundation for a permanent judicial training school by converting the Judicial Training
Center into a School for the Judiciary.

The JRP became effective about seven months later than anticipated in the PAD, which
was due to delays in the ratification procedures. Despite this delay, the JRPIU was able
to initiate some activities (particularly in preparation of designs for court houses) with the
support of the established Project Preparation Facility (PPF). Notwithstanding the
availability of PHRD and the PPF funds and the early establishment of the JRPIU, project
implementation was initially very slow and uneven across various components. This was
reflected in the lower than planned disbursement rates of the project, particularly during
the first two years. During this time, court rehabilitation consumed significant resources
and kept the disbursement rate rising and satisfactory preparatory works were undertaken
by the Legal Information, Enforcement and Public Education components. However,
there was no real progress in implementing the Judicial Governance and Judicial Training
components until 2004 and 2005 respectively.

The slow start of the project can be partially attributed to the limited JRPIU capacity and
management issues in the beginning of the project. The JRPIU was among the smallest in
Armenia and suffered a management crisis with the unexpected resignation of key staff,
including the Director, Architect and Financial Management Specialist, due to an internal
management conflict. This management crisis lasted for several months until a new PIU
Director was hired in September 2002, at which time project implementation began to
significantly improve.




                                               8

Implementation was also affected by several external factors. For example, frequent
audits of the JRP conducted by various government and legislative control agencies
consumed a significant amount of the limited JRPIU staff's time. During 2003-04, three
agencies, including the Chamber of Control of the Parliament, Procuracy, and the
Financial Supervision Department of the Ministry of Finance and Economy, conducted
audits of the Project. Some of the supervision reports prepared by these agencies were
highly disputed by the JRPIU and MOJ, who were unwillingly drawn into political
debates about the effectiveness of the use of the credit funds. Eventually the Bank had to
intervene to clarify the financial management policies and procurement procedures that
were used during project implementation.

Perhaps the most critical factor affecting implementation was the dramatic increase in the
cost of construction in Armenia as a result of remarkable economic growth during 2001-
06. The economic growth ­ driven mainly by a construction boom ­ raised the cost of
construction materials and labor. This, combined with low PAD estimates for the
Rehabilitation Component and the need for new construction instead of rehabilitation of
three courthouses, substantially raised costs of this component necessitating reallocations
and reducing the total number of courts benefiting from this component.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The design of the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system for the project was adequate.
However, implementation of the M&E system was hindered by difficulties related to
identification of relevant data and sources, as well as data collection and measurement
problems. A baseline survey was conducted in the beginning of the Project which
revealed useful information regarding the public's perception about the judiciary and
accessibility of the courts and legal information. At least two additional surveys were to
be conducted during the project implementation to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness
of the project interventions on public perceptions, but only one was carried out at the end
of the Project. The latter used different questionnaires and survey methodology that
made a comparison between the results of the baseline and end-of-the-project surveys
difficult. Data collection and statistics management in other areas, such as number of
cases processed and managed by the courts and enforcement agency, are still done
manually, are not fully systematized and are not fully trusted by judicial leaders. The
project was expected to improve these areas by providing more effective and automated
case management solutions. With full introduction of the automated case management
software across the whole court system, judicial statistics and information will be more
consistent and more readily available. Additionally, the creation of the Judicial
Department, as the new court administrative body, may further enhance the effectiveness
of court statistics management.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)
This Project was governed by OD 4.01 Environmental Assessment (October 1999) and
was assigned a Category B which did not require full environmental assessment. Some
environmental analysis was completed, on account of the civil works envisaged in the
Rehabilitation Component. An initial assessment of court buildings was conducted under


                                                 9

the PHRD grant. This assessment, according to the PAD, did not reveal any significant
negative environmental consequences. Moreover, the PAD suggested that the project
would have positive environmental impact in form of improved and secure court
buildings.

An adequate Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was developed and included in the
Operational Manual (OP) of the Project. The EMP clarified and addressed a wide range
of environmental, safety, health and other issues arising from the construction and
rehabilitation work.

The only major safeguard issue arose during the construction of Arabkir-Zaytun court
house in Yerevan in 2003. The initial ground digging works at the construction site were
negatively affecting a neighboring private house, creating potential risks regarding
resettlement. At the request of the JRPIU the construction work at the site was
temporarily suspended until a further evaluation of the situation was done by government
and Bank experts. The assessment concluded that before continuing any works with
heavy construction machinery a strengthening of the adjacent private house was
necessary. Per request of the government, the Bank team obtained a waiver to allow the
use of a small amount of credit funds for basic strengthening of the house, which was
successfully done.

No other major waivers were used by the Bank in relation to the safeguard policies and
procedures.

Fiduciary: The Project was audited in accordance with the World Bank fiduciary
requirements. The audits were conducted by Bank approved auditing companies and the
Project received unqualified audit reports. The Bank procurement specialists regularly
conducted procurement post reviews and the reports are included in the project
supervision files. Several procurement waivers were obtained during the project
implementation. No major fiduciary issue has been found during the implementation of
the project and no deviations from polices and procedures in this area were recorded. The
PIU has maintained adequate financial management arrangements during the whole
period of project implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The government of Armenia has committed itself to the goal of establishing an
independent and efficient judicial sector and recognizes that longer-term and more
consistent efforts are necessary in this area. In late 2005, following the constitutional
reforms, the government announced the start of the second phase of judicial reforms that
was expected to continue and build on the outcomes achieved under the JRP. Several key
legislative amendments were adopted during 2005-06 that marked the start of this second
phase.



                                               10

Works on the preparation of a new comprehensive Judicial Code started immediately
after the constitutional referendum of 2005. Initial works were supported by a consultant
hired under the JRP. However, before the finalization and approval of the Judicial Code,
the government approved several changes in the existing laws which created new judicial
administration and management institutions. A Judicial Department (JD) was established
under the CCC to act as an administrative body managing all personnel, administrative
and logistic issues of the courts. The Law on Judicial Service introduced the judicial
service in the court system as a parallel to the civil service. As a result of these
administrative changes, it is likely that the outcomes in judicial governance and
administration and court management obtained under the project will be effectively
sustained and extended to other areas not affected by this project during the first reform
phase. All outstanding operational and maintenance issues related to the new IT and
software systems installed under the project are agreed with the Armenian government
and they will be supported through steadily increasing budgetary allocations. The
government has continuously increased its financing of the judiciary thus ensuring the
institutional and operational sustainability of the reforms (see the figure below).
Moreover, for the second phase of reforms the government has now committed additional
resources for significant capital investments.

Before the end of the JRP, the Government of Armenia asked the Bank to continue its
involvement in the judicial reforms by providing a second loan to the sector. The second
judicial reform project in Armenia was approved by the Bank in early 2007 as a repeat
project. The second project will support the Armenian government in advancing the
second phase of judicial reforms thus ensuring the sustainability of the outcomes
achieved under the first project

Regarding the judicial governance component, changes supported by JRP are expected to
continue during the second phase of reforms. Important activities are planned by the
government towards further strengthening of the new judicial institutions, such as the
Council of Justice, Judicial Department, and Council of Judges. The Court



                                                11

administration and case management system developed by the project continues to
remain highly relevant for the increase of efficiency and effectiveness of the judiciary
and it is expected that the system will be gradually rolled out to the whole court system
during the next phase of reforms.

Regarding enforcement of court decisions, the capacities of ESD were strengthened by
the organizational and functional changes and by automation of major business processes
through the AESMS. However, more training of staff will be needed, particularly in the
regions to fully benefit from the new system and sustain the impact on efficiency and
effectiveness of ESD. This training will be incorporated in the Bank's ongoing support
for judicial reform in Armenia.

Easy and reliable access to legal information by both judicial employees, legal
professionals and the general public is no longer a problem in Armenia. ARLIS system
was successfully developed and launched under the project providing free access to all
laws and regulations adopted by the government agencies (through the Internet and CD
ROMs). The maintenance and operation of the system is done by the Official Bulletin
under the MOJ, which was staffed with additional lawyers and operators to effectively
maintain ARLIS.

With regard to the Public Awareness component, it is likely that Armenia's public
television channel as well as one or more of the private channels will continue some legal
programming in the future. The success of "My Rights" revealed an audience for legal
education and justice-focused programs. The Bank and the government plan to build on
the successful My Right brand in the follow-on project.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)
The overall Project Development Objective (PDO) was to "assist in the development of
an independent, accessible and efficient judiciary in Armenia which is essential to
governance, rule of law and investment climate". Realizing that the establishment of an
effectively functioning, open and accessible judicial system would be difficult to achieve
during a short period of the project life, the PDO was correctly defined as aiming to assist
in achieving those results.

The PDO was a highly relevant development priority for Armenia at the time of project
preparation and appraisal, and still remains an important objective for establishing good
governance critical to economic growth and poverty reduction. The hierarchy of
objectives was fully consistent with the Bank's assistance strategy of 1997 that identified
the improvement of legal and regulatory framework as an important factor in fostering
the private sector development in Armenia.

The project design was well developed to effectively target the most needed and urgent
areas affecting the establishment of an effective judiciary as a fully independent third


                                                12

branch of the government. The project concept and components were designed in line
with the government approved 1997 Concept Paper for legal and judicial reform. These
included both institutional and capacity building activities targeted at key judicial
institutions (CCC, ESD, JTC and others), as well as physical rehabilitation and public
awareness and education components. Moreover, the project provided an important
framework for maintaining a high level policy dialogue with the Armenian counterparts.

Establishment of an independent and accessible judiciary in Armenia continues to remain
an important development priority for the country. In 2003 Armenia approved and started
the implementation of its first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The PRSP
identifies improvement in the functioning of the judicial sector as critical element of the
country's struggle against poverty. Similarly, the government approved Anti-Corruption
Strategy (ACS) of Armenia (2003)- prepared with the support of the Bank- has a section
on the judiciary with proposals for legislative and regulatory changes targeted at reducing
corruption risks in the court system. Successful implementation of the planned activities
of both the PRSP and ACS in the judicial sector, were highly dependent on the
availability of sector-targeted external assistance programs. The role of JRP in this regard
was very important and broadly appreciated by the government, legal professionals and
civil society representatives.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)
The project has achieved its development objective of assisting the establishment of
independent, accessible and efficient judiciary in Armenia by successfully supporting the
first phase of judicial sector reforms in several important areas.

In terms of judicial independence major improvements were recorded by the end of the
project. Constitutional reforms of 2005 provided full constitutional autonomy to the
judicial branch by eliminating the representation of the executive branch on the Council
of Justice (COJ) and by introducing the new General Conference of Judges as the highest
body responsible for making key decisions related to judicial governance and appointing
judges to the COJ. The role and functions of the CCC and its administrative body were
later redefined to align with the new legal framework. A new administrative body for the
judiciary, the Judicial Department, was established under the Council of Judges (a
standing governing body also selected by the General Conference of Judges) to take on
all administrative, personnel and operational responsibilities of the court system. The
creation of the Judicial Department flowed directly from recommendations provided by
JRP consultants advising the CCC and judicial leadership. Throughout the development
of the Constitutional reforms and Judicial Code, the Bank and JRP consultants provided
policy dialogue and technical assistance respectively to help shape the reforms in light of
best international practice.

Compared to early 2000, courts in Armenia now have operational autonomy, particularly
in the area of budgetary and financial management aspects, an important indicator of
judicial independence. The establishment of the judicial service, has not only
strengthened the mechanisms of management of the judicial cadre, but has also protected


                                                13

the judicial servants against any external and internal pressures thus making the courts
more independent and professionally governed system. From 2000-06, the budget for the
court system has been steadily increasing, with additional funds allocated each year for
the maintenance and operational expenses of the courts. This is a result of a
programmatic and consistent approach adopted by the government to increase the
financing of the judiciary in accordance with the PRSP and MTEF targets and priorities.
State financing of the courts has also improved in several new directions, including
training and capital expenditures.

Judicial accessibility has been improved through several project interventions.
Renovated and newly-built courthouses provide better access to judicial services and
decrease the opportunities for non-judicial influences on court proceedings. Improved
courthouses also provide a more dignified atmosphere for court hearings and secure and
private areas not only for judges, but also for witnesses and litigants and other court
participants. New and renovated court buildings have special areas for publication of
special notices and improved access to court staff for filing cases and submitting other
documents. Public access to legal information has been greatly enhanced through the
introduction of ARLIS. In addition, citizens have gained a new appreciation for judicial
protection of legal rights though the "My Right" television show.

The project also had a positive impact on judicial efficiency. The introduction of digital
recording devices and the piloting of a court administration and case management system
will improve the speed and accuracy of court proceedings and records. Improvements in
the operations of the ESD will also enhance the effectiveness of the enforcement at
judicial divisions.

The achievement of project development objectives in each component is described
below:

Judicial Governance and Management. JRP has helped to achieve the strengthened
governance and management of the judiciary through several activities, particularly
through improving the institutional capacity of the CCC and its staff and establishing
improved procedures for court administration and case management. A comprehensive
reform program was developed by a JRP financed consultant, who conducted an
assessment of three pilot courts, identified key organizational and management
deficiencies on the existing judicial governing structures and court administration and
case management procedures and provided a set of recommendations to address those
deficiencies. One of the recommendations of the consultant, the need for a separate
institution for judicial administration, was later used in the development of the concept
for the new Judicial Department.

Based on the recommendation and specifications provided by the consultant an
automated case management system was developed and introduced in seven pilot courts,
and efforts are currently underway to extend the system to the all courts. The project also
provided necessary legal advisory services to help the Armenian authorities in developing




                                              14

the legislative amendments and the draft Judicial Code to implement the new
constitutional provisions for strengthening judicial independence.

Infrastructure Rehabilitation. The physical condition of the courts and judicial facilities
were dramatically improved as a result of the works carried out under this component.
The component was successfully implemented despite various problems and delays with
construction contracts and works. As a result of cost increases discussed above in Section
2.2, the total number of beneficiary courts under this component was reduced from 20 to
14. Seven courthouses were fully rehabilitated (one newly built), fully furnished and
equipped in accordance with modern court design and safety standards, and served as
pilots for the court administration and case management software. In addition, four other
non-pilot courts were rehabilitated and three new courthouses were built from the scratch.

About 60 courtrooms in all rehabilitated courthouses were equipped with modern digital
recording systems used to record digital transcripts of court hearings. Relevant
legislative amendments to allow the use of these systems were also prepared under the
project. Introduction of the recording system and availability of the recorded material to
all parties has had significant impact on the way the cases were heard by creating a clear
record of a case for appeals. Another innovation in the rehabilitated courthouses was the
replacement of metal cages used to restrain criminal defendants with modern security
devices.

Enforcement Service. The organizational and operational capacity of the ESD was
enhanced as a result of the review and recommendations prepared by a consultant hired
under the project. Based on these recommendations a comprehensive Armenian
Enforcement Service Management System (AESMS) was developed and introduced in
the ESD's central offices. Some computer equipment was purchased for the ESD and
Local Area Network (LAN) was developed that allowed the implementation of the
AESMS system. AESMS has several modules, including document circulation, case
management, personnel management, archive, auction, financial control and
administration, which have already helped to improve the efficiency of the ESD.
However, the full benefits from the AESMS remains constrained by the limited number
of computers in use by ESD and technical constraints preventing the regional branches
from being constantly connected to the central server, instead of having to rely on the
current dial-up connection. The project also developed and launched the official website
of the ESD ( www.harkardir.am ), which includes an online auction module. In addition,
more than 150 ESD staff were trained for the use of the computer equipment and 10
officials of the ESD went on a study tour in Germany.

The total number of cases managed and processed by ESD gradually increased from
ESD's establishment in 1999 to 2005. The number of cases fully enforced during this
time showed a marked improvement. (See diagram below.) While the overall trend of the
total cases enforced by ESD was rising since 1999, there has been a slight drop in the
number of managed and processed cases in 2005 and 2006, which can be primarily
attributed to the reduction in the number of new cases initiated during those years. This
reduction could signify an increase is cases that were self-enforced (the losing party

agrees to the court judgment without need to resort to ESD) or enforced by other means.
The results of the BEEPS survey indicate that the percentage of all firms reporting that
the judiciary can enforce its decisions has increased from 34% in 2002 to 40% in 2005.

Training and Capacity Building. The training component was the weakest in terms of
implementation and results. Only in 2005, after significant changes took place in the
leadership of the CCC and the Judicial Training Center did work on the objectives of this
component move forward. Initial delays were due to the cancellation of the EC project,
lack of clear management by past CCC leadership and inability of the JTC to create a
long-term training plan. A JRP consultant provided significant input to the preparation of
the new draft Law on Higher School of Judiciary (now incorporated in the new Judicial
Code) and provided a list of recommendations and next steps for the creation of the
training curricula, physical reconstruction of space for the school and organization of
school administration. Necessary classroom equipment and furniture were provided and
a temporary site was renovated to create offices, classrooms and a computer lab using
project funds. With state budget financing, the JTC has successfully started its program
of training of judges and court personnel. During 2006 a total of 158 judges participated
in 52 two-day training programs at the JTC and the rate of participation was 100%. The
JTC has organized three conferences with participations of judges, legal professionals
and international experts. After the introduction of the Judicial Service in 2006, the first
training program for the judicial servants was also organized at JTC and approximately
574 court employees went through special three-day training programs.

Legal Information. The project produced tangible results under this component by
improving the access to legal information for judges, legal professionals and the general
public. After a long period of preparatory and testing works, the Armenian Legal


                                             16

Information System (ARLIS) was successfully launched in 2005. Through a new basic
classification and codification system, ARLIS provides full access to the digital database
of all laws, regulations and legal acts of Armenia. It is user friendly and available free of
charge to both the judicial employees, as well as general public. ARLIS is available both
in the internet (www.arlis.am , www.laws.am, www.legislation.am ) and on CD ROMs
(for a minimal subscription charge). The operational maintenance of the ARLIS is done
by an MOJ agency, which was provided with additional staff to handle the new
responsibilities.

The following graph shows the total number of visitors (users) of the ARLIS system. On
average about 1,300 users visited ARLIS sites per month and there has been a steady
growth through the end of the 2006. With low internet penetration in Armenia, these
statistics are quite impressive for the first year of ARLIS's operation.

Public Awareness and Education. The image of the judiciary, as an open, fair and
accessible institution, was improved as a result of several project activities. The main
output of the Public Awareness component was the "My Right" television show, which
was developed and broadcasted on Armenian Public Television starting September 2004.
By 2006 the show had been rated number one by the Public Television of Armenia for
two consecutive years making it a real success. The show also has an official website that
provides useful legal information and opportunities for the public to ask questions. In
response to the large number of citizens requests for legal information, the MOJ
organized a number of free consulting sessions where the "My Right" TV judge and
Ministry legal experts provided advice. Some activities of this component, such as
journalism training and publication of brochures were dropped due to the Government's
view that they were relatively ineffective and the availability of other donor resources for
such activities.

JRP was an institution building project so no calculations of rates of return were
undertaken during preparation. However, several outcomes of the project have resulted in
significant efficiencies and economies for the judicial sector.

Statistics on the total number of cases managed by the Armenian courts during 2002-05
show a significant increase in the case flow, particularly for the Court of Cassation where
the number of cases during the last five years has increased more than 10 fold. The total
average workload of the whole court system has more than doubled during this period
reaching 125,000 cases in 2005.1 The judicial leadership has made improvements in the
accuracy and consistency of the collection and analysis of these caseload statistics a
priority for the second phase of judicial reforms.

* Note: The statistics of cases for all courts for earlier years was not complete.

Without significant increases in human or financial resource allocations for operational
management of the court system during the past five-year period, the increased number of
cases managed by all courts during 2002-05 indicates a significant improvement in
efficiency. With the increasing caseload, the importance of the automated case
management system provided under the project will gain even greater importance.

The finding of the 2005 BEEPS study suggest some improvement in the perception of
Armenian firms about various aspects of the judicial services. For example, the firms
surveyed by BEEPS report improvement in the judiciary's "ability to enforce its
decisions" ­ an important indication of the strengthening of the judicial institutions. The
development of the official ESD website and incorporation of electronic auctions through
the website have created efficiencies in terms of operational cost savings as well as
raising the value of auctioned items. The efficiency of the judicial sector was also
improved as evidenced by the end of the project survey results, which showed a slight
improvement in the public's perception of judicial efficiency from 2000 to 2006 (see
table below).




1During 2006, the collection of case statistics was transferred to the new Judicial Department. As a result
of this change and a number of policy and legislative changes during 2005 and 2006, the caseload statistics
for 2006 are not as easily comparable to earlier statistics. Under the follow-on project and with the full
implementation of the automated case management system capacity

Some savings are anticipated for the building maintenance as a result of improvements
made in the physical condition of court buildings. Courts in Armenia formerly used
electricity for heating during the winters. Because of depleted conditions of the buildings
and poor external heat isolation systems significant resources were spent for heating.
Rehabilitated court buildings, in contrast, are fully equipped with modern heating
systems primarily using natural gas, which is likely to significantly reduce heating costs.
Similarly, new or improved water and sewage systems are expected to provide economies
as well.

Efficiencies will be also gained as a result of the installment and use of automated
systems both in the courts and in the ESD. The use of ARLIS is growing continuously,
and during the first 11 months of 2006 a total of about 15,000 visitors with unique IP
addresses used the www.arlis.am for retrieving legal information. A very simple
calculation can reveal the magnitude of savings recorded as a result of not paying the
subscription fees to IRTEK. The savings, in terms of unpaid fees to IRTEK, can reach
AMD 20 million per month based on the current rate of average monthly users (about
1,300) and IRTEK monthly subscription fee of about AMD 15,000. This does not take
into account CD version users of ARLIS, as well as multiple visitors from the same IP
address that would otherwise also pay for the use of the system. IRTEK continues
operating successfully in the market for legal information by developing and providing
sophisticated and upgraded systems to end-users, while ARLIS provides much needed
basic legal information (a public good) to the general public. The existence of
competition in the legal information market will ensure continued improvement and
development of the services provided to the public.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome of the project is rated satisfactory in recognition of the significant
progress made towards the achievement of the PDO of assisting in the establishment of
an independent, accessible and efficient judiciary. Despite the slow start of the project,
particularly in the institutional capacity building and training areas, the project
significantly picked up speed during the last two years of its implementation achieving
most of the anticipated outcomes from all components. The outcome of the Legal



                                              19

Information, Enforcement Service and Public Awareness components can be overall
rated as highly satisfactory, while the outcomes from Judicial Governance, Judicial
Training and Infrastructure Rehabilitation components were moderately satisfactory. In
the end, the overall impact of the project in advancing the judicial sector reforms in
Armenia was Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project has contributed to the poverty alleviation and social development efforts of
Armenia by increasing the public awareness and understanding about the court system
and improving the access to judicial services. Better legally educated public with
improved access to legal information and judicial services can help the citizens to fully
exercise their rights. As a result, the project has improved to conditions within which
Armenians can seek social justice and improved living standards.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The project contributed to the institutional development of the judiciary through
strengthening of organizational, management, operational and administrative aspects of
key judicial structures. The CCC and the Judicial Department were strengthened as a
result of the enhanced and improved court administration and case management
procedures, computerization and automation. Judicial Department with its 23 separated
units was established in 2006, and the role and functions of the CCC were redefined
following technical assistance provided by JRP consultants. Similarly, ESD, together
with its regional branches, was strengthened through an organizational and functional
review, introduction of AESMS, trainings and study tour organized for its staff.

Institution building efforts in the area of judicial training were limited and somewhat
marginal under the project. In addition to negative external factors, such as the
cancellation of the EC's Euro 1 million project specifically designed for the training of
the judges, there were major disagreements about the concept of the judicial training
between various counterparts and lack of judicial leadership which delayed the
implementation of the activities under this component. In addition, due to the anticipated
broad legislative and institutional changes following the adoption of Constitutional
amendments in 2005, most of the judicial training assistance was provided towards the
end of the project and was limited to provision of advisory services for the development
of the new Law on the Higher School of Judiciary as well as renovation and supply of
basic furniture and IT and teaching equipment for a temporary home for the JTC.

The development of courthouses design and construction standards under the Project and
the experienced gained in the JRPIU and the judiciary in managing large-scale civil
works projects have led to an increased capacity for efficiently managing capital
expenditures in the MOJ and judiciary. The follow-on project will use and build on this



                                               20

experience in order to expand the renovation of courts to cover most if not all of
Armenia's remaining courts.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low

Following the adoption of the Constitutional amendments in November 2005 and key
changes in the judiciary that took place in summer 2005, the Armenian government
entered the second phase of the judicial reforms building on the results of the project.
Thus the risks to maintaining the achieved outcomes of the projects are minimal. In
December 2006 the National Assembly of Armenia adopted the new Judicial Code that
builds on the new institutional settings and governance structures developed during the
previous years and supported by the project. Both the Constitutional amendments and the
Judicial Code reforms show the government's continued commitment and strong political
will to pursue further judicial reforms and build on the achieved results.

State budgetary allocations for the judiciary have been steadily increasing over the past
six years. At the moment there is no risk to the maintenance and operational issues
related to the new buildings and systems introduced by the project since there are
sufficient funds allocated for that purpose. Moreover, according to the government
approved Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for the coming years,
significant funds are planned to be allocated from the State Budget for additional capital
investments in the court system.

Despite the anticipated government changes as a result of Parliamentary and Presidential
elections in 2007 and 2008 respectively, there is limited political risk to the development
outcomes. This is partly due to the fact that all key legislative changes have already been
enacted. At the same time, since new leadership took over the Court of Cassation and
CCC, the effectiveness of the CCC has dramatically increased. For example, the total
number of CCC decisions adopted during the period of 1999-2005 was under 50, while
during 2005-2006 about 70 important decisions were enacted by CCC under the new
Chairman. This shows that the judiciary has strengthened its self-governance capabilities
and increased its activities and effectiveness which are both important factors that will
likely mitigate any risks to the development outcome.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance during the Project identification, preparation and appraisal are
rated as satisfactory. The Project identification followed an effective and high level
policy dialogue that had been established with the government. Significant work was
conducted during preparation and appraisal that ensured a successful design and scope of
the project, which was fully in line with the government priorities and WB assistance
strategy for Armenia.

The Bank team could have done a better job during appraisal in providing more resources
and time for a more accurate assessment of the actual conditions of court buildings
subject to renovation under the project in order to develop realistic estimates of the needs
and costs under the rehabilitation component. Additionally, for a complex judicial
reform project that included both institutional development as well as a complex
rehabilitation program, the PAD's planned implementation period of four years was
ambitious. Although this period was in line with institutional recommendations within
the region to initially limit planned project implementation periods, it is recommended
that future judicial reform projects be allowed to develop realistic time frames based on
institutional relationships and analyses of implementation capacity.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's Quality of Supervision is rated satisfactory. The Bank has carefully
monitored the compliance of project implementation activities with the fiduciary and
safeguards policies. The project supervision documents were well-written based on
realistic assessment of project implementation issues. Due to the ongoing decentralization
within the Bank by the end of the project the procurement and financial supervision
functions were delegated to country office staff, which allowed the Bank to be closer to
the government and implementation agency and address any issues arising in a more
effective and urgent manner. This was particularly important during the emergency
situation related to the vulnerable private house neighboring one of the courthouses
construction sites, when it was critical that Bank staff respond adequately and promptly
to JRPIU requests. At the same time it should be noted that the process of transfer of task
management and supervision responsibilities from the Legal Department to the ECA
PREM Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Unit that took place in late 2003
caused delays in Bank responses to some of the project implementation issues. This,
however, did not unduly delay implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.y
Overall, the Bank's performance is rated satisfactory. The project overall reached its
anticipated objectives and significantly contributed to the development of the Armenian
judicial system that entered its second phase of reforms in 2006. The Bank team was
responsive to many ongoing issues and problems during the implementation, particularly
in relation to persistent problems with various construction works. The Bank remains an
active player in the sector and will continue supporting the Armenian authorities in
advancing the judicial sector reforms through the second project.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The government performance overall is rated satisfactory. Government support for
judicial reform was strongest during project preparation when the groundwork was laid
for new institutions and a new legislative framework was put in place. During the
beginning of the project the performance of the leadership of judiciary was found to be
only moderately satisfactory which negatively affected the progress in implementation of
two important components.

Project Administrative Council (PAC) was regularly meeting and addressing the pending
project implementation issues. A Deputy Minister of Justice was appointed by PAC to act
as a primary contact for the JRPIU in addressing numerous issues during the daily
implementation work, including coordinating the work with other state agencies. This
relationship worked well to address specific implementation issues.

However, the performance of the Working Groups (WG) established under the PAC for
all project components was unsatisfactory. In reality, this mechanism of WGs proved to
be ineffective and unworkable. As a result, the JRPIU staff was required to take a more
hands-on approach to preparing and supervising activities under all components working
directly with the PAC members led by the Justice Minister.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

                  Implementing Agency                                   Performance
           Judicial Reform Project           The performance of JRPIU is rated highly satisfactory
           Implementation Unit               in recognition of the professionalism, efficiency and
                                             dedication of its staff. The work of the JRPIU was
                                             significantly improved with the appointment of the new
                                             Director following the unexpected resignation of key
                                             staff in 2002. Despite of being one of the smallest PIUs
                                             in Armenia, the JRPIU was effective in addressing
                                             enormous implementation difficulties and problems,
                                             particularly in relation with the construction works,
                                             procurement issues, as well as carrying out non-core
                                             PIU functions, like drafting legislative amendments
                                             and government decisions, developing concepts of


                                             23

                                              reforms and relevant TORs. The JRPIU showed real
                                              professionalism during multiple audits conducted by
                                              various control agencies that eventually did not reveal
                                              any major implementation problems or violations of
                                              existing procedures and policies. Despite of delays in
                                              project implementation, JRPIU was able to complete
                                              all major activities and reach a disbursement rate of
                                              more than 99 %- one of the highest rates among
                                              investment projects implemented in Armenia.

          MOJ                                 The Justice Ministry's performance is rated as
                                              satisfactory. MOJ has provided continuing support
                                              and leadership in advancing the project implementation
                                              and addressing major implementation problems. MOJ
                                              leadership encouraged active and effective
                                              participation by the ESD and Official Gazette
                                              managers and staff which led to the successful
                                              implementation of the Enforcement and Legal
                                              Information components.

          CCC                                 The performance of the CCC is rated as moderately
                                              satisfactory. During the initial years of the project,
                                              CCC leadership was unable to develop a consensus on
                                              the direction for reform of judicial governance and
                                              administration. There was little cooperation between
                                              the MOJ and judiciary during this period. Only after
                                              the appointment of the new Chairman of the CCC in
                                              2005, did the effectiveness of the CCC and the judicial
                                              leadership in the project implementation improve
                                              significantly.



(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall rating of the borrower's performance is rated satisfactory. This recognizes
the Government's increasingly strong commitment to judicial reform during the life of
the project as well as the political and financial support provided for the implementation
of complex and resource demanding reforms.

Delays in the implementation of the project activities were primarily result of external
factors that were out of control of the government (unexpected rise in the construction
cost, problems with land ownership and other construction problems, national currency
appreciation, delays in constitutional reforms, cancellation of EU project, etc). Despite
these challenges the government was able to successfully complete all major activities
and ensure the achievement of the project objectives

The satisfactory rating is also based on the overall rating for the three primary
implementing agencies. The JRPIU effectively managed numerous activities and
effectively solved a number of implementation issues. The MOJ maintained consistent
reform momentum and successfully developed and put in place both ARLIS and the My


                                              24

Rights show. Lastly, while the CCC was slow to participate in project activities, it did
effectively utilize capacity building assistance and its performance changed rapidly
following the appointment of new leadership.


6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Strong and Sustained Political Leadership and Strong Reform Champions are
Essential. The project benefited significantly from the fact that the same Minister of
Justice was responsible for the project during the entire period of its implementation. His
involvement successfully mitigated the situation in which the leadership of the judiciary
was not motivated introduce changes to judicial governance and administration, as
expected under the first two project components. The absence of strong reform
champions in the judiciary, as well as limited involvement of external beneficiaries
during implementation, hindered initial implementation of the Judicial Governance and
Judicial Training components. The appointment of a new, reform oriented Chairman in
summer 2005 had a clear positive impact on project implementation for the remaining
period and secured satisfactory results for these components in the end. The Justice
Minister also had strong backing and trust of the country's political leadership, including
the President, which contributed to the Project's success. Overall, judicial reforms would
have gone much slower and less effectively if the government's policy and commitment
had not been consistent. Long-term and comprehensive judicial reforms need to be
carefully planned and led by reform champions that enjoy the support and trust of the
political leadership of the country. The reforms also need to be carefully prepared and
planned to take into account potential changes in the balance of political powers within
the government and the judiciary.

The Role of the World Bank as a Catalyst and Support of Judicial Reforms. While
reforms in the justice sector require political consensus and commitment, the role of
outside donors and assistance providers can be critical in "jump starting" and sustaining
reforms in the initial stages. The Bank was able to maintain an ongoing political dialogue
with both the Justice Ministry and the judiciary as Armenia began to reform its judicial
system in 1997 and develop its reform strategy. The availability of IDA resources to
support initial reform efforts allowed the Armenian Government to leverage its own
resources and draw in additional bilateral and multilateral donors. In addition, the Bank's
long-term perspective and broad-based project, allowed the Government to use Bank
resources and Bank knowledge as it prepared deeper reforms for the judiciary. Bank
involvement requires significant time and preparation to be successful. Problems and
delays in the Court Rehabilitation component may have been avoided if more detailed
and better preparatory work was done during preparation.

Installed Automated Systems Require Continuous Upgrade. The project introduced
several automated systems aimed at the improvement of the efficiency and effectiveness
of several key judicial institutions (court automation and case management, AESMS,
ARLIS). These systems were piloted and tested to fully comply with and operate within



                                              25

the existing legal and regulatory framework and procedures, to meet the current needs of
those institutions taking into account the available human and technical resource base of
those bodies. However, because the procedural elements and the institutional needs are
continuously changing new automated systems require regular updates to remain
effective tools for the improvement of functioning of judicial institutions and services.
For example, the court automation and case management system was developed based on
the work carried out in three pilot courts. The system itself is also based on existing
judicial governance structure and administration procedures, which might require
changes after the full introduction of the new Judicial Code. Similarly, ARLIS, as the
only public provider of legal information would require regular improvements to remain
competitive and to continue attracting more users. Thus, the government needs to take
increased role in not just the operational maintenance of those systems, but commit
resources for continuing upgrade and improvement of the systems.

Risks Associated with Linking Project Components with Other Donor Projects.
Linking a whole project component with other donor projects is highly risky and can
create serious problems for the achievement of project objectives in those specific areas.
The judicial training component of the project was designed to complement a larger Euro
one million EU TACIS grant project. The latter intended to target capacity building of the
JTC and its curriculum development aspects, while JRP assistance was intended to
provide training equipment and additional limited technical assistance to complement the
TACIS project. The TACIS grant, however, was cancelled by the EU because of apparent
unwillingness and lack of interest in implementation on behalf of the judicial leadership
during the early 2000s. As a result, the JTC was left with much more limited JRP
resources, which were not fully and effectively utilized by the judiciary until late in the
implementation period.

The Roles and Responsibilities of the Judiciary and the Executive in Implementing
Judicial Reform Projects. Placing the implementation of the first judicial reform
project under the leadership of the MOJ proved to be effective in countering weak
judicial leadership and limited capacity for project implementation. MOJ leadership
provided a mechanism of checks-and-balances between the two branches of government
during the implementation of a complex project. The implementation arrangement of
having a high level Project Administration Council (PAC) with the Minister of Justice as
its chair, and composed of representatives of the judiciary, including the Cassation Court
chairman was effective.

While realizing the importance of judicial independence, several issues make it important
to have the executive branch actively involved and even leading first-phase judicial
reforms. First, many reforms supported under the project are not only directly related to
the executive branch, but require government's continuous support for ensuring
successful implementation and sustainability of outcomes, including financial reforms.
Therefore, having the executive branch responsible for the project makes it more focused
on successful implementation and thus provides political and financial support for the
reforms. Second many institutions and judicial services and functions themselves are
placed within the executive branch, including the enforcement service and



                                             26

systematization and provision of legal information, which makes the executive a primary
beneficiary of the project. Lastly, even after strengthening judicial capacity for
implementing a comprehensive reform program, the executive branch's active
involvement (if not leadership) will be necessary because of the initial institutional and
resource advantage that executive agencies have over the judicial branch. Shared
leadership and implementation allows the project to maintain the checks-and-balances
throughout the project.

Improved Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System. More reliable and accessible
sources for data are necessary to use in M&E system for improved measurement of
progress against the achievement of project objectives during implementation. For some
of the performance indicators the best source of data for monitoring and evaluation are
survey results. The project was supposed to carry out at least two surveys, one in the
middle and one at the end of the project. The findings of these two, together with the
baseline survey conducted in the beginning of the project, could have served an effective
monitoring mechanism. However, only one survey was conducted in the end of the
project. Moreover, the last survey did not use the same methodology and questionnaires
as the baseline survey, which limited the task team's ability to carry out an effective
evaluation of the results in many important areas. In other areas the most useful
monitoring data is derived from project beneficiaries themselves. As a result, greater
focus and effort should be made to ensure that these beneficiaries have a clear
understanding of project indicators and that project recourses are committed early on to
building the beneficiaries data collection and analysis capabilities. For the next
operation, the Bank can be more persistent in following up with the mid-term surveys and
in conducting more comparable surveys. Additionally, other external indicators, such as
findings of BEEPS and Judicial Index of ABA/CEELI can be integrated into the M&E
system that would also allow for an external and unbiased evaluation of the project
outcomes.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
(if any)

Executive Summary of Public Opinion Survey (End-of-Project)

In recent years the Government of Armenia (hereinafter GOA) undertook series of
comprehensive reforms in judicial and legal system of the country. The Republic of
Armenia has received a credit from the International Development Association (IDA)
towards the cost of the Judicial Reform Project. One of the most sensitive and
complicated component of the Judicial Reform Project in Armenia is "Public Awareness"
component. The implementation of this component assumes providing general
information to Armenian citizens concerning ongoing judicial reforms as well as
identifying the basic public perception concerning such reforms.

It is obvious that the current public perception and awareness of reforming the judicial
system should be systemized and analyzed for raising the efficiency of ongoing reforms
and evaluating the results of past activities. In close cooperation with relevant
stakeholders (Council of Court Chairmen (CCC), Ministry of Justice (MOJ), Judicial
Reform Project Implementing Unit (JRPIU)) the Consultant elaborated a comprehensive
research instruments, which were applied at the same period of time. According to the
overall objective of the research the following methodological approaches have been
considered:

 -      Direct interviewing instruments to carry out public opinion survey among
 population with at least 1000 sample, including all regions of Armenia;

 -      Organizing focus group discussion in 10 different groups including
 representatives from Yerevan and marzes;

 -      Conducting expert survey in Yerevan and the regions among judges, court staff,
 lawyers, legal academicians, etc.

Taking into consideration the results of similar survey conducted in 2000, the Consultant
presents the major findings of current research in comparison with previous one.

The Consultant identified rather significant achievement in public perception towards law
enforcement. In 2000, only 5% of respondents believed that laws were mainly perfect and
30% agree that these perfect laws were not mainly followed. In contrast, 38% of
respondents agreed that laws in Armenia were mainly imperfect. The results of current
survey show that public attitude towards efficiency of law enforcement has been
significantly improved. 11.7% of respondents believe that the laws of Armenia are
mainly irreproachable and 50.6% of respondents indicate that some laws are imperfect. In

terms of absolute positive answers, the Consultant assumed that the progress is
significant. The same conclusion was true while analyzing negative attitudes. In this
respect, the Consultant found that the difference was also significant - 38% in the
previous survey and 31.7% in the current survey. The following figure illustrates
comparison of law enforcement efficiency according to public perception.

To reveal the progress in law-abidance of population, the Consultant compared the
distribution of responses to similar questions in the previous and current surveys. In this
respect, the Consultant identified that law-abidance of Armenian population was
significantly improved. If in 2000 only 1% of respondent agreed that "the laws are fully
followed" then in 2006 only 18.7% of respondents indicated that Armenian population
was fully or partially law-abiding. Comparing absolutely pessimistic answers, the
Consultant revealed that the positive difference between previous and current situation of
law abidance of population is 16.5% correspondingly - 42% and 25.5%. This is very
impressive achievement or indicator in terms of efficiency of public awareness campaign
of JR PIU.

An important achievement was identified by the Consultant when analyzing the public
satisfaction with the activities of different judicial bodies including courts, Court Acts

The next most considerable success was identified in application of TV programs as a
source of legal information. Comparing the results of previous and current surveys the
Consultant identified that currently more than 80% of respondents use television as a
main source of legal information while in 2000 the popularity of television as a source of
legal information did not exceed 20%. This assessment was conducted based on
absolutely positive responses ("Mainly Use"). The following table shows that a major
progress is also evident for radio and printed media.

positive responses)

As seen from the abovementioned table, judicial bodies, legal consultant as well as
regional and self-governance bodies were not considered as a major source of legal
information available for population.

However, the Consultant identified some pessimistic changes in public awareness of
judicial reforms implemented in Armenia. If in 2000 54% of respondents gave fully or
partially positive answers, then in current survey only 37% of respondents gave positive
answers. One of the reasons for such a phenomenon could be the difference in sampling
methodology, size and territorial coverage of these surveys. For example, the previous
survey covered only 5 regions including Yerevan, Ararat, Shirak, Tavush and Syunik,
while current survey covered all marzes and Yerevan. On the other hand, the weight of
respondents of Yerevan in previous survey was much higher comparing with that of
current survey (correspondingly 45.5% and 37.1%). Moreover, it was obvious that the
awareness level of Yerevan respondents on judicial reforms was significantly higher than
that of regional respondents. All these factors could be considered as important reasons
for inadequate comparison.

The following figures illustrate comparative analysis results of public awareness on
judicial reforms implemented in Armenia.

Nevertheless, when analyzing the legal consciousness of population in terms of
knowledge on their civil right and responsibilities, the Consultant identified that there
was a significant progress. Comparing with previous survey results and taking into
consideration the minor inconsistencies in favor of the current survey, the Consultant
outlined that the average grade of current awareness of population in terms of own civil
rights and responsibilities was higher (4.75 in 10-grade scale) than that of previous
survey (2.24 in 5-grade scale or 4.48 in 10-grade scale).

                    Armenia Judicial Reform Project (Credit 3417-AM)

Dear Mr. Varoudakis:

  Considering the Implementation Completion and Results Report prepared by the Bank,
we would like to express our appreciation to the Bank team for cooperative approach
during the Project identification, preparation and implementation. Despite some minor
issues significant work was conducted during preparation and appraisal of the Project that
ensured its successful implementation.

  It is apparent that the project contributed to the institutional development of the
judiciary through strengthening of organizational, management, operational and
administrative aspects of key judicial structures. We would like to share your ideas that
under several project components tangible results were achieved. Among these are
improving the access to legal information by launching the Armenian Legal Information
System (ARLIS), automation of courts and the Enforcement Service department,
reformed judiciary governing institutions such as the Justice Council, the Judicial
Department and Judicial School. As it is mentioned in report, despite various problems
and delays with construction contracts and works the courts infrastructure component
was successfully implemented. Among the most problematic issues that we were facing
during the project implementation was the dramatic increase in the cost of construction in
Armenia as a result of remarkable economic growth during the Project implementation
period. However, now it is reality that the physical conditions of several courts were
dramatically improved as a result of the works carried out under the Project.


                                              43

 Currently the Government of Armenia in cooperation with the Bank is starting
implementation of the Judicial Reform Second Project. In this light we would like to
assure you once more that the Armenian authorities consider the continuation of the
reforms in the judicial sector as a key priority for the next years.


Sincerely,


Gevorg Danielyan




LETTER FROM CHAIRMAN, CASSATION COURT AND COUNCIL OF
COURT CHAIRMEN

David S. Bernstein
Sr. Public Sector Management Specialist
Europe and Central Asia
The World Bank

        Dear Mr. Bernstein:

        Re: Implementation Completion and Results report for Judicial Reform Project

        Having examined the Implementation Completion and Results report for Judicial
Reform Project we would like to provide our comments.

        In our view implementing the Judicial Reform Project has played a critical role in
implementing major reforms within the judiciary in the past five years. Basically, the
main objectives for the Project should be considered as achieved. We should stress the
importance for achieving higher level of judicial independence which is the direct result
of legal and institutional reforms supported by the Project.

        Implementing all the Project components significantly improved many aspects
related with judiciary. In particular, we should assess highly satisfactory the following
achievements due to implementation of the Project:
    -   Adopting constitutional reforms;
    -   Institutional reforms within Judiciary, such as establishing and operating Judicial
        Department, reforming the Justice Council and establishing Judicial School,
    -   Introducing IT tools and placing necessary basis for court administration and
        management, raising public awareness trough "My Right" TV show,
    -   Introducing "ARLIS" legal database



                                              44

   -  Providing adequate infrastructure to all the courts involved in the Project

      We believe that all positive outputs should serve as substantial basis for further
reforms within judiciary under the Judicial Reform Second Project.


Yours Sincerely,

Hovhannes Manukyan
