REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA
FOR A HIGHWAY PROJECT
1. *I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Equatorial Guinea for the equivalent
of US$ 2 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for
highway maintenance.   The project will be financed jointly with UNDP
which has agreed to make a grant of US$ 400,000.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The findings of the most recent economic mission to Equatorial
Guinea are reported in The Economy of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea:
Recent Evolution and Prospects (Number AW-37a),distributed on November 27,
1972.  Annex I contains the country data sheet of this report.
3.        Equatorial Guinea, a small Western African country, is composed
of Rio Muni which is located between Cameroon and Gabon on the African
mainland, the island of Fernando Poo in the Bight of Biafra, and a few
small islands.   Total population in 1970 was an estimated 300,000 of
which 90,000 resided in Fernando Poo.   Two thirds of the island's popu-
lation consisted of Nigerian semi-permanent laborers and their families.
Average per capita GNP in 1970 was US$ 210 but Fernando Poo, with its
very fertile soils, accounted for half of the GNP of the country.
4.        The country, a former overseas province of Spain, gained
autonomy in 1963 and became independent in 1968.   Its main economic
activity is agriculture.   There are indications of off-shore oil deposits,
but there are as yet no definite prospects for commercial exploitation.
Cocoa, coffee, oil palm and timber account for the bulk of the population's
cash income and for over 90 percent of exports.   Until independence,
operation of plantations and exploitation of forest concessions relied
heavily on Nigerian laborers and expatriate management, mainly Spanish.
Expatriates also filled most of the responsible positions in Government,
banking, and commerce.



- 2 -
5.        Equatorial Guinea's transition to independence has been difficult.
While before independence it had been agreed that the Spanish administrative
and technical staff would remain in the country to supplement local adminis-
trators until sufficient local staff would have been trained, after indepen-
dence many expatriates left.   The country now has a shortage of skilled
personnel at all levels--administrators, managers, and technicians.   In
addition, large numbers of Nigerian workers left when their contracts expired.
The results for the economy have been serious.   Work on many cocoa and oil
palm plantations has now come to a standstill and forest concessions have
been abandoned.   Production of cocoa, coffee, palm oil, and timber is well
below 1968-69 levels and unemployment is high.   At the same time, the
Government's efficiency remains impaired by the absence of competent
administrators.
6.        In view of the general deterioration of the economy, the most
urgent requirement is to improve public administration, to prepare a coor-
dinated program of urgent measures to restore production and to establish a
list of priority investments for development in key sectors, such as
agriculture and forestry, transport, and education.
7.        With a limited number of educated people, the country will
continue to experience severe difficulties in the field of public adminis-
tration and economic management.   Therefore, a large volume of technical
assistance is needed to help the Government in the immediate future.   The
Fund, the Bank and various UN agencies have already provided some assistance.
The Government has had further discussions with both UN and bilateral sources
and indications are that-substantial assistance will be available.   Simul-
taneously, the Government should formulate an education policy aimed at the
long-term solution of the country's manpower needs and arrange for adequate
training of national technical staff.
8.        In the agricultural sector, the Government is taking steps to
induce foreign plantation owners and managers to return to Equatorial Guinea
and has signed a new labor contract with Nigeria.   It is also encouraging
workers from Rio Muni to migrate to Fernando Poo, where most of the plantations
are located.   The National Development Bank is giving priority consideration
to the credit needs of the plantations and forest concessions.
9.        In the past few years, the Government has concentrated on a number of
infrastructure investments deemed necessary for a newly independent country.
Among these were the construction of a new port at Bata on the mainland, and
administrative buildings at Santa Isabel and Bata.   These projects are now
being completed allowing the Government to direct more of its efforts to such
higher priority programs as reorganizing and improving maintenance of the
highway system.



- 3 -
10.       Further planning will be needed, however, to establish an
investment program with proper balance between investments in infra-
structure and directly productive activities.   Past public investments
were the result of ad hoc decisions and were largely finance!d with
medium-term supplier's credits and drawdown of treasury reserves.
Although net reserves by mid-1972 still were US$ 13 million (equivalent to
five months; imports),they are rapidly declining.   On the other hand,
service on supplier's credits has already mounted to US$ 2 million annually,
equivalent to 7 percent of export earnings and 20 percent of 1971 government
revenue.   Further additions to short- or medium-term debt would soon strain
the Government's ability to service external debt.   The obvious need,
therefore, is to increase the volume of long-term finance available to
Equatorial Guinea.
11.       Domestic contributions to the financing of the development program
are bound to remain modest.   In 1970 and 1971, the Government was able to
achieve current surpluses of US$ 1 - 1.5 million, about 15 percent of
government revenue.   In 1972, the Government introduced tax increases and
cut down on current expenditures.   This will have resulted in some increase
in current savings.   Debt service on supplier's credits, however, has
probably absorbed most of these savings.
12.       Prospects for further increases in government savings in the next
few years are slight.   The 1972 tax measures consisted chiefly in raising
the level of import taxes applied to goods from Spain, still the origin of
most imports, to the level applied to other imports.   In view of the low
level of economic activity, the scope for further tax measures is limited
particularly since the tax barden is already high--20 percent of the 1970
GDP.    The scope for further reductions in current expendi-tures is also
small, as increased current expenditures will be required f'or development-
related activities such as rehabilitation of agriculture, maintenance of
infrastructure and improvement of education.   Even with good fiscal
performance, the Government's contribution to development financing will
therefore remain modest.
13.       Once the Government has established a well-conceived program of
priority investments, it will find itself in a better posi-tion to attract
official development assistance, which is likely to be ava-ilable from several
sources-- bilateral donors, UN agencies and the Bank Group.  In view of the
lack of government savings,it is desirable that foreign assistance cover a
very high proportion of project cost, including,if necessary,part of local
expenditures.   Since the country is poor and faces a tight budgetary and
balance-of-payment position, assistance should be on concessionary terms.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN EQUATORIAL GUINEA
14.       Equatorial Guinea joined the Bank in July 1970 and the Association
in April 1972, and the proposed development credit would be the Bank Group's
first operation in the country.
15.       Past attempts to identify and prepare projects for Bank Group
lending have been hampered by initial difficulties in establishing contact
with the newly independent country.   Other donors have had similar diffi-
culties. In 1972, the Bank tnade available to the President of the
Republic the services of an advisor who made preliminary proposals for
investment priorities, a project preparation organization and a program to
train project experts.   Most importantly, he has helped to start a dialogue
between the authorities and the Bank on development problems and prospects
for effective Bank Group action in Equatorial Guinea.   However, our know-
ledge of the country is still insufficient to build a detailed operations
and lending program, and the Governmentts awareness of the possibilities
and conditions of Bank assistance is still limited.   In these circumstances,
our primary objective will be to define and demonstrate how the Bank Group
can effectively contribute to rehabilitation of one or two key sectors before
formulating a comprehensive lending strategy.   Our approach to the country
will,of necessity,be flexible and pragmatic.   As the basic problems now
facing Equatorial Guinea stem from an inexperienced public administration
and lack of managerial skills, we shall place emphasis on lending techniques
which will couple financing with substantial technical assistance.
16.       The proposed highway project is a good illustration of this approach.
Its main objective is to rehabilitate the highway maintenance system through
a package of technical assistance, training programs and equipment financing.
It has been conceived as a flexible program as some of its major components
will be further defined by the project experts , in consultation with the
Association, during project implementation.   A good deal of project formula-
tion, usually done during appraisal, will only be done in the supervision
phase. This first credit should enable the Government to get acquainted
with Bank Group policies and procedures and pave the way for future coope-
ration.
17.       Following the proposed project, future Bank activities will focus
on broadening our knowledge of the economy and intensifying project identi-
fication and preparation.   We are planning a second economic mission later
this year, and will concentrate our, project preparation activities on
agriculture and forestry which seem most urgently in need of help.   Unfortu-
nately, these are also sectors requiring the greatest number of managerial
and technical skills, which are now lacking.   Ways of overcoming such
difficulties would be studied by agricultural identification/preparation
missions, with help from our field mission in Abidjan.   Concurrently, in
view of the prevalence of small local enterprises such as cocoa plantations,
it appears that, with return of confidence, there might be room for improved
facilities for development financing, and we shall examine in due course how
to assist the newly created Development Bank.



PART III - THE TRANSFORT SECTOR
18.       The highway network of Equatorial Guinea is probably one of the
best in Tropical Africa.   It consists of about 1,300 km cf national
roads, 700 km of local dirt tracks and a substantial length of fores-try
roads.   One-third of the national highways are paved and most of the
others are good all-weather laterite roads.   The road system provides
adequate access to the main areas of economic activity, i.e. agriculture
and forestry, and is sufficient for the present low traffic volume.
However, it is rapidly deteriorating due to lack of adequate maintenance.
19.       The Ministry of Public Works, Housing, and Transport, which is
responsible for designing, constructing, and maintaining the road system,
has no organized maintenance division.   While routine maintenance is
performed in each province by Emall teams of laborers under the supervision
of the Directorate of Public Works, periodic maintenance works are
carried out by contractors and are usually costly and poorly supervised.
Establishment of a road maintenance organization and on-the-job training
of national technical staff, therefore, are matters of high priority.
20.       One of the main objectives of the Government is to strengthen
the political and economic unity of the country by reinfo:rcing sea and air
links between the island of Fernando Poo (the principal administrative center
of the country) and the mainland, Rio Muni.   Expansion at the port of Santa
Isabel, in Fernando Poo,is planned although the existing deep natural harbor
appears to be adequate for existing traffic.   The port of Bata, in Rio Muni,
cannot be used by sea-going vessels due to excessive siltation.   Construc-
tion of a new port south of the city is now  almost completed.   The
Government also plans to expand the Bata airport to make it comparab:Le with
the one in Santa Isabel which is capable of handling DC8's.   The economic
justification of the project is doubtful.
21.       The Bank strategy in the transport sector is to assist the
Government in rehabilitating its highway maintenance system and in
improving its overall management of the sector.   The proposed project,
including its essential technical assistance and training component, is an
important step in this direction.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       The project was identified by a Bank mission in November 1970 and
was appraised in August 1971.   An appraisal report (PTR 106a, dated
March 6, 1973) is being distributed separately.   Negotiation of the project
took place in Washington, D.C., from the 12th to the 17th of January 1973.
The borrowerls delegation was led by Mr. Andres Nko Ivasa, Minister of
Finance, and included Mr. Primo Jose Esono Mika, Ambassador to the UN and
Mr. Salvador Ela Ndongo Nsing, Chief of the Presidentts Office.



- 6 -
23.       The Project, which is estimated to cost US$ 2.7 million equivalent,
consists of:
a) technical assistance, including a training program, for
about two and a half years to help the Government improve
highway administration and maintenance;
b) purchase of maintenance and workshop equipment, vehicles,
spare parts, and materials;
c) construction or improvement of workshops, garages, and
warehouses; and
d) improvement of about 30 kilometers of roads.
24.       UNDP will finance up to 108 man-months of expert services.   The
Association will be the Executing Agency.   The experts will provide orga-
nizational support to the Directorate of Public Works; train national
counterparts, including equipment operators and mechanics; determine
immediate maintenance equipment needs; and prepare a five-year highway
maintenance and rehabilitation program.   Four experts have already been
selected by the Association and approved by the Government.   The success
of the technical assistance will be a major determinant of proper execution
of the project, since it is this item on which all other project components
depend.
25.       Maintenance equipment will be purchased in two installments.   The
first list which will cover the most urgently needed items (totalling up to
US$ 150,000) will be prepared by the experts soon after credit approval and
agreed on by the Government and the Association.   This equipment will be
ordered on the basis of quotations from local agents and import companies.
A second, more comprehensive, list of essential maintenance equipment and
vehicles, tools, and spare parts will then be prepared for procurement through
international competitive bidding,, To ensure that this second group of
equipment can be used effectively, the Association will release funds for its
procurement only when the Government and the Association have agreed on the
five-year road maintenance and rehabilitation program and the level of
budgetary provisions to be made available for its implementation.   The UNDP
experts will also develop plans and prepare tender documents for construction
or improvement of workshops, garages, and warehouses, to be carried out by
local contractors.
26.       Road improvement will involve upgrading of 30 km of roads on the
mainland to serve either coffee and cocoa growing areas in the northeast or
one of the main forestry regions in the south.   Selection will be made by
the experts and approved by the Government and the Association.   Contracts
for improvement works will be awarded according to the Guidelines for Procu-
rement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits.



-7-
27.       The credit will be made to the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.
The Directorate of Public Works will be responsible for its execution,
assisted by the UNDP-financed team of expets.
28.       The Association will finance the c.i.f. cost of the equipment,
and the estimated foreign exchange cost of the extension of workshops,
buildings, garages and warehouses, and of road improvement works.  UNDP will
finance the foreign exchange cost of the services of its highway experts,
and of the vehicles and ecuipment necessary for their work.,  The Government
has provided assurances' that it'will finance the local costs'of the project.
29.       The experts are expected to commence work in the second quarter of
1973, and to complete their contracts towards mid-1975.   On this basis, the
annual breakdown of total expenditures between the Association, UNDP, and the
Government would be approximately as follows (in US$ million):
Calendar Year    IDA    UNDP    Government
1973         0.15    0.16        0.03
1974         0.95    0.16        0.07
1975         0.90    o.nR        0.20
TOTAL   2.00    0.40        0.30
30.       The benefits of the project will be substantial.   The reorganized
highway administration will allow improved management of the sector.   Impro-
vement of road maintenance will prevent further deterioration of the network.
On the basis of Bank Group experience in similarconditions in West Africa,
the investment in maintenance equipment and facilities can be expected to
generate road user savings yielding a rate of return of over 40 percent and
the road rehabilitation component at least 15 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
31.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Equatorial Guinea and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being distri-
buted totheExecutive Directors separately.
32.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms to the usual
pattern of credits for highway maintenance projects.



-8-
33.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
34.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.
