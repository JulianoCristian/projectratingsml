{"cdata!": "The principal objectives of the project\n            are to assist the country in developing renewable energy\n            sources to substitute for imported oil and to improve the\n            management performance of Guyana Electricity Corporation\n            (GEC). The project, which is a follow-up to the\n            hydroelectric power survey of Guyana, carried out with UNDP\n            financing in 1974-76, envisages: (a) a power demand study\n            under different assumptions; (b) prefeasibility studies of\n            various hydropower sites and engineering studies and cost\n            estimates of Upper Mazaruni hydropower site in order to make\n            economic comparisons and determine a feasible site for\n            hydroelectric development; (c) a feasibility study of the\n            hydropower site selected as the most economic means of\n            meeting the probable electric power demand; (d) feasibility\n            studies of small and mini-hydro developments for isolated\n            systems; and (e) provision to the GEC of management\n            assistance, staff training, and assistance in developing\n            energy conservation techniques. The project's principal\n            risk is that adequate Guyanese counterpart personnel might\n            be in short supply in the sector. Assignment of key\n            counterpart staff at an early stage of project execution and\n            close Bank monitoring would reduce this risk."}, "docdt": "1980-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
