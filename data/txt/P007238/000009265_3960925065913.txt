PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GUYANA
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR POWER DEVELOPMENT (LOAN 1906-GUA)
GOVERNMENT OF GUYANA
PREFACE
1.        This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for technical
assistance for power which the World Bank supported with Loan 1906-GUA
(US$8.00 million; 1980). The borrower was the Government of Guyana
(GOG), which needed consultancy services for power development and the
managerial and technical rehabilitation of the national power company,
the Guyana Electricity Corporation (GEC).
2.        The various power studies demonstrated that the first hydro
project of the least-cost investment sequence was one which Guyana could
not build due to financial constraints. The management-assistance
consultants improved the financial administration but lack of foreign-
exchange to purchase spare parts limited the long-term results in the
technical areas. Moreover, the high turn-over of GEC staff continually
undermined the consultant efforts to build a stable counterpart management
team.
3.        Approval and signing of the loan agreement occurred on,
respectively, October 7, and November 18, 1980. The loan agreement became
effective on January 30, 1981. The closing date was postponed from June
30, 1984 to June 30, 1986.
4.        The Energy Division of the Latin America and Caribbean
Regional Office prepared this repcrt based on information in Bank files
and a final project report prepared by GOG. This report also reflects
information gathered as a result of discussion with Bank staff.
5.        In accordance with the revised procedures for project per-
formance audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by
OED staff.
6.        Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft
report to the Borrower and GEC. Comments received from GEC have been
reproduced as an Attachment to the report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GUYANA
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR POWER (LOAN 1906-GUA)
GOVERNMENT OF GUYANA (GOG)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       Carried out (1981-1986) in circumstances of macroeconomic
deterioration and extreme foreign-exchange shortages, the project consisted
of: (i) an optimization study for the interconnected system based on a
comparison of various investment sequences of hydro and thermal units to
determine the least-cost expansion strategy; (ii) per-feasibility and
feasibility studies of various hydro sites; and (iii) consultancy services
for management assistance. These various studies showed that the first
projects of a least-cost sequence were bagasse-fired thermal units, for
which there were no feasibility studies, and a hydro electric project which
Guyana could not afford. This was a valuable conclusion, given the limited
economic resources of -he country.
2.       Acting as "in-line" managers, the management-assistance
consultants provided valuable services in maintaining operations of the
national power company (Guyana Electricity Corporation, Ltd. - GEC). They
also made some progress in introducing proper procedures in the financial
administration of GEC. However, due to lack of foreign-exchange to
purchase spare parts and due to the high turnover of counterpart staff (who
were often dissatisfied with salary levels), they were unable to
rehabilitate the company technically or to build a stable group of
competent managers.  The Bank did not agree with GEC's assessment that, due
to frustration on the part of counterpart stafr waiting to assume their
responsibilities and due to consultant preoccupation with short-run
(operational) rather than long-term (planning) problems, the "in-line"
approach was inappropriate.
3.       During implementation of this project, the Bank appraised (1982)
and then abandoned (1983) a power-system rehabilitation project due to
deteriorated macroeconomic conditions. The InterAmerican Development Bank
made (1985) a loan (US$16.1 million) for rehabilitating the GEC system; but
there have been no disbursements because of an unfulfilled condition of
disbursements (related to the selection of management consultants).
4.       As described above (para. 2), the Bank and GEC did not agree in
their respective assessments of the usefulness of the "in-line" approach of
the management consultants. However, it may be then that pre-occupation
with operational problems limited the time of the consultants for long-term
planning. To address this problem, if the Bank chooses in the future to
finance management-assistance consultants in deteriorated conditions such
as those in Guyana, it should consider increasing its commitment to provide
for both managers and planners.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GUYANA
GOVERNMENT OF GUYANA (GOG)
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR POWER DEVELOPMENT (1906-GUA)
I. Background
1.1 Bank Lending to the Sector
1.1.1 Since 1972, the Bank has made two loans amounting co US$14.0
million equivalent benefitting the power sector: 1906-GUA (1980;US$8.0
million), which is the subject of this report; and 875-GUA (1973;
US$6.0 million), which helped to finance the First Power Project. GEC
also benefitted from a structural adjustment loan (1948-GUA), which
provided some resources to purchase spare parts for GEC.
1.1.2 The First Power Project was not a success. The responsibility
for this result was shared by GEC, the Bank, the co-financers, and the
consultant, according to the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
(Report No. 4621, June 30, 1983). During project implementation, the
Guyana Electricity Corporation (GEC) exhibited serious shortcomings in its
technical and financial management; and by the time of loan closing (1978),
it was evident that GEC was not efficiently managed and its financial
position was precarious. Loan 1906-GUA included funding to cover, inter
alia, the cost of consultants who would address the management shortcomings
of GEC.
1.2 Sector Organization
1.2.1 The organization of the power sector is shared by different
agencies of the Government of Guyana (GOG). The National Energy
Authoritv (NEA), part of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources,
is responsible for formulation of a national energy policy. The
Ministry of Finance has jurisdiction over regulatory matters (service
areas, franchises, tariffs, and inspection of electrical facilities).
The main public service electricity supplier is GEC, which is an
operating subsidiary of the Guyana State Corporation (GUYSTAC), a
Government corporation which supervises and controls the state interst
in public corporations.
1.3  The Position of GEC and its Investment Plans
1.3.1 GEC does not have an effective management, and its financial
position is precarious. Poor operating practices and lack of maintenance
of existing thermal plants and distribution system have made the public
system unreliable and expensive.



-2-
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1 Proiect Origin and Preparation
2.1.1 This project had its origins in GOG macroeconomic objectives and the
need to address the shortcomings of GEC (para. 1.1.2). The macroeconomic
objectives included expansion of exports, especially' alumina, and reduced
importation of expensive petroleum products through maximum utilization of
hydro power. Concerning the latter objective, the results of a national
hydro survey and a feasibility study warranted further work, respectively,
on three sites on the Potaro River (Amalia, 195 MW; Kaieteur, 520 MW; and
Tumatumari, 90 MW) and a site on the Mazaruni River (1050 MW) (referred to
as the Upper Mazaruni -- UM). The shortcomings of GEC included limited
managerial capacity, frequent technical failures, and a deficient
financial administration.
2.1.2 In May 1979, GOG requested Bank review of development of UM.
Such development would be part of a larger scheme to expand the
aluminum industry and would include construction of an aluminum
smelter. In this connection, the GCOG established the Upper Mazaruni
Development Authority (UMDA), which was trying to interest the
international aluminum companies in the smelter (or possibly Venezuela
as purchaser of electricity). During subsequent discussions,
principally in Washington in December 1979, it became evident that with
a firm large market -- and this would depend on the success of UMDA to
find a customer -- UM could be justified, and in the absence cf such a
new market, a phased development of smaller hydroelectric project(s)
would be appropriate.
2.1.3 In February 1980, a pre-appraisal mission reached ar understanding
with the UMDA on the structure of a technical assistance project which
would consist of: (1) a two-phase optimization study for the
interconnected-system generating plant; and (2) pre-feasibility and
feasibility studies, plus bidding documents, for certain isolated
systems (Lethem and Matthews Ridge). The first stage of the
optimization study woald consist of market projections under different
assumptions and an economic comparison of all technically feasible
solutions, including UM, Amalia, Kaeiteur, Tumatumari, Tiboku, Tiger
Hill, plus biomass development. The second phase (feasibility, bidding
documents) would be undertaken for the optimum solution once the market
had been defined. The expected completion date for the first phase of
the optimization study was August 1981. If UMDA were successful in
finding a customer, it was anticipated that UM would be the optimum
solution. If UMDA were not successful, it was anticipated that one of
the smaller sites (or perhaps biomass) would be the optimum solution.
2.1.4 According to the project brief (first version, dated March 10,
1980), the Bank's role in the sector would be to assist GOG to: (a)
improve sector planning and design coherent development programs; (b)
identify, prepare, and execute projects of high priority; (c) devise
appropriate demand and pricing policies; and (d) strengthen



-3-
administration and regulation. The project would assist GOG in: (1)
the development of adequate hydropower and possibly other indigenous
resources to meet projected demand by least-cost solutions; and (2)
improved balance of payments by reducing dependence on imported fuels.
The brief included no estimates on the cost of the pr.oposed project or
the size of a possible Bank loan.
2.1.5 In May 1980, an appraisal mission visited Guyana. The revised
project brief (dated June 16, 1980) expanded the project to include a
management-assistance component; and estimated the project cost at US$16.9
million. The proposed Bank loan (US$13.0 million) would cover the
equivaler.t foreign-cost of the project. The Government was expected to
supply local-currency financing (US$3.9 million). Because of financial
constraints, the Bank reduced the scope of the project by reducing
substantially work on the second phase of the optimization study -- that
is, by completing only the feasibility study and preliminary design of the
selected site. Annex 2.1 sets forth the final definition of the project.
With these reductions, the total cost of the project was estimated at
US$10.4 million, with a foreign cost component (US$8.0 million) to be
covered by a Bank loan. As no major problems delayed further processing of
the loan, the Bank proceeded to invite representatives of GOG for
negotiations.
2.2 Negotiations
2.2.1 No major problems delayed negotiations (August 19-21, 1980).
During negotiations, the Bank received assurances that the proposed
project would not compromise the positions of either Guyana or
Venezuela with respect to disputed territory; and agreed with GOG on
appropriate covenants for executing the project. Annex 2.2 sets forth
major covenants of the loan agreement. A post-appraisal mission visited
Guyana in September 1980 to review procedures for consultant selection.
The Executive Directors of the Bank approved the loan on October 7,
1980. Bank and GOG representatives signed the loan agreement on
November 18, 1980. The amount of the loan was US$8.0 million; its term
was 10 years, including 4 years of grace an an interest rate of 9.25%
per annum. The commitment fee was three quarters of 1%. The loan
agreement became effective on January 30, 1981, just a little before
the date specified in the loan agreement, February 18, 1981.

III. PROJECT COST AND IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 Actual and Forecast Data on Prolect Cost and Execution
3.1.1     Annexes 3.1-3.2  compare actual and forecast project data
with respect to: (i) costs and sources of financing; and (ii) execution
dates by component. Annexes 3.3 and 3.4 compare actual and forecast
data with respect to: (iii) disbursement timing; and (iv) allocation of
loan proceeds. The following paragraphs discuss the information set
forth in those annexes.
3.2 Project Cost and Implementation
3.2.1     As completed, the project cost amounted to US$9.3 million
rather than US$10.5 million, as expected at appraisal (Annex 3.1).
Compared with the forecast completior date of December 31, 1983, the
actual completion date was September 1985 when consultant personnel for
management assistance left Guyana (Annex 3.2), although disbursements
for small sums continued to the revised closing date of June 30, 1986
(Annex 3.3). The completed project differed somewhat from the
appraised project by the reduction or deletion of certain components
(Part A2 aud A3) and by the redefinition of the project to include spare
parts. The Bank agreed to tne reallocation of the proceeds of 1906-GUA to
finance the purchase of spare parts (Annex 3.4).
3.2.2     The results of the project were disappointing: the studies
identified no least-cost hydro project in Guyana which was affordable
(Annex 3.2, footnotes 3 and 8); and the management assistance group
failed in their efforts to rehabilitate GEC technically and
managerially because of, respectively, a lack of foreign exchange to
purchase spare parts and the turn-over of GEC staff in search of better
paying jobs (Annex 3.2, footnote 10). It should be understood that
this project was carried out in poor macroeconomic circumstances which
resulted in severe foreign-exchange shortages. Given the findings of the
power studies, GOG and the Bank agreed that rehabilitation of the existing
system was the most appropriate development strategy for GEC. The Bank
appraised (1982) and then abandoned (1983) a power-system rehabilitation
project as the economy continued to deteriorate. In 1985, the
InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB) made a loan of US$16.1 million for
rehabilitation of the system; but, as certain conditions of effectiveness
remained unfulfilled, there have been no disbursements.
3.2.3    Two consulting firms prepared the various studies of Parts A and
B; and their performance was considered to be satisfactory by the Bank and
GOG. A third consulting firm supplied management assistance services.
During the period 1981-1983, GEC was generally satisfied with the services
of the consultant personnel, notwithstanding some reser-ations about the
consultants' not having worked together prior to arriving in Guyana. For
the subsequent period (January 1984-September 1985), GEC felt that
consultant personnel were insufficiently committed to the project, and,
more importantly, that the "in-line" approach was deficient: reluctance on
the part of consultants to delegate duties to their counterparts caused
frustration and loss of motivation on the part o. the latter; and
management responsibilities led consultant



-5-
personnel to focus on short-term (maintenance) rather than long-term
problems (development and planning) The Bank did not agree, feeling
that this approach was appropriate for GEC and that efforts of
consultant personnel had been essential to the operations of GEC (Annex
3.2, footnote 10).
3.3 Closing Date and Reallocation of Proceeds
3.3.1     In May 1984 the Bank agreed to a GOG request to amend the loan
agreement to establish a category for spare parts, to reallocate proceeds
of the loan, and to extend the closing date. In order to evaluate this
request, the Bank extended the closing date on an interim basis from June
30, 1984 to August 30, 1984. Sptisfied that these requests were
reasonable, the Bank extended tlie closing date to June 1985. In May 1985,
the Government again requested an extension of the closing date (to June
30, 1986) and a second reallocation of loan pro^eeds to purchase more spare
parts; and the Bank agreed. There being no further requests, the Bank
closed the loan on June 30, 1986. The undisbursed balance amounted to
about US$144,000.
3.4 Financial Reporting
3.4.1    The Bank judged as poor the performance of GOG with respect to the
covenanted obligation to furnish annually an audited statement on project
expenditures (Annex 2.2, para. 3). GOG did not supply audited financial
reports for the years 1980-1982 until 1984. Thereafter, it furnished only
unaudited statements. The Bank did not threaten to suspend disbursements.
3.4.2    There were no financial covenants in the Loan Agreement and no
reporting requirements for GEC. The absence of such covenants removed from
the Bank the option of suspension because of poor financial performance (or
poor financial reporting) on the part of GEC. The power company furnished
audited financial statements to the Bank through 1985. It did not earn a
profit between 1980 and 1985.



IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
4.1 GOG and GEC
4.1.1     Due to its own economic and political difficulties and a
deterioratirg international economic situation beyond its control, GOG was
unable to secure the foreign exchange to finance the purchase of spare
parts essential to the technical rehabilitation of GEC; and because of its
national wage policy, GOG would not introduce sufficient pay incentives to
hold qualified management staff at GEC. In such circumstances, the
technical and managerial rehabilitation of GEC failed to materialize. The
problem of      institutional autonomy for GEC is beyond the scope of this
report.
4.2 IBRD
4.2.1     The Bank proposed covenants appropriate to the project.  Annex
2.2 discusses the major covenants and the GOG efforts to comply. The
Bank invested substantial resources to assure proper supervision. For
example, during the period September 1980-January 1983 (about 29 months), a
mission visited Guyana about every three months either to supervise the
project or to prepare the rehabilitation project (para. 3.2.2). These
efforts were unavailing, given the deteriorating economic situation of
Guyana and the wage policy of the GOG. After January 1983, the Bank
supervised the project satisfactorily every year.
4.3 The Consultants
4.3.1     GOG and the Bank agreed that the performance of the
consultants for the studies was satisfactory. GOG and the Bank
disagreed in their opinion on the performance of the management-
assistance consultants (para. 3.2.3). The Bank felt that preoccupation
with daily managerial tasks on the part of the consultants was, under the
circumstances, appropriate, even if such preoccupation limited the time
available for long-term planning and training.



-7-
V. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
5.1 Limited Results
5.1.1     The power studies demonstrated that there was no affordable,
least-cost hydro project. These studies prevented GOG from embarking on an
investment beyond its means which in the context of Guyana's very limited
economic resources turned out to a valuable conclusion.
5.1.2     Except for some improvements in the financial administration
of GEC, the managment assistance team was unable to make a long-term
impact due to lack of foreign-exchange to purchase spare parts and due to
the high turn-over of counterpart staff. They did, however, keep the
company running; and their use as "in-line" managers appears warranted.
If the Bank should choose in the future to assist in such deteriorated
circumstances as existed in Guyana, it should be prepared to consider
increasing its commitment to provide for boti. managers and planners; and it
should not be surprised by a very low level of improvement following the
withdrawal of such consultants.

Malor Covenants of the Loan Agreement
1.            The major covenants of the loan agreement for loan 1906-GUA
required GOG to:
(i) carry out the project with due diligence and efficiency
and in conformity with appropriate engineering, administrative, and
financial practices and provide funds, facilities, services, and other
resources, as needed (Section 3.01);
(ii) employ consultants in order to assist in the carrying out
of the project on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank
(Section 3.02);
(iii) select by August 1, 1981 an electricity power development
for full feasibility study, which development shall have been
identified in connection with the first phase of the optimization study
(see Annex 2.1, Part A, para. 1); and furnish the Bank with evidence of
satisfactory commitment from at least one large power user which would
afford adequate justification for proceeding with the development if
the selected project is either Upper Mazaruni (UM' or Kaietur (Section
3.03);
(iv-a) consult with the Bank before proceeding with preparation
of detailed cost estimates on UM (Section 3.04 a);
(iv-b) inform the Bank whether it will proceed with the small
hydroelectric developments at Tumatumari, Lethem, and Mathews Ridge no
later than one month after completion of the feasibility studies
expected for the isolated systems (see Annex 2.1, Part B, para. 1); and
transfer to GEC the responsibility for operating such systems by
September 30, 1981 (Section 3.04 b);
(iv-c) review with the Bank a proposal to be made for management
assistance (Section 3.04 c).
(v) cause the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) to
furnish not less than four months after the end of each year an audited
report with respect to the project (Section 4.03).

ANNEX 2.2
Page 2 of 2
2.         The Government complied with items i, ii, iii, and iv.  With
respect to item iii, the Bank agreed to change the deadline to September 1,
1982; and accepted the selection of Tumatumari for full feasibility study
(Annex 3.2, footnote 8). GOG was unable to identify a large power user for
UM or Kaieteur and did not proceed with the preparation of detailed cost
estimates for UM (items iii and iv-a above; also, Annex 3.2, footnotes 4
and 5). As GOG decided not to proceed with Lethem and Mathews Ridge, a
decision on GEC responsibility for operating isolated systems because a
moot issue (Annex 2.2, footnote 7). GOG reviewed with the Bank the
proposal(s) for management assistance during all stages of project
implementation (Annex 2.2, footnotes 9 and 10).
3.         GOG compliance with respect to item (v) was poor.  In April
1981, the Bank provided GOG with an example of the desired financial report
on the project. It consisted of a simple statement prepared by an auditor
showing cumulative expenditures by category broken down by foreign and
local currencies and stated in US dollars. In spite of repeated requests,
the Bank was unable to obtain such reports until 1984 when their submission
was a condition for the first extension of the closing date of the loan
(para. 3.3.1). Bank files indicate receipt of audited reports for the
years 1980-1982 and unaudited reports subsequently.

1/ Late signing reflected lack of delegation of authority to the
MENR by Cabinet, which was reluctant to proceed with the op imi-
zation study or Tumatumari study, as they might lead to substitution of
project other than UM as first step of a least-cost generation ex-
pansion program (para. 2.1.2).
2/ Late completion reflected delays by another consultant in complet-
ing feasibility study on Tumatumari hydro project (THP) (note 8.)
3/ After analyzing different demand scenarios and generation resources,
consultant on above concluded that least-cost sequence was bagasse
thermal units (80MW) followed by Amalia hydro plant (195 MW). This
finding contradicted feasibility study on THP (50MW) (prepared by
another consultant). (Annex 2.2, paras. l-iii and 2).  Given time (at least
two years) to prepare Amalia (plus high cost) and absence of feasibility
study for thermal units, Bank favored THP; but recommended further study of
options, pending advent of more favorable economic circumstances. GOG
authorized no further expansion planning beyond preparation of draft
bidding documents on THP. Due to economic deterioration, Bank deferred
processing of a rehabilitation project (appraised in 1982).
4/ Late signing reflected unsuccessful GOG efforts to identify a buyer
of electricity from UM. GOG reduced scope of services from
feasibility, etc. to exploratory drilling, resevoir mapping, etc.
5/ Due to a lack of financing, GOG and Bank agreed to delete above.
Financing was expected in connection with possible Bank loan for
THP.

7/ On basis of feasibility study, consultant concluded that Lethem was
not a viable alternative to thermal power. On basis of prefeasi-
bility study, consultant concluded that Mathew Ridge was only
marginally more economical than diesel power. GOG did not authorize
a feasibility study. (Annex 2.2, para. 2).
8/ Delayed completion reflects Government decision to expand scope
of study from 2MW isolated Tumatumari hydro plant (THP) to 50 MW
plant for interconnected system. This decision was based on
prefeasibility finding (August 1980) that THP was technically and
economically justified (expected cost: US$108 m.). Consultant
subsequently (July 1981) drafted feasibility study recommending a
run-of-river installation (50MW) expected to cost US$167 m. (Annex 2.2,
para. 2). The higher cost estimate caused surprise and disappointment. In
the opinion of the Bank, the draft report did not adequately cover
"optimization" questions (such as scope and cost for staged
development). Bank, IDB, GOC, and consultant agreed (November 1981)
on supplementary information which was reviewed in March 1982. The
supplementary studies analyzed alternatives for Tumatumari site and
compared them with all-thermal developments. Having addressed
"optimization" questions, consultant recommended THP, provided that
it were followed by a larger hydro project (such as Amalia). The
consultant for the optimization study (see note 3) argued that this
recommended sequence was not a least-cost strategy, as construction
of THP would lead to substantial underutilization of subsequent
projects (Amalia) in their early years. GOG authorized preparation
of draft bidding documents on THP (note 3).

and failure of GEC to take timely decisions due to workforce con-
straints.
10/ Above consisted of: (i) an initial assessment of GEC and proposals for
improvements (Annex 2, para. 2); and (ii) implementation of proposals by
consultant personnel functioning as "in-line" managment. First contract
(dated 04/27/81) covered services (April-December, 1981) for five-man
assessment team. Second contract (dated February 13, 1982) covered the
implementation phase (December 1981-December 1983) and provided for
services of a twelve-man management group on long-term assignments (twenty-
four man years), plus other personnel on short-term assignment (six-man
years).  In December 1983, the agreement was extended to July 1984.  A
second agreement was made for similar services up to July 1985. This was
later extended to December 1985 (but consultant finished providing services
in September 1985). GEC was generally satisfied with consultant
performance for the period through December 1983, even though major
objectives were not met for lack of foreign exchange to purchase
spare parts and the high turn-over of counterpart staff. Later, GEC was
critical of the "in-line" approach and expressed itself as not fully
satisfied with performance of consultant personnel after 1983. In the
opinion of GEC, the "in-line" approach generated frustration among
counterpart staff, as consultant staff were reluctant to delegate duties to
their counterparts. The "in-line" apprpach was also deficient because it
caused consultant staff to concentrate on maintaining systems rather than
on developing systems and procedures and on long-term planning. Further,
GEC deemed the turn-over of consultant staff to be high and their
commitment to the project to be insufficient. The Bank, the consultant,
and GEC agreed that lack of foreign exchange for the purchase of spare
parts and the high turn-over of counterpart staff were major factors
limiting the effectiveness of consultant work. Lack of foreign exchange
prevented rehabilitation of GEC facilities; the turnover of GEC staff was
due, primarily, to low salaries. In the opinion of the Bank, these factors
were beyond the control of the consultant and GEC.  The consultant
and the Bank agreed on the appropriateness of the "in-line" approach
for GEC. The consultant felt that GOG and GEC had some
responsibility for the turn-over and motivational problems of
individual consultants because of slow GOG action in securing financing
for their services -- that is, GOG did not move in as timely a fashion as
it might have in seeking extensions of closing dates and reallocations for
Loan 1906-GUA, thereby generating scheduling problems for the consultants.

The Guyana Electricity Corporation (GFC) has the following comments on the
Project Cbmpletion Report (PCR) prepared by the Energy Division of the
Latin Pmerica and Caribbean Regional Office, Wbrld Bank:
1.     Manaenent Cbnsultants.
GEC is still of the opinion that the 'in-line' management approach
was the main reason why the objectives of the sub-project were
only partially achieved. The 'in-line' management approach did
not allow the management consultants the tine to develop and docu-
nent procedures and pr-actices.Due to the turn-over of GEC's staff,
systems introduced were not maintained.
2.      Loan from the Inter-Anerican Development Bank (DDB).
All preconditions to the first disbursement of the MDB Loan has
been satisfied and the IDB has declared the loan eligible for
disbursenent.
