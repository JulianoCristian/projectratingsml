      within the Morava region in order to promote accelerated\n            economic development in the least-developed areas of the\n            Morava River Basin; (b) provision of improved water supplies\n            and extension of the sewer networks in the towns of Titovo\n            Uzice and Cacak, to include: a concrete arch dam (70 m\n            high), a water transmission line from the main reservoir, a\n            water treatment plant, transmission and distribution\n            pipelines, pumping station and distribution reservoirs,\n            sewage disposal systems, a wellfield development 2 km\n            upstream of Cacak, collector pipeline and balancing\n            reservoir, storm drains to alleviate local flooding, and\n            engineering studies, including a water supply system\n            development study and the final design for the future sewage\n            treatment plant; and (c) demonstration of the feasibility\n            and economics of low cost irrigation schemes, to include the\n            construction, operation, and monitoring of pilot irrigation\n            schemes covering approximately 400 ha in Milosevac and 200\n            ha in Aleksinac."}, "docdt": "1976-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
