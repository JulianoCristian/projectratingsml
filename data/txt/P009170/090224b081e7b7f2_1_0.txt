2.   For the purposes of this Schedule the term "foreign expendi-
tures" means expenditures in the currency of a country other than
the Guarantor and for goods or services supplied from the territory
of any country other than the Guarantor.
3.   The disbursement percentages have been calculated in compli-
ance with the policy of the Bank that no proceeds of the Loan shall
be disbursed on account of payments for taxes levied by, or in the
territory of, the Guarantor on goods or services, or on the import-
ation, manufacture, procurement or supply thereof; to that end,
if the amount of any such taxes levied on or in respect of any item
to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan decreases or in-
creases, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, increase or de-
crease the disbursement percentage then applicable to such item
as required to be consistent with the aforementioned policy of the
3F  Bank.
4.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, no with-
drawals shall be made in respect of payments made for expenditures
prior to the date of this Agreement, except that withdrawals, in
an aggregate amount not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000,
may be made in respect of Sub-categories (a) and (b) within Cate-
gories (1) and (2) and Sub-category (d) within Category (3) on
account of payments made for such expenditures before that date
but after January 1, 1976.
5.   Notwithstanding the allocation of an amount of the Loan or
the disbursement percentages set forth in the table in paragraph 1
above, if the Bank has reasonably estimated that the amount of the


﻿-40-
Loan then allocated to any Sub-category within either Category (1),
Category (2) or Category (3) will be insufficient to finance the
agreed percentage of all expenditures in that Sub-category, the
Bank may, by notice to the Borrower: (i) reallocate to such Sub-
category, to the extent required to meet the estimated shortfall,
proceeds of the Loan which are then allocated to another Sub-category
within such Category and which in the opinion of the Bank are not
needed to meet other expenditures, and (ii) if such reallocation
cannot fully meet the estimated shortfall, reduce the disbursement
percentage then applicable to such expenditures in order that
further withdrawals under such Sub-category may continue until all
expenditures thereunder shall have been made.
6.   If the Bank shall have reasonably determined that the procure-
ment of any item in any Category is inconsistent with the proce-
dures set forth or referred to in this Agreement, no expenditures
for such item shall be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan
and the Bank may, without in any way rest-icting or limiting any
other right, power or remedy of the Bank under the Loan Agreement,
by notice to the Borrower, cancel such amount of the Loan as, in
the Bank's reasonable opinion, represents the amount of such ex-
penditures which would otherwise have been eligible for financing
out of the proceeds of the Loan.

lines for Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits"
published by the Bank in August 1975 (hereinafter called the Guide-
lines), on the basis of international competitive bidding.
2.   (a) Foreign contractors shall not be required to register
in Yugoslavia as a prerequisite for submitting bids. In the event
that registration shall be necessary after a foreign contractor
has been notified that he will be awarded a contract, the Borrower
shall facilitate the registration.
(b) Contracts for civil works shall include a provision al-
lowing non-Yugoslav contractors to convert into foreign exchange
and to repatriate a reasonable portion of contract payments, and
to import specialized manpower and equipment as required to carry
out their services.
B.   Other Procurement Procedures
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph A.1 above, civil
works contracts estimated to cost less than the equivalent of
$500,000 and contracts for equipment and materials estimated to


﻿- 48 -
cost less than the equivalent of $100,000 may be awarded on the
basis of local advertising only and in accordance with the usual
local competitive bidding procedures of the Guarantor; foreign
firms will be entitled to submit bids.
C.   Evaluation and Comparison of Bids for Goods; Preference for
Domestic Manufacturers
1.   For the purpose of evaluation and comparison of bids for the
supply of goods except those to be procured in accordance with
local procedures: (i) bidders shall be required to state in their
bid the c.i.f. (port of entry) price for imported goods, or the
ex-factory price for domestically-manufactured goods; (ii) customs
duties and other import taxes on imported goods, and sales and
similar taxes on domestically-supplied goods, shall be excluded;
and (iii) the cost to the Borrower of inland freight and other
expenditures incidental to the delivery of goods to the place of
their use or installation shall be included.
2.   Goods manufactured in Yugoslavia may be granted a margin of
preference in accordance with, and subject to, the following pro-
visions:
(a) All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall
clearly indicate any preference which will be granted, the infor-
mation required to establish the eligibility of a bid for such
preference and the following methods and stages that will be fol-
lowed in the evaluation and comparison of bids.
(b) After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in
one of the following three groups:


﻿(1) Grop A: bids offering goods manufactured in
Yugoslavia if the bidder shall have established
to the satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank
that the manufacturing cost of such goods includes
a value added in Yugoslavia equal to at least
20% of the ex-factory bid price of such goods.
(2) Group B: all other bids offering goods manufac-
tured in Yugoslavia.
(3) Group C: bids offering any other goods.
(c) All evaluated bids in each group shall be first compared
among themselves, excluding any customs duties and other import
taxes on goods to be imported and any sales or similar taxes on
goods to be supplied domestically, to determine the lowest evalu-
ated bid of each group. Such lowest evaluated bids shall then be
compared with each other, and if, as a result of this comparison,
a bid from group A or group B is the lowest, it shall be selected
for the award.
(d) If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph (c)
above, the lowest bid is a bid from group C, all group C bids shall
be further compared with the lowest evaluated bid from group A
after adding to the c.i.f. bid price of the imported goods offered
in each group C bid, for the purpose of this further comparison
only, an amount equal to (i) the amount of customs duties and other
import taxes which a non-exempt importer would have to pay for the
importation of the goods offered in such group C bid, or (ii) 15%


﻿-50-
of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods if said customs duties and
taxes exceed 15% of such price. If the group A bid in such fur-
ther comparison is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award;
if not, the bid from group C which as a result of the comparison
under paragraph (c) is the lowest evaluated bid shalli, be selected.
D.   Procurement Without Contracting

tions and modifications to existing facilities or installing new
water and sever pipes, may be carried out by force account, under
arrangements acceptable to the Bank, provided, however, that the
cost of works under Parts E and F of the Project to be so carried
out shall not exceed in the aggregate the equivalent of $1,000,000
and $3,000,000, respectively.

ification is invited, inform the Bank in detail of the procedure
to be followed and shall introduce such modifications in said
