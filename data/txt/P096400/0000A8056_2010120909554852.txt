                         Implementation Status Overview
                         APL3 has been completed, ahead of schedule. It financed 5 underground cables, an overhead transmission line (Karabiga-Can-Soma 380kV) from the Northwest part of Turkey to
                         the Southwest, 3 substations and buy 8 new transformers. It was also used to start the Yenibosna-Davutpasa Cable which will be completed under APL 6. One substation which was
                         planned under this project is not complete, theYenikapi 154/33 KV substation in the old part of Istanbul. It has been held up on account of archeological finds. APL 6 is planned to be
                         used to complete it, once work can be commenced again at the site.
