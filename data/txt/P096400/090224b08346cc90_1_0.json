International Bank\n            for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has supported\n            Turkey\u2019s energy reforms significantly over the last decade\n            by utilizing the full range of World Bank lending and\n            technical support in ways that complement and reinforce each\n            other. The government of Turkey, with IBRD support, has\n            transformed its energy sector to increase competition,\n            expand private investment and promote sustainable use of its\n            renewable energy resources. Turkey has improved the\n            efficiency of its electricity market while increasing\n            private sector participation in power distribution and\n            generation. The World Bank\u2019s work has helped in attracting\n            large-scale private investment, particularly in renewable\n            resources. Significant new financing has been brought in to\n            support new investments in generation, and also in\n            privatized distribution. Turkey\u2019s energy sector has\n            transformed from one that was monolithic and state-owned\n            into a commercially run and liberalized market, with private\n            investment and ownership in several parts of the sector."}, "docdt": "2010-03-04T04:24:04Z"}
