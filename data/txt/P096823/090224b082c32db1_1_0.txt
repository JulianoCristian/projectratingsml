Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project will be almost fully disbursed by the closing date of March 31, 2015. (99.43%). All planned activities are expected to be completed. Four out
 of six project development indicators have been met, while one of the remaining two is substantially achieved and the other remains not achieved.

 The project has been successfully implemented with significant achievements in a) efficiency- through informatization of the primary health care system
 and social protection system, provision of medical emergency vehicles, and capacity building; b) access and equity – through disability fund, grants for
 vulnerable groups and support to the Roma Health Mediator Program; and c) quality - through number of schools that had performed external
 evaluation exercise, accreditation of primary health centers and development of clinical pathways and guidelines. Funds remaining after the closure of
 education and SP components in December 2013 were used to address emergency needs generated by the floods of May/June of 2014 (replace
 equipment, provide emergency ambulatory vehicles, etc). The project has achieved most of its stated objectives.
