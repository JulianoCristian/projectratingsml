                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Bank management approved on June 29, 2012 a restructuring that became effective on July 25, 2012. The restructuring (i) strengthens the results and monitoring framework by
                         improving the specificity, measurability and relevance of project indicators; (ii) reorganizes the Project Description to better align the Project's structure with its implementation

                         arrangements and outcomes; and (iii) simplifies the Disbursement Schedule to enable the effective use of Loan proceeds in the final year of Project implementation. Facilitated by the
                         restructuring, the government significantly improved project implementation over the last 12 months. Yet, the multi-sector design and the corresponding complex Project
                         implementation arrangements continue to hamper progress. Project implementation also experienced some delays during the political transition. Hence, the government is unlikely to
                         complete all critical project activities and fully achieve the Project Development Objectives prior to the original loan closing date and intends therefore to request a first extension.
