     REPUBLIC OF SERBIA – DELIVERY OF IMPROVED LOCAL SERVICES
                              PROJECT
                               P096823
                           LOAN NO. 7510-YF

                                   Restructuring Paper

1.      The closing date for the Republic of Serbia, Delivery of Improved Local Services
Project, Loan Number 7510-YF, P096823 will be extended by 12 months from December
31, 2012 until December 31, 2013.

2.      The Board approved a Loan in the amount of €32 million for the Delivery of
Improved Local Services Project on March 18, 2008 with the objective to assist the
Borrower in increasing the capacity of institutional actors and beneficiaries to improve
access to and the efficiency, equity and quality of local delivery of health, education and
social protection services in a decentralizing environment. The loan became effective on
March 10, 2009.

3.      At the time of the loan closing – December 31, 2012 - the Project is likely to
achieve its objectives with moderate shortcomings. By then, the Project will have
achieved targets for three out of four key performance indicators. Project implementation
significantly improved over time and benefited from a level two restructuring approved
on June 26, 2012. At the time of the loan closing, the majority but not all of the project
outputs will have been achieved. There are no outstanding audits and auditors have issued
unqualified opinions throughout.

4.      Following the general elections in May 2012, a new government assumed office
and confirmed the relevance as well as stated its commitment to achieve the Project
Development Objectives. In a letter dated November 21, 2012, the Minister of Finance
and Economy requested an extension of the loan closing date by 12 months to achieve all
of the Project objectives in a fully satisfactory manner. The government also submitted
and the Bank reviewed and found acceptable an action plan that specifies all activities
proposed for the extension period.

5.     This will be the first extension of the loan closing date.
