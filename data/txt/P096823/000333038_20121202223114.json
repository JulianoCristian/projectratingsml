The closing date for the project\n            will be extended by 12 months from December 31, 2012 until\n            December 31, 2013. The project implementation significantly\n            improved over time and benefited from a level two\n            restructuring approved on June 26, 2012. At the time of the\n            loan closing, the majority but not all of the project\n            outputs will have been achieved. There are no outstanding\n            audits and auditors have issued unqualified opinions\n            throughout. The general elections in May 2012, a new\n            government assumed office and confirmed the relevance as\n            well as stated its commitment to achieve the project\n            development objectives. In a letter dated November 21, 2012,\n            the Minister of Finance and Economy requested an extension\n            of the loan closing date by 12 months to achieve all of the\n            project objectives in a fully satisfactory manner. The\n            government also submitted and the Bank reviewed and found\n            acceptable an action plan that specifies all activities for\n            the extension period.
