   The PDO and Intermediate Outcome Indicators presented in this Section are those following the June 2012
restructuring, which aimed at improving specificity, measurability, and relevance of the indicators to the PDO. The
original indicators as presented in the Results Framework in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) have not been
presented here, as the Results Framework contained neither baseline data nor targets for the indicators, nor was
progress towards these indicators ever measure. Annex 10 presents original and revised indicators and the rationale
for the revisions as mentioned earlier.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Strategic Context. At the time of Appraisal of the Delivery of Improved Local Service
Project (DILS, the Project), the Republic of Serbia (Serbia, GoS) had outlined its 2008 National
Plan for Integration (NPI). Its NPI was a strategic document that defined Serbia’s agenda for
integration with the European Union (EU)—the country’s overarching development objective—
and clearly laid out the priorities for harmonization of Serbia’s institutional and legal framework
with EU requirements. One of its key elements was increasing employment and living standards
and encouraging more balanced regional development. Decentralization, which entailed greater
local autonomy and involvement in service delivery, provided strong fiscal incentives through the
allocation of resources to local levels of government. It was considered important for European
accession and integration, and enjoyed broad political support.

2.      Decentralization of responsibility for service delivery was also key to implementing the
GoS’ poverty reduction strategy and for improving human development. It was key to sector
strategies adopted by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development
(MOESTD), the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veterans and
Social Policy (MOLEVSP) to improve education, health and welfare outcomes, and was seen by
the GoS--together with an accompanying reform of the intergovernmental public finance system—
as a critical step in strengthening of local public administration, to make local self-governments
more accountable and responsive to the needs of households. A framework law on Local Self-
Government Finance that increased the resources and fiscal autonomy of local self-government
(LSGs) was passed in Parliament in July 2006, but awaited implementation.

3.      Social and Poverty Indicators. Serbia’s social indicators and achievements presented a
mixed picture. Health indicators (life expectancy, under-five mortality, infant mortality, maternal
mortality) had improved, but still lagged behind those of the EU-15. Serbia also faced problems in
providing quality education and was failing to equip young people with the skills and knowledge
needed by the labor market. Pre-school education reached only 33 percent of eligible children.
Serbia’s safety net for the poorest was very limited—only three percent of poor households
received targeted cash benefits, and vulnerable, excluded groups (such as Roma, refugees and
internally displaced persons (IDPs)) failed to receive benefits or services. The main social
assistance program, the materijalno obezbeđenje porodice (MOP), was well targeted, but its
coverage was extremely limited and its benefit levels low. The MOLEVSP Disability Fund,
financed with proceeds from Serbia’s State Lottery, was the primary mechanism for supporting
the provision of social services for disabled people. The risk of poverty was especially high among
children and youth, and vulnerable groups including the disabled, children, Roma, IDPs and
refugees showed the highest poverty rates.

4.      Progress with Decentralization. Delivery of health, education and social protection
services had been mainly a State level responsibility. In education, local governments were
responsible for financing the operating costs of primary and secondary schools, but staffing
patterns and salaries for teachers and other staff---the bulk of sector spending—were set and paid
for by the State. LSGs had virtually no formal role in financing health care. They assisted in the
administration of social assistance, but their budgetary responsibility was limited to providing
supplementary benefits and services over and above those required by national legislation,
provided there was flexibility in their budgets. This system resulted in a significant variation in
                                                1 
 
 
social services provided between poorer and wealthier municipalities. Despite active capacity-
building support by several donor agencies, the capacity of LSGs and other local service providers
to manage increased responsibilities varied considerably. The Ministry of Public Administration
and Local Self-Government (MPALSG) was expected to assume a critical role in assisting LSGs
to manage increased responsibilities.

5.      At the time of Appraisal, there had been some degree of decentralization of responsibility
for service delivery. Starting in January 2007, in health, selected decision-making authority had
been transferred from the State level to provincial and municipal governments, including for the
provision of primary health care (PHC), The ability of municipalities to appoint PHC directors,
was expected to provide LSGs increased “voice” in running the facilities. For most municipalities,
however, funding would still be provided on a line-item basis by the Health Insurance Fund (HIF,
a payroll-tax-financed social health insurance institution that was expected to begin implementing
capitation-based financing for selected PHC institutions. This h was expected to provide incentives
for PHC physicians to provide high quality care that met the needs/demands of users, since users
could change doctors if their demands were not met.

6.     In education, municipalities were responsible for provision and financing of pre-school
services. Primary and secondary school directors were appointed by school boards, consisting of
representatives of the municipality, teachers and parents, school directors, selected school staff.
Schools were required to prepare and implement development plans reflecting local priorities. The
GoS was piloting a “school report card” to enhance accountability of performance to local
stakeholders. However, salaries were paid by the GoS and allocated on the basis of centrally-
determined teaching loads; plans to increase local management responsibilities were under
discussion, including giving LSGs the responsibility to finance staff salaries based on a grant from
the GoS (based on per-student financing) and greater local control of the school network.

7.       Decentralization of responsibilities for the delivery of social assistance benefits and
services was expected to be limited. The MOP was delivered by de-concentrated agencies
affiliated with the MOLEVSP, the Centers for Social Work (CSWs), while child allowances were
delivered by LSGs. The GoS assigned priority to reforming the finance and delivery of services
for the disabled, transitioning out of the model of incremental financing towards one of competitive
grants awarded to innovative projects. LSGs were expected to assume greater responsibility for
delivering cash and in-kind benefits (that would still be financed from the GoS budget), and the
GoS aimed to increase the role of non-governmental, community organizations in the provision of
high quality in-kind social services.
 
8.      The Rationale for World Bank Involvement was strong. Decentralization was moving
rapidly, and the World Bank and other agencies had provided technical assistance in this area. The
World Bank was well positioned to support decentralization and help strengthen local public
administration in view of then ongoing, complementary World Bank-financed investment projects
and policy operations that supported systemic reforms in each sector. Support through analytical
work on poverty, including in the development of the Poverty Reduction Strategy, had helped
identify obstacles to increasing access to vulnerable and marginalized groups. Also, the World
Bank’s ability to work across sectors was seen as facilitating inter-ministerial coordination
required for effective decentralization of service delivery, especially important since there was no
inter-ministerial body for coordinating decentralization other than the Commission for Local Self
Government Finance that had a narrow mandate to focus on the fiscal aspects of decentralization.
The Project was also consistent with the Priority II of the World Bank’s Country Partnership
                                                 2 
                                                  
 
Strategy (CPS) FY08-11, that aimed at providing opportunities and broadening participation in
growth and its key indicators were consistent with the CPS outcomes.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

9.      The PDO was to increase the capacity of institutional actors and beneficiaries in order to
improve access to and the efficiency, equity and quality of local delivery of health, education and
social protection services, in a decentralizing environment. The Results Framework, as presented
in the PAD, is provided in Annex 13. The following outcome indicators were defined to measure
progress towards the PDO: (a) Allocation of financing from State government to local self-
governments for health and education services, made according to the Law on Local Self
Government Financing; (b) Percentage of grants awarded by the Project to support innovations in
inclusion, that have achieved success in increasing inclusion of marginalized groups (the poor) to
health, education and social protection services; (c) Share of MOLEVSP financing for disabled
groups that is allocated according to a new program-based model of allocation; (d) Satisfaction
with the quality of delivery of services among users of health facilities and disability services in
municipalities benefiting from the Project, as proxied by responses from exit surveys of users in
these municipalities; (e) Number of local service providers (PHCs, schools, CSWs and non-
governmental organizations) who have gone through a quality accreditation process, designed and
administered by the relevant institution in their sector; and (f) Establishment of information
management systems linking local service providers (PHCs, schools, CSWs and non-
governmental organizations) with the relevant line ministry in their sector, and where relevant to
the successful delivery of services, that allow information sharing across sectors.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.     The Project’s PDO was not revised. The Results Framework was revised first in a Level 2
restructuring dated June 26, 2012. Changes to the Results Framework and indicators under this
restructuring were introduced simply to improve specificity, measurability and relevance of the
indicators to the original PDO. The ICR team did not apply a disbursement weighted rating
methodology as required by Appendix B of the ICR Guidelines because: (a) the restructuring did
not involve a change in the PDO; and (b) no key associated outcome targets were raised or lowered.
A matrix presenting the Project’s original and revised Key Indicators, as well as the rationale for
the revisions is presented in Annex 10. Another Level 2 Project Restructuring dated October 30,
2013 introduced the following additional intermediate outcome indicator to reflect support to the
GoS’ reform on improving efficiency through centralized procurement of pharmaceuticals:
“Centralized procurement of pharmaceuticals initiated”, with an end of Project target of “Health
Insurance Fund awards framework agreements for at least 50 drugs from the B-list”. Details on
the Key Indicators and their status at Closing are presented in Annex 12.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) did not identify specifically the Project’s main
beneficiaries. Nevertheless, inferring from the description of the Project’s components, its main
beneficiaries included: users of the GoS’ primary health and social assistance services that would
benefit from more efficient delivery and higher quality services, persons with disabilities that
would benefit from more effective and responsive programs funded through a restructured
Disability Fund, and excluded groups (Roma, internally displaced persons, elderly, persons with
                                                 3 
                                                  
 
disabilities) that would benefit from more responsive services, through special programs to expand
quality social services coverage to ensure their access to these services. The Project would also
improve the capabilities of LSGs, CSWs, PHCs, schools, as well as state ministries (MOE, MOH
and MOLEVSP) to deliver more efficient, coordinated and responsive social services to their
populations through technical assistance to put into effect new procedures, strategies and
information systems and carry out evaluations of their efforts.

US$7.0 million; Bank financing, US$7.0 million). This component was to support investments
(goods, technical assistance and training) for line ministries and LSGs to develop and adopt
mechanisms for earmarking and allocating funds to investment programs at the local level, in
accordance with the 2006 Law on Local Self-Government Finance. Activities under this
component would: (a) develop new “funds-follow-the-user” formulae and financing framework
with the line ministries and the Commission for Local Self-Government Finance, and (b) provide
training and capacity building for sector actors at the State, local and service provider levels in
applying the new financial framework.
Component II: Improving Outreach and Access through Development and expansion of
Innovations in Service Delivery. (Total Costs, including contingencies, US$12.2 million; Bank
financing, US$12.2 million). This component was to support investments (goods, technical
assistance, training and grants) to: (a) increase incentives for local service providers (LSGs, PHCs,
schools, CSWs and NGO and community organizations) to develop outreach and inclusion
services to excluded groups (such as Roma, IDPs, and refugees) by awarding grants (channeled
through the responsible line ministries) to service providers that implement inclusion activities;
(b) reform the financing and delivery of services for disabled groups by assisting the MOLEVSP,
the CSWs and staff of LSGs responsible for these services to develop and implement a new model
of financing and delivering services, based on a system of competitive review of proposals and the
awarding of grants to the most promising projects, and implement structures to monitor the
performance and evaluate the impact of activities supported by the Fund; (c) build LSG capacity
to address the special needs of excluded vulnerable groups through activities that help them
identify and implement alternative service delivery arrangements, and (d) improve knowledge and
establish institutions to safeguard citizens’ rights.
Component III: Supporting a New, Regulatory, Oversight and Quality-Assurance Role for
State level Ministries. (Total Costs, including contingencies, US$7.4 million; Bank financing,
US$7.4 million). This component was to support investments (goods, technical assistance, training
and grants) to: (a) develop and support the training required for State level ministries to shift to a
regulatory, oversight and quality assurance role; (b) create mechanisms to foster and assure quality,
including the development of structures for accreditation, licensing and accountability to enable
the GoS to monitor service delivery and to ensure compliance with procedures and standards, as
well as accountability in management and service delivery; (c) define regulations and standards
for local service delivery, including the specification of the new roles and responsibilities of
municipal staff and service providers in the decentralized system; (d) support the implementation
of accreditation, licensing and regulatory standards, and awarding grants to local service providers
(PHCs, schools, municipal units responsible for social services and CSWs) to implement those
activities. This sub-component would also support minor civil works in PHCs to improve quality
of care; and (e) develop mechanisms and capacity of line ministries to ensure quality
                                                  4 
                                                   
 
improvements through piloting, monitoring, impact evaluation and performance analysis, to
ensure the effectiveness of specific project investments and to support evidence-based decision
making and accountability.
Component IV: Improving Capacity of LSGs and other Local Public Institutions as Service
Providers. (Total Costs, including contingencies, US$16.5 million; Bank financing, US$16.5
million). This component was to support investments in goods (information and communication
technology hardware and software and special technical services, technical assistance, training and
grants to schools, PHCs and municipal authorities) to: (a) support capacity building, tailored to
LSG and local providers’ needs, to build the minimum competencies for the delivery of services
being decentralized; (b) provide grants for quality improvement in schools, mainstreaming a grant
facility established by the GoS (with World Bank support under the Serbia Education Improvement
Project) that finances quality enhancement proposals in school development plans (SDPs) and for
minor civil works to renovate existing schools; (c) improve the use of information, statistics and
Information Communication Technology (ICT) equipment to provide better information needed
at all levels for policy making, planning, and budgeting of services, as well as for operating,
managing and monitoring the delivery of health, education and social protection services.
Component V: Project Implementation Support. (Total Costs, including contingencies,
US$3.2 million; Bank financing, US$3.2 million). This component was to support a Fiduciary
Services Unit (FSU), as well as implementation support for Project Administration Teams (PATs)
in the MOE, MOH and MOLEVSP, and the Bank Loan’s Front End Fee.

1.6 Revised Components

13.     The Level 2 June 26, 2012 Project Restructuring (Section 1.3) modified the Project
description to: (a) better align the Project’s structure with its implementation arrangements and
outcomes; (b) add the design and implementation of communications campaigns and of measures
to improve knowledge as activities and non-consultant services as a disbursement category under
Components 1, 2 and 3; (c) add people with disabilities to the excluded groups targeted by Grants
and (d) correct minor inaccuracies in references to governance and implementation arrangements.
The revision combined Components 3 and 4 since the GoS faced difficulties in planning and
reporting results by component, as most activities under these components were being carried out
jointly both by State ministries and LSGs and contributed to the same results. The merging of the
two components did not entail any changes to their content, resolved these ambiguities and better
aligned the project structure with implementation arrangements and outcomes. The October 30,
2013 Restructuring (Section 1.3) introduced a minor revision to the Project Description to reflect
changes to Sub-component (e) of Component 3 to include support to the reform on centralized
procurement of pharmaceuticals and efficiency improvements. The revisions after both of these
Level 2 Restructurings are presented in Annexes 11 and 12.

1.7 Other significant changes

14.     The June 26, 2012 Restructuring also provided for changes to the Project’s disbursement
schedule to facilitate the effective use of loan proceeds. Given the uncertainty surrounding the
final composition of activities and their prices, the effective use of loan proceeds would have
eventually required frequent reallocations. The changes included the closure of three of six original
disbursement categories (1 to 3), and the reallocation of remaining funds into a single, new
Category 7 that comprised “Goods, Consultants’ Services, including the preparation of the audit
under Part 4 of the Project, Non-Consultants Services, Grants (other than Grants for Civil Works
                                                 5 
                                                  
 
under Part 3(f) of the Project, Training and Operating Expenses”. A Level 2 Restructuring on
November 30, 2012 extended the Closing Date by one year to December 31, 2013. The October
30, 2013 Restructuring extended the Closing Date by an additional nine months to September 30,
2014 (for activities implemented by the MOH only). A last Level 2 Restructuring dated August 7,
2014 extended the Closing Date by an additional six months to March 31, 2015, representing a
cumulative extension of 27 months. This final extension was approved to allow the GoS time to
cover remaining health activities, utilizing uncommitted loan funds to cover priorities emerging
from damages that resulted from severe flooding in May 2014 (Section 2.2).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

15.     Project Preparation. The Project was prepared in slightly less than two years from concept
discussion through approval by the World Bank’s Board. The World Bank’s preparation team was
large, and included specialists from each of the three sectors in addition to others. Key lessons
were identified in the PAD, but it is not clear that these were adequately addressed in the Project’s
design. The team arranged a Roundtable with the Government, including representatives from the
Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development
(MOESTD), the MOH, the MOLEVSP and the Standing Committee of Towns and Municipalities
(SCTM). This group, further strengthened by representatives of the Ministry of Public
Administration and Local Self Government, met consistently and worked closely with the World
Bank on preparation. This team presented and discussed the Project’s concept and proposed
activities with relevant stakeholders, and SCTM routinely provided their feedback to GoS
ministries and the World Bank team. The PAD identified four risks—complex institutional
arrangements, lack of implementation capacity, a possible politically controversial rationalization
process and uncoordinated donor activity. While appropriate, these were not detailed as justified
by a complex operation, and did not envisage mitigation measures.

16.      Political and Economic Environment. The Project was approved in the midst of challenging
internal political developments, and in the midst of the 2008-2009 global economic and financial
crisis. In January 2008, Serbia had held first round presidential elections, and in February a
candidate from the pro-European Union Democratic Party was elected with a majority. Two weeks
after the election, Kosovo declared independence leading to the dissolution of Parliament and the
scheduling of new parliamentary elections for May 2008. The EU Democratic Party scored a
significant victory but fell short of an outright majority. The formation of the government by a
complex coalition comprised of 13 political parties created an environment that was not
particularly favorable for project implementation, especially in cases where it was necessary to
reach agreement among government institutions headed by officials representing different
coalition partners with divergent philosophies.

17.     Project Design. At the time of preparation, fewer lending instruments were available for
consideration. While some of the objectives related to social service delivery were supported by
the Public Expenditure DPL II, the GoS opted for an Investment Landing project. Still, the
Project’s design was undoubtedly ambitious and complex, envisaging implementation of activities
in three sectors, and through multiple layers of government in addition to by individual schools,
PHCs, CSWs, and NGOs and other civil society organizations and associations. Activities would
be implemented within a framework of coordination at the national level and eventually
coordination at the level of individual LSGs to facilitate an integrated service delivery. In several
                                                 6 
                                                  
 
areas, progress in activities at the national level was needed to make progress at the local,
municipal level, or at the level of individual schools or PHCs. Further, the Project envisaged the
development and implementation of information systems—notoriously complex in terms of
procurement and implementation--in three sectors and multiple levels of government. There were
structural design issues in that a few large activities that were to take place over implementation
were dependent on policy reforms. About one third of loan proceeds were to be devoted to
technical assistance—very supervision intensive and slow disbursing—that were required to
design, put in place and implement the activities that followed, such as information systems
development and implementation (that represented over 40 percent of loan funding), and grant
programs. While there is undoubtedly value in supporting this type of technical assistance
activities, especially for promoting coordination and building cohesion, initial delays in these
activities led to initial implementation delays across the board. Lastly, original Project design
(components and sub-components) did not provide sufficient clarity about how the Project
activities were to contribute to the achievement of improved efficiency, access, equity and quality
in the delivery of basic services in a decentralized context in the three participating sectors (Section
2.3), an appropriate Results Framework and system for monitoring and evaluation was not in place
(Section 2.3) and there were issues with the structure and design of the Project’s components,
namely overlap between the activities in Components 3 and 4, and in the specification of the loan’s
disbursement categories that made reporting and disbursements difficult (Sections 1.6 and 1.7).

2.2 Implementation

18.    The World Bank’s Board approved the Euro 32.0 million loan for the DILS Project on
March 18, 2008. The Loan Agreement was signed on April 11, 2008 and declared effective on
March 10, 2009. An official Project Launch was held in October, 2009 opened by two Ministers
(Health and Education), the President of the SCTM, and the WB’s Country Manager.
Implementation Progress as reported in Implementation Status Reports was downgraded to
Moderately Satisfactory in December 2009, further downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory in
June 2013 and upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory four months later as it remained through
completion. Its Development Objectives rating was downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory in July
2012 and remained Moderately Satisfactory throughout completion. Several factors affected its
implementation, as described below. The final allocation of sector and theme codes (Basic Data
Sheet) was adjusted to reflect an estimate of sectors and themes upon completion.

19.     Status of Preparation. As described in Section 2.1, several actions required for early
implementation were not in place when the loan for the Project was approved. The administrators
for the Fiduciary Services Unit (FSU) and the Project Administration Teams (PATs) in each of the
three ministries were only being hired in mid-2009, the Designated Account was being opened at
the same time, and the institutional mechanisms for requesting grant proposals, including a revised
grant manual, were only then being finalized. These led to delays in implementation of technical
assistance activities needed to procure information technology equipment, and provision of grants
under various lines. In part these delays were the result of the changes in the political environment
(Section 2.1) that caused delays in loan effectiveness and early implementation, but they also
reflected project readiness at approval.

20.     Focus on Disbursements. By June 2010, more than two years after approval, only Euro
1.6 million had been disbursed of the Euro 32.0 million loan. Implementation support missions
began to focus on accelerating implementation to increase disbursements by identifying the five
largest activities in each sector and agreeing upon a plan to implement those activities faster. These
                                                   7 
                                                    
 
included the procurement of information technology hardware in health, vehicles for schools and
the beginning of implementation grants in each of the sectors.

21.     Mid-Term Review and Project Restructuring. The Mid-Term Review (MTR) was held on
October 10-21, 2011, and included a two-day intensive workshop to: (a) share progress achieved
in each of the three participating sectors; (b) discuss how to adjust outcome and output indicators
to better reflect the achievement towards the PDO; and (c) exchange views on how to reorganize
the presentation of the Project’s key activities in Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement to ensure a
better alignment of the Project Description with the PDOs. Agreements reached during the MTR
resulted in the Level II Project Restructuring described in Sections 1.6 and 1.7.

22.     Political Transitions. Several political transitions occurred throughout implementation,
along with other changes in leadership of the State ministries. Throughout there were six
governments, involving four ministers of health, three ministers of education, two ministers of
labor and social protection. Changes at the ministerial level invariably led to changes at the level
of the PATs in each of the three ministries, as well as in the Coordinator and other staff of the FSU
(in 2012), resulted in the need for additional time the new teams to become familiar with the
Project’s activities in their respective sector, and often involved revisions to ministries’ internal
operating procedures and procurement plans. For example, in 2012, by Ministerial Decision, the
MOH established a DILS Project Steering Committee (composed of seven Assistant Ministers)
that had to approve every project activity in detail.

23.     Government Commitment. Government commitment affected the Project in three ways.
First, commitment to the Project’s activities was generally maintained through the PATs in each
of the ministries, but those activities that depended upon the passage of legislation or policy
reorientation were affected by the frequent changes at the ministerial level and a lack of momentum
and commitment to objectives (e.g., the introduction of capitation in education). Second, the
Project’s design had envisaged the establishment of a Project Policy Board (PPB) composed of all
the stakeholder ministries (MOE, MOH and MOLEVSP), MPALSG, MOF and one representative
of LSGs, that would meet regularly, and that would be responsible for project progress, act as a
forum to coordinate activities (particularly those of a cross-ministerial nature), resolve disputes
and make decisions on necessary adjustments, should the need arise. Throughout, the PPB met
only three times, and did not function as contemplated. The MPALSG’s involvement was limited,
with the consequence that the Project was implemented as three separate projects at the national
level with inter-sectoral cooperation provided on an ad-hoc basis and mostly at the level of the
LSGs and other local agencies. Finally, the GoS’s broad commitment to its stated goals in
individual sectors was generally strong but intermittent. This was reflected in the passage of
legislation in key areas either supported by or affecting the Project, which either provided the legal
basis to move forward or led to implementation and design issues, and also in the establishment of
committees and commissions that had new responsibilities over activities financed by the Project.
The Law on the Foundations of the Education System was passed in 2009, creating the key legal
pre-conditions for the DILS implementation, e.g., mandating the change in the allocation
mechanism of funding to schools from input to per capita financing (but later, commitment to its
implementation wavered). The new Social Assistance Law was eventually adopted by parliament
in March 2011. However, it had been expected earlier with the effect that the design of the
management information system for social protection had to move ahead in advance of and then
later in parallel with the passage of the law, and as a result the system has to be retrofitted to
incorporate elements introduced. Similarly, the establishment of the Commission for the Integrated
Health Information System in early 2013 affected the implementation of this activity when the
                                                  8 
                                                   
 
Commission suspended activities related to the system’s development, although this has now been
resolved. The adoption of a new Law on Public Procurement in late 2012 did not affect
procurement procedures, per se, but did affect the processes of procurement planning in the
ministries (procurement plans became integral parts of ministries’ procurement and financial
plans, reducing flexibility).

24.     Integrated Assistance. The Project was implemented within a framework of assistance for
each of the sectors that included investment and policy lending, and technical assistance. These
included the Serbia Health Project (and Additional Financing) that closed on March 31, 2012, a
Programmatic Public Expenditure Development Policy Program (PEDPL), and a Second Serbia
Health Project approved in February 2014. At the policy level, the PEDPL series (planned as three
operations but only two went forward), aimed at, inter alia, reducing the size of the large public
sector, and increasing the efficiency of expenditures in health and education spending (in part
through introducing a productivity factor into the calculation of the wages of primary health
professionals and per-pupil financing in education), while mitigating the social impact of the crisis
and expanding coverage of social assistance programs (in part by supporting a adjustments to
social assistance benefits through amendment of the Social Welfare Law in 2011). As a result, the
Project both provided more focused technical assistance to policies included in the PEDPL, and
benefited from the policies that the PEDPL supported, especially in health. Likewise, in health,
the Project gave continuity to reforms initiated under the Serbia Health Project Additional
Financing, by providing a “bridge” for continued implementation of ongoing activities under the
follow-on project that is now, in turn, providing continuity and further reforms in support of the
DILS Project’s objectives. In education, an Education Sector Technical Assistance (2012)
complemented the Project’s activities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

25.    Design. Monitoring and evaluation was to be carried out by ministries and LSGs through
regular data collection instruments such as household surveys, and existing administrative
monitoring systems, such as the education information system, the health information management
system, etc. Progress would be monitored according to the PAD’s outcome and intermediate
outcome indicators. Design also included funding for carrying out impact evaluations of the phased
implementation of decentralization (particularly the roll-out of new financing formulae and
assumption of responsibilities for management of schools and PHCs), and of innovations in service
delivery to vulnerable groups, particularly to disabled people.

26.      There were several issues with the design of the Project’s Results Framework (RF) that in
part paralleled the issues with the Project’s design (Section 2.1). Specifically, for outcome
indicators: (a) all lacked baseline and target values; (b) several referred to intermediate outcomes
(i.e., outputs) rather than outcomes or were difficult to measure; (c) some referred to two or three
sectors (e.g., education, health, social protection), and there was insufficient clarity regarding
which sector had responsibility to report on a particular indicator and how the achievement of the
indicator would be measured; (d) several were not fully aligned with the PDO (e.g., those relating
to Roma inclusion, while inclusion was not an objective) and (e) there were inconsistencies in the
wording of several between the PAD and Supplemental Letter No. 2 to the Loan Agreement.
Shortcomings with the original intermediate outcome indicators were similar to those of PDO
indicators and some corresponded only loosely with PDO indicators.


                                                 9 
                                                  
 
27.     Implementation and Utilization. At the MTR it became clear that the RF required
amendment. Agreements during the MTR led to a revision to the RF in the June 2012 restructuring
(Section 1.3). The restructuring rectified shortcomings in the RF, and clarified processes and
responsibilities for data collection and reporting. It assigned indicators to each ministry, formally
defined baseline and target values for outcome indicators and revised them to provide a more
adequate measurement framework for the efficiency, access/equity and quality of the delivery of
health, education and social protection services at the local level, and revised the intermediate
output indicators. A summary of the changes to the RF, together with a justification for the
revision to indicators is provided in Annex 10. Monitoring of project outcomes and intermediate
outcomes were since carried out by sector, by the responsible State ministry, on the basis of their
own systems and of information submitted by the LSGs. The RF was further revised in the October
2013 restructuring (Section 1.3 and Annex 11). Consultants carried out two evaluations, of the
Trainings and Grant Programs for Inclusive Education and of the PHC grants. The findings of
these evaluations are incorporated in this ICR, and described in Annex 2.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

28.     Safeguards. The Project triggered the Environmental Assessment (OP/BP4.01) and
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP4.11) safeguards, and was classified as an environmental
category B. As some of the grant sub-projects would support building rehabilitation works and the
location of these works was not known during preparation, an Environmental Management
Framework (EMF) was prepared. The EMF required preparation of environmental management
plans to address risks associated with air quality, noise, water quality, solid waste disposal,
asbestos, toxic and hazardous wastes and medical wastes, in addition to risks to cultural heritage.
The implementation support team included routinely a Safeguard Specialist to review compliance,
and capacity and institutional arrangements, and generally found these satisfactory. At the team’s
recommendation, a qualified safeguards specialist was hired to advise the MOE and MOH, as well
as grant sub-project implementing agencies on the environmental screening process and
assignment of sub-project environmental categories. Although no major issues surfaced with
safeguard compliance, the, preparation of a final Environmental Compliance Report by the MOE
(on grant sub-projects) was substantially delayed, and submitted long after the MOE’s activities
had been concluded in December 2013. The MOE’s Environmental Specialist was no longer
available to provide the individual site supervision reports that had been prepared, with the
consequence that this report was not fully documented, and did not reflect the standard of good
practice in supervising civil works under the Project.

29.     Financial Management and Procurement. The Project’s financial management and
procurement functions were centralized in the FSU, supported by the three PATs in MOE, MOH
and MOLEVSP that would provide technical inputs. The FSU was to consolidate procurement
plans, project accounts and disbursements, the project audit, and forward the require
documentation to the World Bank. Both financial management and procurement were supervised
routinely, with detailed assessments carried out during the MTR, which found that fiduciary
responsibilities were being carried out satisfactorily by the FSU with inputs from the PATs.
Quarterly financial reports (IFRs) were submitted to the Bank within due dates and assessed to be
reliable. Transactions review and walk-through test of internal controls were conducted and no
irregularities identified in the process. Audit reports were received in a timely fashion and auditors
issued clean opinion on project financial statements.


                                                 10 
                                                   
 
30.     Several issues stand out with respect to financial management (staffing, budgeting,
accounting, internal controls, funds flow, financial reporting and external auditing) and
disbursements. Towards the end of implementation of its activities, the MOE had accumulated
large payment arrears that had been pending for well over two years, primarily due to weak
oversight by the MOESTD. For example, there were disagreements about the quality of the
deliverables, apprehension to make payments for services rendered under previous
administrations, and lost institutional memory due to frequent MOESTD staff turnover. In
addition, disbursement estimates were revised formally on several occasions to reflect delays in
effectiveness and implementation, and especially the Project’s structure and readiness that required
completion of several technical assistance and design activities for disbursements against large
value activities (IT equipment, grants) to begin (Section 2.1).

31.      Procurement was on occasion rated Moderately Satisfactory in ISRs due mostly to two
issues: (a) delays in implementation of large activities, (b) the complexity and time required for
procurement of IT hardware and systems, and (c) frequent communication problems between the
FSU and the PATs, which prevented the efficient updating of the procurement plans. IT systems
procurement presented challenges, as follows: (a) for MOLEVSP one large contract was
envisaged, but this was eventually broken into two contracts; and (b) for MOH, the most
advantageous bid had to be rejected because on member of the consortium with the lowest bid was
a state company. The World Bank implementation support team recommended repeatedly that the
FSU update the procurement plan more frequently, with inputs on changes in dates and activities
from each PAT as soon as these took place, to take advantage of the procurement plan as a tool for
managing, planning, and monitoring project implementation activities.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

32.     There is no follow-on operation, per se. Additional support for health reform is being
provided under the ongoing Second Serbia Health Project, approved in early 2014, that will
continue to improve the efficiency and quality of the public health system through strengthening
of health financing, purchasing, and maintenance systems and quality improvement systems and
management of selected priority non-communicable diseases. It will provide continuity to
important mechanisms initiated under the Project, including, improvements to further primary
health care financing, to further instruments for quality improvement systems. The EU is financing
hardware for the MOE’s information system. As of now, the remaining activities, including
operations and maintenance, have been absorbed within the responsibilities of the relevant State
ministries, and of now strengthened LSGs in accordance with the Law on Local Self Government
Finance.

33.     The Government of Serbia and the World Bank have identified skills development and
inclusion of vulnerable groups as strategic priorities for the country. A discussion between the
World Bank and the Government of Serbia has been launched in recent months on a proposed
Early Childhood Development (ECD) Project. Such a project would aim at benefitting particularly
children from poor and minority backgrounds and providing them with a critically needed head-
start in terms of educational inclusion and skills acquisition. The project would support quality
early learning in connection with other ECD measures for different age-groups: pre-school
children (3 – 5.5 years); younger children (0 – 3 years) and their families, but also strengthen the
transition into primary education (age 5.5/6.5 plus) with a focus on inclusive education and
learning. Other aspects of the project would include expansion of access to ECD, especially for


                                                11 
                                                  
 
children from lower socio-economic and vulnerable backgrounds, revision of ECD financing and
more efficient use of the ECD and primary school network.

34.     The World Bank has recently completed a Western Balkans Investment Fund (WBIF)
Inclusive Education Technical Assistance in Serbia. Within this context the WBIF was used for
financing analytical work to provide a stock-taking of the use of already established measures of
inclusive education, the development of a roadmap institutionalization the Monitoring Framework
for Inclusive Education in Serbia and the training concept for monitoring and evaluation of
Inclusive Education. This work also supported capacity building activities that include training,
learning and exchange of experience on Impact Evaluations. Regional consultations and a national
event on Monitoring and Evaluation of Inclusive Education were further activities that were also
used for dissemination of results.

35.     A Jobs and Competitiveness Project was recently approved by the Board (September 2015)
and aims to improve effectiveness and coordination of selected public programs to alleviate
constraints to competitiveness and jobs. The project consist of four components, one of which
related to labor. Labor-related component aims at: (a) Improving the effectiveness of labor
intermediation services and active labor market programs; and (b) Facilitate social assistance
beneficiaries’ transitioning into formal jobs.

36.     At the Government’s request the World Bank is currently conducting a functional review
of service delivery in the three sectors (health, education, social protection and labor). For the
health and education sectors, the functional review consists of an assessment of service delivery
mechanisms, efficiency and rightsizing and is focused on primary and secondary health care
workforce and pre-university education and of the school network and teaching force, respectively.
For social protection, the purpose of pension portion of the functional review is to improve service
delivery by the Pension and Disability Fund of Serbia through improved business processes and
secondarily and over the long-term, to improve overall Pension and Disability Fund staffing
efficiency. The social assistance segment of the functional review aims at improving service
delivery by consolidating program design and oversight and better integrating social assistance
and social insurance. Lastly, the review covers the labor part with a view to improve service
delivery of the National Employment Service.

37.    At the Government’s request, the World Bank is also undertaking analysis of
pharmaceutical policies in the health sector with a particular focus on increasing efficiency of
procurement of drugs and medical devices.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance is rated Substantial.

38.      Relevance of Objectives. The Project’s objective was relevant at the time it was approved,
and continues to be relevant. Hence, relevance of objectives is Substantial. The Project’s objective
is all the more relevant following the 2008 global economic and financial crisis, which resulted in
a real decline of 3.5 percent in Serbia’s GDP 2009, requiring determined fiscal adjustment and
reversing previous impressive declines in poverty starting in the early 2000s. Poverty had fallen
from 13.4 percent in 2002 to 6.1 percent in 2008, but rebounded to 6.9 percent in 2009 and further
                                                12 
                                                  
 
to 9.2 percent in 2010, according to the Household Budget Survey, placing substantial stress on
Serbia’s social protection system and exacerbating long standing challenges for its most vulnerable
populations. Despite improvements, Serbia still faces challenges in educating its citizens,
especially when compared to its neighbors. Not enough of its young people are enrolling in school,
and too many drop out before finishing. There are also issues of access to education for more
vulnerable populations. Health outcomes have improved and more services are delivered at lower
cost. Still, an aging population, the introduction of new, expensive pharmaceuticals and the
development of new technologies are exacerbating the fiscal pressures. The increase in
unemployment and poverty has reduced the HIF’s revenue base and increased the pool of
vulnerable groups who must be subsidized from the general budget. As a result, the GoS is seeking
ways of using resources more efficiently. The Project’s objective is fully consistent with the second
pillar of the Bank’s FY12-15 Country Partnership Strategy for the Republic of Serbia: Improved
Efficiency and Outcomes in Social Spending, and with the respective CPS Outcome (Strengthened
fiscal performance with sustained improvement in human development outcomes through more
efficient, effective social spending).

39.     Relevance of Design and Implementation. While supporting priority activities in three
sectors, the Project’s design was relevant when prepared, but lost relevance at the beginning of the
implementation period. It was designed as an integrated, cross-sectoral operation that was to be
implemented with strong coordination at the State level that promoted the same cross-sectoral
coordination at the level of LSGs. The Project Policy Board was not functional, and the
MPALSG’s involvement in implementation was minimal. Realigning its components and RF to
this reality during implementation, and continuing to support, on a sector-by-sector basis, priority
activities that would individually contribute to its objectives, with coordination only at the level of
LSG, have to a certain extent brought its relevance back during implementation. Relevance of
design and implementation are rated modest and substantial, respectively.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

40.    Achievement of Project Development Objectives is rated Substantial. The Project was
implemented in an environment of varying degrees of decentralization of service delivery within
each of the sectors, and widely varying LSG capacity to manage these increased responsibilities
(Section 1.1). Nevertheless, the Project made substantial progress towards the achievement of its
PDO, as measured by its Key Outcome Indicators, although progress varied by sector, as described
below by sub-objective, i.e., efficiency, equity and quality of local service delivery; outputs
financed that led to their achievement are presented in Annex 2.

Improve the efficiency of local delivery of health, education and social protection services
41.     Progress towards this sub-objective is rated substantial. The Project had a decisive impact
on improving the efficiency of local delivery of health services, but was less successful in
establishing the per capita financing mechanism in education as originally envisaged. By
reforming the allocation of funding under the Disability Fund, it also had an impact on social
protection (paragraph 46). The greatest impact was on the financing of primary health care, which
is now the only sector in Serbia financed on basis of performance, i.e., productivity based pay. The
capitation formula developed by the MOH and the National Health Insurance Fund under the EU-
funded Support for the Implementation of Capitation in Primary Health Care in Serbia came into
force in October 2012 with the approval of the Law on Salaries of Public Servants and
corresponding by-laws defining performance payments in primary health. The Project provided

                                                  13 
                                                    
 
training for all employees in all LSGs and PHCs participating in the Project (500) and also others
that were not participating to familiarize the participants with the capitation formula, and highlight
the possibility that the formula offers in terms of improving the operation and efficiency of PHCs
so that the switch to the new system could proceed smoothly. When introduced, the capitation
formula allocated two percent of the salaries of primary health care providers based on
performance; this proportion has been increased gradually to eight percent in 2015. Several other
activities contributed to increase the efficiency of primary health care service delivery, including:
(a) the presentation to staff of 27 PHCs of the step-down method for analyzing the costs and
activities in PHCs, to improve administration and spending efficiency; (b) an analysis of PHC
financing at the LSG level, including 33 municipalities that participated under the Project,
including a review of local legislation, aimed at improving the allocation framework for
equalization funds; (c) assessing the energy efficiency of 33 PHC buildings, in order to improve
the structures to become more efficient; (d) support to the HIF to build capacity for the introduction
of diagnosis related groups; (e) the analysis of the activities and financing of National Reference
Laboratories (NRL), their equipment and staffing, with a view to improve their services and
efficiency; and (f) capacity building for staff of PHCs on EU health policy and preparation of
project proposals for EU financing.

42.    Outcomes aimed at increasing the efficiency of education financing were developed, but
not implemented. The Project aimed to develop and pilot central and local formulae that would
finance pre-school and primary education on a per-pupil basis providing an incentive for LSGs
and schools to find an optimal allocation to class sizes and the type and number of facilities needed
to meet service needs. Progress was made on developing the central formula, and more limited
progress on the development of local formulae. An external assessment confirmed that local
formulae might not be necessary given Serbia’s geographic size and resource allocation modalities.
Nevertheless, the GoS is considering the piloting and implementation of the central per-pupil
funding as part of its broader efforts to “right size” government expenditures.

Improve access and equity of local delivery of health, education and social protection services
43.     Progress towards this sub-objective is rated substantial. The Project had a significant
impact in improving access and equity of local delivery of health, education and social protection
services. In health, the Project implemented an effective program of recruiting and financing of
Roma health mediators to work in PHCs, and training of 75 mediators on public health and
communication skills, hygiene and prevention of communicable diseases, vaccination, health
lifestyles, etc., that reached a total of 50,754 children, 46,453 women and 43,201 men (total
140,408). This program resulted in the vaccination of 30,018 children, and in providing for Roma:
(a) 2,340 personal documents and health cards; (b) medical examinations to 650 pregnant women
and new mothers; (c) 1,496 screening examinations to women; (d) 1,144 mammograms; (e) 11,371
women selecting their gynecologists; (f) 2,998 Roma selecting their primary care providers; (g)
health education work for 3,529 persons; (h) 58,961 visits provided and (i) 260 children enrolled
in school. Grants aimed at increasing access to healthcare for vulnerable population groups (Annex
2) were equally effective reaching 44,250 persons, including persons over 65, youth, persons with
disabilities and Roma. Unofficial feedback highlights an increase in the number of newly
diagnosed cardiovascular diseases, elevated blood sugar, elevated triglycerides and cholesterol,
and addition to other non-communicable diseases, which should lead to improved health outcomes.
Palliative care provided to the elderly undoubtedly improved the quality of life of the terminally
ill and of those that depend on care and assistance. Single elderly were provided with access to
nurses, in cooperation with CSWs, or with volunteers from NGOs. Specialist referrals,

                                                 14 
                                                   
 
transportation, guidance on obtaining health insurance where warranted, were additional outputs
that should improve health outcomes of vulnerable groups. The Project trained 2,000 health
professionals on the needs of vulnerable groups in 42 PHCs.

44.     The MOE was equally effective in improving access and equity in pre-school and primary
education, through sub-projects awarded under two grant programs: Strengthening Schools for
Inclusive Education and Education Inclusion of Roma. The inclusive education program, intended
to improve the quality of education for disadvantaged populations (violence at schools, Roma,
students with special needs, rural schools and students requiring motivation). Details on these
grants, criteria for their award and implementation arrangements are provided in Annex 2. In
addition, four thematic trainings were directed at inclusive teams in 313 schools (Annex 2). The
External Evaluation concluded that “Based on the results and opinions of the different
stakeholders, it can be concluded that the DILS school grants program has achieved its goal. The
results of the evaluation revealed that schools that benefited from grants achieved “remarkable
progress” in relation to the control group. As a result, the share of children from vulnerable groups
in project schools increased from 3.2 percent (presumably in 2009, according to the restructuring
paper from June 2012) to 6.6 percent when the education activities closed in December 2013. The
2010/11 data indicate that the share of children from vulnerable groups in project schools reached
a high of 8.44 percent before the decline, which reflects the precariousness of this indicator. It
should also be noted that project schools had nearly 60 percent more students from vulnerable
groups than non-project schools (4.11 percent). With respect to training, the evaluation found that
the greatest effect or range of impact was attributed to the module on strategies and methods of
adapting instruction for children with disabilities and gifted children, especially in increasing the
sensitivity of teachers of students from vulnerable groups.

45.    Sub-project grants awarded under the Education Inclusion of Roma program aimed to
contribute to the creation and implementation of the Roma integration policy at the municipal
level. Details on these grants, criteria for their award and implementation arrangements are
provided in Annex 2. The External Evaluation found that this program was equally successful, and
met its goals by contributing to better cooperation of different agencies at the local level in
providing services and support to children from deprived groups, uniting various stakeholders, and
enabling cooperation. The Evaluation’s found that stakeholders reported significantly reduced
absenteeism and increased school achievements of students from deprived communities, although
drop-out rates and primary education coverage continue to warrant attention.

46.     For Social Protection, MOLEVSP satisfactorily adjusted the Disability Fund’s financing
modality to one where project funding for addressing the needs of persons with disabilities are
allocated under a competitive mechanism based on the quality and relevance of the proposals
submitted, thereby producing the greatest results for its target population. Based on an iterative
four stage process of developing a Grant Operations Manual, awarding sub-project grants, revising
the Manual to incorporate implementation lessons, awarding another round of grants, etc., a final
Grant Manual incorporates improved formats for applying for grants and templates for reporting
on expenditures and activities implemented, and improved scales for assessing project proposals,
which are transparent and public. The Manual includes clearly defined modalities of project
financing, conditions, criteria and procedures for awarding grants, for monitoring funds usage, etc.
The Disability Fund awarded 92 sub-project grants to NGOs, eight of which were implemented in
partnership with local stakeholders (Annex 2).

Improve quality of local delivery of health, education and social protection services
47.    Progress towards this sub-objective is rated substantial The Project also had an influential
impact on improving the quality of local delivery of health, education and social protection
services. In health, the Project financed activities at the State level, as well as activities with LSGs
and project PHCs, especially, three types of sub-project grants aimed at helping the PHCs
accomplish the Project’s objectives: (a) PHC Accreditation Grants; (b) Quality Improvements
through Investment Grants; and (c) Grants for Introducing Information System Software.

48.      A total of 51 percent of Serbia’s PHCs have completed the quality accreditation process,
and 39.62 percent of all PHCs have received at least a 3-year certification. PHC Accreditation
Grants (Annex 2) were awarded to the 42 PHCs participating in the Project, and an additional 20
PHCs based on a request by the MOH. Accreditation standards for PHCs with the process defined
in scope, form and duration by the Agency for Accreditation of Health Care Institutions in Serbia,
include: (a) standards for patient care in general practice, gynecology, pediatrics, specialist-
consultative services and home care; (b) standards of clinical support: pharmaceutical services,
laboratory diagnostics and diagnostic radiology; and (c) non-clinical standards for the
environment, human resources, information management, governance and management. The
External Evaluation confirms that 83 PHCs, in three cycles, implemented the accreditation process,
as well as the Institute for the Health Care of students in Belgrade. An additional 33 institutions
have begun the process (but without grant funding). The MOH remarked that accreditation has
produced the following benefits: “the development of multidisciplinary teams, review of the
institutions’ operational policies, improving data systems, generating local and national prestige,
and improved networking between primary health centers in exchange of good practices.” The
Evaluation found that PHC institutions recognize accreditation as one of the most important
external mechanisms for improving the quality of health care.

49.      Quality improvements through investment grants (Annex 2) were supported for 43 PHCs
participating in the Project to support local cooperation between healthcare institutions and LSGs,
and to serve the practical integration of all activities in the field of quality improvement that were
implemented at the local level, ranging from strategic planning, through recommendations made
in the process of accreditation to the development of an integrated quality improvement plan and
its implementation. The MOH has found that for the majority of the PHCs this was an opportunity
to understand how investments can be used for quality improvements, as they were able to analyze
their needs, prioritize, and compete for funding, explaining the rationale with evidence to support
their investment proposals. The External Evaluation reports that PHCs in general found that the
investments the grants supported improved the quality and efficiency with which services are
delivered, increased the interest of the respective LSGs in healthcare issues, and enhanced public
trust in the system. All have gained competence in how to prioritize investments within constrained
resources, how to prepare investment proposals and how to monitor and evaluate progress.

50.     Finally, grants for introducing software were provided to all (158) PHCs, as well as to 3
health institutions for healthcare of students and the Republican Gerontology Institute (Annex 2).
At project completion, 95.7 percent of Serbia’s PHCs had a fully operational health management
information system platform. The External Evaluation highlights several positive benefits and
impacts of these grants that are described in Annex 2.

51.   Further, the Project achieved the target of 50 percent of PHCs having adopted clinical
pathways. Under the Project, a team of regional coordinators was established and trained, seminars

                                                  16 
                                                    
 
with top management of hospitals and PHCs, clinical pathway coordinators from healthcare
institutions and the MOH conducted, and: (a) developed methodologies for developing clinical
pathways according to the guidelines of the European Pathway Association; (b) carried out a pilot
project in 50 PHCs with the specific aim of developing methodology of development and
implementation of six clinical pathways in 18 hospitals and 8 clinical pathways in 44 PHCs, and
(c) created the condition for adoption of relevant legislation.

52.     In education, the Project also achieved impressive results. One hundred schools
participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012, and in the Trends
in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2011. The Project provided consultant
services for: (a) enhancement of education policy planning and coordination; (b) developing
training packages and manuals, and training to ensure compliance with the international agreed
target population definitions and sampling procedures and effective administration and
management of the assessments; (c) preparation activities for participation in the PISA 2012 and
TIMSS 2011, and (d) reporting on results from participation in PISA 2009. The Project also
provided technical assistance and training for the implementation of standards for the end of
compulsory education (8th grade) and related capacity building. While it is difficult to link project
investments with quality improvement outcomes in education, the student assessment structure
was greatly enhanced. PISA is conducted every three years and Serbia participated in PISA 2015,
which will allow for longitudinal comparison of learning outcomes of 15 year-olds.

53.      In Social Protection, the centralized management information system for social protection
institutions has been developed, equipped with infrastructure and software in all 265 CSWs, and
600 staff in all of the CSWs have been trained in its use. However, due to delays in its development
and implementation, in part due to delays in approval of the Social Assistance Law, and later in
the need to adjust the system to new requirements introduced in the approved law, the system is
not yet operational. The Ministry is currently working on the revision of the Law on social
protection that would be adopted soon. Once the Law is adopted the Ministry will work on software
modules revision to reflect the changes in the Law. After modules are prepared, revisions to the
MIS system will be operationalized. The system provides a single database that will contain the
records of all approximately 700,000 social protection beneficiaries, with linkages between 256
CSWs and the MOLEVSP. It is expected that when operational, the system will reduce the
processing time between the entries of a case to its resolution from 60 to 30 days. The system’s
modules include: (a) basic records in the CSW, providing for their more efficient operation; (b)
management of basic records, providing for case management and record keeping; (c) financial
benefits, providing for more efficient processing of social assistance and benefits; (d) custody,
providing for more efficient processing of custody cases for children and adults; (e) adoption,
providing for efficient evaluation and processing of adoption cases, both for children and
prospective parents; (f) exercise of parental rights, providing for more efficient monitoring and
supervision over the exercise of parental rights; and (g) participation in court proceedings,
providing for more efficient participation and monitoring.

3.3 Efficiency

54.     Efficiency is rated Modest. The PAD did not provide a full economic analysis, but
provided a review of the expected impacts on service delivery, fiscal sustainability using evidence
from literature. Although the Project generated a number of direct and indirect multiplier impacts,
due to data limitations the benefits could not be quantified and hence a traditional economic
analysis has not been attempted. The Project contributed to improving overall efficiency in the
                                                 17 
                                                   
 
use of resources in health, education and social protection through implementation of a number of
activities. For health, these include: (a) introduction of per capita financing of primary health care;
(b) strengthening of primary health care and the capacity of LSGs to deliver it, through capacity
building, efforts to reach out to unattended groups, clinical pathways among others, which should
reduce higher cost services such as specialist referrals, hospital admissions, and diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures; (c) health management information system that will lead to better
coordination, record-keeping, and as a result, lower cost and more quality driven care; and (d)
consequently, a better health status of the population, with the benefits that brings to society. For
education, these include: (a) efforts to improve access and equity, inter alia, through addressing
the needs of vulnerable children, inclusive education, in a cost effective manner, and (b) studies
on international student assessment that should, in the longer term, lead to improvements in quality
and cost effectiveness of interventions. In social protection, these include: (a) a new, more
effective, model for allocating resources for PWD, that will ensure that projects and programs
financed are efficient and effective in meeting the needs of the groups for which they were
intended; and (b) a management information system that will centralize data, reduce transaction
processing times, and ensure a better link between beneficiaries of cash benefits and relevant social
services offered by other social protection institutions. Even though the Project has greatly
contributed towards setting the foundation for improved efficiency in all three sectors, the
following next steps could have led to greater improvement in that regard: in health: obsolete Law
on Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) still prevents the sole use of EMRs, thus leading to
duplication in medical record keeping (electronic and paper-based); in education: although studies
on international student assessment have been completed, measures towards improvement of
quality and cost-effectiveness are yet to be launched; in social protection: the management
information system has been installed and piloted, but is yet to be fully operational nationwide.

55.      Despite problems with its original design, when restructured, the Project was well
implemented by PATs in each of the MOE, MOH and MOLEVSP, supported by a FSU that
supported all three. This was especially noteworthy when considering that the Project also
supported all 158 PHCs, 559 preschools and primary schools, 14,000 teachers and school
administrators, 130 NGOs, and 142 CSWs. Finally, loan resources were allocated efficiently, to
the sector that had the most capacity to implement investments effectively. The final allocation of
resources was as follows: MOH, EUR 16.9 million; MOE, EUR 9.1 million and MOLEVSP, EUR
5.8 million. Pragmatically, the Project did not finance hardware for the education management
information system, since financing for this was expected to become available from the EU. So
far, the tender has been prepared but not yet contracted.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

56.      The Project’s Overall Outcome Rating is assessed as Moderately Satisfactory. This was
undoubtedly a complex project, whose original design proved difficult to implement. Through the
October 2012 restructuring, it maintained its relevance, which has become all the more important
given fiscal constraints that the GoS is facing, and the need to do more with less. Its outcome—
efficacy—especially in view of the multitude of positive results and evaluations that have been
reported, is impressive, despite some shortcomings, especially in education. The Project not only
supported actions aimed at promoting efficiency in service delivery, but was implemented
efficiently, especially given its complexity across sectors and levels of government, However,
critical steps towards further improvement in efficiency in all three sectors remain to be addressed.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

57.    The Project impacted disadvantaged groups that have traditionally not been provided
access to health and education services, and that are associated with higher levels of poverty,
including the disabled, Roma, youth, especially in rural, dispersed areas of the country. These
impacts are detailed in Section 3.2, especially in the objective of improving access and equity.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

58.     The Project supported several training, technical assistance and analytical activities and
investments aimed at strengthening institutional capacity, most notably the design and
implementation of information systems, but also through the provision of grant schemes in
working across sectors, with LSGs coordinating activities implemented by PHCs, CSWs, schools,
together with NGOs to provide higher quality inclusive services. But it also supported the
implementation of several new policies such as the performance-based allocation of resources in
primary health and, the reform of the Disability Fund to allocate resources based on performance
that have now been institutionalized. These are described in detail in Section 3.2.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

59.    Not applicable.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

60.    Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

61.     The Risk to Development Outcome is assessed as Moderate. The main risk to sustainability
would be the fiscal constraints that the GoS is facing at present. However, several factors bode
well for sustainability, in that the activities that were financed either served to promote efficiency,
and hence strengthened the GoS’ ability to deliver more and better quality services at lower cost,
or proved that it is possible to deliver inclusive services that yield results with small financial
commitment. The integrated health information system has contributed significantly to the
efficiency, transparency and accountability of the delivery of primary health care by avoiding
unnecessary diagnostic procedures, specialist referrals and hospital admissions, all while delivery
higher quality care. The information system for the MOLEVSP, when fully functional at the level
of all CSWs, will allow higher quality services, with shorter response times, and coordination
among multiple levels of government. In education, the network established around inclusive
education brought together trained school officials and teachers to provide equitable access to
children with learning difficulties, disabilities, and from socio-economically disadvantaged
groups. With this, it developed improved vertical coordination (among different levels of
schooling) and horizontal coordination (among different schools at the same level). The Disability
Fund, now grounded with new operating and results-based procedures for resource allocation,
                                                  19 
                                                    
 
helped identify those services that have the greatest impact on the lives of the disabled. All of these
positive experiences should weigh heavily in resource allocation decisions at the national level,
even in a resource-constrained environment. Finally, the Laws of Self Government and of Local
Government Finance have broadened the scope of public revenues that belong to LSGs, giving
them not only greater responsibilities in terms of service delivery, but also greater decision making
authority on disposable resource allocation.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
62.     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The
preparation team helped prepare a conceptually strong project that responded to the GoS’ request
for assistance to its decentralization of service delivery efforts. Nevertheless, the team
underestimated severely the implementation risks of such a complex project, especially since the
timing of its approval by the World Bank’s Board—two months before elections--was not optimal,
the Project required passage of legislation to achieve its objectives and the capacity to implement
and monitor progress on a cross-sectoral basis at several levels of government (and especially at
the level of LSG) simply did not exist. It was the Project, through the activities it supported that
would eventually put in place the capacity to work cross-sectorally at the various levels of
government. Further, the M&E mechanisms for the Project as set up at the onset were very weak.
PDO was overly complex aiming to address equity, efficiency, access and quality, and not equally
adaptable with all the sectors. PDO and corresponding indicators were not fully aligned to
appropriately reflect Project achievements and the Results Framework was rather weak with a
number of indicators lacking baselines and proper measurement mechanisms. In addition, the
indicators were not fully aligned with the PDO.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
63.      Quality of Supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Initially, the World Bank’s
implementation support team aimed to foster inter-sectoral cooperation, especially at the State
level, in order to jump-start implementation of the Project as designed. When it became clear that
the Project could not be implemented as designed, the team worked closely with the FSU and the
PATs to realign the Project’s description and Results Framework, within the context of its PDOs,
to respond to the GoS’ priorities for decentralization in three sectors, while at the same time
retaining, where feasible, the goal of promoting inter-sectoral coordination, especially at the level
of LSG. But the Mid-Term Review took place late in the project implementation and the
subsequent project restructuring took too long to complete, the issues that the team had identified
early on (e.g., slow disbursements) were not the correct ones so that the Quality of Supervision,
especially in the Project’s initial years of implementation was only Moderately Satisfactory.
Implementation support became a challenge, especially since the Project in effect required strong
inputs from specialists in three sectors, with knowledge of information systems design and
procurement, and with oversight of activities carried out by LSGs across Serbia. Task management
changed six times, as did team members, but overall strong implementation support was provided
throughout. Quality of Supervision improved significantly after the project restructuring in June
                                                  20 
                                                    
 
2012, and it was through the strong implementation support provided thereafter, that the Project
was able to accomplish important results. Towards the final years of implementation the team
recommended correctly that upon project completion, the closing date be extended for MOH
activities only, since not only were these showing the most promising results, but also, continued
support under the Project would provide continuity in World Bank health sector assistance until
the Second Health Project was approved. Coordination of this assistance was achieved through
responsibility of task management for implementation support assigned to the same Task Team
Leader. Finally, the team quickly identified health sector activities that would be required to help
the GoS respond to the impact of flooding in 2014 on its population, and restructured the Project
to provide this needed assistance.

(c)   Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
64.     Overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Despite issues with the its
design, the World Bank’s implementation support teams through intensive and proactive
assistance, was able to address those issues satisfactorily and realign the Project’s description and
monitoring framework, intensifying support in those areas where results were more promising,
responding to the GoS’ priorities, and in this manner overcome the original design issues.
Nevertheless, issues with the Project’s original design required strong efforts on the part of the
World Bank’s implementation support team in order to keep implementation on track.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
65.     Government Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Project was approved and
implemented during a difficult period, especially in view of the economic challenges following
the 2008-09 financial crisis. Despite the tight fiscal space, however, the GoS has largely pushed
ahead with reforms with a view to international integration, especially EU membership for which
Serbia has been recommended “candidate” status by the European Commission. The Project’s
cross-sectoral implementation model that was to be supported by the Project Policy Board did not
function, as had been expected. Nevertheless, the GoS remained committed to the Project’s
objectives, and provided the necessary resources, staffing and support to its restructuring despite
changes in government, in general, and in individual ministries, in particular, that led to wavering
commitment to specific policy actions on occasion.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
66.     Implementing Agencies Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Project
Implementing Agencies were the FSU, the PATs in the MOE, MOH and MOLEVSP, and the
LSGs, PHCs, schools and CSOs that implemented subproject grants. Performance varied by
agency, as can be expected. Despite occasional lapses due to changes in staffing, the FSU provided
timely and responsive support and coordination to implementation, consolidating and coordinating
with each of the PATs. The PATs in the MOH and MOLEVSP worked generally effectively,
although each was affected by ministerial changes, changes in procedures, and, in the case of the
MOLEVSP, delays in information system procurement due to protracted delays in approval of the
                                                 21 
                                                   
 
Social Assistance Law. Nevertheless, both of these were able to sustain implementation progress,
despite these changes and unforeseen delays. The PAT in MOE faced more routine issues
throughout, especially insofar as tracking invoices and arranging payments to contractors, and
providing follow-up to and delivering routine project supervision reports, such as the
Environmental Compliance Report on the implementation of sub-project grants.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
67.    Overall Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory, based on similar ratings
for Government and Implementing Agencies performance.

6. Lessons Learned

68.       The Project offers several lessons with regard to project design and implementation.
      •   Projects designed and implemented across multiple sectors and among multiple
          layers of government and implementing agencies require a strong coordinating body
          at the national level (in addition to coordination mechanisms at the local level). Design
          had envisaged a Project Policy Board with representatives of stakeholder ministries, as well
          as strong involvement by the MPALSG. This Board met only twice, and the PMALSG’s
          involvement was minimal such that during implementation, the inter-sectoral coordination
          required was only provided, without much technical support, at the level of individual
          LSGs. As a result, the Project was implemented almost as three separate projects in each
          of the sectors supported, with little if any coordination among the ministries at the State
          level. Implementation support, mission Aide Memoires, and completion reporting were
          likewise carried out on a sectoral basis.
      •   PDOs for complex, multisectoral projects should be kept simple, contained and easily
          measurable. This is especially true for a first multisectoral project in a country, in which
          commitment to adopt a rather complex approach has not yet been tested.
      •   A well formulated Results Framework, with outputs leading to intermediate
          outcomes, leading to outcomes, with baseline data and targets upon completion can
          facilitate project management and oversight. The Project’s RF did not have a clear
          results chain, nor baseline data or targets. Further, it defined outcome indicators that
          spanned sectors, which became difficult to monitor in the absence of a coordinating body
          at the national level. The project restructurings amended the RF to make it compatible with
          implementation, establish baselines and targets, but monitoring was done sectorally, with
          the additional effort required to compile monitoring data from three ministries.
      •   Disbursement schedules need to take into account the nature of the activities being
          financed, and the estimated time needed to and cost of implementing each of the
          activities. The Project devoted about one third of its funding to supervision intensive and
          slow disbursing technical assistance that was required up-front to help define both the
          policy actions, and more importantly, the grant programs and information systems that
          were to be financed later. Implementation support identified that these issues with design
          were impacting the pace of disbursements, but spent an inordinate effort in accelerating
          disbursements when the issue was structural.
      •   Placing a fiduciary coordinating unit in one of the implementing agencies helps to
          provide some coordination of at least procedural requirements, but can create some
          tensions among implementing agencies. The Financial Services Unit was housed in the
          Ministry of Health, and the other implementing agencies could voice concern about lack
                                                  22 
                                                    
 
       of attention or support to their needs. It would have been preferable to have the coordinating
       unit in this case housed in a central ministry that was not directly an implementing agency.

Grants financed by the DILS Project:

1.      Several activities under the Project were carried out through grants delivered by the MOE, MOH
and MOLEVSP to municipalities, NGOs, and PHCs. In all cases, the provision of grants followed a similar
process: finalization of the respective grant manual (including criteria and procedures for accessing and
implementing grants), dissemination of availability of grant funding, provision of training on preparing
grant proposals, preparing grant proposals, implementing and monitoring grants. Details on the several lines
of grants provided, the activities they financed and their beneficiaries are provided below, by sector.

Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MOE)

2.      The MOE provided grants through two programs: Strengthening Schools for Inclusive Education
(together with trainings for teachers presented in the Table above), and Educational Inclusion of Roma.

3.       A total of 298 schools received grants under the Strengthening Schools for Inclusive Education
program for the development and implementation of school projects aimed at achieving two of five goals:
(a) improving the professional competencies of employees to work with students with disabilities and
learning difficulties; (b) sensitizing school stakeholders and the local community for the acceptance and
support to students with disabilities and learning difficulties; (c) enhancing cooperation with parents of
students with disabilities and learning difficulties; (d) involving better students with disabilities and learning
difficulties in the educational process; and (e) providing access to the school premises for students with
disabilities and learning difficulties. In all, about Euro 1.2 million were allocated to schools through these
grants, approximately Euro 4,000 per school. These grants were intended to improve the quality of
education for disadvantaged populations (violence at schools, Roma, students with special needs, rural
schools and students requiring motivation). The grants financed small civil works and materials and
equipment. Four thematic trainings included: (a) Strategies and methods of adapting instruction for
children with disabilities and gifted children; (b) Planning and Individual Education Plan; (c) Monitoring,
evaluation and revision of the Individual Education Plan; and (d) Motivation for learning and psychological
principles of learning.

4.       The Education Inclusion of Roma program aimed to contribute to the creation and implementation
of the policy of Roma integration at the municipal level. To implement the grant program, 56 municipalities
were selected on the basis of two main criteria: (a) the level of economic development of the municipality,
and the less developed municipalities were given preference; and (b) the aggregate composite index based
on a series of indicators derived from a group of official record indicators related to the Roma population
(e.g., number) and indicators collected by the Roma Education Fund. Municipal grants were awarded to
192 pre-school and primary schools and 56 NGOs within the overall 56 municipal programs financed.
Municipalities received, on average, Euro 35,000 with the objective of increasing the educational inclusion
of Roma students by increasing the availability and quality of education. Municipal mentors were appointed
(26) to assist the 56 municipal teams develop and implement their projects. Participating municipalities
were required to: (a) provide a complete analysis of the educational needs of Roma children and a plan of
community development activities to address them; (b) remove barriers to access of the right to education
for Roma children, and provide full educational coverage of Roma children in pre-school and elementary
education; (c) increase significantly the participation of Roma children in pre-school education; (d) improve
significantly the quality of services for Roma children at the local level; (e) strengthen the responsiveness
of local authorities and others responsible for promoting social integration of Roma children in the
community; (f) the inclusion of any educational institution in activities related to the policy of Roma
integration; and (g) create a local action plan to ensure sustainability of the activities aimed at the inclusion
of Roma students.

5.       The External Evaluation of the Training and Grants Programs for Inclusive Education found that
these grant and training programs have achieved their goals. The external evaluation used an on-line
questionnaire to collect data for each program (and training) designed on the basis of inclusiveness
indicators but tailored for each group of respondents (e.g., municipal officials, school principals, teachers
trained, NGO representatives, the teams for inclusive educations, school coordinators for the Project).
Inclusiveness indicators included: lower dropout rates, lower rates of absenteeism, higher academic
achievement, lower rate of repetition, greater coverage of pre-school and primary education, the degree of
mobility to higher levels of education, the rate of segregation, students’ and parents’ satisfaction with
school, intersectoral cooperation at the municipal level. The sample included a representative group of 16
schools, one from each region that received grants and a control group of 16 schools with similar geographic
and demographic conditions that did not. For training, all teachers in the 16 schools in the sample were
covered.

6.       The evaluation concludes “Based on the results and opinions of the different stakeholders, it can
be concluded that the DILS school grants program has achieved its goal: it has contributed to a more
successful implementation of inclusive education, led to higher academic achievements of the students with
disabilities and made them feel more satisfied and accepted within the school. Furthermore, it led to
cultivating inclusive culture within schools to a greater extent.” Also, the results revealed that schools that
benefited from grants achieved “remarkable progress” in relation to the control group. With respect to
training, the evaluation found that the greatest effect or range of impact was attributed to the Inclusive
Education – Strategies and methods of adapting instruction for children with disabilities and gifted children
training, especially in increasing the sensitivity of teachers of students from vulnerable groups. The
evaluation also found that the grants awarded under the Education Inclusion of Roma program also met
their objective by contributing to better cooperation of different agencies at the local level in providing
services and support to children from deprived groups, uniting various stakeholders, enabling good
cooperation, etc. According to the evaluation’s findings, stakeholders reported significantly reduced
absenteeism of students from deprived communities and their increased school achievements, although
dropout rates and coverage of primary education continue to warrant attention. Finally, the evaluation
highlighted the importance of synergy for the successful implementation of inclusive education:
cooperation with NGOs that provide pedagogical assistants and field work, with municipalities that help
meet basic needs of this group (meals, clothing and transportation).

Ministry of Health (MOH)

7.      The MOH provided grants under four lines: (a) grants for increasing access to healthcare for
vulnerable population groups; (b) PHC accreditation grants; (c) quality improvements through investment
grants; and (d) grants for introducing MIS software in PHCs. Progress in each of these is described
separately below.

8.       Grants were awarded in three cycles to LSGs for increasing access to healthcare for vulnerable
population groups following a process of working with the LSGs to provide training in proposal writing,
project management, and management and administration of grant funding. In the first cycle, 42 LSGs
received grants to implement one-year projects. The largest share of these grants were for projects directed
at addressing needs of persons over 65, mostly in rural areas (22 grants, covering 15,025 persons), followed
by youth (9 projects, covering 7,390 youth), the disabled (7 grants, covering 1,920 disabled) and Roma (4
grants, covering 1,405 Roma). In the second cycle, grants were awarded to 26 LSGs that had shown the
best implementation results in the first cycle (one LSG dropped out subsequently). The largest share of the
second cycle grants were for projects directed at increasing access to healthcare for persons over 65 living,
usually with chronic illnesses and dependent on care and assistance (14 grants), followed by increasing
healthcare for the disabled (3 grants for adults and 2 for children with disabilities), for youth to improve
their reproductive health and prevent addictions (4 grants) and two grants intended for uninsured,
unemployed persons. In addition, during the second cycle, grants were provided to 9 PHCs to increase the
availability of dental healthcare and improve the oral health of the population. In the third cycle, 12 grants
were provided to LSGs to increase healthcare to vulnerable groups, and 9 grants to increase their access to
dental healthcare, covering about 7,500 members of these groups.

9.       It is difficult to measure the impact of these grants in such a short period, but unofficial feedback
highlights an increase in the number of newly diagnosed cardiovascular diseases, elevated blood sugar,
elevated triglycerides and cholesterol, and addition to other non-communicable diseases such as cancer.
Nevertheless, better regulation of blood pressures, blood sugar, cholesterol and triglyceride levels should
lead to improved health outcomes, and there have been efforts to promote healthy lifestyles and choices,
identifying risk factors and required behavior changes. Palliative care provided to the elderly undoubtedly
improved the quality of life of the terminally ill and of those that depend on care and assistance. Single
elderly were provided with access to nurses, in cooperation with centers for social work, or with volunteers
from NGOs. Specialist referrals, transportation, guidance on obtaining health insurance where warranted,

                                                      45 
                                                        
 
were additional outputs that should improve health outcomes of vulnerable groups. PHCs purchased
medical supplies and equipment, and in partnership with LSGs provided vehicles, home nurses, food etc.
NGOs involved with vulnerable groups provided critical support.

10.     An external evaluation, Technical Assistance in DILS Grants Evaluation, found, inter alia, that: (a)
PHCs procured the necessary equipment, including dental, that will allow them to continue providing health
services to vulnerable population groups; (b) cooperation of PHCs with LSGs and NGOs improved, while
the expectation that they would enhance cooperation with educational, cultural and other institutions still
needs further work; (c) increased public trust in the availability of health services for vulnerable population
groups, and (d) the PHCs’ skills in preparing project proposals, implementation and reporting have
improved allowing them to continue competing for and receiving funds for projects. Almost all PHCs have
continued their activities in some way, some independently and others with the support of LSGs.

11.      PHC Accreditation Grants were awarded to the 42 PHCs participating in the Project, and an
additional 20 PHCs based on a request by the MOH. Accreditation standards for PHCs with the process
defined in scope, form and duration by the Agency for Accreditation of Health Care Institutions in Serbia,
include: (a) standards for patient care in general practice, gynecology, pediatrics, specialist-consultative
services and home care; (b) standards of clinical support: pharmaceutical services, laboratory diagnostics
and diagnostic radiology; and (c) non-clinical standards for the environment, human resources, information
management, governance and management. PHCs were selected according to pre-defined criteria that
included: (a) size of the PHC; (b) degree of development of the municipality; (c) percentage of positive
responses to questionnaires sent to all PHC on the degree of fulfillment of the criteria to be considered in
the accreditation process; and (d) express desire for entry in the accreditation process. Grant funding was
provided in fixed but varying amounts, depending on the size of the PHCs (small, medium or large), with
the difference provided by the PHC in cooperation with the respective LSG. The grants provided funding
for training of the accreditation teams in PHCs, development of the strategic plan for the PHC, and carrying
out of self-assessment according to the standards of accreditation.

12.      The external evaluation confirms that 83 PHCs, in three cycles, implemented the accreditation
process, as well as the Institute for the Health Care of students in Belgrade. An additional 33 institutions
have begun the process (but without grant funding). The MOH remarked that accreditation has produced
the following benefits: “the development of multidisciplinary teams, review of the institutions’ operational
policies, improving data systems, generating local and national prestige, and improved networking between
primary health centers in exchange of good practices.” The evaluation found that PHC institutions recognize
accreditation as one of the most important external mechanisms for improving the quality of health care.

13.      Quality improvements through investment grants were supported for 43 PHCs participating in the
Project. This funding had the following objectives: to support local cooperation between healthcare
institutions and LSGs, and to serve the practical integration of all activities in the field of quality
improvement that were implemented at the local level, ranging from strategic planning, through
recommendations made in the process of accreditation to the development of an integrated quality
improvement plan and its implementation. Funds were used to finance minor construction works, such as
repairs, window replacement, leakage control, purchases of medical equipment and transport vehicles,
including ambulances, to respond to patients requiring home care, transport to health facilities, etc. Only
14 PHCs had the financial support of their LSG, which varied form over 50 percent of the investment to
only 2 percent.

14.     The MOH has found that for the majority of the PHCs this was an opportunity to understand how
investments can be used for quality improvements, as they were able to analyze their needs, prioritize, and
compete for funding, explaining the rationale with evidence to support their investment proposals. The
external evaluation reports that PHCs in general found that the investments the grants supported improved
the quality and efficiency with which services are delivered, increased the interest of the respective LSGs
in healthcare issues, and enhanced public trust in the system. All have gained competence in how to

                                                      46 
                                                        
 
prioritize investments within constrained resources, how to prepare investment proposals and how to
monitor and evaluate progress.

15.      Grants for introducing software were provided to all (158) PHCs, as well as to 3 health institutions
for healthcare of students and the Republican Gerontology Institute. The amount of each individual grant
varied, depending on the availability of software in the PHC, the size of the institution as measured by the
number of doctors, the number of clinics, and the economic development of the municipality. LSGs were
expected to participate (except for 46 of the poorest municipalities) by contributing up to 30 percent of the
cost of introducing software, on an as need basis. In fact, only one-third of the PHCs counted on the financial
support of the respective LSG, and most of those that did not highlighted that the grant financing was
sufficient to cover their needs.

16.       The grant funds were used to: (a) purchase certified software with the accompanying package of
service for all PHCs, or reinstallation and customization of existing software for PHCs that have introduced
it; (b) training staff to use the software; (c) implementation of software functionality through a 6-month
warranty period, and (d) creating conditions for PHCs to be included in the integrated health information
system. (The purchase of IT equipment was carried out centrally by the MOH under a separate contract, as
was the process for certification of software.) Any unused grant funds upon full installation of the software
could be used by the PHC (with prior approval of the MOH) for: (a) purchase of hardware or IT equipment;
(b) purchase of new software modules (e.g., laboratory information systems); and (c) maintaining IT
systems in the facility. The implementation of the electronic health record and respective user training were
implemented in 156 health facilities (96.3%).

17.      The evaluation report highlights several positive benefits of this line of grants. These include,
among others: (a) it has standardized the information system with respect to all components, hardware,
LAN, WAN, software, user training, documentation, maintenance; (b) the relationship between PHC
management and health personnel towards the process of computerization has changed considerably in a
positive direction; (c) the software is characterized by medical personnel as a very useful tool, which
facilitate the work and definitely improves the quality and efficiency of health services and delivery; (d)
patients accept positively the existence of their electronic health records as the consider that it improves the
quality of services especially where services that visibly facilitate access to medical treatment have been
introduced; (e) PHCs have continued to introduce new modules providing own funds after seeing the
benefits of the initial software installed; and (f) LSGs have become increasingly involved in the process of
computerization, more than before, and at the level of decision-making along with other stakeholders. As
to impact, the evaluation notes: “the impact of computerization in the PHC facilities on direct beneficiaries,
local and regional environment, as well as the entire health system has been extremely positive and visible
in many aspects. Accuracy, uniformity, speed of delivery of health services were all improved which
significantly raised the quality. The care procedures related to chronic patients, for screening, prescription
drugs, prescriptions, referrals, making appointments, etc. were all simplified. These positive changes have
been observed by both doctors and patients. The relationship between the management of the facilities and
health personnel towards the process of computerization changed to a large extent compared to the
beginning of the project, and in a positive direction. Local government provided the media promotion of
the computerization of institutions and is familiar with the problem of sustainability. At the regional level,
connection with institutes of public health is being partly achieved. Also, selected physician and nurses
(team) generally have an increased awareness of the importance and responsibility of their role in the
creation of electronic health information on an individual patient. The process of computerization in
primary health care has been intensified, this initiated the founding of the Association of IT Experts in
Health Care Facilities, which aims to increase the impact of information technologies on the process of
computerization of health care in Serbia.”

Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veterans, and Social Policy (MOLEVSP)

18.      The MOLEVSP provided grants to 87 projects of Disabled People’s Organizations under the
Disability Fund. Previously, the Disability Fund had provided financing on an incremental, yearly basis,
with no monitoring of results and impacts on the end users. A main objective of reforming the process of
allocating funds was to ensure that funding provided through the Disability Fund were directed towards
activities that provided the greatest results for persons with disabilities (PWD).

19.      The Disability Fund was reformed in four stages. Using a first draft of the Grant Operations Manual,
two projects targeting persons with disabilities were piloted: sign interpreting services and companion
services. The Grant Operations Manual was revised to incorporate experience under these two projects. A
second call for grant proposals was conducted in 2010, and led to a further revision of the Grant Operations
Manual, a third call for proposals in 2011, and further revisions and finally a fourth call for proposals. The
final Grant Operations Manual incorporates improved formats for applying for grants and template for
reporting on expenditures and activities implemented, and improved scales for assessing project proposals,
which are transparent and public. The Manual includes clearly defined modalities of project financing,
conditions, criteria and procedures for awarding grants, for monitoring funds usage, etc. The MOLEVSP
conducted training, at various intervals, to associations focused on persons with disabilities on the
preparation of grant funding proposals, and monitoring and implementation of their projects. Monitoring
of grant implementation, reporting and monitoring was carried out be external consultants that periodically
verified compliance with the Manual, implementation progress, financial management and issues. Periodic
interviews were also held with project coordinators, members of project teams, beneficiaries, and others
involved in implementation.

20.     Following the granting and implementation of the two pilot grants totaling approximately Euro
50,000, 47 projects of associations (providers of service could be citizens’ associations, NGOs, private
groups, etc.) out of a total 350 organizations that submitted proposals were awarded grants in the total
amount of approximately Euro 388,313. In 2011, the Disability Fund awarded 36 grants totaling Euro
287,777. In 2012, 4 grants were awarded for approximately Euro 90,000.

21.       The Disability Fund grants covered the following main types of activities:

•     Training activities aimed directly at strengthening the capacity of PWD organizations and providing
      training to have an active role as the service providers in their local communities—implementation of
      training, education, workshops, and seminars through which representatives of PWD organization
      gained knowledge and skills to effectively design and develop program activities and launch services,
      actively participate in the creation and implementation of programs within the defined policies for the
      improvement of the position of PWN at the local community level;
•     The provision of social services and psycho-social support to PWD and their families through the
      launch of innovative activities and further development of the newly establish social services for PWD
      piloted through the previously awards grants. Funded services predominantly were classified as
      advisory-therapeutic and social and educational service, as well as support services for independent
      living (the funding for which in accordance to the Law on Social Protection is under the jurisdiction of
      local governments);
•     Training activities for broader groups of citizens, as well selected categories (teachers, employees of
      public institutions, children with typical development of pre-school or school age, students, youth)
      through implemented educational workshops, lectures and specific trainings, and media and public
      campaigns that contributed to creating a positive environment and conditions for the social integration
      of PWD, raising public awareness about the presence, needs and abilities of PWD, overcoming negative
      perceptions of PWD based on a medical approach and acceptance of PWD as equal member of society
      with equal rights;
•     Activities aimed at improving the availability and effectiveness of services for PWD—collecting,
      compiling and disseminating information about existing social services for PWD, connecting service

                                                      48 
                                                        
 
    providers with local authorities and relevant public institutions and planning of joint actions,
    development of a legal framework for the establishment of the center for improving the standards for
    services provided by the PWD associations, and
•   Activities of assessment and planning of social services for PWD.

22.      Most of the grants included several categories of these activities, adjusted to address local needs
of the PWDs in their communities. Informal evaluations, on the basis of grant monitoring, show that from
80 to 100 percent achieved expected results as defined by their measurable indicators, and one-third
exceeded initial expectations, primarily in the number and motivation of direct users, as well as the
sensibility of the public and institutions to the needs and problems of PWD (i.e., accepting PWD as equal
members of society with equal rights).

23.      The main target beneficiaries of the Disability Fund grants awarded were employees of state
institutions (that by nature of their work are in daily contact with PWD) and organizations and PWD
themselves. Targeting employees of state institutions provides for easier integration of PWD into society
by providing for their easier use of existing services. PWD attended different trainings, workshops and
meetings to acquire new knowledge and skills to make use of existing social services, and systematically
influence changes at the national and local levels. Some grant project targeted marginalized groups such as
Roma PWD and Roma children.

24.      All grant projects were implemented by PWD organization and NGOs. Most were carried out
independently, while eight projects were implemented in partnership with local stakeholders (LSGs,
Centers for Social Work, other public institutions at the local level), or other related civic associations. In
addition to covering part of the direct costs, local level partners assisted with the technical, logistical,
organization aspects, in addition to providing technical expertise and professional resources (e.g.,
psychological counseling, psycho-social and other activities in accredited programs, establishing specific
services and educational facilities). The informal support of local institutions, LSGs, NGOs, and the local
media was instrumental in providing the conditions for promotion and implementation of activities,
especially for those project whose implementation was directly related to the cooperation with these local
institutions and the inclusion of their representatives. The establishment of formal and informal partnerships
with key local stakeholders reflects the recognition of PWD association of the need for networking and
connecting with these groups to overcome discrimination towards PWD, to protect their rights and ensure
equal treatment for PWD. Also, one third of all grant projects involved actively volunteers in the
implementation of their activities.

                                                  Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

1.       The development objective of the DILS Project was to increase the capacity of institutional actors
and beneficiaries to improve access to and the efficiency, equity and quality of local delivery of health,
education and social protection services in a decentralizing environment in Serbia. The project had five
components to: Make fiscal decentralization work through investments in goods, technical assistance and
training for line ministries and Local Self Government (LSG) agencies; Improve outreach and access
through development and expansion of innovations in service delivery; Support a new, regulatory oversight
and quality-assurance role for State level Ministries; Improve capacity of LSGs and other local public
institutions as service providers; and the last component was to provide project implementation support.

2.       Although the project generated a number of direct and indirect multiplier impacts, the nature of the
activities pursued and the resulting benefits could not be quantified. Hence a traditional economic analysis
with rates of return analysis has not been attempted in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and in this
completion report. Instead this section traces the economic impacts of activities pursued under the project
to improve access to and the efficiency and quality of local delivery of health, education and social
protection services in a decentralizing environment based on evidence from the literature.

    Economic impact of decentralization on delivery of health, education and social services

3.       The decentralization of social sectors services produced significant impact on quality of local
delivery of health, education and social protection services. Estimation of the impacts of decentralization
of these services requires major research effort and often sufficient data do not exist to quantify the impacts
(Bossert, 2002)4. We do not have sufficient data to analyze and estimate the direct and indirect impacts of
activities under this project and hence is not attempted here. Studies by Robalino, Picazo and Voetberg
(2011) showed significant impacts of fiscal, administrative and political decentralization on variables used
to measure access to health care and health outcomes. Studies using panel data suggest significant
association between both fiscal and administrative decentralization and delivery of health services and
health outcomes at the local level. The World Development Report 2004 further argues that political
decentralization brings about accountability to the system and thus improves health service delivery5.

4.       The health sector activities implemented under the DILS project included 6 : streamlining the
financing of the primary healthcare; performance payments; training for employees in LSGs and PHCs;
training in financing and accounting procedures like step-down method of analyzing costs and PHC
financing; assessment of energy efficiency of PHC buildings; support to National Insurance Fund to build
capacity for the introduction of diagnosis related groups; analysis of the activities and financing of National
Reference Laboratories (NRL), their equipment and staffing, with a view to improve their services and
efficiency; and capacity building for staff of PHCs on EU health policy and preparation of project proposals
for EU financing. All of these activities produced substantial direct and indirect multiplier impacts in local
delivery of health services. Though we do not have data to document those impacts the evidences from the
literature on the impacts of these activities cited above and those presented in the PAD provide justification
for significant economic impacts.

5.       Evidences from the literature also show significant impact of decentralization on education
outcomes. Evidence to date suggests activities like increasing school autonomy, delivery of schooling,
fiscal decentralization and school governance have significant impacts on educational outcomes (USAID,

    Detailed list of activities and outputs is presented in Annex 2.
                                                                     50 
                                                                       
 
2007)7. The education sector activities and outputs undertaken include: piloting central and local per capita
funding formulae, training and seminars on the funding formulae, grants to educational institutions without
violence and to Roma children, grants to inclusive schools, trainings for staff and teams on inclusive
schools, Procurement of Assistive Technologies equipment and software, and distribution to 6 schools,
consultant services and technical assistance and analytical services to support education sector. As in the
case of health sector interventions, these activities in the education sector generated impacts both direct and
indirect. However, we do not have data and information to quantify the direct and multiplier impacts. But
evidences from literature cited above and in the PAD suggest possible impacts of these interventions on
local delivery of education services.

6.      Available evidence further suggests that decentralization of services delivery and involvement of
decentralized local governments increases efficiency and impacts of social protection programs.
Intergovernmental arrangements and coordination, local government capacity development, fiscal
decentralization and accountability and local capacity development were found to increase economic
impact of social protection programs (UNDP, 2013)8.

7.       Consistent with the above evidence from literature, the activities and outcomes from the DILS
project improved access to and efficiency, equity and quality of local delivery of health, education and
social protection services by increasing capacity of institutional actors and beneficiaries in a decentralized
environment. It also increased accountability and governance of LSGs by better coordination and loops of
communication among the different agents.

    A. Marginal benefits with the project

8.      This section presents the marginal benefits with the project. The project had significant impact in
improving access to health, education and social protection services. In the education sector, the project
improved access and equity in pre-school and primary education through the implementation of sub-
projects awarded under two grant programs. The two sub-projects were strengthening schools for inclusive
education and education inclusion of Roma.

9.       The project also had an influential impact on improving the quality of local delivery of health,
education and social protection services. In health the project financed activities at the state level as well
as activities with LSGs and project PHCs, especially, three types of sub-project grants aimed at helping the
PHCs accomplish the Project’s objectives: (a) PHC Accreditation Grants; (b) Quality Improvements
through Investment Grants; and (c) Grants for Introducing Information System Software. In education the
project achieved impressive results through a variety of activities like participation in student assessments
and technical assistance and training for the implementation of standards for the end of compulsory
education (8th grade) and related capacity building. In order to improve social protection at the local level
the project developed a centralized management information system and provided with infrastructure and
software in all 265 CSWs, and 600 staff in all of the CSWs have been trained in its use.

10.     All of these activities generated significant marginal benefits with the project. The Project
Appraisal document outlines a number case studies and results from literature that demonstrate positive
impacts of different activities in health, education and social protection services.

    B. Macroeconomic growth and financial sustainability

11.            After the recession of 2014, the economy is gradually showing signs of stabilization but faces
downside risks. The recent recovery is supported by robust increase in industrial production and exports,
lower oil prices and stronger growth in the euro area. GDP growth is expected to remain flat in sort-run.

More robust growth rates of around 2-3% are forecasted over the medium term. Inflation is declining in
recent years falling from 11.1 percent in 2011 to 2.1 in 2014 and is expected to be stay around 4 percent in
the medium term. But a large public debt accumulated through 2014 will require further efforts in order to
control it over the medium-term. Public revenue as a percent of GDP increased from 37.9 percent in 2013
to 40 percent in 2014 and is forecasted to gradually decline over the medium term (ie through 2020) to
around 38.2 percent of GDP. Government expenditures as percent of GDP has been relatively high at around
45 percent in the recent past and is expected to gradually decrease falling to 40 percent by 2020. The fiscal
balance as percent of GDP also improved from -6.7 percent in 2014 to projected 4.1 in 2015 and is expected
to be around 2 percent by 2020.

12.       The Government put in place a fiscal consolidation program in 2014 which has
contributed to improved fiscal performance in 2015. The general government deficit over the first
nine months of 2015 was 1.3 percent of full-year GDP, down from 3.9 percent in the same period of
2014. The deficit reduction came primarily as a result of increased revenues (up 6.5 percent y/y in
nominal terms). VAT and excises pushed total tax revenues up by 2.3 percent. However, the strong
revenues were mainly supported a by major increase in non-tax revenues primarily due to one-off
measures (i.e., payment of net income from state owned enterprises and proceeds from the sale of 4G
licenses) and from the introduction of surcharges on public sector wages. Total nominal government
expenditures declined by 1.7 percent as a result of major savings from wage and pension reforms (down
by 11.4 and 3.5 percent, respectively). Wage bill reduction comes as a result of introduction of a 10
percent cut in wages across the public sector and continued implementation of a hiring freeze (introduced
in January 2014). Savings on spending on pensions comes as a result of the reduction of pensions higher
than RSD 25,000 by 22 percent and those above RSD 40,000 were cut by 25 percent.

13.     As the expenditures in the health, education and social protection sectors have increased and are
projected to stay at the similar level in the future we could expect more decentralized delivery of health,
education and social services as the government’s commitment to decentralization, which indicates the
sustainability of the project and its development objectives.

14.        Fiscal weaknesses over the 2012-2014 period led to a significant increase in public debt.
General government expenditures averaged 45.6 percent of GDP over 2012 to 2014, about 2.5 percentage
points more than in the pre-crisis period. At the same time revenues declined and consequently the fiscal
deficit rose, reaching historically high levels (averaging 6.5 percent over 2012-14). As a result, public
debt grew rapidly, reaching 72.3 percent of GDP at the end of 2014.
15.       Notwithstanding lower net fiscal financing needs, central government debt (including
guarantees) has moved up slightly over 2015, to 73.7 percent at end-September 2015 from 72.3 percent
at end-2014. As well as the continued, if narrowed deficit, this is partially explained by the US dollar
strengthen in early 2015 (with 33 percent of debt dollar-denominated). The stock of guarantees have been
gradually declining – from 7.9 at end-2014 to 7.5 percent of GDP in September 2015, as the policy of no
new liquidity guarantees is being strictly observed. Most of the public debt relate to external direct debt
(38.8 percent of GDP) while the domestic public debt accounts for 26 percent of GDP.
    C. Sustainability at the local level

16.     The decentralization of public revenues to local governments was facilitated by the Law on Self-
Government (2002). This law increased the autonomy of local self-governments and improved the
transparency of intergovernmental fiscal relations.

17.     In 2007 the new law on local government finance was enacted creating four principal sources of
revenue, namely: local taxes, shared taxes, non-categorical intergovernmental transfers; and categorical
intergovernmental transfers. This new law eliminated the arbitrary and unpredictable distribution of
revenues that characterized the prior system of local public finance. It also replaced a system based on
varying shares of the sales tax with fixed shares of the payroll tax and formula-driven transfers. The new
law improved the predictability and transparency of the intergovernmental finance system. Among
individual jurisdictions, the reforms achieved a significant reduction of disparities in per capita revenues.

18.      The new law on local self-government reduced disparities in spending in social sectors as the law
is being implemented. The DILS project also reduced the variations in spending in the social sectors as the
variations in per capita revenues continue to decrease.

    D. Impact of the project on poverty, income distribution and other distributional impacts

19.      The service delivery at the local decentralized level under the DILS project increased access to
health, education and social services at the local level, targeting the poor and vulnerable groups. With
relatively high levels of poverty among the children and youth, at about 50 percent and about ten times the
national average at the Roma level, the project, through targeted delivery of social services at the local level
and among vulnerable groups had significant impact on poverty and social outcomes.

20.      The decentralization and targeting of local decentralized institutions under the DILS project
facilitated targeted support in health, education and social services to households and vulnerable groups at
the local level. The decentralization improved efficiency and targeting of poor and low-income groups and
regions. Access to public pre-school education increased from 41.5 percent in 2003. Similarly, the project
significantly increased access to pre-school education among poor children in the project area from 15.9
percent before the implementation of the project. The DILS project supported reforms to improve access
and quality of pre-school and secondary education by: (i) improving the equity in the allocation of funding;
                                                      53 
                                                        
 
(ii) increasing local control over the allocation of resources- by providing block grants on a capitation basis
and allowing school directors to allocate funds among different economic categories of expenditure on the
basis of local priorities; and (iii) encouraging network rationalization.

21.     In conclusion, the DILS project provided improved access to health and health services at the local
level. As evidenced in the economics literature improved health and education services and safety nets
improved human capital, which in turn had significant impact on poverty in the project area. These impacts
will continue through in the long run through better health, education and thus improved productivity of
human capital among the youth and adults. The project also accelerated the pace of decentralization in
delivery of health, education and social services.

Subject: IBRD “Delivery of Improved Local Services” – Final Report on Implementation and Results


        Dear Sir/Madam,
        The Loan Agreement (“Delivery of Improved Local Services” Project) between the Republic of
Serbia and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in the amount of EUR 32,000,000
was signed on April 11, 2008. The National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia passed the Law on
Confirming the Loan Agreement (“Delivery of Improved Local Services” Project) between the Republic of
Serbia and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development that was published in the “Official
Gazette of the Republic of Serbia – International Agreements”, number 121/08.
        The project “Delivery of Improved Local Services” (hereinafter referred to as: Project) aimed at
increased capacity of institutional stakeholders on the republic level, level of local government, service
providers from the non-governmental sector, primary health care centers, schools and social work centers
in order to improve access and efficiency, equality and quality of service delivery in the area of health,
education and social protection on the local level in the decentralizing environment.
       The Project was implemented through the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, Science and
Technological Development and Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs. The total
amount of disbursed loan proceeds is EUR 31,838,697 while the amount of EUR 161,303 was cancelled.
        It was established that in the Final Report on Implementation and Results of the Loan (IBRD 75100)
in the amount of EUR 32.0 million (equivalent to USD 46.4 million) for the Republic of Serbia, the project
“Delivery of Improved Local Services” (DILS), in Annex 3, Economic and Financial Analysis, B.
Macroeconomic Growth and Financial Sustainability, the stated data are not up-to-date. With regards to
that, we indicate that it is necessary to correct the stated data along with mentioning the institutions of the
Republic of Serbia as relevant sources of these data. Furthermore, we kindly ask you to state the reasons
                                                        58 
                                                          
 
for unavailability of data from Annex 5: The Results of the Survey among the Beneficiaries, Annex 6: The
Report and Results from the Workshop for Interested Stakeholders and Annex 8: Comments of Co-funders
and Other Partners/Interested Stakeholders.
        Besides the abovementioned, we particularly emphasize that it is unacceptable to show the territory
of the Republic of Serbia on the map at the end of the Report without its integral part –AP Kosovo and
Metohija, since it violates the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia.


                                                                                            Sincerely Yours,
                                                                                             Acting Director

Response from the ICR team:

       The Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development and
the Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veterans and Social Policy have not provided comments to the Draft
ICR.
         In response to the Ministry of Finance comments and request, received on November 4, 2015, the
following changes to the draft ICR have been made: (i) the map has been removed from the Report; and
(ii) Section B (Macroeconomic Growth and Financial Sustainability) of Annex 3, Economic and Financial
Analysis, has been revised in line with the Ministry of Finance’s comments and the sources of the data have
been added. Further, as to the points regarding missing information in Annex 5: The Results of the Survey
among the Beneficiaries, Annex 6: The Report and Results from the Workshop for Interested Stakeholders,
and Annex 8: Comments of Co-founders and Other Partners/Interested Stakeholders, the ICR Team would
like to inform that the Education and Social Protection respective share of the Loan (closed on December
31, 2013) were transferred to the Health sector (which remained active until March 31, 2015) to help
mitigate the damage originating from floods in Serbia. Consequently, the Education and Social Protection
Project Administration Teams (PATs) ceased to exist starting beginning of January 2014 while the Health
PAT was operating under reduced capacity only to ensure successful implementation and monitoring of the
remaining activities. In addition to that, the leadership of all three Ministries changed in March 2014. There
was no consensus among the respective Ministries and no adequate PAT’s capacity to undertake beneficiary
survey nor to organize workshop for stakeholders.

        Annex 11. Revisions to Project Description after Level 2 Project Restructurings


1.      The Project had two Level 2 Project Restructurings that modified its Project Description, the first
on June 26, 2012 and the second on October 30, 2013.

2.       The June 26, 2012 Level 2 Project Restructuring (Section 1.3) modified the Project description to:
(a) better align the Project’s structure with its implementation arrangements and outcomes; (b) add the
design and implementation of communication campaigns and of measures to improve knowledge as
activities and non-consultant services as a disbursement category under Components 1, 2 and 3; (c) add
people with disabilities to the excluded groups targeted by Grants for the development of outreach services;
and (d) correct minor inaccuracies in references to governance and implementation arrangements. The
revised Project description combined Components 3 and 4 into a single component (Table 1) since most
activities under these components were being carried out jointly and contributed to the same results. As
such, the Government faced difficulties in planning and reporting results by components. The merging of
the two components, did not entail any changes to their content, resolved these ambiguities and better
aligned the project structure with implementation arrangements and outcomes. The revised Project
description is presented in detail in Table 2.
        Table 1: Original and Revised Project Components after June 26, 2012 Restructuring
    Original                                          Revised

    Implementation 

3.      The changes to the Project’s structure were two-fold. First, the revised Project description combined
Components 3 and 4 into a single component. The original design assumed that activities defining roles
and responsibilities of actors, strengthening capacities, and enhancing accountability to improve service
quality would be carried out separately for the central and for local governments and produce independent
results. In reality, however, most activities under these components were being carried out jointly and
contributed to the same results. As such, the Government faced difficulties in planning and reporting results
by components. The merging of the two components, which did not entail any changes to their content,
resolved these ambiguities and better aligned the project structure with implementation arrangements and
outcomes. Second, the revised description adopted different names for Components 1 to 3 to better capture
the expected results.

4.      The restructuring also added the design and development of communication campaigns
(Components 1 and 2) and of measures to develop knowledge (Component 3) to the Project description.
The original description envisage the development of information material to improve the knowledge of
citizen’s to safeguard their rights under Component 2. Assessments, however, demonstrated the importance
of broader communication efforts under the revised components as being critical to build and sustain reform
                                                     67 
                                                       
 
momentum, prompting the Government to seek the Bank’s co-financing for this purpose. The introduction
of broader communication activities to the Project description required in turn adding non-consultant
services (defined as printing, reproducing, publishing and disseminating information materials) as an
expenditure category.

5.      The restructuring also added people with disabilities to the excluded groups targeted by Grants for
the development of outreach services. The original description of Component 2 included technical
assistance to reform and evaluate the financing and delivery of services for disabled people, including
Serbia’s Disability Fund. It also included Grants to develop outreach services to excluded groups, explicitly
mentioning Roma, internally displaced persons and refugees---but not people with disabilities. However,
the reform of Serbia’s Disability Fund, supported by the Project, increased access and, thus, demand of
local organizations for Grant funding. Moreover, assessments demonstrated the results of such local
initiatives. Both the increase demand and the demonstrated results prompted the Government to scale up
the Fund’s grant scheme, and to seek Bank financing for it under the Project.

6.      The October 30, 2013 Level II Project Restructuring introduced changes to Component 3 to reflect
the inclusion of Project support to the GoS’ reform on centralized procurement of pharmaceuticals and
efficiency improvement.
