   Local Services (DILS) Project for Serbia were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            a well formulated Results Framework, with outputs leading to\n            intermediate outcomes, leading to outcomes, with baseline\n            data and targets upon completion can facilitate project\n            management and oversight. Disbursement schedules need to\n            take into account the nature of the activities being\n            financed, and the estimated time needed to and cost of\n            implementing each of the activities. The project devoted\n            about one third of its funding to supervision intensive and\n            slow disbursing technical assistance that was required\n            up-front to help define both the policy actions, and more\n            importantly, the grant programs and information systems that\n            were to be financed later. Implementation support identified\n            that these issues with design were impacting the pace of\n            disbursements, but spent an inordinate effort in\n            accelerating disbursements when the issue was structural.\n            Placing a fiduciary coordinating unit in one of the\n            implementing agencies helps to provide some coordination of\n            at least procedural requirements, but can create some\n            tensions among implementing agencies. The financial services\n            unit was housed in the Ministry of Health and the other\n            implementing agencies could voice concern about lack of\n            attention or support to their needs. It would have been\n            preferable to have the coordinating unit in this case housed\n            in a central ministry that was not directly an implementing agency."}, "docdt": "2015-11-24T22:18:05Z"}
