                         The project closing date was extended to September 30, 2014 to allow the continuation of activities under the health sector. Activities under the education and social protection
                         sectors are now completed. The Ministry of Health has prioritized activities which are considered essential for maximizing the achievement of the project development objectives.
                         Most of the Project objectives have been achieved and the remaining one is on track to be achieved before September 30, 2014. The Bank's follow up implementation visit of June
                         2014 has assessed implementation progress of the project ongoing activities which are planned to be completed by the current closing date.
