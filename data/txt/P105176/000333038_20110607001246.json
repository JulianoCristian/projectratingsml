      agricultural population; there are adverse impacts that will\n            emanate from the subproject activities. These subproject\n            impacts include loss of marshland ecosystems and the\n            functions, loss of avifauna habitat, agro chemical pollution\n            of soil and water resources, reduced water flow downstream,\n            water wastage through increased evaporation, loss of\n            domestic water sources, loss of marshland services and\n            products, increased incidences of water borne diseases\n            especially malaria, safety hazards posed by the reservoirs,\n            flooding, emergence of pests and agricultural diseases,\n            reduced production of subsistence crops .All these impacts\n            can be mitigated through a design, management, agronomic\n            practices, policy, capacity building and proper planning.\n            These measures include adopting water saving technologies\n            and management systems, construction of adequate drainage\n            system in the farm, canalization of the drains,  training in\n            efficient irrigation water management, training on\n            precautionary measures required for the handling, labeling\n            and application of agro-chemicals under field conditions,\n            conserving buffer zones to filter pollutant loads from\n            upstream and those leaching from irrigated farms, regulating\n            water abstraction for irrigation and other uses, catchment\n            management especially upstream to control the intensity of\n            the floods, need for a full inventory and assessment of\n            Rwanda wetlands, provision of water points for domestic use,\n            measures to control pathogens and vectors, incorporation of\n            safety measures around the dams, among other measures as\n            described in the Environmental Management Plans of the\n            subprojects. The RSSP subprojects considered in this study\n            are environmentally feasible due to the fact that it targets\n            marshlands that have been traditional developed and degraded\n            aims at rehabilitating these areas. The Pest Management Plan\n            (PMP) will focus on intensification of the five target crops\n            namely, rice, maize, potato, cassava and tomato. These are\n            important crops produced by small scale farmers in their\n            small plots or under cooperative. The major pest problems\n            include mainly diseases and few insect pests and vectors.\n            The PMP will promote the use of integrated pest management\n            (IPM) in insect pest management where possible and safe use\n            of pesticides as a component of IPM approach."}, "docdt": "2010-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
