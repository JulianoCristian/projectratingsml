                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Following on the recommendation of the Project's mid term review (MTR) in October 2010, the Government communicated (February 2011) its decision to close RSSP 2 in advance
                         of its intended closing date of 31 October 2012, due to an early attainment of its PDO and target indicators. Early preparations for a third phase of this adaptable program loan (RSSP
                         3) have therefore begun. In light of its good performance, an in-depth review at the recent MTR, and the likely need for a preparation mission for RSSP 3 in early FY12, a further
                         implementation support mission in late FY11 was not needed. The current ratings for different aspects of implementation reflect the MTR ratings and these will be updated in early
