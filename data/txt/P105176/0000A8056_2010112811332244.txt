                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The midterm review (MTR) found the overall implementation progress of RSSP 2 to be satisfactory at midterm. Safeguards, procurement and finanical management functions are all
                         rated satsifactory at midterm. The MTR notes that the Project is making significant progress towards its targets. Both Project PDO indicators which can be assessed--at least partially
                         --at midterm, show that the Project is fully on track to achieve its PDO. Namely, for the portion of marshland thus far completed, the target of doubling productionhas been achieved.
                         Similarly, the PDO indicator dealing with cooperatives is performing beyond the expected target set for Year 2. Of the two (out of three) Component 2 intermediate outcome indicators
                         that can be measured at midterm, the indicator on business development has exceeded its midterm target, while that on seed production has already surpassed its end-of-Project

                         end-of-Project targets for marshland and hillside development will be met--perhaps evenahead of schedule. The economic and financial analysis of the Project was updated at

                         increased from 34%to59%, driven by the Project's success in raising rice yields for marshlands and in improving yields and prices obtained on hillsides through farmer training and
                         post-harvest storage and marketing.
