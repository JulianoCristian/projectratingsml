Introduction

The Government of Rwanda (GoR) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal
Resources (MINAGRI) is implementing Land-husbandry, Water-harvesting and
Hillside-irrigation Project (LWH) which is dealing with comprehensive watershed
management, water-harvesting in valley dams for hillside-irrigation and
horticultural development by producing and commercializing high value fruit and
vegetable crops in irrigated command areas.
One of the Project sub-components is the implementation of sustainable land-
husbandry measures for hillside agriculture intensification. These measures include
mainly radical/bench terraces, grass strip and trash line, cut off drain and
waterways, liming and compost application, tree planting and gully reshaping which
are expected to create favorable conditions for sustainable hillside agriculture
intensification. The Land husbandry activities will therefore allow the increase of
crop production and ensure food security in project site and increase the source of
income for the farmers.

During preliminary land husbandry works within the project sites, some project
beneficiaries were economically disturbed by temporary loss of their seasonal, annual
and biannual crops on the site. There was no physical resettlement of PAPs during
these preliminary works. In order to mitigate the negative impact related to the land-
husbandry works, in consultation with the project beneficiaries, the livelihood
restoration Process Framework has been developed in early stage of the land
husbandry works in order to ensure that their livelihoods are kept at least to their
pre-project level in accordance to the World Bank social safeguard policy. It was
agreed with the Project Affected People (PAPs), local authorities and the Bank that
the income restoration process will be through participating in the Cash for Work
program.

Implementation progress and monitoring by 30th November 2011.

In all the four sites where the project is being implemented, the income restoration
process in one site ( Karoni -12) has been completed with 2010.

The socio-economic survey conducted at the beginning of the project revealed that a
total of 712 PAPs in the remaining three sites would lose potential income from their
crops evaluated at a total amount of 24,740, 660 Rwf , as described here in the table
below:

                      Total 712                      24,920,660
Since January, 2011 the project has started the land husbandry works in the above
mentioned sites and the PAPs were the first to get jobs in the land husbandry works
as agreed in the livelihood restoration Process Framework.

Up to end of December 2011, cash for work amounting to a total of 59,150,940 Rwf
was paid to 549 PAPs engaged in cash for work in all the three sites, representing
242.2.1 % progress in completion of the total income restoration. The table below
presents the progress by site:

In order to ensure the good implementation of this process framework, field staff
carry out regular monitoring by cross checking the payment lists compiled by the
land husbandry implementation company and each person engaged in land
husbandry works is informed about his wage before the lists are submitted to the
project for payment. After the payment, the Monitoring and Evaluation Assistant
crosschecks again if there are no discrepancies in the payments for subsequent action.
This monitoring system helps in avoiding potential inconsistence in the cash for work
payment due to some typing error which may occur during manpower records.

Framework by end of December, 2011.
