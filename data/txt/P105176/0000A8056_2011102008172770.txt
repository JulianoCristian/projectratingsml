                         Implementation Status Overview
                         RSSP continues to have a very robust performance. On the production side, yields in the areas that have already been rehabilitated or developed by the Project have at least
                         doubled, with rice yields going from 3t/ha to more that 6t/ha. The capacity of cooperatives supported by the Project also shows strong improvements with 35 cooperatives increasing
                         their revenue by at least 50% , surpassing the project-end target of 20 cooperatives. In addition, the number of cooperatives marketing certified maize or potato seeds has risen to 19,
                         surpassing the original target of 9 cooperatives. Indicators that are linked to the completion of marshlands and hillsides are fully expected to show positive results once all works are
                         completed. Overall implementation progress (OIP) of RSSP2 is rated as Satisfactory.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         RSSP2 will be completed successfully and earlier than scheduled. Preparation for RSSP 3 has therefore begun. A project preparation fund (PPF) will be requested by the
                         Government of Rwanda to undertake necessary technical studies for RSSP 3. The Project will proceed with the preparation of a merged implementation unit with the hillside project
                         (Land Husbandry, Water Harvesting, and Hillside Irrigation, LWH).

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
