          outcomes were highly satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was highly satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: The strong, demonstrated commitment of\n            government at various levels, and effective mechanisms to\n            sustain that commitment, are vital for success and essential\n            to embark on a scaling up phase. Close implementation\n            support by the Bank and sector was invaluable for resolving\n            implementation challenges. The marshland investment model\n            developed in RSSP offers a basic framework for replication\n            throughout Rwanda. The model has been the basis for new\n            policies and institutions throughout the sector. Approaches\n            that enhance farmers' business skills, promote value\n            chains, and link farmers to financial institutions provide\n            inclusive, sustainable benefits. RSSP 2 demonstrates the\n            wisdom of continuity in the financing mechanism and\n            implementation teams. A programmatic approach (financing\n            mechanism) is advantageous to consolidate, scale up, and\n            sustain project benefits from a previous phase, while\n            ensuring clear criteria and initiatives for new\n            interventions. Water User Associations (WUAs) should be\n            established and strengthened at the start of irrigation\n            works. Instead of working with multiple hillside\n            cooperatives spread throughout the country, RSSP 3 is\n            adopting a more targeted and approach of establishing and\n            strengthening cooperatives on the hillsides that surround\n            RSSP 3 marshlands."}, "docdt": "2013-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
