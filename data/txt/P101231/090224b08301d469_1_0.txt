The core evaluation team consisted of Zeljko Bogetic, lead economist and task manager,
Moritz Piatti, evaluation officer, IEGPS2, and Alastair Sussock, consultant based in
Uganda. Mark Sundberg, Manager, IEGPS2 and Nick York, Acting Director, IEGPS
provided managerial guidance and invaluable advice.

The evaluation benefitted from the broader context and insights from a parallel, joint
IEG-EC evaluation of the Uganda joint budget support by all donors during the period
2004-13. This joint report was also led by the PPAR team with Zeljko Bogetic leading
the joint team. Notwithstanding the synergies, the two report are separate and
complementary. While the PPAR report focuses on the standard PPAR evaluation of the
Bank’s PRSCs, the joint budget support report, by design, treats all budget support by all
donors as one large financing, coordinating, and reform and results product.

Invaluable support from the World Bank’s country office and staff is gratefully
acknowledged, especially from Ahmadou Mustapha Ndiaye, former country manager;
Christina Malmberg Calvo, current country manager; Jean-Pascal Nganou, senior
economist; Anton Dobronogov, senior economist; Barbara Magezi, senior public sector
specialist, and Harriet Kiwanuka, program assistant, and other Bank specialists, is greatly
acknowledged.

The team would like to express special thanks to the government of Uganda represented
by Keith Muhakanizi, Permanent Secretary/Secretary to the Treasury, Ministry of
Finance, Planning, and Economic Development (MoFPED); Lawrence Kiiza, Director
Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development
(MoFPED); Ms. Maris Wanyera (Commissioner, Aid Liaison Department, MoFPED);
Isaac Impoza (Director, Cash and Debt Management, Ministry of Finance, Planning, and
Economic Development (MoFPED); Albert Byamugisha, Commissioner, Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E), Office of the Prime Minister (OPM); and Timothy Lubanga,
Assistant Commissioner Monitoring and Evaluation (M&C), Office of the Prime Minister
(OPM). The EU Delegation in Kampala provided kind and extensive support and a forum
for constructive discussions in Kampala in the course of this evaluation. Special thanks
go to Kristian Schmidt, Head of the EU Delegation in Uganda; Theo Hoorntje, Head of
Cooperation; and Stephan Lock, Thomas Millar, and Cybille Schmidt, Heads of Sections;
as well as David Rider-Smith (DfID); and Tim Williamson, Research Associate, Center
for Aid and Public Expenditures for their kind advice, support and productive
discussions. The team thanks all the government agencies and representatives of the
research community and civil society that are too numerous to mention (see Annex C).

The team would also like to express appreciation for the very valuable advice,
discussions, and inputs received in the course of the preparation of this PPAR, from
Juergen Lovacz and Federica Petrucci (Managers, EC evaluation unit), Enzo Caputo,
Camilla Valmarana, Tino Smail, Ann Bartolomew, Bjorn Eckman, and Clarissa Moulders
(all Particip GmBH, consultants to the EC on the joint budget support evaluation to
Uganda (see below)). Special thanks also go to Bahar Salimova, Lauren Kelley, Kathryn
Steingraber, Elena Bardasi (IEGPS2) for their kind support and advice regarding the
                                           viii


design of the surveys of joint budget support, and Pia Schneider and Erik Bloom
(IEGPS2) on an early analysis of health and education.

The evaluation was carried during the period November 2014 to April 2015. This
included a two week mission in November 2014 during which the team held extensive
discussions and consultations with the development stakeholders, including main
government agencies, donors (EC, DFID, Ireland, and others), and representatives of the
civil society. The team also made field visits to secondary towns to collect new data and
discuss relevant issues with service providers in local government administration, public
financial management, education and health.

      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, and Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to
which the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s
objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency
is the extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of
capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to
adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory,
Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This Project Performance Assessment Report evaluates two series of PRSCs to Uganda,
PRSC5-7 and PRSC8-9, which were approved and closed during the periods January
2006 to November 2009 (PRSC5-7) and September 2010 – June 2013 (PRSC8-9)
respectively. The overarching objective of the first series was to support the
implementation of the government’s third Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). The
two objectives of the second series were improved access to, and greater value for money
in, public services. The total amount disbursed for the first PRSC5-7 series was $462
million ($137 million for PRSC5, $125 for PRSC6, and $200 million for PRSC7).
PRSC5 was approved on January 17, 2006 and PRSC7, the last in the series, closed on
November 30, 2009. The amount disbursed for the second PRSC8-9 series was $200
million ($100 million each operation). Because of delays in reform implementation and a
corruption scandal involving diversion of bilateral donor resources, approval of PRSC9
was delayed. In this context, in 2013, the Bank decided not to continue the series with the
originally planned PRSC10.

This report presents findings based on a review of the Project Appraisal Documents, the
Implementation Completion and Results Reports, Implementation Completion and
Results Reviews, aides-memoires, IMF and World Bank reports, and other relevant
materials. An IEG mission visited Uganda between November 1-14, 2014 to interview
government officials, the staff of non-governmental organizations, project staff, donor
representatives, and other stakeholders (see Annex C for list of persons interviewed). The
mission also visited and interviewed officials in two provinces. Bank staff members,
donor representatives, and other information providers were also interviewed at
headquarters and by telephone. This work was carried out in parallel with, and benefited
from, the joint IEG-EC evaluation of joint budget support by all donors to Uganda during
the period 2004-13 (IEG-EC, 2015).

The assessment aims to verify whether the operations achieved their intended outcomes.
The report provides additional evidence and analysis of relevant and comparative data for
a more complete picture of the outcomes and factors that influenced them. By covering
the period between 2006 and 2013, it offers an opportunity for broader lessons and a
longer time perspective, as well as reflection on the evolution of the Bank support and
long-term factors that drove outcomes. Finally, the report draws lessons that are intended
to inform future operations of this nature in Uganda and other low-income countries.

Following standard IEG procedures, a copy of the draft Project Performance Assessment
Report (PPAR) was sent to the Borrower for comments. No comments were received.

Summary
This Project Performance Assessment Report evaluates five PRSC operations clustered in
two series of PRSCs to Uganda, PRSC5-7 and PRSC8-9. The operations were approved
and closed during the periods January 2006 to November 2009 (PRSC5-7) and
September 2010 – June 2013 (PRSC8-9), respectively.

The evaluation benefitted from the broader context and insights from a parallel, joint
IEG-EC evaluation of the Uganda joint budget support by all donors during the period
2004-13. This joint report was also led by the PPAR team. The synergies
notwithstanding, the two report are separate and complementary. While the joint budget
support report, by design, treats all budget support by all donors as one large financing,
coordinating, and reform and results product, the PPAR provides standard IEG
assessment using IEG objectives based methodology focused on the specific objectives
under the World Bank supported programs.

The longer-term perspective that this PPAR takes is part of the IEG effort to gain greater
insights into the impact of budget support in countries with significant levels and duration
of development policy operations (DPO) support.

Four specific issues during the decade 2004-13 are important in understanding the
broader development context and background, relevant for this assessment.

First, economic and social outcomes, overall, show substantial gains in income growth
and poverty reduction and access to basic public services. But these gains are
increasingly under threat because of weakening growth since 2009, slowing poverty
reduction, low domestic revenue mobilization, and high population growth in the context
of low agricultural productivity.

Second, Uganda had built––through previous PRCS and donor engagement––a sound and
extensive development planning framework around the Poverty Eradication Action Plan
and National Development Plan. Donors, including the Bank through PRSCs, have
provided coordinated, substantial support to the government’s priorities through the Joint
Budget Support Framework (JBSF). There was considerable mutual trust between the
donors and the government, reflected in large budget support levels, until about 2007/8
(IEG-EC 2015).

Third, sometime during the period of the first series under evaluation, PRSC5-7 (2006-
09), the government’s priorities shifted from the elimination of extreme poverty towards
the productive sectors and infrastructure (IEG-EC 2015). This led to a gradual change in
emphasis from the priorities of bilateral donors, who continued to support the social
sectors and emphasize poverty-related issues. As a result of a confluence of factors
including somewhat diverging government’s and donors’ priorities, some corruption
episodes, and the much tighter budget environment for donor governments, Uganda faced
substantially reduced volumes of budget support in recent years. However, the Bank
supported this shift in government’s priorities based on considerable analytical work
(World Bank 2007) and the Bank strategy, which supported infrastructure primarily
through investment projects.

Fourth, the low domestic revenue mobilization throughout the period of assessment has
resulted in pressures on public expenditures, including for basic social services. This has
been complicated by the policy of proliferation of districts without corresponding
increase in local revenue and implementation capacity. These developments threaten to
unwind hard won gains on access to basic social services achieved in previous years.

Against this backdrop, the PRSC series were highly aligned to the government’s
priorities and designed to support the government’s Poverty Eradication Action Plan
(PEAP) and the subsequent National Development Plan (NDP). The Bank played a key
role in donor coordination and harmonization, which resulted in 2008 in the Joint Budget
Support Framework (JBSF) bringing together all budget support donors under a single
donor umbrella and monitoring and assessment framework. The implementation was
annually assessed and monitored through the Joint Assessment Framework (JAF).

On the positive side, the PRSCs helped finance Uganda’s budget within this broader
budget support framework and shared priorities, contributing to macroeconomic stability
and to maintaining public spending on basic social services (education, health, and water
and sanitation) that otherwise would not have been possible given the low domestic
revenue mobilization. The Bank also maintained broad and high-level policy dialogue
with the government. The PRSCs also benefitted from considerable analytical work
focused on growth and public expenditures, which informed the design of both series.
And PRSCs supported institutional strengthening in the areas of public financial
management, and upstream governance institutions and contributed to some gains in
access to education and health, and, especially, sector policy dialogue, institutions, and
access to water and sanitation services.

But in their drive to extend budget support focused primarily on social sector
expenditures, the Bank and the other budget support donors missed a major opportunity
to help significantly increase domestic revenue mobilization, which would have made
these gains more sustainable. In the event, as the donor budget support began to decline
in 2009 and then came to an abrupt halt in 2012 as a result of a corruption episode with
bilateral donor funds, low domestic government revenues––at 13 percent of GDP––
increasingly put pressure on public expenditures on basic social services. As a result,
these services became underfunded and outcomes began to suffer in education and,
especially, health. Even in water and sanitation––a comparative sector success story––
acute underfunding is threatening to reverse past gains in access, especially in the most
vulnerable rural areas. Also, despite policy announcements towards a greater role for
women, there remain significant gender inequities in access and quality of basic social
services and other gender indicators. The government’s policy of proliferation of districts
without corresponding increases in local revenue base and capacity undermined service
delivery.

The reasons behind these developments were complex and intertwined. Clearly
contributing was the policy of low revenue mobilization, which is a result of extensive
tax exemptions to the private sector, patronage, and vested interests as well a culture of
non-compliance. The prospect of oil revenues in the future may have weakened
incentives to broaden the tax base and increase revenues today. But the donors’ and the
Bank’s substantial budget support which was extended without hard conditionality to
                                           xvii


increase government revenues also contributed to low revenues and attendant pressures
on social expenditures and outcomes. At the same time, rapid population growth––among
the highest in the world––has continued to fuel demand for basic services. Weak local
capacity and local revenue base, which did not receive sufficient attention in the policy
frameworks, undermined local service delivery and results.

For reasons elaborated below, the design and results of PRSC5-7 fell short of
expectations. But the Bank has learned and incorporated important lessons from the
PRSC5-7 series into the PRSC8-9. This learning from the past has been a key
distinguishing feature between the two series. As a result, PRSC8-9 featured better design
and outcomes, even though the overall environment for budget support, and the relations
with the donors, became more difficult.

Against this broad overview, the following is the summary of the main conclusions of the
PPAR assessment with respect to its key components: relevance of objectives and design,
achievement, the Bank’s and the borrower’s performance, and M&E.

The overarching objective of the first series PRSC5-7––to support the implementation of
the government’s third Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP)––is too broad and
general to permit evaluation. Ten specific objectives are derived from the PRSC7 policy
matrices: (i) reducing the fiscal deficit; (ii) increasing private competitiveness by
reducing the cost of doing business and improving the financial sector; (iii) increasing
agricultural production and efficiency by improving resource allocation, improving
supply and security of water, and improved marketing information to farmers; (iv)
strengthening public financial management and procurement at central and local
government level; (v) reducing corruption; (vi) improved public sector performance
through better use of public service workers and pension reform and improved
management (vii) strengthening local government system for service delivery; (viii) a
better educated society; (ix) healthier Ugandans; and (x) improved access to safe water
and sanitation. The objectives of the second PRSC8-9 series––improved access to, and
greater value for money in, public services––were pursued through a cluster of reforms in
public expenditure management, public financial management and public service
management that improve service delivery (cluster 1) and health, education, water and
sanitation, and roads transport (cluster 2).

The relevance of objectives was substantial for the first series and high for the second.
Objectives were closely aligned with the Bank’s strategic documents at closure.
Considerable analytical work informed formulation of objectives and design of both
series, especially the Uganda Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) of 2007 and the
Uganda Public Expenditure Review (PER) of the same year.

Relevance of design of the first series PRSC5-7 is rated negligible. The ten specific
objectives covered too many sectors and were too numerous. The results framework was
weak because many indicators were qualitative and difficult to evaluate and relate to
objectives. PRSC8-9 design is rated substantial. The program documents demonstrate
learning from past experience. Prior actions and results indicators were fewer, more
concrete, and better aligned with program objectives.
                                           xviii


Achievement of objectives of the first PRSC5-7 series was modest. It was adversely
affected by design weaknesses. Assessment by each of ten specific objectives show
significant shortcomings in each policy area. For example, regarding the objective of
reducing the fiscal deficit, there are no corresponding, credible policy actions other than
the execution of the budget. Also, despite the low revenue-to-GDP ratio of 12 percent, no
actions were proposed on the revenue side. The human development objectives of a better
educated society, healthier Ugandans, and improved access to safe water and sanitation,
are too general and neither they nor related policy actions establish a concrete, credible
chain of attribution.

Achievement of the first objective of PRSC8-9––improved access to public services is
rated modest. Gains were made in access to health, education, and water and sanitation,
and can be attributed to the series. But these gains in access were hampered by
underfunding of basic services in the context of reduced overall aid flows and low
domestic revenue mobilization. Achievement of the second objective––greater value for
money in public services––is rated substantial. Achievements were made in the areas of
budget credibility, public financial management (PFM), procurement and audits,
upstream governance and accountability, and strengthening local government systems,
although less so in public sector management.

Bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory for the PRSC5-7 series because of
significant shortcomings in quality at entry, including inadequate design and project
preparation. These factors outweigh strong policy dialogue and coordination and
harmonization with other development partners within the context of the Joint Budget
Support (JBSF) framework. In the PRSC8-9 series, Bank performance is rated
moderately satisfactory. The lessons from the previous series had been learned. There
was greater achievement of objectives despite a difficult economic environment,
deteriorating donor relations (reflected in declining aid levels), and the cancellation of
PRSC10.

Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory for the first series but
moderately satisfactory for the second. During the first series, the government performed
broadly well on macroeconomic policies, public financial management and strengthening
of upstream governance and accountability institutions, and on some metrics of access in
education and water and sanitation. But this was outweighed by large and destabilizing
supplemental budgets, especially during pre-election periods, which undermined
credibility and worsened the composition of public expenditure, thereby compromising
service delivery. The government pursued a policy of district proliferation and post-
primary education expansion without adequate local capacity building, or the institutional
and budgetary resources required for such initiatives. Moreover, development partners
were not consulted. For the second PRSC8-9 series, the government performed better in a
difficult economic and donor relations environment.

The M&E framework in the PERC5-7 series was weak, and essentially non-existent in
the first operation (PRSC5). It was rated negligible. Objectives were too numerous and
vague. The choice of indicators was poor––often qualitative––and did not permit
measurement of progress towards the achievement of objectives. Baseline values were
frequently missing. The second PRSC series featured a better M&E framework, closely
                                           xix


related to the National Development Plan (NDP). It was rated substantial. It was part of
an intensively negotiated donors’ annual Joint Assessment Framework (JAF), which had
government, Bank and other development partner buy-in. It featured much clearer
objectives, prior actions and indicators and better linkages among them.

Lessons

      Six main lessons emerge from this assessment.
      Lack of clear, concrete objectives impedes both implementation and evaluation of
       DPOs. Framing objectives in terms of broad support of government policies (as in
       PRSC5-7) is best avoided.
      Focus and selectivity in policy areas is critical to DPO implementation and
       outcomes. The Bank, the donors, and the government have jointly adopted an
       overly ambitious and extensive policy agenda under the PRSC5-7, which diluted
       focus and undermined effectiveness in implementation.
      Adequate consideration of political economy factors in the design of major
       reforms are essential requisites of the design of a successful DPO series. For
       example, the failure to increase revenue mobilization over a long period of time
       was directly related to the political economy of political patronage and large,
       entrenched tax exemptions and culture of non-compliance. Another example is
       the relatively strong upstream governance institutions but weak enforcement,
       including for offenses by government officials. Lack of policy focus on these
       areas undermined the quality of PRSC design and their implementation and
       outcomes.
      Pressures to extend budget support within the broader donor support framework
       without hard conditionality to raise domestic revenues can undermine incentives
       for domestic revenue mobilization. This, in turn, can undercut macroeconomic
       adjustment needed for sustainable fiscal policy as well as the adequacy of funding
       for basic services.
      Implementation and evaluation are also facilitated when objectives are tightly
       linked to prior actions and there is a measurable and relevant results framework,
       with unambiguous outcome indicators and targets incorporating an explicit and
       convincing theory of change.
      DPOs strongly benefit from active incorporation of lessons from the past
       operations and from knowledge products (such as CEMs and PERs).

1. Background
         Four issues during the decade 2004-13 are important in understanding the broader
development context relevant for this assessment: (i) the longer-term evolution of
economic and social outcomes, (ii) Uganda’s development planning framework and the
shift in government priorities, (iii) donor relations, and the reduced volumes of donor
budget support in recent years, and (iv) the government’s failure to significantly increase
government revenues, which led to pressures on basic public services in the context of
reduced aid flows. These issues define the overall environment in which PRSC5-7 and 8-
9 were implemented.

         Uganda experienced average annual economic growth of 7 percent over the 2004-
13 decade, resulting in steady gains in per capita income, despite rapid population growth
(3.3 percent per year). Poverty was reduced, although poverty and vulnerability remain
high. Access to basic education, health, and water and sanitation increased, especially in
the first part of this period. Since 2009, however, growth has declined to an annual
average of 5.9 percent. Domestic revenue mobilization, at about 13 percent of GDP,
remains low despite declining external support. There is a danger that hard-won gains in
poverty reduction and service delivery may be lost.

        The framework that guided policy between 1998 and 2010 has been the Poverty
Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). In 2010, policy changed when the Government
developed an ambitious new vision for the development of the country, aiming to achieve
middle-income status within 30 years. The National Development Plan 2010-2015 entails
a significant shift in emphasis towards economic infrastructure, linked to the discovery of
oil, gas and minerals. Social services, which were the long-standing focus of the
Government’s policies and external donor support, assumed a lesser priority.

        Uganda has traditionally received large amounts of international aid in the form of
budget support. Since 2008, this aid was coordinated and harmonized within the Joint
Budget Support (JBS) Framework, of which the Bank’s PRSCs were a key part. Of the
twelve budget partners, the World Bank was the biggest contributor followed by the
United Kingdom (UK) and the European Union (EU). The PRSC5-7 and 8-9—subject of
this assessment––provided a combined total of $662 million during this period. However,
donor budget support decreased substantially from a high of almost US$700million in
FY06/07 to well below US$100 million as of FY12/13. Several corruption episodes had
eroded mutual trust and the Government’s policy priorities after 2010 diverged from
those of many donors. The World Bank was one of the few external partners to align its
strategy to the Government’s by financing infrastructure while providing reduced
volumes of budget support.

2. Poverty Reduction Support Credit 5 -7
Relevance
Objectives

        The overarching objective of the first series PRSC5-7 -- to support the
implementation of the government’s third Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) – is
too broad to permit evaluation. For evaluation purposes, ten objectives were derived from
the policy matrices: (i) reducing the fiscal deficit; (ii) increasing private competitiveness
by reducing the cost of doing business and improving the financial sector; (iii) increasing
agricultural production and efficiency by improving resource allocation, improving
supply and security of water, and improved marketing information to farmers; (iv)
strengthening public financial management and procurement at central and local
government level; (v) reducing corruption; (vi) improved public sector performance
through better use of public service workers and pension reform and improved
management (vii) strengthening local government system for service delivery; (viii) a
better educated society; (ix) healthier Ugandans; and (x) improved access to safe water
and sanitation.

       Relevance of objectives is rated Substantial. The ten key engagement areas
correspond to the PEAP pillars of economic management and to the theme of “growth,
employment, and socio-economic transformation for prosperity” in the National
Development Plan (NDP pp.38).

       Unsurprisingly given their breadth, the objectives were highly relevant to country
conditions. The objectives were also substantially relevant to the Bank strategy. The
FY06-09 CAS had a joint part (with other donors) and Bank Group-specific part joint
with the IFC. It was one of the first joint assistance strategies elaborated, and was built
around the same 5 pillars as the PEAP.

Design

       Relevance of design is rated modest. The objectives, spread across ten sectors,
were too broad, too numerous, and over-ambitious.

        The ten specific objectives that were derived from the policy matrices covered too
many sectors and were too numerous. As a result, the design was overly complex.
Further, the results framework, and logical chain linking policy areas, and prior actions to
the outcomes is weak, and indicators do not adequately reflect progress against the
objectives (a more substantive discussion of the quality of indicators can be found under
M&E). This is especially the case for PRSC5-6. An attempt was made in PRSC7 to
increase the number and concreteness of actions to ensure a better match with objectives,
but the links remained weak and a larger number of actions in PRSC7 diluted priorities.
Further the quality of prior actions was lacking in terms of the necessary institutional
depth, and measurability.
                                              3


        For example, regarding the reduction of the fiscal deficit, there are no
corresponding, credible policy actions, other than the execution of the budget and the
Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), which are specifically aimed at
achieving the objective of deficit reduction. Despite noting very low revenue-to-GDP
ratio of 12 percent, the Project Document proposes no actions on the revenue side. On the
expenditure side, there are no credible actions for reducing public expenditures,
especially with regard to public administration and security and defense, which had
proved difficult to control. It is unclear whether expenditure led consolidation was
appropriate in the environment of extremely low revenues.

        The policy agenda regarding increased private competitiveness, is vague and
difficult to relate to the intended outcomes. There are, for instance, no actions that would
credibly translate into increased access to credit. Also, in PRSC6, the main prior action is
“make satisfactory progress on agreed key investment climate undertakings identified in
the PEAP.” It is difficult to judge the achievement of this objective in view of ambiguity
on what key investment climate undertakings are and what is deemed “satisfactory
progress”. Finally, it is difficult to discern a clear, concrete, and logical chain of
attribution between the objective of increased competitiveness and the vague actions
across operations in this series. For example, for PRSC6, the Government committed to a
coordinated approach to improve the investment climate, and to make satisfactory
progress on agreed key investment climate undertakings identified in the PEAP.
Similarly, in PRSC7, a prior action reads that the Government prioritized and fulfilled the
key investment climate and competitiveness undertakings identified in the PEAP.

        Prior actions were completed. But questions remain about their strength,
relevance to the objective, their institutional depth, the attribution chain, and the links
between outcome indicators and the objective. The focus of most prior actions was
primarily on upstream and institutional and pre-legislative actions (‘undertakings’) rather
than execution and ultimate completion of reforms. Therefore, the conditionality related
to private sector competitiveness may not have been strong enough to support the
Government in implementing reforms and pushing forward the competitiveness agenda.

         While increasing agricultural production and efficiency is a relevant objective of
critical importance to household incomes and poverty, there are no outcome or
intermediate outcome indicators related to the objective. The same prior action remains
throughout the PRSC series -- “satisfactory implementation of the core undertakings of
the joint plan for modernization of agriculture (PMA) annual review.” Because these
annual reviews cover a range of activities, there is lack of prioritization and selectivity in
the choice of prior actions. In addition, PRSC7, includes the incorporation of findings of
the agricultural public expenditure review into the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal
Industry and Fisheries Strategic Development and Investment Plan (MAAIF-SDIP). This
action, also, is too broad and difficult to assess. PRSC7 features two additional prior
actions, “finalize and submit draft water for production policy,” and “prepare sustainable
market information systems framework.” However, there were no corresponding
indicators or targets related to these actions.

       On strengthening public financial management (PFM) and procurement at central
and local level there are a number of concrete and relevant actions geared towards
                                               4


improving public financial management (e.g., improving budget reporting, payroll audits,
a public procurement law, and organizational structure for the Accountant General’s
office enabling implementation of an Integrated Financial Management Information
System). These actions are well designed, contribute to the PFM reform agenda, and
relate to the objectives.

        On reducing corruption, the program includes important actions on the upstream
side of the accountability chain. Examples include “the satisfactory implementation of
undertakings agreed by the joint government development partners’ review of the
national anti-corruption action plan“, “preparation of the audit bill”, and “having the bill
ready for cabinet”. The design of prior actions, such as “the satisfactory implementation
of undertakings” was, however, not concrete or measurable. Further, “preparation of the
audit bill”, and “having the bill ready for cabinet” are important steps, but insufficient as
prior actions since they do not require government to present the bill to parliament. There
were few actions addressing the downstream of the accountability chain such as
improved capacity for enforcement of the bill, introduction of more credible penalties,
reduction of the case backlog of Inspectorate General of Government (IGG).

        For the objective improving public sector performance through better use of
public sector workers and pension reform and improved management, PRSC5-7 did not
have any indicators nor results framework. Prior actions were process-type upstream
measures focusing on revisions of documents for public service reform. They also lacked
concreteness and measurability (e.g., satisfactory progress in implementing the new
phase of the Public Service Reform program). Other actions lacked any claim to critical
importance, for example “the submission of an inception report for a study.” Also,
implementing the Public Service Reform Program in PRSC6 and PRSC7 appears, to an
extent, duplicative. This raises questions about relevance and commitment to the
achievement of objectives. There were no actions with respect to the objective of pension
reform.

        Strengthening local government systems for service delivery has featured
throughout all PRSC series in Uganda. However, there are no indicators related to the
objective in the policy matrices, and there are no concrete policy actions in support of this
objective in PRSC5. Actions in PRSC6 are more concrete including “to identify
alternative source of revenue for local government to replace funds from the graduation
tax.1”This abolition took place by presidential decree directly in the context of the
elections without clear economic justification or consultation with the stakeholders. The
prior actions here de facto supported this abolition by focusing on compensatory
measures, and not reversing this measure. The latter could have helped preserve past
gains in fiscal autonomy for local governments as well as their capacity for local service
delivery. The prior action of “satisfactory progress in core undertakings of the Joint

  The graduated tax was a direct tax levied on property, which provided a large share of local
Government revenues (about 60-70 percent). In 2005, however, in the context of pre-election
campaign, the Government abruptly abolished the graduated tax. As no replacement revenues for
local governments were put in place, this substantially inhibited local governments’ ability to
finance recurrent expenditures, including for basic social services.

Annual Review for Decentralization” in PRSC7 is, again, overly vague, not measurable,
and does not hold stakeholders accountable.

        Regarding the human development objectives of a better educated society,
healthier Ugandans, and improved access to safe water and sanitation, the results
chain lacks plausible policy actions. The prior action of “satisfactory implementation of
the sector review” in all three sectors across the series is weak and not conductive to a
credible chain of results. While sector reviews were important mechanism for
government and stakeholder consultation and coordination, the use of their
implementation as prior actions makes the outcome of the series subject to a complex
process of assessment of entire sector policy. As such, they cover a much wider set of
sector activities than those covered by the outcome indicators, which focus only on
primary education or immunization.

Implementation of PRSC5-7

         The PRSC5-7 series was designed to support the Government’s PEAP and thus
finance priority programs for poverty reduction and growth. The PRSCs were set up
under the umbrella of the Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy, and fully adopted the PEAP
objectives and results framework. This PRSC financing modality was chosen as it was
perceived to be the best vehicle for a system-wide reform process addressing crosscutting
institutional issues while supporting the institutions and country systems. In the spirit of
the 2005 Paris Declaration, the PRSC’s were intended to foster the Bank’s flexibility,
alignment with country’s priorities, donor harmonization, resource predictability, and
country ownership.

        The Bank extended these three operations between 2006 and 2009 through a
loan/grant blend program (details on financing and dates is provided in table 1 below).
The implementing agency for all was the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). While
there were no co-financers, budget support was provided in parallel by other development
partners, such as the European Union, the UK’s DfID, and Ireland. As the largest budget
support donor, the Bank played a key role in coordinating with other donors and
harmonizing its strategies and policy agendas. Table 2.1 provides main details on the
dates and financing of the PRSCs5-7.

       There were significant changes in disbursement amounts and tranches. The
financing for PRSC 5 was reduced from US$150 million to 135 million, and PRSC6 was
reduced from US$150 to 125 million in response to problems regarding budget
                                                  6


execution. In particular, the agreed budget ceilings for public administration and defense
spending were repeatedly and significantly overspent, thus breaking the agreed prior
actions. PRSC 7 was originally designed as a single credit operation. But it was later
divided into an exceptional, two-tranche operation, combined with an increase from
US$150 to 200 million in total funding to US$200 million, thereby enabling two separate
tranches of US$100 million each for FY2007/08 and FY2008/09, respectively.2

       There were a number of delays in disbursements related to tardiness in meeting
some prior actions. PRSC7 was not approved by the Government until December of 2008
(the Board date was May 2008). As a result, the US$100 million was not disbursed into
the 2007/08 budget as originally planned but into the next one. Similarly, there were
delays by the Government in submitting the proposed amendments to the Public
Procurement and Disposal Act (PPDA) to Cabinet and the second tranche of PRSC 7 was
consequently released only in September 2009, with almost a year of delay.

        No safeguard policies were triggered by the operation. Based on the evaluation
team’s inspection of prior actions, no adverse distributional effects are anticipated from
policies supported by the PRSC series. Further, the PRSC is not expected to result in
major adverse, or irreversible, environmental impacts.3

Achievement of the Objectives (efficacy)
REDUCTION OF THE FISCAL DEFICIT: NEGLIGIBLE.

        The outcome indicator for this objective was a reduction in the fiscal deficit
(including grants), from 11.3 percent of GDP in 2004/5 to 8.2 percent in 2007/8 (PRSC
policy matrix). This was to be achieved through a budget execution consistent with
allocations (see Annex B for more detail on prior actions). The ICR (2011) reports that
the fiscal deficit fell from 11.3 to 8.5 percent of GDP over the PSRC5-7 period.

       However, there are several issues related to this result. First, the 11.3 percent
baseline was defined in 2004/5; the actual, corrected deficit in 2004/5 was 8.5 percent of
GDP (IMF Article IV consultations). The use of a baseline 3 percentage points of GDP




2
  The Bank’s reasoning behind this change, based on the staff interviews, was the following: (i)
this would facilitate budget planning for FY2008/09 by improving the predictability of PRSC
resources, and align the PRSC better with the new Joint Budget Support Framework (JBSF); and
(ii) a two-tranche operation of US$100 million each rather than the previous US$150 million of
annual support allowed the Bank to signal more clearly its discontent with relatively weak
performance in public expenditure targets and a delay of the amendment of the Public
Procurement and Disposal of Assets (PPDA) Act.
3
  This is in part due to the elusive nature of some of the prior actions such as satisfactory progress
of the actions agreed in the join sector review. While institutional reforms to facilitate land titles
as a means to strengthen the investment climate, and increased agricultural production (including
fish exports) constitute a moderate risk no evidence of such surfaced during the field mission.
                                              7


higher than the actual deficit appears to be due to reliance on the PEAP monitoring
matrix as a source.

         Second, the actual deficit in FY08, according to the Article IV consultations, was
7.7 percent of GDP, an improvement of 0.8 percentage points over FY05. The pace of
deficit reduction was, therefore, modest. Other fiscal measures show a clear deterioration.
As grants decreased, the fiscal deficit including grants increased from 0.6 to 4.9 percent
GDP. The primary deficit (excluding debt servicing payments) increased from 2.1 to 6
percent of GDP. Thus little, if any, fiscal consolidation was achieved during the program
period.

        Third, budget execution was not consistent with allocations (a prior action for
PRSC5-6). While contributions to the Poverty Action Fund were broadly protected and
their execution appeared high, there were expenditure overruns in other areas, especially
on public administration and defense and security. Public administration exceeded
expenditure targets by 13, 18, and 14 percentage points for PRSCs 5, 6, and 7
respectively.
       Fourth, the overall quality of fiscal consolidation was undermined by the low
revenue-to-GDP ratio of about 12 percent of GDP compared to regional peers (see figure
2. 1).

INCREASED PRIVATE SECTOR COMPETITIVENESS. MODEST.

         Prior actions were: (i) strengthening the coordinated approach to improve the
investment climate, and satisfactory progress on agreed key investment climate
undertakings identified in the PEAP, including necessary institutional reforms to
facilitate access of businesses and potential investors, registration, land titles, and courts
(PRSC6); and (ii) (a) prioritization and fulfillment of the key investment climate and
competitiveness undertakings identified in the PEAP, including the approval by the
Cabinet, and submission to the Legislative Assembly of, inter alia, the following draft
bills, the Companies Bill and the Insolvency Bill; and obtained the Cabinet’s approval of
the Policy Paper on Regulations of Pension Reform system; and (b) submission of
evidence that the above undertakings are being implemented.

        The outcome indicators were: i) increased access to credit (PRSC5), and (ii)
increased share of private investment in GDP (PRSC6). No indicator was specified in
PRSC7. The only prior action in PRSC6 was to make satisfactory progress on agreed key
investment climate undertakings identified in the PEAP. PRSC7 required (i) the
Companies Bill and the Insolvency Bill approved by Cabinet and presented to
Parliament; and (ii) the Policy Paper on Pension Reform approved by Cabinet. Prior
actions by policy area are listed in more detail in Annex B.

        Attribution of these indicators to the objective of private sector competitiveness
could be questioned. None of them is a direct or strong correlate of competitiveness.
Access to credit reflects the efficiency and equity of access to the financial sector
services. And an increased share of private investment reflects more cyclical,
macroeconomic factors than longer-term productivity and competitiveness of the private
sector per se.

       The impact of the prior action requiring satisfactory progress on the investment
climate for PRSC 6 cannot be measured. The Companies Bill and Insolvency Bill were
approved by Cabinet, albeit after the PRSC series, and acted as precursors for the
Companies Act of 2012, and Insolvency Act of 2011. Similarly, in 2008, the Cabinet
approved a policy on pension regulation, which eventually came into effect in 2011.

        Access to credit as measured by credit to the private sector as percent of GDP––a
key performance indicator––increased from 7.1 in 2003/4 to 11.8 percent in 2008/9,
exceeding the PRSC5 target of 10.4 percent. Private investment as a percentage of GDP
increased from the baseline of 17 percent of GDP in 2004/5 to 19.1 percent in accordance
with the target of 19 percent in 2008/9. However, as noted in the design section above,
the indicators are only weakly related to the objectives and attribution to the series is
unclear.

        The competitiveness indicators of the Bank’s Doing Business Reports provide a
more comprehensive, and mixed, picture. The time required to start a business, dealing
with construction permits, getting electricity, ease of registering property, getting credit,
protection of minority investors, paying taxes, trade across borders, enforcing contracts
and resolving insolvency are all meaningful dimensions that the PRSC series did not
                                                                               10


consider. The overall distance to frontier4 has improved only slightly from 48.9 in 2010
to 51.1 in 2015 placing Uganda at rank 150 globally (see figure 2.2). Figures for earlier
years are not available.5 Starting a business has become easier in Uganda over the
evaluation period. The distance to frontier improved from 52.8 in 2005 to 58.3 in 2010.
The number of procedures remained the same at 18, but the number of days required to
set up a business was reduced significantly from 34 to 25. In 2015, Uganda performs
markedly worse than most of its neighboring peers in the ease of starting a business.
Further, Uganda stands 131st in the ranking of 189 economies regarding ease of access to
credit, which is a reflection of poor legal rights of borrowers and lenders, and limited
depth of credit information, and coverage of credit bureau and credit registry. Here,
Uganda performs on par with the SSA average but it lags far behind South Africa and
Rwanda, for example.

         A key achievement under this objective was the establishment of the Credit
Reference Bureau (CRB) in 2009 that provides borrower credit histories to banks, thus
facilitating the lending process. The 2009 Mortgage Act supported the functioning of the
growing real estate market by consolidating the law relating to mortgages; providing for
the creation of mortgages; and providing for the duties of mortgagors and mortgagees

  The distance to frontier score assesses the absolute level of regulatory performance and how it
improves over time. This measure shows the distance which represents the best performance
observed on each of the indicators across all economies. An economy’s distance to frontier is
reflected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents
the frontier. For example, a score of 75 in DB 2014 means an economy was 25 percentage points
away from the frontier constructed from the best performances across all economies and across
time.

  While 2015 is significantly after project closure, it provides insight into Uganda’s performance
relative to its peers. Further, the laws supported under the PRSCs came into effect only in 2011-
2012. The years prior to 2013 would thus not have adequately captured the Bank’s contribution.

(Mortgage Act 2009). However, while the credit bureau was established, the “Getting
Credit” World Bank Doing Business rankings do not show sustained improvement and as
of 2014 Uganda is 125th in the world. This occurred despite credit to the private sector as
a share of GDP increasing from 8.8% in 2006/07 to 11.8% in 2008/09. PRSC-supported
efforts in improving the Doing Business rankings are not evident. There is no clear
explanation of this result in project documents.

INCREASED AND MORE EFFICIENT AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. NEGLIGIBLE.

        There were no outcome indicators associated with this objective. The objective
was to be achieved through prior actions in the areas of resource allocation, supply and
security of water, and improved marketing information to farmers. Details on prior
actions are in Annex B.

        There has been some progress in the policy reform supported by the PRSCs. In
particular, the preparation of the Ministry of Agriculture’s Development Strategy and
Investment Plan progressed. Stakeholders noted that the agriculture sector Public
Expenditure Review informed the budget preparation process by–strengthening the
analytical underpinning of the PRSCs and the strategic alignment of resources. In
addition, in the extensive field interviews and visits, the IEG evaluation team found
anecdotal evidence that the PRSCs contributed to increased awareness and access to
agriculture technology.

        However, support through the PRSC series to the National Agricultural Advisory
Services (NAADS) was largely ineffectual in improving agriculture productivity.
NAADs appears to have been captured by special interest groups, reflecting district-level
political patronage rather than contributing to its original purpose. These challenges
negatively affected the policy dialogue between donors and the Government.

        Land reform objectives were hindered by political tensions and inaction in
Parliament. The adoption of the Water for Production sector policy was continuously
delayed due to challenges in cross-ministerial coordination and lack of clarity regarding
roles and responsibilities. Further, stakeholders noted during the interviews that the lack
of targeted surveys meant a particularly weak evidence base to inform policy.

        Against this backdrop, several broader factors affected sector performance, which
has been weak over the evaluation period. Although the agriculture sector employs a
large proportion of workers (about 66 percent of the population6), it makes up a
relatively small share of GDP (20-25 percent). The services sector has picked up the
slack and increased its share of GDP from 45 to 53 in 2013. Industry continues to make
up about a quarter of total economic activity (figure 2.3).

        While there were increased agriculture and rural expenditure allocations, this did
not lead to sustainable agricultural growth. Initial public expenditure allocations toward
rural infrastructure such as irrigation, feeder roads, bridges, and markets for livestock and
agricultural produce, diminished. There was also lack of support for the enabling
environment for agriculture productivity. Public expenditure for agriculture is
predominantly recurrent in nature, and in the form of subsidized inputs. In the geographic
areas that depend heavily on local-level public service delivery, there remain significant
shortcomings (World Bank 2010).

        Real growth in the agriculture sector has been sluggish over the evaluation period,
and the trend across the sub-sectors is declining. Further, there was substantial
fluctuation, which is particularly important for price sensitive cash crops. Fisheries, in
particular suffered from contraction during the PRSC5-7. Life stock and forestry
remained comparatively stable at about 3 percent. The growth of food crops averaged out
to zero over the ten years. By comparison, industry and services grew substantially faster,
each averaging an impressive 7.5 percent over the same timeframe.

       Importantly, this rate of growth has been below the population growth rate of
about 3.2 percent, implying that per capita agricultural GDP has been declining. It is also
lower than the 6 percent growth target for the agricultural sector set by African
Governments under the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development
Program.7(CAADP).

        In early years of the PRSC5-7, robust growth in agriculture was accompanied by
significant poverty reduction.

STRENGTHENING PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT (PFM) AND PROCUREMENT AT CENTRAL AND LOCAL
LEVELS. SUBSTANTIAL.

        Prior actions included (i) agreement with the donors on MTEF and budget
execution consistent with budget allocation (PRSC5, 6 and 7), (ii) revised Ministry of
Finance draft audit bill (PRSC5), (iii) the audit bill ready for Cabinet (PRSC6), (iv)
satisfactory progress on improvements in public procurement system (PRSC6). These
actions in PRSC5 and 6 were broad, all-encompassing, and initiated important legislative
action and the introduction of IFMIS (PRSC5). PRSC7, by contrast, included more and
more specific measures regarding budget allocations, execution and reporting (e.g.,
Poverty Action Fund expenditures were to be at least 95 percent of approved budget;
limitations on supplementary budget request; mandating quarterly budget execution
reports, and publishing them within 30-day period).

        Since 2004, Uganda has made major improvements in PFM, supported by the
Joint Budget Support framework, which included PRSC support. The Public Finance and
Accountability Act (PFAA) of 2003 and the Budget Act of 2001 provide the legal
platform for the budget formulation process. The Budget Act of 2001 stipulated the
information and timeline of information that the Government is required to present to
parliament and its timeline. The PFAA provides the legal framework for the control and
management of public resources, fiscal transparency, and accountability. Legislation and
supporting circulars are comprehensive, although some ambiguity remains with regard to
the roles and responsibilities in enforcing compliance. Progress has also been made with
regard to budget classification, budget formulation, and minimizing deviations from the
approved budget. An Oracle-based8 Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS) was successfully established. The IEG mission was able to confirm that

Development (NEPAD).

it is currently operating in all central government ministries and budgetary agencies, in
the Office of the Auditor General, as well as in 36 districts and four municipalities.
(Government of Uganda 2012). Consequently, for most of the period under review
(2004/5 to 2009/10), Uganda has been rated above its Sub-Saharan African (SSA) peers
by a number of PFM assessments9.

        However, since 2008/9 political pressures have compromised budget credibility,
as reflected in the deterioration of the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment10 (CPIA) rating on the quality of budgetary and financial management
(figure 2.4), as well as the respective PEFA indicators (Figure 4). Credibility is
undermined by increasing domestic supplier arrears, frequent resorting to supplementary
budgets, and bypassing of internal controls in execution (World Bank 2014).

  The World Bank’s CPIA is a diagnostic tool that assesses and rates the quality of a country's
policies and institutional arrangements each year in all member countries. The assessment feeds
directly into the determination of the volumes of the Bank’s concessional lending.
11
   Quality of budgetary and financial management in the CPIA assesses the extent to which there
is a comprehensive and credible budget linked to policy priorities, effective financial
management systems, and timely and accurate accounting and fiscal reporting, including timely
and audited public accounts.

stable12 in others. Institutional strength in revenue collection and management appears to
have improved due to better management of information on revenue collection and better
management of cash balances. Despite these efforts, however, revenue collection itself
remains at a regional low of about 12 percent of GDP. Cash management and audit
systems have seen modest improvements since 2007. A comparison of the PEFA score
aggregates between 2008 and 2012 is shown in figure 5.

        Cash management was enhanced. By 2008, the average cash management PEFA
score was already quite high with a B and has since improved further to a B+ by 2012.
Even though the series ended in 2009, the PEFA scores in 2012 and 2013 are reported
here as relevant indications of the longer term sustainability of these results. There were
noteworthy achievements in forecasting and monitoring of cash flows, the quality of debt
data management and reporting, and the consolidation of cash balances.

        Slow and unreliable financial transfers from the central government adversely
affected local service delivery. Although commitments on aggregate transfers to a
majority of local government entities were largely met, PEFA assessments provide
evidence that commitments on earmarked grants were not honored.

        The PEFA reviewed PFM in ten local government entities. This is particularly
relevant for the policies regarding medium-term expenditures and budget planning and
execution supported under the series. All ten local governments have adopted multi-year
fiscal planning and budgeting, although predicted expenditures are not always consistent
with budget ceilings. There are four broadly positive findings. First, budget classification
meets international standards in all ten assessed entities. Second, budget information is
reportedly accessible to the public. Third, procurement systems operate adequately.
Fourth, the legal and regulatory framework is transparent, fairly comprehensive and
based on competition. However, there are also a number of shortcomings. First, there is
significant variance between aggregate expenditures and the approved budget, thereby
undermining credibility. Second, arrears are not registered in most local governments and
are not collected in districts or municipalities. Third the availability of funds to meet local
government expenditure commitments is not predictable in any of the 10 local
governments. Fourth, districts do not undertake cash-flow planning, and the information
provided to central budget entities is unreliable. Fifth, fiscal risk oversight remains weak.

       Budget classification meets international standards for practically all of the 10
LGs assessed. This supports comprehensiveness and transparency in Public Finance
Management. On balance, the evaluation for the 10 entities indicates that the budget is
comprehensive and budget information is accessible to the public. However, fiscal risk
oversight remains weak for most entities. Procurement systems operate broadly
adequately for all the 10 LGs. The legal and regulatory framework is transparent, fairly
comprehensive and based on competition.

       Central government financial reporting has significantly improved from 51
percent in 2004 to 99 percent in 2009/10. The passage of the Audit Bill that was prepared
under PRSC5 and 6 significantly strengthened the operational independence of the

Auditor General. Budgetary execution relative to approved budget has been broadly
adequate except during the election years when supplemental budgetary spending tended
to deviate substantially from statutory budgets. At the same time, Poverty Action Fund
expenditures (pro-poor expenditures monitored and tracked by the government in a
virtual fund) tended to be broadly in line with approved budgets.

REDUCING CORRUPTION. SUBSTANTIAL.

        Prior actions for PRSC5 and 6 were (i) implementation of the anti-corruption
action plan (PRSC5 and 6), (ii) asset declarations of Ministers (PRSC5), (iii) Ministry of
Finance draft revised audit bill (PRSC5 and 6), (iv) reducing incidence of corruption, (v)
introducing special anti-corruption courts, (vi) clearing the backlog of cases in the
Inspector Government General (IGG) office (PRSC6), (vii) satisfactory implementation
of the national anti-corruption plan (PRSC7). Most prior actions were achieved although
this achievement in some cases was more in terms of process than of outcomes (e.g.,
progress with drafting terms of reference for an anti-corruption court).

         There were important gains in the quality of legislation, action plans, policy
dialogue, and upstream accountability institutions––and PRSC5-7 contributed to those
gains––but significant gaps remain in implementation and enforcement. On the positive
side, Uganda has some of the strongest practice anti-corruption laws in the world scoring
99 out of 100 on the global integrity scale. Also, some of the upstream governance
institutions such as Inspector General and Auditor General are making major
contributions to anti-corruption efforts.

        Prior to 2008, Uganda performed consistently better than the IDA-eligible Sub-
Saharan average. However, the CPIA ratings of the quality of policies and institutions
regarding transparency, accountability, and corruption in the public sector13 have
deteriorated since then.14 Uganda scored well below the Sub-Saharan average in 2012
(figure 2.6). This is largely attributable to a number of high-profile corruption incidents,
including the embezzlement of donor funds, poor follow up in prosecution and
indictment, and the relative lack of civil society engagement in governance processes.




13
  Transparency, accountability, and corruption in the public sector assess the extent to which the
executive can be held accountable for its use of funds and for the results of its actions by the
electorate and by the legislature and judiciary, and the extent to which public employees within
the executive are required to account for administrative decisions, use of resources, and results
obtained. The three main dimensions assessed here are the accountability of the executive to
oversight institutions and of public employees for their performance, access of civil society to
information on public affairs, and state capture by narrow vested interests.
14
  It should be noted that PEFA assessments are carried out every four years and, therefore, do not
capture the year-to-year variations in the quality of PFM between PEFA assessments. By
contrast, CPIA ratings on budgetary transparency, financial measurement, and accountability
measure somewhat overlapping aspects of institutional and policy performance and are carried
our each year.

         PRSC funding, institutional and technical assistance, in support of the
development of key accountability institutions, especially Office of the Auditor General
(OAG), Inspector General (IGG), has contributed to their strengthening and capacity and
institution building. This is evidenced by consistent responses to extensive field
discussions and interviews with key stakeholders and staff of these offices. The Auditor
General’s office, in particular, has been a driving force uncovering several corruption
cases, including the diversion of the bilateral donor project funds in 2012, which resulted
in the temporary secession of all aid. This is precisely the role that this Office is expected
to play in a strong system of governance and accountability.

        Performance matrices––in particular the High Level Action Matrix agreed
between the donors and the Government in order to restart the broad dialogue on budget
support––regarding governance were important in helping organize the dialogue around
specific indicators and in monitoring implementation. The High Level Action Matrix in
2012-13 helped refocus capacity building efforts for the office of the auditor and
inspectorate general. These longer term data are provided for a longer-term perspective
on sustainability of results achieved with these important metrics for corruption.
Prosecutions and convictions have increased since 2006, but the latter at a slower pace, so
that there is a growing gap between prosecutions and convictions. While the number of
prosecutions increased more than threefold from 44 in 2006 to 145 in 2013, convictions
rose from 2 in 2006 to 18 in 2013 (see table 2-5).

        The workload of the IGG is heavy with 14,501 cases in 2014 and the number is
increasing. Some 78 percent of these cases are accumulated from the period coinciding
with PRSC5-7. This poses a serious accountability problem. In addition, the time needed
to resolve a case at the end of the PRSC5-7 series was still very long -- in 2010, 54.2
percent of cases took more than 12 months to be resolved.

         Weak enforcement is also suggested by frequent corruption scandals and
comparative perception indicators that place Uganda among the low performing
countries. For example, implementation of laws scores 51 out of 100 on global integrity
scale (Andrews 2013; Global Integrity 2011). Uganda has repeatedly scored poorly in the
Transparency International Corruption Perception Index15, and is ranked 142 out of 175
countries. Its score is in the 21st percentile overall. Placing this into regional context, this
score is on a par with Kenya, but significantly worse than Tanzania, or Rwanda, who are
in the 37th and 71st percentile, respectively. According to the global corruption
barometer (Andrews and Bategeka 2013; Global Integrity 2011), 86 percent of
respondents in Uganda reported to have paid a bribe in 2010. While 58 percent report that
the government’s efforts to fight corruption are effective, two thirds of all respondents
still believe that the level of corruption had increased over the previous three years (2007-
2010). The institution perceived to be most affected by corruption is the police, followed
by the judiciary. Conversely, the media and religious bodies are perceived to be least
corrupt (Transparency International 2014).

IMPROVING PUBLIC SECTOR PERFORMANCE THROUGH BETTER USE OF PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS AND PENSION
REFORM AND IMPROVING MANAGEMENT. NEGLIGIBLE.

       The size of the civil service increased gradually over the period covered by the
PRSC series, while public revenues stagnated, and the composition of public
expenditures and public service delivery outcomes deteriorated. The evidence shows a
decline in public sector performance rather than an enhancement. Major problems,

  The Corruption Perceptions Index (published by Transparency International) ranks countries
and territories based on how corrupt their public sector is perceived to be. A country or territory’s
score indicates the perceived level of public sector corruption on a scale of 0 (highly corrupt) to
100 (very clean).

including “ghost workers” and public sector arrears (including salaries) remained acute
throughout the PRSC5-7 period.

        The PRSC series focused on the reform of public sector pay. However attempting
such reform without tackling public sector employment and in a context of limited fiscal
space was incoherent. Salary reform could not be systematically implemented. Public
sector employment grew as a result of the mandate of universal primary education and
proliferation of districts. Given the limited fiscal space, this put pressure on public sector
salaries and resulted in salary arrears that undermined public sector worker morale and
performance. There were riots among teachers and health workers, resulting in ad hoc
salary increases.

STRENGTHENING LOCAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS FOR SERVICE DELIVERY. NEGLIGIBLE.

         Prior actions under the PRSC5-7 focused on some process reforms, such as to
identify alternative source of revenue for local government to replace funds from the
graduation tax. This could not result in tangible impact given the broad direction of
policies described above. Other actions such as satisfactory progress in core undertakings
of the Joint Annual Review for Decentralization is insufficiently tangible, and lacks
institutional depth.

         By the time PRSC5 was launched, decentralization and local capacity for service
delivery had suffered major policy-related setbacks and earlier gains in decentralization
had been reversed. The abolition of the graduated tax in 2005 drastically eroded the local
revenue base. The government reduced automatic transfers to Local Governments and
increased percentage of conditional grants. Also, the government created a number of
new districts, reflecting political patronage. These policy decisions were essentially
mandated by the presidential administration without consultation. There was no analysis
of budgetary and service delivery implications. This undermined local government
service delivery and employee morale. Over the period of evaluation, the number of
districts increased by almost 50 percent (figure 2.7). Further, table 2.6 shows that almost
all types of local government grew by close to 50 percent. The proliferation of districts
was particularly damaging to local systems for service delivery Figure 2.7).

        Facing political pressures during the elections, the government reduced local
government autonomy. It recentralized some of its functions and resources. And––given
budgetary constraints––it reduced resources available for service delivery at both existing
and new district levels. The composition of public spending at the local level also
worsened, shifting towards wages and recurrent spending at the expense of non-wage
expenditures (e.g., local infrastructure, management) for service delivery programs. The
agriculture, health, and education sectors are examples of inadequate development
budgets. Execution of development budget lines performed worse than that of recurrent
expenditures. (IEG, 2014).

A BETTER EDUCATED SOCIETY. MODEST.

         PRSC5-7 attempted to support the entire education reform as discussed and
agreed with the donors within the annual education sector reviews. Prior actions were
broad ––“satisfactory implementation of the undertakings agreed in the sector reviews” is
a typical example – and their impact difficult or impossible to measure. The education
reform had to be carried out in the context of the reduction of the local government tax
base, extension of the education mandate to post-primary education (post-primary
education became compulsory), recentralization of resources, and reduction of resources
for service delivery, in large part because of the politically motivated proliferation of
districts. These broad setbacks in policy direction determined, in large part, the outcomes
in the education sector, despite considerable sector dialogue and coordination and
resulting specific reform measures.
                                             22


         There has been significant progress in increasing access to schooling for primary
and lower secondary aged children and in decreasing gender disparities. Some attribution
to the program, which explicitly targeted these indicators, is likely. Access at primary
level is above 90 percent for both girls and boys (figure 2. 8) although girls still lag
behind boys in secondary school enrolment. Primary completion rates have improved
over the evaluation period. While it has remained about 70 percent for boys, however, the
sustainability can be questioned as the rate has increased sharply for girls from about 40
percent in 2006 to 70 percent in 2012. There is gender parity in primary completion rates
(figure 2.9).

        However, these gains in access have not been matched by an equivalent rise in the
quality of education. This is due in part to the education budget being spread thinly, as a
result of the government’s policy of expanding access at both primary and secondary
levels. This was undertaken without increasing resources to the sector.

        Primary Leaving Examinations (PLE) are taken at the end of Primary 7 and are
graded on a nine-point scale: 1 to 9, where 1 is the best. Time series data for the pass
rates of the PLE are not available for the entire period of 2004-2013. However, a closely
                                               23


related indicator is the PLE performance index used in the Sector Performance Reports of
the MoES16. Its evolution shows that there has been a significant increase in average PLE
performance of students. The index was at 51.5% for boys and 45.6% for girls) in 2004
and increased to 65.1% for boys and 59.5% for girls in 2013. In practice, this represents a
return to levels experienced in 2001 where the aggregate index was 62.9% (MoES, 2013).
This trend is shown in figure 2.10.

       There was an initial increase in literacy and numeracy competence at Primary 6 at
the beginning of the evaluation period with an increase from 26.8% in 2004 to 54.8% in
2010. Competency levels then declined decreasing to 41.4% in 2013. Girls still lagged
behind with levels of 37.4% in 2013, as compared to boys at 45.8%, although at both P3
and P6 levels girls’ literacy skills were higher than boys, but were lower than boys in
numeracy (see Figure 2.11).




16 To calculate this index, candidates are weighted in each grade of passing with the best grade
carrying a high weight and failures given a weight of zero. The actual weight is summed up and
expressed as a ratio of the expected maximum weight attained by multiplying the highest weight
with the number of candidates that sat exams (see UNESCO (2012): The use and usefulness of
school grants: lessons from Uganda). Under this measure, 100% would imply that all PLE
candidates passed in division one. Therefore, the further the index from 100 percent the poorer
the quality of performance. Results for 2013 show a gap of 37 percent for Uganda to attain a
quality of 100 percent.

        On the negative side, at primary level, there are issues related to teacher
absenteeism, limited community participation (as UPE is free to the user), high dropout
of pupils (particularly girls), high pupil-teacher ratios, and high attrition rates of teachers.
At secondary level, there are inadequate teaching skills, and inadequate number and
quality of science and math teachers and science equipment/laboratories (MoES 2014).

       There is also a large variation across districts in spending, performance and value-
for money. An estimated one-third of expenditures in primary education has been wasted
or used inefficiently. At secondary level, the distribution of secondary education
expenditure was found to have no relationship to need. Inefficiencies stemmed from low
workloads, poor teacher deployment and high teacher salaries (World Bank, 2007, 2008
&2013).

        In terms of specific achievements, improving access to education at both primary
and secondary level has been the main area of success in the education sector, with
gender equity in enrolment at primary level, although girls still lag behind boys in
secondary school enrolment. Completion rates at primary 7 have also risen, but this is
counterbalanced by very low survival rates to primary 7, indicating that the majority of
pupils have dropped out by this level. The PRSCs have contributed to this increase in
enrolments through providing funding to support Universal Primary Education (UPE) and
Universal Secondary Education (USE), although support has also been provided through
other development-partner funded projects. However, the PRSCs have not been
successful in addressing drop-out rates or survival to primary 7.

HEALTHIER UGANDANS. NEGLIGIBLE.

        The prior actions were the following (i) implementation of the undertakings
agreed in the health sector review held in November 2003 and confirmed by the health
sector review held in November 2004 (PRSC5); (ii) provision of evidence as to the

implementation of: (a) the undertakings made in the health sector review during
November 2004, and subsequent confirmation during the 2005 review; and (b) the
undertakings made during the 2005 review, and subsequent confirmation during October
2006 review (PRSC6); and (iii) evidence as to the implementation of: the undertakings
made during the November 2006 review and subsequent confirmation during October
2007 review (PRSC7). These prior actions were too general and vague to permit
evaluation. In what follows, the IEG team reviews the main outcomes in the sector that
figure prominently in the “undertakings agreed in the health sector review” in order to
indirectly ascertain achievement.

       Health reforms suffered from the same significant policy reversals that affected
education. In the case of health, however, the adverse impact was felt more strongly due
to underfunding and weak capacity.

        Evidence of gains in access is counterbalanced by that of deteriorating quality and
unequal access to health care over the evaluation period. Figure 2.12 shows a difference
of almost 40 percentage points in the ratio of deliveries by health facilities between urban
and rural and according to wealth quintile (figure 2.12). While there is evidence that the
poor benefit from primary care levels, the public hospitals on which the bulk of public
health resources are spend––do not benefit the poor (World Bank, 2009). DPT3
immunization rates have increased from around 62% in 2004 to around 90% in 2011 and
then down to 86% in 2011 and 2012, the most recent years with data. In FY2012/13, 83%
of boys were immunized and 85% of girls (MoH, 2014).

       Significant issues remain regarding the immunization rates and urban-rural gaps,
and the quality and equity of health services for women and children. According to the
Health Sector Reports and HMIS data, DPT3 immunization rates have increased from
around 62% in 2004 to around 90% in 2011 but then declined to 86% in 2011 and 2012,
the most recent years with data (MoH 2014; Annual Health Sector Performance Report
2013/2014). The Demography and Health Survey (HS) data suggests a positive trend in
immunization coverage (table 7), but 2011 DHS numbers are significantly lower than
                                              26


HMIS numbers. Immunization in the HMIS dataset seems to have been over reported: “A
health facility record review of DTP third dose immunization (verification of facility
source documents to determine consistency with reported values) conducted in June 2013
showed a verification factor of 0.79, indicating a rate of over-reporting (more
immunizations reported to HMIS than could be verified in source documents) of
approximately 20%.” (MoH, 2013: HSSIP MTR)

       The table also shows that the while rural-urban gap in immunization has narrowed
and the wealth gap disappeared, overall immunization rates are still well below the
desired levels. Further, regional equity gaps are still apparent: the North and the West
have higher immunization coverage than the Central and Eastern regions. The HSSIP
midterm review notes that “health facilities providing routine child immunization
services are generally well-equipped to provide the service. Approx. 80% of facilities had
vaccines in stock on the day of the assessment, and availability of single-use syringes and
sharps container was close to universal.” (MoH, 2013).

         However, maternal and child health care indicators are worrisome. The share of
institutional deliveries (or deliveries attended by a skilled birth attendant) has stagnated at
around 41% and most likely one reason for Uganda’s failure in achieving the MDG 5 on
maternal mortality (GoU, 2013b). The contraceptive prevalence rate is generally low.
                                            27


Data show an increase from less than 20% of women in ages 15 to 49 using or having
access to some type of contraceptive in 2005 to 30% in 2011.17

        During consultations several sector experts noted that, for example, the
distribution of condoms is generally incomplete and only cover certain parts of the
country, predominantly the urban areas. The hard-to-reach areas of the country have less
access to contraceptives, including condoms and other types.

        More broadly, there is strong evidence to suggest the Ugandan health sector faces
several gender related challenges and that progress on gender sensitive outcomes has
been slow and well below expectations. This is partly a result of general gender
challenges, such as women and girls being forced into early marriages, teenage
pregnancies (leading to higher risk of education drop-out), and gender based violence
(IEG mission consultations).

       With respect to gender sensitive health sector outcomes, Uganda will not achieve
Millennium Development Goal number 5 to improve maternal health, including reducing
maternal mortality (MDG, Target 5.A), which is graded as ‘Stagnant’ in the most recent
update (GoU, 2013b). In addition, progress on Target 5.B, on universal access to
reproductive health services has been graded ‘Slow’ in the same report.

        There is also evidence that women, especially young women, are particularly
vulnerable to HIV infection (EPRC, 2012, GoU, 2013a) and that infection rates are on the
rise. This is partly due to the weak position of (young) women in society as reflected by
the phenomena of ‘transactional sex’ (not prostitution, but the exchange of sex for favors
and undue pressure from males, including managers, teachers, and boda-boda18 drivers).

       Security concerns in rural areas also affect maternal and child health. There is
convincing evidence from sector experts and field visits that access to maternal and
reproductive services, including in connection with deliveries, is hampered by the
unwillingness of midwives to attend pregnant mothers during night hours for fear of
being attacked (IEG mission consultations). This highlights the importance of security,
transportation, and health sector linkages in delivery of health services to women,
especially to the poor, rural areas that require health outreach services.

       Around one-third of pregnant women attend antenatal care services. During
consultations, it was frequently reported that most women attend the first ante-natal care
(ANC) session and many the second session. However, significantly fewer pregnant
women attend all four ANC sessions. The reasons for the gradual decline in ANC

attendance are several, but include low trust in the usefulness of services and difficulties
in funding transportation to clinics for all four sessions.

        There is little and highly unreliable data on infant mortality rates for Uganda for
the evaluation period. The Joint Assessment Framework (JAF) matrix notes an infant
mortality rate (IMR) in 2010 of 76 and in 2012 of 54. However, this reduction appears
too large to be reliable.

Improved access to safe water and sanitation. Substantial.

        Prior actions were: the implementation of the undertakings agreed and confirmed
by the water and sanitation sector review held in September 2003 and confirmed in
September 2004 (PRSC5); (ii) provision of evidence as to the implementation of: (a) the
undertakings made in the water sector review during September 2004, and subsequent
confirmation during the 2005 review; and (b) the undertakings made during the 2005
review, and subsequent confirmation during September 2006 review (PRSC6); (iii) the
provision of evidence of implementation of the undertakings made during the September
2006 review, and subsequent confirmation during 2007 review (PRSC7). These prior
actions were achieved but they were too general. However, the quality of the policy
dialogue and sector review and consultation process was strong as evidenced by
extensive field interviews, including visits to secondary towns. It is the quality of this
dialogue that led to the agreement on realistic sector objectives and indicators, which
showed improvement.

        PRSCs5-7 supported the sector19 as part of the joint budget support mainly
through the water and sanitation sector review process, sector dialogue, and consultation.
In particular, the field interviews and visits show evidence of high-quality sector reviews
and policy dialogue. This has not been the case with other priority sectors such as
education and, especially, health. This led to the realistic measures and indicators which
showed improvement. Indicators in the sector generally improved (table 2.8).

  The responsibility for sanitation and hygiene is shared by three line ministries. Domestic sanitation falls
under the Ministry of Health, and at local level under the District Health Inspector’s office in terms of
sensitization and mobilization and construction of latrines in health centers, communal sanitation is
implemented by DWD, and at decentralized level by DWO, and the Ministry of Education and Sports is
responsible sanitation in schools. A sanitation MoU between the three ministries was signed in 2001. NGOs
and CBOs have continued to contribute to the water and sanitation subsector, by mobilizing funds for the
sector, by supporting water and sanitation infrastructure development, and by capacity building of
communities to demand, develop and maintain water, sanitation and hygiene facilities.

        Over the period under review, the overall access to safe water has increased from
57% to 64%. The increase was mostly in the period 2004 – 2007, before the JBSF; after
that, the rural safe water coverage stagnates. (figure 2.13 and 2.14). The percentage of the
population with access to sanitation facilities has risen. (figure 15). However, domestic
sanitation is the responsibility of households.

        These positive developments under the PRSC5-7 have been reinforced by the
significant involvement of NGOs, by the strong sector dialogue, and by effectively
decentralized sector management.

        Substantial numbers of people are served by new water supplies funded by off-
budget resources implemented by NGOs, which ensures that the safe water coverage so
far is not falling. The 2011 Sector Review shows that in FY20099/10, an estimate
472,894 people were newly served in rural areas by NGOs, as compared to 670,910
people by the DWSDCG. (figure 2.15).

        A positive contribution has been made to safe water access through improvements
in decentralized management, decentralized capacity building and focus on O&M––also
supported by the sector dialogue. Another positive impact on the increase of rural water
supply coverage was the establishment of a “Water and Sanitation Development Facility”
(WSDF) to channel funding and technical support into the sector’s service providers.
These gains can be traced back to increased financing, improved supervision, improved
use of the implementation guidelines as well as increased follow up by the extension
workers.

        There has been a solid sector dialogue ––which has been a key PRSC tool of
mediating the achievement of prior actions to the sector outcomes––bringing together
development partners, including the Bank, as a basis for implementation of measures in
the sector.

Outcome
       Given high relevance of objectives but negligible relevance of design, and
assessment of modest efficacy,20 overall outcome is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

Risk to Development Outcome
        The review finds three main sources of high risk to the weak development
outcomes achieved: political patronage, population growth, and lack of attention to
agricultural productivity.

       In Uganda, political patronage, especially near election periods, results in
expansion of expenditures and supplemental budgets that may not be justified on
economic and social grounds. In addition, patronage, based on a system of extensive
exemptions, is a major cause of low revenue mobilization, which translates into
underfunding for key sectors ant makes taxation reform difficult. These factors threaten


20 Achievement   of the ten objectives is summarized as follows: reduction of the fiscal deficit
(negligible), increased private sector competitiveness (modest), increased agricultural production
and efficiency (negligible), strengthening Public Financial Management (PFM) and procurement
at central and local levels. (substantial), reducing corruption (substantial), improving public sector
performance through better use of public sector workers and pension reform and improving
management (negligible), strengthening local government systems for service delivery
(negligible), a better educated society (modest), healthier Ugandans (negligible), improved access
to safe water and sanitation (substantial).
                                            32


the mixed achievements in the social sectors. These issues are compounded by weak
capacity at the local level. Political patronage also makes enforcement of some of the
upstream governance institutions difficult. Low enforcement may eventually erode the
credibility of the upstream governance reforms themselves.

        Social sector achievements are also threatened by a combination of factors such as
rapid population growth, lack of policy focus and general direction of policies (e.g.,
extension to post-primary education, proliferation of districts, lack of robust local tax
base) running counter to the need for high quality service delivery in education and health
and in water supply and sanitation.

       The lack of a coherent set of policies to address low agricultural productivity
represents a major missed opportunity and a risk to future growth of rural incomes and
poverty reduction.

Bank Performance
Quality at Entry
       Positive aspects of Quality at Entry were (i) a broad and deep policy dialogue
underpinning the PRSC policy agenda; (ii) coordination and harmonization with other
donors in the context of the Joint Budget Support (JBS) framework; (iii) close alignment
with the government’s priorities in the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP); and (iv)
a considerable corpus of analytical work. The Bank also coordinated closely with the
IMF on the macroeconomic framework.

       There were, however, significant weaknesses. The overarching objective was so
wide and general that it was impossible to evaluate. Even the more specific objectives
were too many and too broad and difficult to relate to the prior actions. Design was
complex and spread over too many policy areas. Prior actions were often too broad, not
measurable or very piecemeal and process- oriented. The monitoring and evaluation
framework was also overly complex and lacked baselines. Many indicators were only
weakly connected to actions and objectives. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Bank Supervision
       The Bank addressed initial design and M&E weaknesses in subsequent
operations. For example, prior actions in public financial management became more
concrete, more numerous, and better linked with the objectives in PRSC 7. Attribution
was also made clearer.

        The Bank discussed governance issues (including periodic corruption scandals) as
part of policy dialogue, and coordinated closely with other donors. The government’s
agreement was obtained to compensate for the abolition of the graduation tax by
increased transfers to local authorities, although its restoration would have been
preferable. The monitoring of macroeconomic performance was enhanced. However, the
Bank did not respond to the repeated underperformance of government revenues. Rating:
Moderately Satisfactory.
                                            33


Overall rating for Bank performance is moderately unsatisfactory.

Borrower Performance
        The Implementing Agency is not distinguishable from Government and is thus
not rated separately.

Government Performance
        On the positive side, government performance has been broadly solid on
macroeconomic policies without inflation crises or escalation of fiscal deficit, despite
poor design of the fiscal program under the series. Public financial management and
strengthening of upstream governance and accountability institutions as well as making
progress on some metrics of access in education and water and sanitation were strong
elements of government performance. Also, the government managed to protect poverty
related expenditures as part of the Poverty Action Fund.

        Macro-fiscal performance, however, has been subject to large and frequent
supplemental budgets, especially during the 2006 election. This undermined budgetary
credibility and worsened the composition of public expenditures towards less productive
current expenditures (including public administration and military expenditures),
undermining efficiency of public expenditures in supporting service delivery. The
structural problem of very low revenues remained unaddressed. Regarding governance,
despite some gains in upstream institutions, downstream enforcement was lacking.

        At the local and sectoral levels, the government pursued a policy of proliferation
of districts. It also expanded the mandate for post-primary education expansion without
adequate consultation with development partners, and in the absence of necessary
preparation, local capacity building, and institutional and budgetary resources. This,
coupled with the low revenue mobilization, undermined progress in policy areas
supported under the PRSC, especially in the latter years when overall donor budget
support began to decline and resources for social sectors at the local level came under
increasing pressure. Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation
        M&EM&E design was based on the overall PEAP framework that had been
discussed and agreed with the development partners, including the Bank. In that sense,
M&EM&E was aligned with the government’s broad monitoring framework under the
PEAP. However, M&EM&E of PRSC5-7, in particular, had a number of shortcomings
related to quality, concreteness, and measurability.

       The results framework was weak. It was essentially non-existent in PRSC5. This
assessment of M&E is, therefore, focused on PRSC6-7. Objectives were too numerous
and vague. The choice of indicators was poor––often qualitative––and did not permit
measurement of progress towards the achievement of objectives. Baseline values were
frequently missing.

        M&E implementation. Annual policy action matrix was used to monitor the
achievements of targets. Efforts were made to improve the quality of M&E in PRSC6 and
7 by improving the concreteness of indicators (e.g., in the PFM area). Annual joint sector
reviews in health, education, and water and sanitation were conducted and M&E
indicators reviewed, recommendations made, and applied. However, the overall quality,
number and measurability of indicators was still lacking at the end of the series.

        M&E utilization system was not sufficiently operational for tracking and
reporting on outcomes. There is no evidence of a clear theory of change in the M&E
indicators and their use. Some of major changes in policy directions cannot be traced to
M&E systems. At the same time, it appears that M&E did inform subsequent PRSC
series, which featured better quality results and M&E frameworks. Rating: negligible.

Lessons
        Several lessons emerge from this assessment of PRSC5-7 series. They relate to
the design, implementation, and proactivity and learning.

      Lack of clear, concrete objectives impedes both implementation and evaluation of
       DPOs. General statements of broad support of government policies (as in PRSC5-
       7) are best avoided.
      Design of DPOs and implementation can be adversely affected by lack of focus
       and selectivity in policy areas.
      Inadequate accounting of political economy factors in the design of major reforms
       can adversely affect the design, implementation and outcomes of DPOs. Lack of
       focus on domestic revenue mobilization is a prime example.
      Pressures to extend budget support within the broader, coordinated donor support
       framework without hard conditionality to raise domestic revenues can undermine
       incentives for domestic revenue mobilization. This, in turn, can undercut
       macroeconomic adjustment needed for sustainable fiscal policy as well as the
       adequacy of funding for basic services.
      Implementation and evaluation are frequently undermined when objectives are
       not tightly linked to prior actions and there is no measurable and relevant results
       framework, when outcome indicators are ambiguous, and when targets do not
       incorporate an explicit and convincing theory of change.

3. Poverty Reduction Support Credit 8-9
Relevance
Objectives

         The program development objective for the series was “improved access to and
greater value for money in public services.” (Program Documents for PRSC 8 and 9, p.
ii) ). The Financing Agreement does not define the objectives for the series or the
individual operations.

        The Board originally approved three Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs)
for the series, but the last operation (PRSC 10) was cancelled. Some end of program
targets were adjusted when the Board approved PRSC 9.

        The PRSCs supported reforms under two policy clusters with the following
objectives:

      Policy Cluster 1 Objectives: “(i) improved budget credibility, (ii) transparent and
       efficient public financial management and public procurement; (iii) strengthened
       public sector management and accountability; and (iv) strengthened local
       government system for service delivery.” (Policy Results Matrix of Program
       Document for PRSC 8, page 54).
      Policy Cluster 2 Objectives: (i) “wider access to, and better quality of, health
       services and improved sexual and reproductive health care services and control of
       major communicable diseases”; (ii) “wider access to, and better quality of,
       primary and secondary education”; (iii) “improved water and sanitation system”;
       and (iv) “improved national road network to lower transport cost, raise
       competitiveness, and facilitate economic activity” (idem., pages 61, 62, 64 and
       65). Relevance of Objectives. High

      The objectives were relevant to the government’s priorities in the National
Development Plan in the following main policy areas: human development, governance,
economic infrastructure, and access to quality social services.

        The objectives were relevant to the World Bank 2010 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), covering the Fiscal Years 2011-2015, which focused on public
infrastructure, human capital development, and good governance and value for money.

        The PRSC series also reflects closely the Bank’s CAS at appraisal when basic
service delivery indicators and value for money in public services were low, justifying
the focus on these policy areas.

PROGRAM DESIGN AND RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

       The objectives were limited to two clearly defined policy areas: improving access
and ensuring greater value for money in public services. PRSC 8 and PRSC 9 had eight
                                             36


and ten prior actions, respectively, and there were eight triggers for PRSC 10, dropped
from

Policy Cluster 1: Reforms in Public Expenditure Management, Public Financial
Management, and Public Service Management that Improve Service Delivery.

        Component 1.1 Credibility of the Budget: i) Adhere to a 5 percent variance
threshold for the GOU budget in the four JBSF sectors; ii) change from monthly to
quarterly budget releases; and iii) piloting the use of quarterly work plans and
procurement plans in the ministries/agencies corresponding to the four JBSF sectors
(PRSC 8 prior action 1, PRSC 9 prior action 1, PRSC 10 trigger 1)

       Component 1.2 Transparency in Funding at Service Delivery Level: To improve
transparency of local government expenditures, the MOFPED was to develop, produce
and publish quarterly reports on actual Local Government (LG) expenditures and outputs
(PRSC 9 prior action 2, PRSC 10 trigger 2).

        Component 1.3 Public Financial Management (PFM): i) better compliance with
PFM laws and regulations with greater emphasis on performance-based assessment of
public servants, with an emphasis on both rewards and sanctions; ii) strengthening
internal and external audit capacity; iii) improve compliance, control arrears in the period
covered by PRSC 9 and 10; and iv) PFM legislation to add provisions related to
management of oil revenue and strengthening in other areas (PRSC 8 prior action 2,
PRSC 9 prior action 3, PRSC 10 trigger 3).

        Component 1.4 Compliance with Public Procurement Regulations: i) strengthen
the legal and regulatory framework for procurement; ii) improved monitoring for better
enforcement of procurement laws and sanctioning of breaches by establishing and
piloting a system for measuring performance in public procurement; and iii) improve
procurement capacity within spending entities (PRSC 8 prior action 3, PRSC 9 prior
action 4, PRSC 10 trigger 4).

        Component 1.5 Performance of Public Servants: i) address the inequitable
distribution of public servants across the country, as well as the significant variation in
the level of their performance; ii) address weaknesses in the inspection and disciplinary
system for public servants that lead to poor accountability and performance; iii) instill a
stronger sense of ethic and accountability in the public service by enhancing and
coordinating performance management tools; and iv) rolling out performance
management tools and pay reforms and improving management systems for personnel
and payroll (PRSC 8 prior actions 4, 5 and 6, PRSC 9 prior actions 5 and 8, PRSC 10
trigger 5).

         Component 1.6 Accountability and Anti-Corruption: i) strengthen the tracking of
corruption trends by the Inspector General of Government (IGG) and other key
institutions by developing evidence-based data to promote anti-corruption reform and
facilitate the demand side of governance, and by deepening the public dialogue about
corruption across all stakeholders; and ii) supporting GOU's effort to disseminate key
                                              37


Data Tracking Mechanism (DTM) findings, and reach out to and involve non-state actors
in monitoring (PRSC 9 prior action 6, PRSC 10 trigger 6).

Policy Cluster 2: Improving Value for Money in Public Service Delivery Sectors

         Component 2.1 Health: i) improve the availability of essential medicines and
health supplies in health centers; and ii) improve the availability of qualified health staff
at task (PRSC 8 prior action 5, PRSC 9 prior action 7).

         Component 2.2 Education: i) improve the equitableness of teacher deployment
and ii) improved accountability of head teachers (PRSC 8 prior action 6, PRSC 9 prior
action 8, and PRSC 10 trigger 7).

         Component 2.3 Water and Sanitation: i) increase the functionality of rural water
facilities and Water for Production (WfP) facilities; and ii) improve the levels of
sanitation and hygiene (PRSC 8 prior action 7, PRSC 9 prior action 9).

        Component 2.4 Transport: i) help ensure stable funding for road maintenance and
increased quality of the maintenance work by year-by-year monitoring of road quality by
first generating national, district and sub-district data on the quality of roads, starting with
the set of baseline data, and establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework to
systematically track improvements in the sector; and ii) improve transparency and
accountability in the roads subsector (Uganda National Roads Authority-UNRA) which
would seek to obtain procurement accreditation from PPDA and begin implementation of
an independent and parallel bid evaluation process (PRSC 8 prior action 8, PRSC 9 prior
action 10, PRSC10 trigger 8).

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN: SUBSTANTIAL

        The objectives were clear, limited to well defined policy areas, and were
monitorable. Prior actions and results indicators were fewer, more concrete, more
implementable and better aligned with program objectives compared with the previous
series.

        However, there were still too many policy areas, which undermined the focus of
the series and affected implementation and sustainability of reforms. Also, some prior
actions could have been made less process and more outcome oriented. In health, the
linkages between objectives and prior actions (focusing on the adoption of policy
documents related to health staff, absenteeism, and drug stock outs) and outcome
indicator (DPT3 immunization) were weak. In roads, major challenges identified in the
sector (e.g., inadequate maintenance, capacity of private construction industry and poor
business environment, road safety and procurement) were not clearly addressed by the
prior actions.

        The program assumed that improved value for money would be achieved by
supporting correlates of value for money. This may be the case in some areas such as for
anti-corruption, PFM, and procurement, but is not true for all actions supported under the
program. Direct measures and indicators of value for money that would, ideally, capture
                                               38


both cost and benefit dimensions of public service delivery are, for example, number of
vaccinations per unit of cost.

Implementation of PRSC 8-9
        The PRSC8-19 was designed as a series of three operations, in support of the
newly developed National Development Plan. Similar to the PRSC5-7 series, it was
provided within a harmonized framework for budget support, under the Office of the
Prime Minister. In the event, PRSC10 was dropped because of delays in implementing
the original policy agenda (see below). IDA financing for the truncated two operation
series consisted of two credits for $100 million each.

        PRSC8 financing was comprised of $60 million from IDA and $40 million from
the Pilot Crisis Response Window (CRW). This amount represents a reduction from the
planned amount of US$140 million "as a result of inadequate strengthening of the legal
framework for public procurement and slow progress in public service reform” (PD,
pp.17).21

        Disbursement of funds from PRSC9 was delayed for several months after the
Auditor General of Uganda released a report raising concerns about the transfer of funds
for bilateral budget support to dormant accounts at the Bank of Uganda and then used
fraudulently.22.The credit was disbursed after the Government of Uganda committed to
carry out actions to strengthen governance and public financial management systems. In
this context of eroded trust, the Bank decided to truncate the series, cancelling the
PRSC10. Table 3.1 provides an overview of the financing and dates.



21
  The PD for PRSC 8 provided a detailed explanation of the reason for the changes in total
financing: “The amount of PRSC 8 budget support is US$100 million, comprising US$60
million country IDA and US$40 million from the Crisis Response Window to help GoU mitigate
the impact of the global economic crisis. The total credit amount is a reduction from the planned
amount of US$140 million as a result of inadequate strengthening of the legal framework for
public procurement and slow progress in public service reform. The draft Amendment to the
Procurement Law presented to Parliament meets international best practice in most areas, with the
exception of the amendment to allow unrestricted use of force account. This originally agreed
prior action has therefore been dropped. It is given high weight in the assessment of government
performance under the program since achieving efficiency in public procurement is critical to
Uganda’s reforms to achieve value for money in public spending, especially given that at least 55
percent of the government budget is expended through public procurement” (PD PRSC8).
22
   In October 2012, the Auditor General of Uganda issued a report on misappropriation of budget
support funds provided by some bilateral development partners. According to the report, a
substantial amount of funds provided by the Governments of Denmark, Ireland, Norway, and
Sweden as official development assistance (approximately USD12 million) was inappropriately
transferred in 2011 to dormant accounts of the Office of Prime Minister at the Bank of Uganda
and then used in a fraudulent way. The report raised serious concerns about quality of public
financial management, and, more generally, about deterioration in the quality of Uganda's
governance, resulting in suspension of budget support by a number of bilateral donors
participating in the Joint Budget Support Fund. (ISR1 PRSC9).

        No safeguard policies were triggered by the operation. No adverse distributional
effects are anticipated from policies supported by the PRSC series. The PRSC is not
expected to result in major adverse, or irreversible, environmental impacts.

Achievement of the Objectives
GREATER VALUE FOR MONEY IN PUBLIC SERVICES: SUBSTANTIAL

         Greater value for money was to be achieved through progress in budget
credibility; PFM and procurement; governance and anti-corruption; public sector
management; and strengthened local government systems. The following subsections
discuss the progress against each of these outcomes, and how they relate, and can be
attributed, to the Bank’s interventions.

         Improved budget credibility was to be measured through the allocation and
execution of the budget for health, education, road and water and sanitation. A budget
variance not exceeding 5 percent for each sector was targeted. This was to be achieved
through the following prior actions: (i) actual annual budget releases of conditional grants
to each of the four JBSF sectors (health, education, water and sanitation, and roads) were
at least 95% of the corresponding approved budget allocations for the fiscal year; (ii)
budget releases of recurrent wage expenditure across the four sectors, recurrent non-wage
expenditure across these sectors, and development expenditures across these sectors were
in each case at least 95% of the corresponding approved budget allocations; (iii) the
treasury has made budget releases to spending agencies on a quarterly basis; and (iv) the
recipient has piloted the use of quarterly work plans and procurement plans. Further
detail on prior actions is provided in Annex B.

       In a survey in which 66 stakeholders were interviewed, conducted during this IEG
evaluation, 23 some 80 percent of government officials report that there has been
considerable progress in budget credibility linked to PFM reforms. In contrast, 60 percent
of non-government actors and DPs share this sentiment.

                                                                40


        Looking at the budget execution numbers, in the aggregate, the Government was
able to broadly control and implement the budget with a variance of total expenditure of
below 3 percent.

        Notwithstanding aggregate budget control, there has been considerable over- and
underspending across ministries. Also, frequent and sizable supplementary budgets––
especially around the elections––have undermined budget planning and credibility (figure
16). As it is illegal for any expenditure vote to spend more than its approved budget, any
deviation must be covered through supplementary authorizations by Parliament
(Constitution of Uganda, section 156 (2)).

        Large supplementary expenditures were, for example, authorized at various times
for the Ministry of Defence to buy fighter jets and pay for salary shortfalls; state house
expenditures to meet operational shortfalls; Ministry of Energy and Development to clear
payment arrears; and Uganda Police to police the 2011 elections. It is unclear why such
expenditures could not have been anticipated, discussed, and planned for in the regular
budget process. Furthermore, the Auditor General notes that many budget cuts were
applied unilaterally by MOFPED on the Ministries, Departments, and Agencies’ (MDAs)
budgetary prioritized activities without prior consultation of the respective MDAs
(Auditor General Report on 2010-11, Vol. 2). This deterioration in control of aggregate
expenditure and composition of expenditure outturns has resulted in the decline in budget
credibility and a corresponding decline in the respective PEFA and CPIA scores.

        In principle, arrears on goods and services should not happen as the commitment
control system (IFMIS) rejects any unwarranted commitment by the spending agencies.
In practice, arrears do happen, but as of FY12, they had been reduced considerably to
                                                  41


below 9 percent of total expenditure. They tend to be concentrated in payment arrears to
government’s suppliers. 24

        In conclusion, despite reforms, at present, budget credibility remains relatively
weak, and improvements remain modest. Lack of budget predictability has undermined
execution of expenditure programs and medium-term planning. And delays in the release
of funds from ministries resulted in the periodic underfunding of district governments and
service providers. It should also be noted that delays in release of donors’ budget support
complicated budget management.

  Arrears, however, still accumulate due to inadequate budgeting practices, as spending agencies
can fetch higher allocations for some items by deliberately under-estimating expenditure for core
expenditure items such as salaries, pensions, rent, or utilities. During discussions with civil
society, the school examination board was noted where allegedly the examinations are grossly
under-budgeted in order to allow for later revisions.

         PFM and procurement. The outcome and intermediate outcome indicators were
(i) the share of local Governments publishing financial transfers and budgets at local
level; and (ii) contracts with complete procurement records in compliance with PPDA
regulations. Prior actions set to achieve progress across these dimensions include: (i)
satisfactory progress in implementing its undertakings to develop a format for
performance agreements for accounting officers including chief administrative officers;
(ii) performance agreements with all Permanent Secretaries in central government
ministries and Chief Administrative Officers in local governments, including a
requirement for compliance with the Recipient's financial management regulations; (iii)
satisfactory implementation and monitoring of procurement regulations and systems; and
(iv) approved and submitted to the Recipient's Parliament revised procurement
implementation regulations.

        There have been considerable improvements in efficiency, accountability, and
transparency in PFM. The Government uses a more appropriate budget formulation that
is based on administrative, economic and functional classifications. Since 2004/05, the
classifications include fund and funding source, administrative organization, project,
sector, Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) (objective, output, and activity),
and account (class, item, and sub-item) codes. The quality of information and
comprehensiveness is sound, but there are some transparency issues discussed below.

        The introduction of electronic fund transfers was reported to have significantly
increased disbursement speed. In districts that have not yet converted to Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), transfers can take up to a month,
which compares to less than 48 hours for those that have a functioning IFMIS system in
place. (World Bank 2013). Field missions confirmed that frameworks were set up in
some of the pilot districts, well-functioning, and have improved expenditure controls.

        Most Local Governments publish their financial transfers. The target of 90
percent in 2013 was significantly surpassed to 100 percent. This is a considerable
improvement from the 48 percent baseline in 2008. On the downside, the share of
contracts with complete procurement records with compliance of Public Procurement and
Disposal Act (PPDA) regulations was reduced over the evaluation period from 32 percent
in 2008 to 17 percent in 2011, substantially missing its target of 70 percent. This is
largely due to missing contract implementation plans, which were only found in 17.1
percent of procurement records according to the Third Annual Report on Tracking
Corruption Trends in Uganda. (GoU 2012). Other categories were much more
comprehensive. “Evidence of contract completion” was found in 60.2 percent, and the
remaining ten categories of procurement records had compliance rates of 81.5 percent or
higher. Despite the low compliance in one category, the action was a valuable
improvement in public procurement, as there were no adequate data to measure
procurement performance previously.

        The 2012 PEFA rates the comprehensiveness of the information included in the
budget documentation as strong based on all documentation presented to Parliament.
While the Budget Speech of the various MDAs provide a fairly comprehensive picture on
total external indebtedness and grants received as well as guarantees provided,
information on debt stock and financial assets is provided in the Audit Report and
Consolidated Accounts. Unreported extra budgetary expenditures (other than donors’
funds) are estimated relatively low––between one and five percent of total Government
expenditure––and non-tax revenue collected at the level of MDAs have largely been
contained to the referral hospitals that collect user fees and retain them at facility level.

         PEFA ratings for payroll, procurement and controls, however, have remained
relatively low over the period (Table 3.1) but there is evidence of improvement in the
latest draft PEFA 2013. The rating for competition, value for money and controls in
procurement (PI 19) was only D+, in 2012, which marks no improvement over the 208
rating, and constitutes one of the worst performing dimensions in Uganda’s otherwise
well-functioning PFM system. In particular, the 2012 PEFA notes that procurement is
decentralized but reporting to the central regulatory body is in arrears and some entities
fail to report altogether. PPDA has a good Procurement Performance Measurement
System, and undertakes compliance checks, but has insufficient resources to check more
than a fraction of all procuring entities. Many contracts over the threshold for competitive
bidding are given out on non-competitive methods such as direct (sole supplier)
procurement, usually on grounds of emergency. It is estimated that less than half of these
can be justified. The 2013 draft local government PEFA assessment found that
procurement systems, payroll controls, non-salary expenditure controls and internal audit
improved and work well in most cases. Procurement systems operate broadly adequately
for all the 10 sample LGs. The legal and regulatory framework is transparent, fairly
comprehensive and based on competition. (PEFA 2013).

        Fiscal transfers between central and Local Government (LG) lack transparency.
The Constitution provides for transfers to LG in the form of conditional, unconditional,
and equalization grants. Most grant expenditures are conditional grants (95 percent);
followed by unconditional (4 percent); and equalization grants (less than 1 percent).
Except for the unconditional grant, which is generally based on area and population, the
LGs cannot calculate the grants they will receive because the vertical allocation (part of
the total sectoral allocation that relates to decentralized services) by each sectoral
ministry that precedes the horizontal allocation across the LGs, is not predictable, there is
uneven adjustment for donor interventions, and also because of frequent, unanticipated
intersectoral shifts due to policy changes during the year. Relevant PEFA indicators,
scores, and justifications are summarized in the table 3.2 below.

        These findings are largely supported by a field survey of the IEG evaluation team.
Almost all (99 percent) of the interviewees said their LG would prepare regular financial
statements. 37 percent prepared annual statements, 60 percent quarterly statements, 3
percent both and 1 percent none. Further, 97 percent stated their LG prepared budget
execution reports, and 57 percent state that their LG uses IFMIS for all or a large extent
of budgetary preparation, monitoring and execution. 96 percent of respondents state their
LG has been audited by an external auditor in the last three years. See Annex B for more
detail on methodology.

         Governance and anti-corruption. Progress in Governance and anti-corruption
was to be measured against clean audit reports for Central Government, Local
Government, and Statuary Bodies. While there was no prior action in PRSC 8 in this
area, PRSC 9, stipulated that the Inspectorate General has developed and agreed upon a
measurement framework with the Inter-Agency Forum, including indicators, for
improved tracking of corruption trends and that it has published the first annual report on
corruption trends in Uganda using that measurement framework.

       These indicators were largely achieved. The target of clean audits for Central
Government (45 percent), Local Government (29 percent), and Statutory Bodies (59
percent) were surpassed at 59 (compared with the 2008 baseline 35), 45 (baseline 9), and
61 (baseline 49) percent, respectively by 2012.

        Over the years, this and the preceding PRSC series have contributed significantly
to the quality of governance institutions and accountability. Governance indicators have
improved across a number of domains, especially in the earlier years of the evaluation
period and on the upstream side of the accountability chain. Also, budget support and
related policy dialogue, directly and indirectly, helped strengthen some key governance
and accountability institutions such as the Auditor General’s office and Inspector
General’s office as well as their relative importance within the government institutions.
However, progress is especially lacking regarding downstream of the follow up on
upstream decisions, enforcement of prosecution, and recovery of funds.

         The quality of Parliament and Civil Society scrutiny of national budgets,
expenditures and audit reports is adequate and has improved. Parliament upstream
scrutiny is exercised through some of the key committees such as the Budget Committee.
Through its Budget Committee, Parliament reviews fiscal policies, the medium term
fiscal framework and medium term priorities, and details of expenditures and revenues.
Additionally the 2012 PEFA Assessment considers the procedures of the legislature to be
relatively well established and respected. There is adequate time for the legislature to
provide a response to budget proposals, as stipulated in the Budget Act of 2001. It is also
noteworthy that recommendations of the Accountant General are by and large being
considered by the executive. However, Parliamentary scrutiny of the budget downstream

or ex post is weak. For example, Parliament has not debated or approved any of the audit
reports on the Consolidated Accounts of the three years up to 2012. The Public Accounts
committee, an important committee, is overwhelmed with the workload and there is a
backlog of matters for its consideration. (PEFA 2012)

         CPIA ratings on transparency, accountability, and corruption in the public sector
have deteriorated significantly since 2008. Prior to that date, Uganda performed
consistently better than the IDA-eligible Sub-Saharan average. Since then, Uganda has
lost considerable ground and scores significantly worse that the Sub-Saharan average in
2012 (figure 3.2). This is largely attributable to a number of high-profile corruption
incidences, including the embezzlement of donor funds, poor follow up in terms of
prosecution and indictment, and the relative lack of civil society engagement in
governance processes. This is viewed as reducing the integrity of public resource use and
its effectiveness, affecting citizens’ trust in their government.

        The evaluation team conducted an online survey of key stakeholders, and found
that there are diverging views on progress in corruption: according to most government
officials corruption has been reduced to some or a great extent; development partners and
non-state actors generally disagree.

         Uganda’s anti-corruption legal framework and governing legislation is assessed
as strong. However, there are problems in the legal framework for political party
financing. Also, the country is still lacking effective implementation and enforcement of
the rules in place. In particular, the continuing lack of progress in prosecution, and

conviction of corruption cases is undermining the gains made in upstream legislative
reform and institution building.25

        The office of the Inspectorate General (IGG) has the mandate to investigate or
cause the investigation of corruption, prosecute, as well as arrest or cause the arrest of
corrupt officials. It also serves as the country’s ombudsman and is regulated by the
Inspectorate of Government Act of 2002. There has been a notable increase in
prosecutions since 2006. Convictions have increased at a much slower pace, so there is a
growing gap between prosecutions and convictions. The number of prosecutions has
increased more than threefold from 44 in 2006 to 145 in 2013. The number of convictions
has increased from 2 in 2006 to 18 in 2013. It is noted that the ratio of prosecutions to
convictions has improved, from 4.5 to 12.4 percent. This is a tangible improvement, but
much less than needed to affect the incentives for corruption and contribute to a deterrent
effect of enforcement activities.

        Concluded cases were about 50 percent of total prosecutions, which has however
deteriorated significantly in 2013 to about 20 percent. The great majority of corruption
related cases investigated relate to embezzlement and forgery. Lack of data, or sufficient
evidence, for prosecution is the leading cause for closing cases or referred cases for
further investigation. (Inspectorate General 2014b). Table 3-4 shows the breakdown of
the conviction rates.

        However, there is limited follow up on the IGG recommendations by the
executive. Similar to the Accountant General’s Office, the IGG submits a report to
Parliament every six months regarding the operational performance of its functions and
recommendations. However, it is noted that some institutions and officers “ignore; delay
compliance; or refuse to implement the IG’s recommendations, without giving credible
reasons” (Inspectorate General 2014a). This undermines the credibility and efficacy of
the institution. This may also be an institutional problem of a lack of a standalone

  Comparatively, Uganda scores poorly in the corruption perception index, and is ranked 142 out
of 175 countries. Its score is in the 21st percentile overall. Placing this into regional context, this
score is on par to Kenya, but significantly worse than Tanzania, or Rwanda, who are in the 37th
and 71st percentile, respectively. (Transparency International 2014).

parliamentary committee on anti-corruption, which could give greater parliamentary
oversight and urgency to the implementation of IGG and AG recommendations.

        Overall, significant progress was made regarding the time required for case
resolution. However, this is still insufficient to address the very large backlog of
unresolved cases that has accumulated over recent years. In FY 14, the backlog grew by
850 cases.

        The total workload of the IGG was substantial with 14,501 cases in 2014. Some
78 percent of these are accumulated cases from previous years. It has been recognized
that the backlog of cases poses a serious accountability problem. However, actions taken
were inadequate, and the backlog continues to increase. Table 3-5 shows that there were
2,240 cases investigated and completed, which is significantly less than the number of
new complaints received (i.e. 3,092). In other words, in FY 2014 the backlog grew by
more than 850 cases. (Inspectorate of Government 2014b).

       Significant improvement was made regarding the time needed to resolve a case.
While in 2010 54.2 percent of cases took more than 12 months to be resolved, this
number substantially dropped to 24 percent in 2012. It has risen to 28 percent in 2013.
However, this progress is still insufficient to curb the backlog. Of the 85 cases that were
ongoing in December 2013, 34 had been before the courts for more than 24 months.
Inadequate staffing at both the IG and in the court system contributes to the delays in
concluding prosecutions initiated by the IG. (Inspectorate of Government 2014a)

       Public sector management. Improvements in Public Sector Management were to
be measured against the share of employees whose computerized HR processes related to
pay are managed by the employer. Prior actions to achieve this objective include the
adoption of a framework for attracting and retaining teachers and health personnel in
hard-to-reach areas, and of a single framework for results oriented management, output
oriented budgeting and budget monitoring, including a modality for attaching
performance agreements to letters of appointment of civil servants.
                                                49


        The target of employees whose computerized HR processes related to pay are
managed by the employer was set at 50 percent for 2013, and was significantly surpassed
at 96 percent. This is a considerable achievement given a zero baseline in 2008. This
action in principle permits the government to link one person to one job and eliminate
"ghost workers". According to the Auditor General Office (4th annual report on Tracking
Corruption Trends in Uganda, pp. 34), as of May 2014, 8,229 “ghost workers” had been
eliminated from the payroll; the reduction represented a saving of about 1.45 million
dollars (3.74 billion Shillings) for the three month period of February – April 2014,
which annualized amounts to close to six million dollars.

         However––EG field visits in 2014 which provide additional evidence––do not
confirm these findings. Absenteeism and ‘part-time-ism’ of public officials, in particular
in some of the priority sectors (education and health), was found to be a persistent
problem, continuing to undermine service delivery. 26 Other continuing pertinent issues
are inequitable distribution of public servants across the country; weaknesses in the
inspection and disciplinary system for public servants; and incentives and pay system.
The PRSC aimed to address some of these weaknesses, for example, by a prior action
aiming for an adoption by government of the framework for attracting and retaining
public officers in hard-to-reach areas, integrated personnel and as well as the adoption of
results oriented management, output oriented budgeting and monitoring. While prior
actions were met, the IEG mission field visits including visits to hospitals and medical
facilities in the secondary towns strongly suggest that progress remains limited.

        Strengthened local government systems. The same indicator as for PFM applies to
this objective: the percentage of Local Governments publishing financial transfers and
budgets at local level. In support of this was the prior action requiring the recipient to
analyze quarterly reports to provide aggregate and in-year information about actual local
government expenditures and outputs, and publish the summary budget performance
report. As already noted above, Local Governments by and large publish their financial
transfers. The target of 90 percent in 2013 was significantly surpassed to 100 percent.
This is a considerable improvement from 48 percent at baseline in 2008.

        Progress in strengthening decentralization has, however, been modest at best, and
capacities for local governance and service delivery have suffered major policy-related
setbacks. The abolition of the graduated tax in 2005 practically eroded the local revenue
base. The government reduced transfers to Local Governments and increased percentage
of conditional grants. The graduated tax compensation almost eroded entirely. These
developments are shown in the figure 3.3 below.

  The situation does not seem to have changed notably since the Health Sector Public
Expenditure Review of 2010, which notes that health worker absenteeism represents a major
source of waste in the sector. Absenteeism is estimated between 37 and 52 percent in public
health facilities. Regarding ghost workers the study estimates that 1.5 percent of health workers
were in fact ghost workers, based on a prior clean up exercise and the fact that no substantial
improvements regarding the lag in removing workers who have died, retired, or absconded from
the payroll has been made. (World Bank 2010).

        This is also consistent with findings from the local government module of the
stakeholder survey. Most respondents note that the majority of funds from central levels
to the districts are allocated with conditions. What complicates strategic prioritization is
that funds were generally reported to be 1-3 months delayed. These trends are shown in
Figure 3.4 below. For more information on methods see Annex B.

        The government created a number of new districts, reflecting mostly political
patronage. These decisions were mandated by the presidential administration without
consultation and unsupported by analysis of budgetary and service delivery implications.
They undermined local government service delivery and local government employee
morale. Over the period of evaluation, the number of districts increased by almost 50
percent. This is the problem that remained throughout the period of both PRSC series
(see figure 3.5).

       The actions supported by the PRSC were insufficient to address the deeper
problems of local government functioning, including the lack of a robust own revenue tax
base and lack of flexibility resulting from reliance on conditional transfers. Nor did the
PRSCs address adequately weaknesses in local capacity, budget cycle credibility,
coordination of collection and processing of data on revenue and expenditures, lack of
transparency and inequality in inter-governmental fiscal transfers, and issues in
coordination of inspection, monitoring and supervision.

IMPROVING ACCESS TO PUBLIC SERVICES. MODEST

        Improving access to health. Achievement of this objective was to be measured
through: the DPT3 immunization rate––which is a critical indicator of the quality of
public health affecting children; vacancy rates for medical workers in hard-to-service
locations; proportion of approved posts filled by qualified health workers; health
workers’ absenteeism rate; and the proportion of health facilities without drug stock outs
for tracer drugs. Prior actions were (i) the establishment of a human resources for a health
management information system and the provision of information on levels and
distribution of the health workforce; and (ii) the signature and the start of implementation
of a memorandum of understanding, which includes a performance framework with key
performance indicators, for the distribution of essential medicines by the National
Medical Stores. To assess achievements, available evidence is first presented based on
                                              53


the demographic and health survey through 2011. Then these data are, where possible,
extended using the latest UNICEF and WHO data.

       Regarding DPT3 coverage27, there was a reduction of coverage from 82 percent
in 2008 to 80 percent in 2011, clearly missing the target set for 90 percent (ICR). (table
3-6). Vacancy rates for medical workers in hard-to-service areas remained the same at 42
percent missing the modest target of a reduction to 40 percent. Proportion of approved
posts by qualified health workers improved modestly from 51 to 56 percent, between
2008 and 2011, thus missing the target set for 65 percent. The absenteeism rate of health
workers declined modestly from 31 to 28 percent, though missing the target of 25
percent. Finally, the proportion of health facilities without stock-outs for tracer drugs
increased significantly from 28 percent to 43 percent, though still missing the target of 65
percent. In summary, little progress was made prior to 2011.

       Most recent UN data on immunization, which extend the data presented above
suggest some gains (Figure 3.6), though in the case of DPT3 and BCG, there appears to
have been further decline between 2011 and 2013.

  The Immunization Rates indicator is widely regarded as a good proxy for the overall strength
of a government’s public health system (Becker et al. 2006).

Notes: Child immunization rate, BCG is the percentage of children ages 12-23 months who received vaccinations
before 12 months or at any time before the survey for BCG. A child is considered adequately immunized after one
dose. Child immunization DPT measures the percentage of children ages 12-23 months who received DPT vaccinations
before 12 months or at any time before the survey. A child is considered adequately immunized against diphtheria,
pertussis (or whooping cough), and tetanus (DPT) after receiving three doses of vaccine. Child immunization rate
hebb3 for hepatitis B is the percentage of children ages 12-23 months who received vaccinations before 12 months or at
any time before the survey. A child is considered adequately immunized after three doses. Child immunization hib3
measures the percentage of children ages 12-23 months who received vaccinations before 12 months or at any time
before the survey. A child is considered adequately immunized against Hib3 after receiving three doses of
Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine. Child immunization rate pol3 for Polio is the percentage of children ages 12-23
months who received vaccinations before 12 months or at any time before the survey. A child is considered adequately
immunized after three doses. Child immunization for measles measures the percentage of children ages 12-23 months
who received vaccinations before 12 months or at any time before the survey. A child is considered adequately
immunized against measles after receiving one dose of vaccine.

       Moreover, any limited progress achieved cannot be fully attributed to the PRSC.
There were a number of other major donors in the area of immunization such as the
Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) that supported immunizations
with substantial funding.

         There is evidence that overall access to maternal services has improved. There is a
significant gap between urban and rural households, as well as across wealth quintile,
however. There is almost a 40 percentage point difference between rural and urban
households as well as the richest and poorest wealth quintile who deliver in a health
facility (figure 3-7).

         Also, the share of institutional deliveries (or deliveries attended by a skilled birth
attendant) has stagnated at around 41%. This is a key contributing factor for Uganda’s
failure in achieving the MDG 5 on maternal mortality (GoU, 2013b). Around one-third of
pregnant women attend antenatal care services. During consultations, it was frequently
reported that most women attend the first Ante-Natal Care (ANC) session and many
attend the second session. However, significantly fewer pregnant women attend all four
ANC sessions. The reasons include low trust in usefulness of services and difficulties in
funding transportation to clinics. Security, transportation, and health sector linkages in
delivery of health services to women are especially important to the poor women in rural
areas.

        Access to contraceptive services is generally low. Data show an increase from
less than 20% of women in ages 15 to 49 using or having access to some type of
contraceptive in 2005 to 30% in 2011. Further information on gender sensitive outcomes
are provided in Annex C. During consultations several sector experts noted that, for
example, the distribution of condoms is generally incomplete and only cover certain parts
of the country, predominantly the urban areas. The hard-to-reach areas, which were
targeted by the operation, continue to have less access to contraceptives.

        The PRSCs directly supported staffing in health facilities through policy actions
aiming at reducing vacancy rates for medical workers in hard-to-service locations, and
improving the ratio of approved posts filled by qualified health workers. However,
progress has been sluggish. The field survey conducted by the evaluation team28 finds
that most health units are understaffed. Only 19 percent of the respondents stated that
their unit was fully staffed in all categories. Health assistant and midwife positions are
particularly lacking, contributing to the poor results outlined above. Respondents also
indicated that the most difficult staff to attract were midwives followed by health

  A number of level III health units were surveyed. More information on methods can be found
in Annex B.

assistants and senior clinical officers. This is particularly true for hard-to-reach areas.
Regarding staffing improvements, 48 percent of respondents indicated that the staffing
situation has improved since 2009 and 50 percent state that it has not (figure 3.8).

        Improving access to education. This objective was set to be measured through a
number of outcome and intermediate outcome indicators including: primary pupils
passing PLE with grades I-III at public primary schools; girls in public primary school
passing PLE with grades I-III; vacancy rates in primary and secondary schools in hard-to-
service locations; and number of teachers at work in 12 districts with the weakest
education sector indicators. The PRSC sought to achieve these indicators through the
following actions such as the signing of performance contracts with head teachers in the
12 Districts with the weakest education sector indicators, and a new teacher allocation
formula.

         The main outcome indicator was primary pupils passing PLE with grades 1-3.
This outcome improved from 262,000 in 2008 to 316,000 in 2011, higher than the target
for 2013 of 284,000. (MoES 2013). This is related to the action of providing more
teachers where they are needed and incentivizing head teachers with performance
contracts. This indicator would also have been more informative if it had been expressed
in percent of primary pupils in view of high population growth and new cohorts of
students. The other outcome indicator is, indeed, expressed in such terms. The percentage
of girls passing grades 1-3, in fact, increased from 45.2 in 2008 to 48 percent in 2011
compared to the target of 46 percent in 2013. (MoES 2013). However, other relevant
outcome indicators such as the dropout rate and net enrollment rate were not considered
by the operation.
                                             57


        There has been a substantial increase in access to education at both primary and
secondary level, with equal rates of enrolment between boys and girls at primary level,
although girls still lag behind boys in secondary school enrolment. Completion rates at
primary 7 have also risen for girls from 54% in 2004 to 67% in 2013, but there has been a
decline for boys from 72% to 67%. There are very low survival rates to primary 7,
indicating that the majority of pupils have dropped out by this point (31% survival rate
for both girls and boys in 2013).

       Net primary school enrolment rates (NER) have increased significantly since
2004, and peaked in 2011 (figure 3.9). Rates have since declined, but remained at around
93 percent (male 92.9%; female 94.6%) in 2014. This indicates that now there is almost
an equal NER of boys and girls. These figures mask significant regional differences in
enrolment at primary level. For example, in Karamoja in the North the NER for boys was
45% and for girls 43% in 2013, whereas, in Buganda in the Central region the NER was
89% and 91% for boys and girls respectively in 2013 (MoES, 2013: Sector Performance
Report).

       There has been a significant increase in secondary school enrolment since 2004 as
shown in the figure below. Secondary school enrolment has risen from 697,507 (male

There is still a substantial gender gap, with girl’s enrolment lower than boys (figure

        The NER at secondary level has improved as it was at 14.5 % in 2004 (15.5%
boys and 13.6% girls). This increased to 24.1% in 2014 (22.4% boys and 23.3% girls).
Similarly, the GER has risen from 17.2% in 2004 (19.1% boys and 15.3% girls) to 28.1%
in 2014 (29.1% boys and 28.1% girls) (MoES, 2014: Sector Performance Report). There
are significant regional differences in terms of secondary level NER. For example, in
Busoga in the Eastern Region there was an NER of 35% for boys and 31% for girls in
2013. In contrast, Karamoja in the North had an NER of 5% for both boys and girls
(MoES 2013).

        Primary level completion rates at primary level 7 fell between 2004 and 2008
from 62% to 45% and then increased again to 70.3% in 2012, before falling back to 67%
in 2013 as shown in the figure 26 below. Completion rates rose for girls from 54% in
2004 to 67% in 2013, but there has been a decline for boys from 72% in 2004 to 67% in
2013. Completion rates varied between districts with the highest completion rate in 2013
in Nwoya in the Northern Region at 191% (255% for boys and 127%) for girls and the
lowest in Amudat, also in the North at 7% for both boys and girls in 2013.

       This is counterbalanced by a very low survival rate to P7, which has changed little
since 2004 when the survival rate was 28% (boys 27% and girls 29%). By 2013 the
survival rate was 30% (boys 30% and girls 29%), this is in contrast to a 65% survival rate
in 2002 (MoES 2014).

        The PRSCs emphasized the importance of teachers through its policy actions. The
field survey of the evaluation team found that the qualification of teachers is not always
adequate, and that timely allocation to schools is lacking (figure 3.12).

        An econometric analysis was undertaken by the evaluation team, looking at basic
correlates between access and quality of education and various inputs including funding.
The aim was to establish whether there was any link between sector outcomes and sector
funding and other inputs supported by the PRSCs. The analysis highlights a number of
specific determinants of improved gross enrolment ratios, such as the number of teachers
relative to the school age population, the number of classrooms and adequate seating
space. Some of the estimated effects of specific sources on school enrolment differ
between boys and girls. The analysis also indicates that the number of students per
                                                     60


classroom, seating spaces, as well as the qualification and number of teachers influenced
PLE pass rates or primary completion rates. Box 1 provides an overview of the findings.
More detail can be found in Annex B.29

Box 3-1. Key factors contributing to access in education
 Primary and secondary enrolment ratios (access)
 Districts improved their gross enrolment ratios (GERs) in primary and secondary over
 time with increased provision of:
 Schools: 1 additional school per 10,000 children of primary school age increased the
 male and female GERs in primary by 1.5 to 2 percentage points and somewhat less at
 secondary level.
 Classrooms: 1 additional classroom for all schools led to a roughly 3 pct. point increase
 in the male and female GERs at primary level and to 1 pct. point increase at secondary
 level
 Adequate seating and writing space: 1 additional space in all classrooms raised the male
 and female GERs in primary by 0.5 to 1 pct. points and by 0.2 pct. points in secondary.
 Teachers: 1 more teacher per 1,000 children of primary school age produced an increase
 of 1 pct. point in male and female GERs at primary level and of 0.3 pct. points in the
 female GER in secondary.
 While the positive signs of the effects usually hold for both boys’ and girls’ enrolment,
 the magnitudes of the impacts are often different for the two and may trigger a change
 in the enrolment gender gap.
 Boys benefited from:
 New primary and secondary schools
 Additional classrooms and seating/writing spaces in secondary;
 Upgrading schools to the highest class: expanding 10 % of the schools to grades P7
 (primary) or S6 (secondary) increased male GERs by about 2 and 0.5 pct. points,
 respectively.
 Girls benefited from:
 Classrooms and spaces in primary;
 Increasing shares of girls-only secondary schools;
 Number of gender-segregated latrines (somewhat mixed evidence)

  These findings are convergent with those of other studies. Using data from 2006-2010, an
earlier study carried out by the World Bank found that, at primary level, teacher attendance,
school size as determined by enrolment, and the availability of toilets and first aid services at
school, explained 13 percent of the variation in the proportion of students who pass the PLE in
grades 1-3. However, key inputs such as trained teachers showed no significant association with
the percentage of students passing this exam (Mulindwa Najjumba, I. &J. H. Marshall 2013).

        On balance, there has been a significant increase in access, and there is evidence
that the PRSCs contributed to this through both financing and an emphasis of teachers.
However, achievements in access this has not been matched by an equivalent rise in the
quality of education. This is due in part to the education budget being spread thinly, given
partly as a result of the government’s policy of expanding access at both primary and
secondary levels. This was undertaken without increasing resources to the sector.

Improving access to water and sanitation

         There were two prior actions in PRSC8: (i) The Recipient has, in accordance with
paragraph 15.2 of the Letter of Development Policy, section on economic management,
ensured that: (a) actual annual budget releases for the sum of conditional grants to each of
the four JBSF sectors (health, education, water and sanitation, and roads) were at least
95% of the corresponding approved budget allocations for the Fiscal Year 2008/2009; (b)
budget releases for the sum of recurrent wage expenditure across the four sectors, the
sum of recurrent non-wage expenditure across these sectors, and the sum of development
expenditures across these sectors were in each case at least 95% of the corresponding
approved budget allocations for the Fiscal Year 2008/2009; and (c) the Recipient’s
Treasury has made budget releases to Spending Agencies on a quarterly basis, through
the end of the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2009/2010 (PRSC8); and (ii) Water and
Sanitation: In accordance with paragraph 15.4 (iii) of the Letter of Development Policy,
section on effective delivery of and improved access to core public services, the
Recipient has provided evidence satisfactory to the Association that water user
committees under a community based maintenance system are actively functioning in at
least 50% of Districts, and within these Districts at least 40% of water points are covered
by water user committees. In PRSC9, there was one prior action: to pilot the country-
wide establishment of water user bodies for water-for-production facilities, starting with
at least 18% established and functional bodies, and pilot the contracting of private
operators to handle day-to-day maintenance of large water for production facilities (dams
and valley tanks with capacity exceeding 40,000 m3, starting with at least one large
facility), all in accordance with the Manual for Water-for-Production Management
Systems.

         Access to water and sanitation was measured through outcome indicators
including: improved water sources that are functional at the time of spot check at rural
and valley levels; people accessing hand washing with soap facilities; and pupil to
latrine/toilet stance ratio in schools. Prior actions included (i) water user committees
under a community based maintenance system are actively functioning in at least 50
percent of districts, and within these districts at least 40 percent of water points are
covered by water user committees; and (ii) the recipient piloted the country-wide
establishment of water user bodies for water-for-production facilities, starting with at
least 18 percent established and functional bodies, and has piloted the contracting of
private operators to handle day-to-day maintenance of large water for production
facilities (dams and valley tanks with capacity exceeding 40,000 m3, starting with at least
one large facility, all in accordance with the Recipient's Manual for Water-for-Production
Management Systems.

        Uganda continues to make modest progress toward achieving targets on safe
water access and sanitation. Access to rural water stabilized, and increased from about 63
percent in 2008 to 64 percent in 2013. The 2015 MDG and PEAP targets are 62 and 77
percent, respectively. Sanitation coverage has increased substantially however. The share
of rural population with effective sanitation coverage was 68.0 percent in 2009 and
increased to 74.6 percent in 2013. The 2015 MDG and PEAP targets are 72 and 80
percent, respectively. Hand washing with soap was 14 percent in 2008 to 33 percent in
2011, but no 2013 values were provided. (WESPR 2013)

        Access to safe water has gradually improved over the past decades and the
positive trends continued during most the evaluation period although some stagnation can
be observed in recent years. The percentage of rural population served with safe water
raised from 57% in 2003/04 to 65 % in 2008/09 (table 3-6). Similarly, there is an overall
positive trend in rural sanitation coverage. Some geographical disparities persist in terms
of access to water and sanitation in the country but the situation has improved along with
increased access to water and sanitation over the past decade.

        The water and sanitation sector is faced with challenges that undermine recent
gains. These include low functionality of water facilities in rural areas and water for
production facilities, owing to weak Community Based Maintenance Systems (CBMS),
weak LG capacity, weak private sector capacity, and poor quality of construction. To
address these challenge, prior action were aiming for the recipient piloting the country-
wide establishment of water user bodies for water for production facilities, and
contracting of private providers to maintain facilities. Outcome: 71 percent of water
sources in valley tanks and dams in 2012 were functional at the end of the program,
substantially exceeding the target of 24 percent.

        The percentage of people in rural areas who reported using safe water sources
increased overall from about 20% in 1991 to 60% in 2002. Rural access to safe water in
2003 is not mentioned, whereas for 2003/04 the indicator value is at 57%. Over the
period of review, overall access to safe water has increased from 57% to 64% (figure
3.13). The increase was notably in the period 2004 – 2007, coinciding with the period
before the JBSF; after that, the rural safe water coverage more or less stagnates.

        Between 2003/04 and 2012/13, urban water coverage increased gradually from
65% to 70%. Data on variations across the regions or by socio-economic groups are not
available. A factor explaining the steady increase in urban water supply coverage is that
within the sector, the urban water and sanitation sub-sector receives sufficient funding for
reaching its targets, at the expense of the rural water supply sub-sector. The share of the
budget allocated to urban services is larger than the rural sector budget: 46% as compared
to 39% (JWSSPS mid-term review, p. 18), whereas 85% of the population lives in the
rural areas. Another factor of importance is that implementation of water supply schemes
has become more cost-efficient and effective with the introduction of the deconcentrated
Water Supply Development Facilities (WSDFs).

        Domestic sanitation is the responsibility of the household, and the water and
sanitation sub-sector is not mandated to fund improvements, apart from support through
community mobilisers. Monitoring of sanitation coverage is done by the Ministry of
Health, and the information is reported in the SPRs. The trend in rural safe sanitation
coverage are provided in Figure 3-14.

        It should be noted, that the definition of a safe latrine in Uganda is stricter than
that from WHO/UNICEF’s Joint Monitoring Programme, as also shared latrines are
counted as improved sanitation facilities.

        As highlighted below, some positive evolutions can be observed in school
sanitation for girls. In primary schools, the number of separate girls' toilets with door
and/or shutter per 1,000 girls has increased by 27% between 2006 and 2012 (figure 3.15)

         Apart from the evolution in school sanitation for girls, there is no evidence on this
indicator. Generally, access to sanitation is improving, but the gender sensitiveness of
this is not known.

Improving access to roads

         Prior action under PRSC8 was provision of evidence that: (a) the board of
directors as well as the executive director of the Road Fund have been appointed, and (b)
Cabinet has approved a policy on strengthening national construction industry. Under
PRSC9, the prior action were (i) the collection of data on the condition of national,
district, urban and community access roads and the establishment of a baseline; and (ii)
the establishment and operationalization of a monitoring and evaluation framework to
measure key road sector performance indicators.

         The outcome indicator is the percentage of roads is in fair-to-good condition.
Against a baseline of 65 percent in 2008, at series closure fair-to-good condition roads
were 77 percent, slightly short of the target of 80 percent. While this constitutes
substantive progress, the relation to the prior actions mentioned above is not strong, since
the latter focus mainly on the management of the road fund and policy for the national
construction industry as well as data collection. Moreover, the Bank may have
contributed to this outcome outside the framework of the PRSC series through parallel
investment projects (e.g. 2010 Transport Sector Development Project; US$190 million).

Outcome
        Given high relevance of objectives and substantial relevance of design, substantial
achievement of the objective of greater value for money and modest achievement of the
objective of improving access to services, overall outcome is rated as moderately
satisfactory.

Risk to Development Outcome
         Given the governance challenges, risk to development outcome is rated high.
While significant improvements were achieved regarding upstream governance
institutions, implementation is lagging, and corruption continues to be perceived as
widespread. Lack of policy focus on enforcement and related political patronage are key
risks to the achievements made in the areas of greater value for money in governance and
public financial management as well as priority social sectors.

       Achievements made in access to basic social services are under threat primarily
because of the underfunding directly related to low domestic revenue mobilization in the
context of substantially reduced aid levels, including budget support from the Bank.

        Government showed commitment to PRSC policies, which supports sustainability
of the operation. The Government independently expanded the coverage of actions
supported by the PRSCs and completed many of the PRSC 10 triggers despite the fact
that the operation was dropped.

Bank Performance
Quality at Entry

        The preparation of the two operations drew on lessons generated from the Bank’s
substantial experience of policy lending in Uganda. Particularly noteworthy is that the
results framework improved significantly since the series 5-7, with much more cohesion
in the results chain. The Bank selected sectors of strategic relevance to include in the
operations and adopted a more limited number of sound prior actions. The program
design did not however include a sufficiently specific monitoring and evaluation
framework. Moderately satisfactory.

Quality of Supervision

        The Bank appropriately postponed disbursement for PRSC 9 in response to the
corruption scandal in the Prime Minister’s office. Subsequently, the Bank engaged with
the Audit Office and the Inspectorate General to strengthen key governance institutions.
In addition the Bank helped the Government to develop a high level action matrix with a
strong focus on governance and PFM. The completion of this allowed the Bank to
disburse the credit. On balance bank, performance is rated Satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
Government Performance

        The Prime Minister’s (PM’s) office with the support of the Ministry of Finance
performed well as a designer, negotiator and implementer of the PRSC series. All prior
actions were met. MOFPED was proactive and responsive. For example, with respect to
PFM the MOFPED actively pursued good practices in monitoring, reporting,
transparency and controls, and incorporated them into the design of PFM legislation. In
the event, this led to the passage of the state-of-the-art Public Finance Management Act
in March 2015. The PM’s office staff were committed to results measurement, which led
not only to an improved results framework for the PRSC series, but also much improved
reporting by the line ministries on their annual performance.

        Serious concerns regarding value for money were raised by misappropriation of
funds. The government responded adequately and engaged the Bank effectively through
the High-Level Action Matrix (HLAM) process in which the government agreed and then
delivered on the key HLAM agreements. In implementing the HLAM, the GOU made
significant progress and regained some of the trust that was eroded in the process. On
balance, Government and Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation
        M&E Design. The M&E framework for PRSC 8-10 was a significant
improvement from the previous series although there remained weaknesses. It is closely
related to the National Development Plan (NDP) and was part of an intensively
                                            67


negotiated Joint Action Framework, which had government, Bank and other development
partner buy-in.

        The framework was to be managed through the government’s coordination
framework for poverty reduction reforms and implemented through the Office of the
Prime Minister. The impact of the reforms the program supported was to be monitored as
part of the results framework for the National Development Plan. Sector Working
Groups, which coordinated with the JBSF technical and policy dialogue task force, would
monitor sector performance. A multi donor trust fund financed a Technical and
Administrative Support Unit whose purpose was to collect data, evaluate impact, and
write studies relevant to the JBSF. The experience with past PRSCs helped to guide the
selection of indicators, which had more realistic targets, were monitorable within the time
period of the program and to some extent could be related to the actions of the program.

        M&E Implementation. The data collection methods were part of the
government’s statistical processes and of its reporting framework, and the data were
collected as planned. The executing agencies knew the objectives of the operations and
which data to collect and update as they became available, although with some
shortcomings related to the mapping of objectives into policy areas.

        M&E Utilization. The data tracked advances in the program. They were used to
justify a suspension of disbursements of PRSC and other budget support funds whenever
there was evidence of major reallocations of expenditure in ways incompatible with the
program’s goals. This occurred, for example, during the elections of 2011, when the
government used budget funds originally intended for the social sectors to finance large
spending increases in other areas. Rating: substantial.

Lessons
       Two main lessons emerge from this assessment of PRSC8-9 series.

      Achievement and sustainability of development outcomes are facilitated by
       careful attention to political economy dimensions, both at the design stage and
       when making changes in a DPO series. For example, the failure to increase
       revenue mobilization over a long period of time, which was not addressed under
       the program, was directly related to the political economy of political patronage
       and large, entrenched tax exemptions and culture of non-compliance.
      DPOs can show improvements in design and outcomes when they actively use
       lessons from the past operations as well as integrate important technical
       knowledge products (such as CEMs and PERs). Such lessons can also inform the
       Bank to take proactive, if difficult measures such as the cancellation of an
       operation.

Gender

  1. The 1995 Uganda Constitution recognized equality of men and women and made
     provisions for ensuring women’s participation in decision making at all levels of
     Government. The number of women in the Uganda parliament increased from 18
     percent in 2000 to 35 percent in 2012. In 2009, Parliament passed three landmark
     laws: (1) a 2010 law on Domestic Violence and the 2011 Domestic Violence
     regulations; (2) the anti-Female Genital Mutilation Act of 2010; and (3) the anti-
     human trafficking law passed in 2009. Progress in implementation of these laws has
     however been limited. The Marriage and Divorce Bill has been a source of contention
     for more than thirty years. Parliament has repeatedly resisted this Bill, which has the
     potential to fundamentally reform power relations between husbands and wives.

  2. A Ministry of Gender, Labor and Social Development (MGLSD) was set up in 1989,
     with a mandate to establish mechanisms for gender mainstreaming at different levels
     of national and subnational government. Under the MGSLD, the National Gender
     Policy was developed in 1997, and updated in 2007. The Act has provided guidance
     for nationwide gender mainstreaming across key sector Ministries, including at the
     local level. The Local Government Act 1997 provided for affirmative action for
     women’s representation at various local government structures at lower level.
     (Gibson et al.) A mid-term review of the Government’s National Development Plan
     (NDP) finds that Women’s participation at lower government levels has largely been
     ineffective due to low education levels of women and soci-cultural and economic
     constraints faced by women. (Government of Uganda 2013)

  3. An overview of women’s ability to access institutions, quotas, and rights is given in
     table 1. Uganda is put in comparison with Tanzania, Kenya, and Rwanda. As outlined
     above, Uganda performs well, and is comparable to its peers, regarding constitutional
     rights and quotas. The quotas for women in parliament are only a little behind those
     of Tanzania, and Kenya. While there are no legal quotas for women on corporate
     boards, this is not the case in any of the comparator countries. Regarding rights of
     women, unmarried woman can apply for a passport the same way as a man. This is
     not the case for married women. In Tanzania and Kenya, married women continue to
     be treated the same way as men. In Rwanda, neither married nor unmarried women
     can apply the same way men can. Regarding the other indicators, Uganda performs
     well and on par with Tanzania and Kenya. Rwanda is significantly more discrimatory.
     Regarding division of labor within marriage Uganda also performs well and better
     than Rwanda, but protecting a wife’s interest is lagging as the does not provide for
     valuation of nonmonetary contributions during marriage, in contrast to Tanzania and
     Kenya. Men and women do however have equal property rights. Further inheritance
     laws discriminate. Female and male surviving spouses as well as sons and daughters
     do not have equal inheritance rights to property.

    4. Overall educational attainment is low compared to peers. While there appears to be
       gender parity in enrollment, drop-out rates for girls are significantly higher, which is
       reflected in completion rates. Of women aged 25 and older 37 percent completed
       primary schooling, which drops sharply to 23 percent for lower secondary schooling
       and 2 percent for tertiary education. While these figures are significantly worse in
       comparison to Kenya, the apparent gender gap is also significantly wider – especially
       regarding women with completed primary education (see table 2). A more nuanced
       picture emerges from the completion of primary education as a share of the relevant
       age group, which currently is about 50 percent for both girls and boys. While this is a
       major improvement from the population by large, Uganda lags significantly below
       Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Low Income Country (LIC) average (see figure 3).
       Gibson et al (2014) note that gender parity prevails in secondary education, however
ANNEX B                                               106


              no data were available to confirm these findings. Tertiary education is heavily biased.
              Enrollment for every 100 men is matched by only 26.9 women. While the literacy
              rate for male and female in Uganda is higher than its peers and substantially so of the
              region, a significant gap between male and female remains. While 65 percent of
              women are estimated to be literate, male literacy is estimated 18 percentage points
              higher. Further details on completion rates, enrollment ratios, and literacy, are
              provided in table B. 2.

           5. Uganda has a very high fertility rate. The total fertility rate in 2014 stands at 5.96,
              which is significantly higher than the SSA average of 5.11 and also higher than that
              of Tanzania, Rwanda, and Kenya which have 5.28, 4.61, and 4.45 respectively. Some
              progress, has been made regarding adolescent fertility (women aged 15-19) but at
              126.6 per 1,000 women it remains well above SSA and LIC average. The SSA
              average stands at 108 in comparison. Rwanda in contrast has made significant inroads
              into adolescent fertility rate, which is four times lower (33.6). The share of women
              first married by age 18 is also significantly higher than that of its regional peers, and
              stands at almost 40 percent. Significant inroads have been made in maternal
              mortality. The ratio per 100,000 is estimated significantly lower than the SSA and
              LIC average of, but remains nevertheless high at 360. After an encouraging period of
              decline maternal mortality has increased again slightly in 2014, which is in part due
              to increasing HIV prevalence and pregnancies for young women (Gibson et al 2014).

6.      Labor force participation is high with little discrimination between men and women.
A large gap regarding access to financial institutions however remains. The labor force
participation rate (proportion of population aged 15 and older that is economically active) is
at 78 percent well above the SSA average (71 percent) and Kenya (68 percent), but
significantly below the rate of Tanzania and Rwanda (about 90 percent). The ratio of female
to male labor force participation has been consistently good, at close to 100 percent, and well
above the SSA and LIC average which have consistently been just over 80 percent. (see
figure B.3) The labor force participation of 15-24 year olds is above the SSA average and
female are almost on par to male. The labor force participation in Kenya of 15-24 year olds is
significantly worse for women than for men in comparison. Access to financial institutions
for women in Uganda however is well below the SSA average. Only 15 percent of women
hold an account at a formal financial institution, comparing to 26 percent of men. (see table
B.4).

Online stakeholder survey
Overview of the main findings
General findings
    o The authorities consistently rate the contribution of budget support to the
      implementation of reforms higher than the donors and the non-state actors, and sector
      budget support seems rated higher than general support by most actors. This reflects
      the government's long-standing preference for budget support as an aid instrument.
    o Budget support seems to have contributed to greater harmonization and coordination
      of donors.
    o In terms of upstream policy formulation, PFM, education, health, and water and
      sanitation are best rated sectors, and agriculture, roads and transport, and gender
      (again with higher rating by non-state actors) the worst.
    o Budget support is universally viewed as contributing to better fiscal and overall
      macro-management.
    o The contribution of budget support to M&E is rated modestly (about 1.2 on the scale
      0-3) by all actors.
    o In most cases, the stakeholders have rated the respective sectors consistently over all
      categories (i.e. one sector has either received only positive or only negative ratings).
      There are however some exceptions to this observation: Health and education scored
      well in most categories but received low ratings for service quality; PFM was rated
      very positively across the board with the exception of budget credibility.
Findings by sector
    o Public Financial Management (PFM) is one of the highest scoring sectors across all
      dimensions. The majority of the respondents rate capacity development efforts in this
      sector highly and state that budget support fostered dialogue in the sector, which in
ANNEX B                                     110


       turn contributed to better formulation of policies. There is also agreement among the
       respondents that PFM reforms at large have advanced over the last years. However,
       when it comes to budget credibility, opinions are not uniform. Development partners
       and non-state actors rate progress in that sector more modestly than Ugandan
       government officials.
   o   Budget support operations in the education sector have been rated positively.
       Capacity development activities and sectoral dialogue score high and there is
       agreement that reforms have advanced and produced positive results in the area of
       access to education. When it comes to the quality of education, opinions are mixed
       and especially development partners see this area rather critically.
   o   The results in the health are similar to those in education: Respondents agree that
       capacity development activities and sector dialogue have made a positive
       contribution, reforms have advanced and access to health care services has
       progressed, while the quality of services is rated less positively.
   o   Budget support in the Water and Sanitation is viewed positively by all actors and
       scored well in all dimensions, especially in the area of improved access to services.
   o   Gender mainstreaming and equality has been rated poorly. Most respondents agree
       that capacity development and policy dialogue have had little effect and have not
       helped to improve the mainstreaming of gender issues into the reforms. In terms of
       outcomes, the stakeholders see little progress in gender equality in public
       administration and service delivery.
   o   Other: JLOS and local governance sectors have received average scores while the
       agriculture and roads were the sectors that received the poorest results (apart from
       gender, which is not a sector, but a cross-cutting issue).

Purpose and structure
The stakeholder survey was primarily geared towards the collection of information on issues
related to the design and implementation of BS operations. A few questions were
nevertheless pitched at a higher level to cover issues linked to policy reform efforts and
progress achieved in terms of development outcomes. The survey was targeted towards
national level stakeholders (including government officials across the different line ministries
and institutions, development partners and non-state actors) directly involved in BS
operations.

The questionnaire featured six sections. The first two sections are very short and aimed at
identifying the type of respondent and his/her involvement with BS operations. Sections
three to six are longer and aimed at gathering information on the effects of BS operations
across the three central levels of the comprehensive evaluation framework for the evaluation
of budget support, i.e. direct outputs, induced outputs and outcomes.

The questionnaire was structured – with a couple of exceptions - in a series of closed
questions with a rating scale 0-3 (plus the “don’t know” answer). In addition, respondents
had the possibility to further develop their answers through optional text boxes for
comments.

Respondents

Four target groups were identified:

   o     Government and other national institutions;
   o     World Bank;
   o     Other development partners; and
   o     Non state actors.
The survey featured the same set of questions for all categories of respondents, although -
according to the group and the question - there are differences in the depth of the replies and
the views expressed. Around 300 resource persons with contact details were identified
drawing on various sources of information.

The table below provide some details on the final respondents, including number of
respondents by category.

Field survey
Overview of the main findings
Local Administration

   o The broad majority of surveyed LG officers stated that the per capita funding of their
     administrative unit has increased over the last 5-10 years.
   o Most transfers from national/district governments are allocated with conditions and
     delays in the receipt of funds are an important problem.
   o Most respondents agree that decentralization of budgeting and planning has made a
     positive impact on many areas of the budget process, especially financial and
     operational planning and the participation of local stakeholders.
ANNEX B                                     112


Health Units

   o HR very problematic, most health units are understaffed and midwives are especially
     hard to find. Timeliness of staff allocation is also a problem
   o Physical resources are mostly rated insufficient. Medical supply as notable exception,
     strong improvements in the last 10 years.
   o Predictability and stability of funding of the health units is low.
   o Schools
   o Teachers are often allocated to schools with significant delays.
   o Physical resources are mostly judged inadequate for the good functioning of the
     schools.
   o Predictability and stability of school funding is problematic.

Purpose and sector focus
The field survey collected data from local (indirect) beneficiaries of budget support for three
key purposes. First, to provide a picture of the institutional setting and resource situation in
which financial planners and providers of public services operate – factors that are directly or
indirectly addressed by budget support. Second, to reveal challenges in planning and service
provision that have affected the way how potential benefits of budget support may have
triggered down to the local level. Third, to identify determinants of service and development
outcomes.

Financial planning and service provision was studied in different administrative units and
sectors. The questionnaires and interviews covered the local government administration at
district and sub-county levels, as well as a large number of service providers (but not their
end users). The survey focused on the sectors of education and health, including some
questions on Water and Sanitation as well. Service providers in the two focal sectors
included public primary and secondary schools, as well as public health units at levels II
(parish level) and III (sub-county level).

Thematic focus
The survey covered the following thematic areas:
   o Policy and development challenges
   o Financial planning and funding
   o Interaction with public administration at higher levels and administrative capacity
   o Policy changes including decentralization
   o Development and service provision outcomes
   o Physical resources including water and sanitation
   o Human resources including technical capacity
   o Role of service unit management committees and service staff
   o Gender issues in budgeting, service delivery and development outcomes
   o Challenges in post-conflict areas.

Institutional arrangements

The internal Research and Evaluation Unit of BRAC Uganda, with support of BRAC local
offices in the survey districts, led the organization and implementation of the survey. Its main
responsibilities included:

   o contracting of local enumerators and interviewers in the survey districts
   o provision of one week of enumerator and interviewer training in the organization’s
     country office
   o comments on the setup of the survey and the survey instruments
   o programming of electronic versions of the questionnaires for data collection via
     mobile phones
   o liaison with local stakeholders for obtaining authorizations and logistic preparation
   o collection of all quantitative data and conducting semi-structured interviews in the
     field
   o monitoring of data quality
   o preparation and delivery of the final datasets and interview notes.

Sampling strategy

Districts

The selection process for districts was based on logistical constraints; local context
(economic conditions; health service availability/accessibility; access to education;
administrative history; roral/urban balance; and poverty. The table below gives an overview
of the eight districts selected.

Sub-counties

Below the district level, administrative units were randomly selected through cluster
sampling. The sampling framework for sub-counties included all 79 sub-counties located in
the eight selected districts, as per administrative division 2014 (available from Uganda
Bureau of Statistics and other sources).

Service providers

The cluster sampling approach continued at service provider level. Schools and health units
were random sampled or universally covered (depending on their type) within the previously
sampled sub-counties. Both random sampling and universal coverage minimized selection
bias that could have arisen, for example, from selecting service units based on accessibility
by road.

     Except for school enrolment.
 Even though Zombo was less affected by conflict than Lira, the modules for post-conflict areas
31

were applied as well.

Notes: Each cell entry shows the estimated percentage point change in the given enrolment ratio induced by a one-unit
change of the variable in the given row.
*, ** and *** denote statistical significance (effect different from zero) at 10 %, 5% and 1%, respectively (marked in bold in
the main specification).
The unit of observation is the mother district as per district division 2006. All variables refer to primary schools in the
district. Gender gap = outcome for boys minus girls. Standard errors (not reported) are clustered at the district level (for
fixed effects estimation) or robust (Arellano-Bond estimation). Additional independent (control) variables include:
population of (i) boys and (ii) girls of official primary school age (6-12 years), share of schools located in rural areas, share
of schools in periurban areas, school average of distance in km to District Education Office, share of schools within 1 km
distance to nearest main water source, average number of textbooks per school, % of underqualified (i.e. licensed or
Grade II) teachers, share of schools with more than two inspections per year, total of other central government transfer in
previous fiscal year and a dummy for the years after the split of the mother district (if any)

Notes: Each cell entry shows the estimated percentage point change in the given enrolment ratio induced by a one-unit
change of the variable in the given row.
*, ** and *** denote statistical significance (effect different from zero) at 10 %, 5% and 1%, respectively (marked in bold in
the main specification)
The unit of observation is the mother district as per district division 2006. All variables refer to secondary schools in the
district. Gender gap = outcome for boys minus girls. Standard errors (not reported) are clustered at the district level (for
fixed effects estimation) or robust (Arellano-Bond estimation). Additional independent (control) variables include:
population of (i) boys and (ii) girls of official secondary school age (13-18 years), shares of schools located in (i) rural and
(ii) periurban areas, school average of distance in km to DEO, share of schools within 1 km distance to nearest main water
source, average number of textbooks per school, share of schools with > 2 inspections per year, central govt. transfers in
previous fiscal year for: (i) SCP and (ii) total of other transfers, and a dummy for the years after the split of the mother
district (if any)

The econometric analysis for the Education sector estimates the contribution of various
inputs provided under GoU sector policies and programs – financial, physical and human
resources – on outcome indicators for educational access and quality at both primary and
secondary level. The unit of observation is the district in a given school year (2006-2013).
The main data source is a comprehensive extract of micro data from the Educational
Management Information System (EMIS) – the national school census – provided by the
Ministry of Education and Sports. Further data sources include population estimates by based

on data and procedures of the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBoS), PLE results reported by
the Uganda National Education Board (UNEB) and fiscal data for central government
transfers to districts collected in the World Bank’s BOOST database. The result is a panel
dataset with annual observations for all districts of Uganda for the period 2006-2013.
Coefficient estimates are largely obtained via panel data estimation with district fixed effects,
which exploits only changes in variables within districts over time.
