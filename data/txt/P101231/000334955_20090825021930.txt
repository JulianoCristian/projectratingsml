                  Seventh Poverty Reduction Support Credit (443 1-UG)
                   Release o f the Second Tranche - Full Compliance

                               Tranche Release Document

1.    The Board approved the two-tranche Seventh Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSC 7, Cr. No. 4431-UG) o f SDR 125 million on M a y 7, 2008 to support the
Government o f Uganda's third Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP 111).

2.     Following the Board decision, the Financing Agreement for PRSC 7 was signed on
June 13, 2008 by the Borrower and the International Development Association (IDA). The
Credit was declared effective on December 9,2008 with the first tranche o f SDR 62.5 being
released upon effectiveness.

3.      PRSC 7 was the third and final budget support operation in a development policy
lending series under I D A 1 4 which included PRSC 5 and PRSC 6. This three operation
series was integral to the Bank's Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy (UJAS) discussed by the
Board on January 17, 2006. Unlike previous PRSCs in Uganda, which were annual single
tranche operations, PRSC 7 was designed as an exceptional two tranche PRSC in order to
provide time to harmonize future PRSCs under a new joint budget support framework with
other donors. The second tranche was made conditional upon; (i)          the Government
maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment, (ii) Government approving the
                                                          the
FY2008/09 Budget consistent with the PEAP and i t s medium-term growth objectives, and
  i ithe
( i ) Government submitting to Cabinet draft proposed amendments to the procurement
law and regulations.

4.     The total amount o f funding under PRSC7, at SDR 125 million represented an
increase o f SDR 41.7 million compared to the PRSC6 o f SDR 83.3 million. However, the
two tranches were designed to disburse into two different fiscal years, amounting to a
reduction by SDR 20.8 million in Bank annual support under the PRSC7 in light o f slower
than expected implementation o f policy actions.

5.      The overriding themes o f the broader PRSC 5-7 series were to support the
Government in delivering better services and to create a better policy environment for
economic growth and poverty reduction. A core focus o f the program was therefore on
supporting actions under the fourth pillar o f the PEAP3, on "good governance". This
included actions to strengthen commercial courts, public financial management, budget
reporting, public procurement, public sector management and accountability, and the
framework for decentralization.

                                       .
                                      I Background

6.     The PRSC5-7 series in Uganda continued to support a policy and institutional
framework which has yielded solid results in terms o f growth and poverty reduction.
During the implementation o f the government's poverty reduction strategy under the three
                                              2


successive PEAPs, the number o f households who live under poverty in Uganda has fallen
impressively (down to 31 percent in 2005/06 from 44 percent in 1997 and from 38 percent
in 2001/02). Economic growth has remained high with annual real GDP growth averaging
8.3 % over the last 5 years to 2007/08 in the face o f exogenous shocks, including the global
food crisis and a Ugandan energy crisis. This growth performance i s all the more
impressive coming several years after the initial stimulus to the economy from post-conflict
rebound and one-off privatization, price and market reforms had worn off. During the
1990s growth averaged 6.5 percent annually, some 1.8 percentage points lower per year.

7.      The core focus o f the PRSC 5-7 series remains highly relevant, even as thinking
about the PEAP in Uganda has evolved. For the last 2 years o f implementation o f PEAP3,
Government of Uganda has begun to reorient the country's development strategy, placing
higher emphasis on sustaining the continued rapid pace o f economic growth that the
country has enjoyed, whilst striving to accelerate structural transformation o f the economy
into manufacturing and services to create jobs o f the world's fastest growing workforce.
This reorientation i s fully consistent with the Bank's advice in the 2006 Country Economic
Memorandum. It i s now being reflected in the annual budgets, and the evolving 5-year
National Development Plan (NDP) will have the theme o f "Growth, Employment and
Prosperity". T o sustain rapid growth and achieve export-led structural transformation,
Government's main emphasis is, rightly, to seek to avoid the fast growing economy from
running up against more infrastructure shortages, particularly in road transport and
electricity sectors. The annual budgets for 2007/08 and 2008/09 included large increases in
funding for electricity and roads projects. The reorientation o f policy towards infrastructure
has underscored the importance o f the core focus o f the PRSC7 program on supporting
actions o n the PEAP's "good governance" pillar. Given the high share o f contracts in
infrastructure sectors, reforms to the public procurement laws are now even more important
to the achievement o f good governance under PEAP3, and are even more important to
getting value for money from Uganda's budget than previously.

8.      The PRSC7's focus on institutions and reforms in public sector management and
accountability also remains highly relevant to the renewed focus o n infrastructure, because
these issues are the key to achieving better efficiency and economy in public spending.
Consistent with the 2007 Public Expenditure Review, Government recognizes that Uganda
needs to find additional fiscal space to pay for what amounts to a sizeable scaling up o f
investments in roads and electricity, whilst maintaining ambitious targets for human
development for a growing population - such as universal primary and secondary education,
as well as free basic health care. The Government and the Bank have assessed that creating
sufficient fiscal space for scaled up infrastructure in the medium-term without
compromising improvements in other services, will require comprehensive public sector
management reform and greater accountability to realize efficiency gains and to get better
value for money in public spending. There i s limited scope for a rapid increase in revenue
mobilization in Uganda, and aid volumes could prove less reliable with the onset o f the
global crisis. A main focus o f the Joint Budget Support Framework which succeeds PRSC7
will therefore be supporting reforms in public spending for service delivery, where the
potential for getting more outputs for a given level o f spending i s greatest.
9.      Better public sector performance and hence better efficiency in public service
delivery in Uganda i s impeded by entrenched governance problems in public administration
and public sector management. These areas in most need o f substantial reform are also
areas o f relative weakness in Uganda's CPIA ratings relative to other IDA countries.
Uganda performs considerably better than average .for IDA countries (and the Africa
region) on economic management (with high macroeconomic, fiscal, budget and structural
CPIA scores) but only average or even below average on service delivery, PSM, efficiency
o f revenue mobilization, quality o f public administration, and transparency, accountability
and corruption.

10.     The continuation o f reforms in the areas which were supported under the PRSC5-7
series therefore remains essential for successful execution o f the Government's nascent
strategy for growth, structural transformation and human capital development which will
succeed PEAP3. Implementation progress under PRSC7 should be a strong predictor o f
progress under the new series.

                             1 . Recent Economic Developments

11.      The global financial crisis i s slowing down the rate o f growth o f Uganda's economy
by reducing FDI, private transfers, reducing tourism receipts and lowering the price o f
Uganda's exports. Growth in 2008/09, though down from the 9.5% achieved in 2007/08,
was s t i l l an impressive 7%. Real growth i s expected to slow to 6% in 2009/10. But
Uganda entered the crisis following several years o f growth with strong fundamentals and
prudent policies. This strong initial position means Uganda can in the short-term afford to
use counter-cyclical policies without threatening macro stability. The pro-growth fiscal
policy stance already adopted pre-crisis amounts to an appropriate stimulus package for the
economy.

 12.    Uganda's banking sector i s isolated from the defaults and risks in the international
system. The banking system - though small - i s stable and strong, with very limited
exposure to the sub-prime market or to foreign currency debt. Uganda's foreign exchange
reserves at US$ 2.7 billion were equivalent to about 6 months o f imports by June 2008.
Fiscal policy was already geared towards addressing infrastructure constraints for growth.
Consequently, Uganda was shielded against the first round crisis effects, except for the
temporary instability in the foreign exchange market during October 2008 as some off-
shore investors retracted their portfolio investments.

13.     During 2008/09, some noticeable effects on the balance o f payments were felt
through reduced remittances (by about U S $ 300 million), reduced export prices, and a
decline in FDI to 3.3 percent o f GDP (half o f 6.7 percent recorded in 2007/08). Exchange
rate depreciation towards the end o f 2008 and into early 2009 allowed the private sector to
adjust, but private investment slowed slightly. Fiscal revenues were 0.2 percentage points
o f GDP lower than budgeted in FY2008/09. Government responded mid-year with an
offsetting trimming o f public expenditure in non-essential activities. By the end o f the fiscal
year, slower than planned expenditure o n roads because o f project implementation delays
                                                4


meant Government did not need to draw o n their sufficient room to use domestic financing
or to draw down ample reserves to maintain the 2008/09 fiscal program.

14.     Inflationary pressures driven by higher food and fuel prices, persisted into 2008/09.
At 14 percent by end-March 2009, inflation was almost triple the target o f 5 percent. With
about 5 percentage points o f this on account o f external shocks, it i s envisaged that inflation
will decline as these global food price pressures continue to subside. Following the global
economic crisis, the real exchange rate depreciation during 2008/09 should allow for the
necessary adjustment in the economy, as the balance o f payments position worsens. And
although tighter monetary policy during the early months o f the crisis was followed with a
rise in interest rates, this has been reversed as monetary policy hedges towards an easier
stance to support growth, as the risks o f rising inflation to growth subside.


                         1.
                        1 1 Progress against Tranche Release Criteria

15.         Overall progress in implementation o f the Government o f Uganda's medium-
term strategy to sustain broad-based growth and reduce poverty has been satisfactory. The
main issue under PEAP3 implementation - that Government needed to re-orient towards
more o f a growth focus - has not materially affected the relevance o f the PRSC series for
the reasons set out above. However, the lack o f a technical framework for sequencing and
prioritizing reforms- under PEAP3 has been both a cause and a symptom o f capacity
weaknesses in policy formulation and implementation. With limited implementation
capacity, Uganda should set out to do less and to focus on what needs doing most.
Otherwise, Government runs the risk o f not implementing what i s most needed.

 16.       Implementation o f some o f the more important reforms identified under the
governance pillar o f PEAP3, and supported under the PRSC5-7 series, has been subject to
increased political economy constraints and has been less satisfactory. With the advent o f
contestable multi-party politics in Uganda, populism, patronage and party funding have
become increasingly more important factors in determining the feasibility o f reforms than
they were under past PRSC series. Meanwhile with a genuine opposition, Parliament has
become more vociferous. These political factors are a natural consequence o f Uganda's
increased political maturity and bring new challenges. They are most seriously and directly
constraining progress in the areas o f public sector reform, anti-corruption, decentralization
and public procurement. But they also pervade the sequence and prioritization o f reforms,
and the pace o f implementation. This happens because in contrast to the past situation in
Uganda, technocrats have less freedom than in the past to design policy making.

 17.       The first two second tranche conditions were chosen to limit disruption to
funding in the transition to a harmonized joint budget support framework, whilst ensuring
that the minimum entry criteria for budget support were met. The third condition revising
the procurement law originally was agreed by Government as a prior action for Board
discussion but was not met in time for the Board meeting. Given i t s importance, it was
therefore amended and carried over into the second tranche. Bank experts were invited by
the government to j o i n a technical task force that would bring the procurement law and
                                               5


regulations to acceptable standards. Government expected the revisions to be completed by
September 30th, 2008. This was an indicative review date, not a deadline for the prior
action to be met. N o deadline was set for the prior action in the Financing Agreement for
the credit which i s set out in paragraph 24 below. Meanwhile Government agreed to and
has fulfilled some additional undertakings including a review o f 1,000 procurement cases to
offset the original lapse in amending the procurement law. These are being used by the
procurement agency to inform the development o f actionable indicators o f compliance with
procurement procedures. These indicators have been proposed to Government for inclusion
in the joint budget support framework which will succeed PRSC7.

 18.        Condition 1: Macroeconomic environment: I n accordance with paragraph 13(9
 o the Letter o Development Policy, the Recipient has, to the satisfaction o the
  f              f                                                               f
Association, maintained a stable macroeconomic environment, as shall be evidenced by a
joint review with the Association.

19.        The Bank staff reviewed the macroeconomic environment with Government in
November 2008 and again with the IMF in April 2009. Strong and prudent macroeconomic
management policies kept Uganda's economy resilient and stable in the face o f exogenous
shocks in 2007/08 which came in the form o f floods in the East and high food and o i l
prices. Real GDP growth in 2007/08 remained surprisingly strong at 9.5 percent. Growth
in 2008/09 slowed down slightly to 7 percent as Uganda felt the impact o f the global
downturn. The authorities' response to the initial effects o f the international financial crisis
and the subsequent global slowdown has so far been appropriate and prudent.

20.        This condition i s considered as met.

21.        Condition 2: FY2008/09 Budget: I n accordance with paragraph 13(ii) o the
                                                                                 f
Letter o Development Policy, the Recipient has approved the FY2008/09 budget consistent
        f
with the PEAP and its medium-term growth objectives.

22.          Consistent with the Government's PEAP and medium-term growth objectives as
well as with Bank advice under the CEM, the 2008/09 budget continued to scale up
expenditures on electricity and trunk roads (with the creation o f a National Roads Agency).
Also consistent with the Bank's Public Expenditure Review o f 2007, this scale up was
accommodated through a prudent widening o f the fiscal deficit compared with the PEAP
target. This amounts to a slowdown in the Government's fiscal consolidation strategy, not
a change in the strategy. Government also halted in the 2008/09 Budget the recent trend o f
declining conditional grants for non-salary health and education spending at District level
and held firm on pay increases. With new funds flowing to infrastructure sectors, the
shares o f the budget going to service sectors and productive infrastructure rose relative to
the shares for security and public administration.

23.        This condition i s considered as met.

24.       Condition 3: Amendment to the Public Procurement and Disposal Act and
Regulations: I n accordance with paragraph 13(ii) o the Letter o Development Policy, the
                                                   f            f
                                               6


Recipient has' submitted to the Cabinet the draft proposed amendments to the Public
Procurement and Disposal Act and Regulations, as shall be evidenced by submission to the
Association ofpublished draft amendments.

25.         Under the PRSC 6, the Public Procurement and Disposal o f Asset Authority
indicated the main areas o f weakness in the PPDA Act. Under PRSC 7 it was initially
agreed that government would prepare a draft o f revisions to address these weaknesses.
These were to be subject to review and comments by the World Bank and were to be
approved by Cabinet by January 3 1, 2008. PPDA prepared the draft amendments, but the
quality was not acceptable to the Bank. The Government then set up a Technical Working
Committee (TWG) to take over the preparation o f the Amendments. The Bank's
procurement experts were members o f the Technical Working Group. Given the
importance o f this reform, the Government proposed to include this undertaking as one o f
the triggers for the release o f second tranche funding under PRSC7, with the revision that it
would be submitted to Cabinet rather than approved by Cabinet (paragraph 45 o f Report
                                                     iio
No. 43229-UG). As set out in paragraph 11.3 ( i ) f the Letter o f Development Policy,
Government intended to submit the revised law to Cabinet and Parliament by September
2008. However, progress in agreeing upon satisfactory amendments through the TWG was
further delayed. In February 2009 the Ministry o f Finance submitted to Cabinet principles
for the proposed amendments to the PPDA Act. These were discussed by Cabinet in June,
2009. Following that discussion some o f the proposed Amendments were rejected, and
others introduced which weaken certain sections o f the Law. The most significant
weaknesses include; the deletion o f provisions that clarify the applicability o f the law to the
procurement and disposal o f land, assigning PPDA the power to permit deviations from
Competitive Procurement Methods, and the introduction o f force account as a procurement
method. The Bank team has notified the Government o f these weaknesses, and discussions
are continuing. In line with condition 3, the proposed Amendments were submitted to
Cabinet in July 2009.

2 6.       This condition i s considered as met.

                            IV. Conclusion and Recommendation

27.        In view o f the overall performance and progress with the implementation o f the
program supported by the Credit, and in compliance with the specific conditions o f release
as described in paragraphs B1-3 o f Schedule 1 o f the Credit Agreement, the Association has
informed the Borrower o f the availability o f the second tranche in the equivalent o f SDR
62.5 million.
