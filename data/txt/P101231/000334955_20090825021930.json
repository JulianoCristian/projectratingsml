Seventh Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit (PRSC 7) was the third and final budget support\n            operation in a development policy lending series under the\n            fourteenth International Development Association (IDA14)\n            which included PRSC 5 and PRSC 6. This three operation\n            series was integral to the Bank's Uganda Joint\n            Assistance Strategy (UJAS) discussed by the Board on January\n            17, 2006. Unlike previous PRSCs in Uganda, which were annual\n            single tranche operations, PRSC 7 was designed as an\n            exceptional two tranche PRSC in order to provide time to\n            harmonize future PRSCs under a new joint budget support\n            framework with other donors. The second tranche was made\n            conditional upon: (i) the Government maintaining a stable\n            macroeconomic environment, (ii) the Government approving the\n            FY2008/09 budget consistent with the Poverty Eradication\n            Action Plan (PEAP) and its medium-term growth objectives,\n            and (iii) the Government submitting to cabinet draft\n            proposed amendments to the procurement law and regulations.\n            The overriding themes of the broader PRSC 5-7 series were to\n            support the Government in delivering better services and to\n            create a better policy environment for economic growth and\n            poverty reduction. A core focus of the program was therefore\n            on supporting actions under the fourth pillar of the PEAP3,\n            on 'good governance'. This included actions to\n            strengthen commercial courts, public financial management,\n            budget reporting, public procurement, public sector\n            management and accountability, and the framework for decentralization."}, "docdt": "2009-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
