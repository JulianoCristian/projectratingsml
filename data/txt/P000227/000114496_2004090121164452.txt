Excellency:
Re:
Credit No. 2494-BU (Social Action Project)
Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
Please refer to the Development Credit Agreement (the Agreement), 
dated June 10, 1993, concluded between the Republic of Burundi (the 
Borrower) and the International Development Association (the Association), 
for the Project referenced above.
Further to the discussion held between the representatives of the 
Borrower and the representatives of the Association during the last 
supervision mission and subsequent to your request dated June 30, 1996 
regarding an increase of certain thresholds for the review of procurement 
decisions by the Association as well as a reallocation of the proceeds of 
the Credit, we are pleased to inform you that the Association accedes to 
your request and proposes that the Agreement between us be amended as 
follows:
1. 
The table set forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Agreement 
is replaced in its entirety with the new table set forth in the Annex to 
this letter.
2.
Schedule 3 to the Agreement is modified to read as follows:
(i)
in paragraph (a) of Part D, the figure “$ 50,000” is replaced 
with the new figure “$ 75,000”;
(ii)
the existing paragraph of Section II is modified by inserting 
the number “1.” at the begining of the said paragraph; and
(iii)
a new paragraph 2 is added to read as follows:
“2.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this 
Section, the provisions of the Consultant Guidelines 
requiring prior review of the Association or approval of 
budgets, shortlists, selection procedures, letters of 
invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts, 
shall not apply to: (a) contracts for the employment of 
consulting firms estimated to cost less than $50,000 
equivalent each; (b) contracts for the employment of 
individual consultants estimated to cost less than $20,000 
equivalent each; or (c) contracts for the recruitment of a 
consulting firm or independent consultants recruited for 
on-site supervision of works.  However, said exceptions to 
prior review of the Association shall not apply to: (i) the 
terms of reference for such contracts; (ii) single-source 
selection of consulting firms; (iii) assignments of a 
critical nature, as reasonably determined by the Association, 
such as the recruitment of the Project staff and auditors; 
(iv) amendments to contracts for the employment of consulting 
firms raising the contract value to $50,000 equivalent or 
above; or (v) amendments to contracts for the employment of 
individual consultants raising the contract value to $20,000 
or above."
Please kindly confirm your agreement with these amendments by

provided therefore and by returning to us one duplicate original duly
