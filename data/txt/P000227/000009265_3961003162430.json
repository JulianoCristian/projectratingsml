{"cdata!": "The main objectives of the project are\n            to:  (i) involve larger segments of the population in the\n            growth process by encouraging a deeper participation of poor\n            individuals in small-scale productive activities; (ii)\n            improve the living conditions of the population through\n            employment generation and better social services and\n            infrastructure; (iii) foster the participation of local\n            governments and non-governmental agencies in\n            development-related activities; and (iv) improve government\n            capacity to formulate and implement economic and social\n            policies through a better monitoring of the social situation\n            and a better knowledge of the patterns of poverty in the\n            country.  The Social Action Program will be mainly targeted\n            at the poor (especially women and unemployed/underemployed\n            youth) and will support:  (a) income generating activities;\n            (b) rehabilitation of basic social infrastructure such as\n            primary schools and basic health facilities; (c) enhancement\n            of small basic economic infrastructure such as bridges and\n            feeder roads; (d) promotion of priority social activities\n            such as family planning, food supplementation and literacy\n            programs; and (e) development of local nongovernmental\n            organizations, mainly through technical assistance and\n            training. The Poverty Monitoring Program will contribute to\n            set up a household and community survey system to produce\n            socio-economic data necessary for following the evolution of\n            living standards over time, identifying population groups\n            for targeted assistance, and designing and assessing the\n            country's development strategy to promote growth among\n            the poor.  The component includes the processing and\n            analysis of existing household budget surveys, targeting\n            vulnerable groups, and launching new household and community\n            surveys. Critical elements of this component are capacity\n            building for statistic services and demand-driven studies\n            and analysis of the information collected for improving\n            policies and programs."}, "docdt": "1993-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
