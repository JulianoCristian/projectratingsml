F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
1. To increase and diversify agricultural production and exports through intensifying land
use, increasing productivity per hectare, and introducing new crops and modem varieties.

 2. To increase and stabilize the agricultural incomes of about 120,000 small and
medium-sized commercial farms.

  3. To improve the effectiveness of basic agricultural support services to increase the
international competitiveness of agricultural products, by introducing new and more
productive technologies, increasing quality and improving sanitary conditions of products,
and eradicating diseases that limit access to international markets.

  4. To improve rural productive infrastructure to reduce production and marketing costs,
through a significant reduction in the risk of losses (crops, livestock, equipment and
facilities), as well as more efficient use and better conservation and management of
natural resources.

  5. To strengthen national and provincial institutional capacity to formulate and analyze
sectoral development policy, as well as to identify, prepare and implement investment
projects. '

  6. To rationalize public investments and promote an expanded private sector role (e.g.,
farmers' organizations, NGOs, and service providers) in agricultural development.

 1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

 1.1 Context at Appraisal

  1.1.1 Country background: In the five years preceding project appraisal in 1997, Argentina
  had initiated a major reform program to streamline the public sector, transform the monetary
  system and shrink the foreign debt, thus restoring public confidence in the market as primary
. driver of economic growth and monetary stability. Inflation was sharply reduced, the tax structure
  simplified, many state enterprises were privatized and economic· relations were restructured
  between the national and provincial governments. A pillar of this program was the fixed
  exchange rate regime (Convertibility Plan) ensuring that the monetary base was fully-supported
  by international reserves. These reforms expanded exports and foreign capital inflows, with
  further positive outcomes from the advent of MERCOSUR and stronger economic ties to Brazil.
  In 1995, Argentina slipped into a serious but short-lived recession stemming from the Mexican
  financial crisis, with fast recovery validating the national benefits of the Convertibility Plan.
  However, this crisis aggravated existing problems at the provincial level, while national poverty
  levels were again rising after declining for several years, with higher incidence in rural areas.

 1.1.2 Sector context: Argentina's strong comparative advantage in agriculture and agro-
 industrial production - with minimal public support or protection - and promising prospects for
 sustained sector growth and exports were further enhanced by these macro-economic reforms.
 Yet the sector remained the slowest-growing in the national economy, chiefly due to a
 combination of low international prices, high domestic interest rates, discriminatory policies and
 negligible capital investment. A land-extensive agriculture· provided few opportunities for fast
 responses to new macro-economic conditions. Long-term agricultural diversification depended on
 better technical services: animal and plant health, extension, irrigation systems and quality control.
 With decentralization, the future of such services rested increasingly with the provinces but their
 limited experience and technical, financial and institutional constraints restricted their ability to
 formulate agricultural plans, implement projects and deliver agricultural services. Meanwhile, the
 re-defined role of the State slated the private sector as the chief provider of most such services,
 and cost recovery as an increasing focus.

1.1.3 Rationale for Bank involvement: A series of earlier Bank and joint Bank/IDB-
supported operations at the federal level in provincial development, agro-credit, institutional
modernization of sector agencies, and forestry development, prompted provincial governments to
demand mechanisms for strengthening agricultural support services and financing high priority
investment projects in rural areas. Bank support for the sector was justified as a catalyst to
environmentally sustainable economic development, employment creation, .more rational public
investment in the sector and export growth. PROSAP was deemed consistent with the 1995
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and its progress report of 1996 in important, specific
provisions/features: consolidation of macro-economic reform, poverty reduction and job creation,
and infrastructure rehabilitation and improvement.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

1.2. I As stated in the Staff Appraisal Report, the Project Development Objectives (PDO) were
to: (i) increase and diversify agricultural production and exports through intensifying land use,
increasing productivity per hectare, and introducing new crops and modern varieties; (ii) increase
and stabilize the agricultural incomes of about 120,000 smalt and medium-sized commercial
                                                   ..   ~




                                                  1
farms; (iii) improve the effectiveness of basic agricultural support services to increase the
international competitiveness of agricultural products, by introducing new and more productive
technologies, increasing quality and improving sanitary conditions of products, and eradicating
diseases that limit access to international markets; (iv) improve rural productive infrastructure to
reduce production and marketing costs, through a significant reduction in the risk of losses (crops,
livestock, equipment and facilities), as well as more efficient use and better conservation and
management of natural resources; (v) strengthen national and provincial institutional capacity to
formulate and analyze sector development policy, as well as to identify, prepare and implement
investment projects; and (vi) rationalize public investments and promote an expanded private
sector role (e.g., farmers' organizations, NGOs, and service providers) in agricultural
development.

1.2.2 Project performance indicators were tied closely to seven Bank-supported, pre-defined,
priority subprojects with potentially high impact, known as Group A. Each defined subproject
had its own matrix of Development Impact Indicators which in aggregate were intended to
measure PD~ achievement (see 1.5.1,2.1.3 and Annex 2 for more details).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/j ustification

 1.3.1 As noted in the Data Sheet (Section F), a further sub-objective was added to PROSAP
under a project restructuring in 2002 in response to Argentina's economic and social crisis: 1
"Improve maternal and child health through the delivery of quality services, and to strengthen
disease surveillance and control activities, all for purposes of reducing the acute risk of disease in
the Borrower's territory", No related performance indicators were added.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The primary target group was some 120,000 small and medium-sized commercial
farmers whose agricultural incomes - as stated in the PD~ - would be increased and stabilized.
The entire rural population of the subproject areas would also benefit indirectly. In addition,
national and provincial institutions in the rural sector and associated with the project would
benefit from improved capacity to formulate and analyze policy, and to promote public/private
coordination, as a result of project-financed institutional development activities.

1.5 Original Components

1.5.1     The project planned to finance the following components:

(a)      Investment Subprojects (about 93% of total project cost), presented by
participating/eligible provinces based on their agricultural strategies and investment priorities.
Eleven subprojects designated as Group A - seven of which were intended for Hank financing,
and four for financing by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) - were described in the
SAR as pre-defined and appraised for immediate launching following effectiveness. Similarly; a



I US$20.0 m of Loan funds were reassigned from PROSAP to Government's Health Emergency Program through an amendment to
the Loan Agreement dated October 16,2002. The amendment added two new parts to the project description (Parts C and D) to fund
emergency activities under the Bank-supported Maternlll and Child Health and Nutrition 2 Project (pROMlN). The PROSAP loan
was reduced by 16%, from US$125.0 m to US$105.0 m. The 2007 Additio.nal Financing was intended, inter alia, to restore this
funding which, in a situation of rising subproject prices, had created a financing gap for the project.



                                                              2
    second set of subprojects (Group B) had feasibility studies moving forward but were still at an
    early stage. When several provinces needed to address a common regional issue, e.g., animal and
    plant health threats, through coordinated actions, the project would finance national subprojects
    with multi~provincial coverage. To avoid a concentration of lending in a demand~riven
    framework, limits were placed on the aggregate permitted value of subprojects implemented by a
    single province or nationally: 25% and 30% respectively, of total project cost.

    (b)     Institutional development (about 2% of total project cost), strengthening national and
    provincial institutional capacity to define roles and coordinate activities between public and
    private entities, to formulate and analyze agricultural policy, and to design legal and institutional
    reforms facilitating the transfer of responsibilities to user groups.

    (c)      Project coordination and management, and monitoring and evaluation (about 5% of
    total project cost), at the national and provincial levels.

    1.6 Revised Components

    1.6.1   Components were not revised.

    1.7 Other significant changes

i .7.1 Restructuriug: Cumulative extensions of the Closing Date (Level Two Restructurings)
totaled 71 months, including an Additional Financing (AF, see 1.7.3). The original and final
closing dates were June 30, 2004 and May 30, 2010 respectively. The primary reason for most of
these extensions was to permit the completion of individual subprojects and full disbursement of
the Loan. Three extensions were directly related to the Additional Financing including the
bridging extension from June to December 2007 to ensure uninterrupted support while the
Additional Financing (see below) was processed and presented to the Board.

1.7.2 Reassignment of funds: As noted earlier, the original Loan - specifically Component 1
Investment Subprojects ~ was reduced in 2002 by U8$20.0 million to finance emergency
maternaVchHd health activities under the Bank-supported PROMIN II Health Emergency Project.
The transfer was justified as a cost savings and a reduction in scope at a time when PROSAP
implementation was sluggish, cancellation of at least part of the Loan was under discussion, and
the overall state of the Bank's Argentina portfolio was unsatisfactory.2

1.7.3 Addhimud Financing: An Additional Financing (AF) loan ofUS$37.0 m was approved
in 2007, to complete certain activities under the original project constrained by a cost overrun and
financing gap: The AF was justified as follows: 0) reassignment of US$20.0 m to Government's
health emergency program was not accompanied by any reduction in project scope; (ii) PROSAP
implementation surged with the economic recovery and renewed focus on the role of agriculture.
The project became the centerpiece of Government's agenda for promoting direct investments in
the      sector; and (iii) cost escalation from the the end of the Argentine currency convertibility
regime in 2001 along with dated subproject appraisals entailed the upward revision of most
subproject budgets.



1 Memorandum, November 8, 2006. The expectation in 2002 was that due to slow progress in project implementation and overall
unsatisfactory status of the Bank's Argentina portfolio, such reduction ill scope made sense. In practice, however, while PROSAP
funds were cut scope stayed the same.

2.1.1 Background analysis: The SAR portrays an exhaustively analyzed project, sourcing
from Bank, international and Argentine research documents, and supporting core CAS goals:
consolidation of macroeconomic reforms through economic growth; increased income and
employment; and, rehabilitation and construction of productive infrastructure. However, as
discussed below, key aspects of the 'analysis were incomplete with ramifications for effective,
timely execution.

2.1.2 Assessment of project design: Several elementsllessons were cited as essential for
successful agricultural development projects, but their reflection in project design was uneven.
Sound macro-economic and sector policies were expected to create a project-enabling context
"reducing tendencies to over-burden projects with multiple objectives" yet PROSAP was notable
for its numerous, internally complex objectives. Experience also suggested that project scale
should conform to an implementing agency's institutional capacity. While project components
were few and the framework simple, many Group A provincial subprojects were large operations
(ranging from US$5.0 m to around US$20.0 m) requiring sophisticated technical, analytical and
operational skills exceeding the capacity of many project institutions.

2.1.3 There was an inconsistency between the vision/concept and actual operational needs.
Design envisaged demand-driven, programmatic or loosely-defined activities - the project had no
strict funding target in terms of geographic location or subsector and the Group A operations
represented about 50% of total subproject cost, with the advantage of flexibility in determining
investment of the remaining 50%. But, reality mandated the disbursement ofUS$250.0 m in six
years, and thus readiness to launch rapidly and effectively - via a pre-defined pipeline - was
critical. This inevitably introduced rigidity including in the complex, closely~linked indicators
even if the vision was for subsequent investments to proceed/flow as conceptually envisaged.

2.1.4 Objectives and indicators: PRO SAP I was an old-style, programmatic loan originating
in the early-1990s. ThePDOs were numerous, internally complex, and not well-defined
quantitatively or qualitatively.3 Project Performance Indicators (PPI) linked closely to the Group
A, priority subprojects rather than the PD~ itself, and several objectives had no corresponding
indicators. Each Group A subproject had its own Log Frame but any linkage to the PD~ was
assumed, not described or justified, and there was no Log Frame for the project as a whole. The
tight linkage between the Group A subprojects and PPI meant that if the former did not proceed
(which actually occurred), the framework for measuring outcomes was also largely defunct.
While project monitoring and evaluation became an intense focus after the formal creation of an
M&E unit in the UEC in 2005, opportunities to formalize new PD~ indicators were missed. 4 A
set of updated PD~ indicators was developed in consultation with the Bank team to guide



3 Thismay be explained by the project's vintage. However, evidence suggests the POO framework was designed in collaboration with
IDB and was seen as the best compromise at the time, However, the IDB Completion Report cites the original PDO from the lOB
Loan Agreement as being to "increase the value of agro-Iivestock products by improving the quality and production volume of these
products", a much simpler construct. The ICR did not attempt to resolve this inconsistency.

4 For example, in 2003 post-crisis when many aspects of the project were reviewed/restructured; in 2005 when the M&E unit was
established; or, as part of preparation of the Additional Financing in 2006/07.




                                                                4
    analysis/evaluation after 2005, The ICR views the valuable products of this effort as
    compensating for the bureaucratic omission.

    2.1.5 Poverty targeting:                 had no explicit poverty focus and the project was not
    exclusively targeted to the poor, But. the project was expected to benefit many poor farmers
    especially in the north where the incidence of poverty was highest. Further, the project's income,
    employment and infrastructure goals were linked directly to the poverty reduction elements of the
    1995 CAS. TIle total value of production was expected to rise 45% over baseline, net incomes
    would rise between 25% and 50% in real terms, and about 120,000 farmers would see their
    standard ofliving improve (SAR, Annex 4 and Table 3.1).

2.1.6 Components and organia;ation: Components were few, and some 93% of available
funds financed demand..driven investment subprojects. Diagnostic studies durinypreparation
showed that investments were .Hkely to fal! into nine "areas of intervention" . While the
subproject selection process and provincial eligibility criteria were dearly-defined, the origins of
subproject proposals - the original Group A and subsequent substitutes - their fit/priority within a
provincial or national strategy, and the profile of intended beneficiaries, were somewhat opaque.
The potential implications for project resource allocation and cost-effectiveness have not been
studied but the lesson is reflected in the design of the fonow~on PROSAP II. The small allocation
for Institutional Development (US$5.0 m total, Bank and IDB, 2% of project total costs) seems
inconsistent with the SAR's recognition of serious capacity issues at aU levels in many provinces,
but was explained by the preparation          and confirmed by other project managers as reflecting
the long-standing reluctance of Argentine authorities to borrow for such purposes.

2.1.7 Financing: With an estimated total cost of US$3S7.2 million, the project was jointly-
financed by the Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) through two loans of
US$125.0 million each, representing about 70% of total estimated cost. The Federal and
Provincial Governments were expected to contribute US$90.0 m and beneficiaries US$17.2 m.
The critical mass of financing considered essential for PROSAP I mandated a collaboration
between two or more development institutions but PRO SAP was a co-financing in only the most
limited sense; each institution was to finance separate subprojects in parallel. Exceptions were the
institutional development and the coordination and management components under which the
Bank would finance technical                (TA) and consultants, and the IDB would finance all
other activities.

2.1.8 rusk mjt~gatiom Types of risks likely to influence the project were accurate as far as
they went, but suggested mitigation was superficial in some cases and certain risks were not
mentioned, Such analysis obviously could not            predicted the socio-economic crisis of 2000,
which affected the entire Bank portfolio in Argentina, and magnified the risks already identified
at appraisaL However, the belief that internal flexibility could mitigate shifting political priorities
was inconsistent with the quite inflexible Group A framework, which proved vulnerable to the
crisis and collapsed, Further, lack of readiness to implement (see 2.2.l(a» represented a major -
and unaccounted ~ project risk, crisis or no crisis. Also, while acknowledging acute weaknesses in
provincial experience and capacity - and citing the results of Bank research on technical
assistance - the project lacked a strategy for building sustainable capacity over time, and adequate

market development, agricultural information, production and regulation of food products, and strengthening of provincial agriCUltural
institutions.




                                                                 5
    resources to fund it. Last, it was unrealistic to expect/assume that improved infrastructure and
    increased productivity would ensure new capital flows, given historically low access to long-term
    credit in the agriculture sector and the chronic financing problems of smaller producers.

    2.1.9 Participatory processes: PRO SAP acknowledged the importance of beneficiary
    participation to project success, effectiveness and sustainability. Stakeholderslbeneficiaries in five
    provinces were systematically consulted during preparation using workshops, focus groups and
    interviews to define mechanisms for their participation throughout the project. Among a range of
    issues studied was how the project could strengthen water user associations' (WUA) capacity to
    administer their irrigation systems (SAR, Annex G). The extent of beneficiary participation
    during subproject proposal development and implementation however, may have been uneven.
    Research evidence on rural roads and other investments suggests it was, and this can have
    implications for beneficiaries' willingness to invest in, operate and maintain them. 6

2.1.10 Adequacy of government commitment: Acting on the request of the provinces for a
mechanism to strengthen agricultural support services and finance high priority investment
projects, the GOA asked the Bank and IDB, based on their extensive prior experience in
Argentina, to develop a comprehensive framework for supporting provincial agricultural
development. Recovery from a national recession in 1995 prompted by the Mexican financial
crisis again reinforced the importance of the agricultural sector as a major component/driver of
the economy, fostering strong official and political commitment - national and provincial - to
modernizing the sector. PROSAP was a direct outcome of this evolving situation and received
strong support and collaboration from the GOA and provincial authorities.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1         Factors affecting Project implementation and outcomes:

(a)       Readiness to implement: Hindsight shows that theSAR over-stated the readiness of the
Group A subprojects for implementation. 7 They variously lacked technical feasibility studies
andlor engineering designs, while some, even if technically ready, were sponsored by provinces
still lacking fiscal clearance for eligibility. Efforts to repolve these issues following effectiveness
were costly and protracted, involving massive inputs in consultant services and supervision by the
Bank and Borrower. This situation was further complicated by the hiatus between initial appraisal
of Group A in 1995/6 and project effectiveness in 1998, during which provincial priorities had
shifted, public finances weakened, and the relevance of some Group A subprojects to provincial
strategies had waned. AU but one of the 22 Bank-supported subprojects (seven national and 15
provincial) actually implemented were proposed/developed during or after the national crisis.8

(b)      Provincial eligibility: The criteria for provincial eligibility were justifiably stringent but
acted as a brake on progress following effectiveness. Difficulties surrounding the formulation of
these criteria - both in the Bank and with the provinces - delayed negotiation and Board approval



6   Participation was evident in Mendoza Province where potential beneficiaries derailed one subproject and forced relocation of another.

7 The SAR states in several places "to facilitate project start-up, a set of 11 priority subprojects (Group A - Bank 7 and IDB 4) was
defined, whose feasibility studies and engineering designs were ready by appraisal, representing more than 50% of total project costs".

8   Of the original Bank-supported Group A, only Montecaseros Irrigation (Mendoza Province) was implemented.




                                                                    6
of the project. 9 Initial provincial eligibility criteria discussed in the Bank and agreed with
Argentine authorities had few fiscal.pre-conditions but emerging signs of fragility in provincial
finances prompted the Bank to with-hold issuance of the Invitation to Negotiate pending on-site
analysis by Bank fmancial management specialists of the fiscal health of all provinces, a process
exceeding one year and resulting. in much tighter criteria,lO Provincial eligibility standards were
streamlined in 2001 but given the overall situation, this had little impact on facilitating provincial
access to the project, and demand for subproject investments was generally low; The improving
provincial fiscal health which accompanied the recovery in 2003 permitted smoother access for
many previously ineligible provinces.

 (c)     Flood emergency: Inundation of large areas of the country by severe floods soon after
effectiveness in 1998 affected crops, herds, harvests, and planned investments in improved
productive infrastructure including roads. Government's emergency program (PROEMER) -
partially financed by IDB. resources and by the Bank via the PROINDER project - absorbed the
time and attention of the Central Executing Unit (DEC) and provincial governments. Many DEC
and Provincial Executing Unit (UEP) personnel were seconded away from PROSAP
implementation to the flood relief effort.

(d)      Crisis and stagnation: The unprecedented economic and social decline starting in. 1999
and intensifying from 2000-2002, witnessed numerous changes of government and sector
authorities at the national and provincial levels and government's default on its· foreign debt
obligations. This virtually paralyzed PROSAP (and most projects in the Bank's portfolio),
hamstrung by the decline/loss of provincial capacity to borrow. Only two subprojects (one Bank
and one IDB) made any progress while most Group A subprojects were sidelined. SAGPyA had
five leadership changes in this periOd, and the DEC four different Executive Coordinators. Bank
disbursements were about US$4.0 million/year. Counterpart resources were scarce, civil works
contracts required re';'negotiation 'due to devaluation of. the .peso, and. no new subprojects
emerged. 11 Efforts were made to revise/restructure the PROSAP portfolio, and as noted,
provincial eligibility standards were streamlined, but the deepening crisis frustrated these efforts.
PROSAP's continuing weak performance prompted discussion in the Bank of cancellation, and
US$20.0 m were reassigned to other emergency activities (noted earlier).12

 (e)    Recovery and restructuring: Effective implementation of this project started in
2002/03. BanidBorrower com~itment to. a new approach at a time of economic recovery was
instrumental in reviving PROSAP and paving the way for its many successes. The improved



9 Criteria included: a current account. fiscal surplus in the most recent. full budget period before approval of access to PROSAP
investments; and, total proVincial debt service obligations below 15% of total current provincial revenues. Other provisions were made
for exceptional cases.                               .

10 The Bank also had several provincial-leveL operations underway with tough fiscallother frameworks and PROSAP needed to be
consistent Meanwhile, the IDB-financedactivities; approved in 1995, could not initiate disbursemer.t due to conditions tying IDB
disbursement to approval of the Bank· loan, with negative effects at the provincial level, noted in the Borrower Completion Report
(pROSAPIUEC, 2010). The rationale for tying the two loans in this way is hard to understand given the very limited overlap in
practice and the fact that not a single investment subproject was jointly-financed. They were really two parallel operations.

II IDB disbursements were comparatively high in this same period, mainly due to ongoing activities under PROEMER; the onset ofan
acute outbreak of foot and mouth disease (Aftosa) which closed international markets for Argentine meat and prompted a massive
herd vaccination campaign; and, more lenient provincial eligibility standards ..

12   The crisis impacted severely on the Bank's Argentina portfolio; about 50% of projects were rated Unsatisfactory in 2002-2003.




                                                                    7
macroeconomic environment with relative prices and terms of trade favorable to agricultural
production and exports boosted the project. Federal and provincial governments showed renewed
commitment to PROSAPobjectives which aligned closely with their rural recovery strategies,
and the project became an effective instrument for policy implementation. The provinces took
critical steps to strengthen their fiscal status.

(f)     Action Plan: The Argentina Country Management Unit (CMU), the Bank project team
and the Borrower developed a comprehensive portfolio improvement Action Plan (AP) in 2002 of
which both the reassignment of $20.0 m to Government's Health Emergency Plan and the
sequenced extension of the PROSAP closing date were activities. Other elements of the AP,
including enhanced supervision, benchmarking and restructuring of the PRO SAP portfolio,
renegotiation of civil works contracts to accommodate devaluation of the Peso, and continued
Bank support for public infrastructure investments were cited explicitly in the 2004 Argentina
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).

(g)      Project leadership and team continuity: This new period initiated an even closer, more
hands-on and proactive partnership between the Bank team and the UEC characterized by an
intense focus on quality, realism, flexibility, promoting commitment to the project model, and
strategic planning to improve overall performance and disbursements. New subproject proposals
were encouraged. The Bank project team, under new task management, informally "restructured"
the project, analyzing its portfolio to weed out/cull non-performing subprojects, eliminating the
quasi-earmarking of resources for subprojects which were not moving, and overhauling
subproject budgets in light of sharp cost escalation in this period. 13 The goal was to build shared
values among key institutions/stakeholders and to promote a medium to long-term vision of the
project's trajectory and goals. There was political fall-out in some provinces but most agreed with
the portfolio "cleansing", defending it as a necessary Bank requirement for access to PROSAP
investment. Of critical importance to the project's recovery and success in its second "life" was
the continuity of the effective UEC Coordinator, Bank Task Manager and core technical teams in
both institutions.

(h)      Complexity vs. capacity: Argentina enjoyed five years of strong growth following the
crisis and this undoubtedly boosted PROSAP's recovery and momentum, but it did not alleviate
the innate technical complexity of the subprojects or necessarily resolve institutional/capacity
issues. The implementation trajectory of many subprojects was much longer than expected with a
steep initial learning curve for all stakeholders. As noted in the BCR (UECIPROSAP 2010),
technical and administrative limitations in the VEC and provincial UEPIEPDAs affected the
proper identification and formulation of subprojects, the management of procurement as required
by the Bank and IDB, and the documentation of expenses for disbursement. Even so, rising
demand for new investments from recovering provinces stimulated a strong process of political
and institutional commitment to the program and evolution/growth in the ability of the UEC, UEP,
EPDA and network of service providers, to manage the subproject cycle.

(i)     Mid-term Review: The project Mid-term Review (MTR) in 2001, conducted jointly
with IDB, analyzed the reasons for extremely slow progress and disbursements (which stood at
about 6% of the Loan) based on an independent consultant diagnosis, results of provincial
surveys, and field yisits. The Bank team acknowledged, inter alia, the need for much faster Bank


13 There was an intensive effort to bring a new slate of subprojects into the PROSAP portfolio. Feasibility analysis was accelerated
and interested provinces were advised on what they needed to do to get proposals approved.




                                                                 8
"no objections" for provincial eligibility requests and for the prOcurement/contracting of
consultants and goods~ as well as for
                                    easing the eligibility criteria - nine provinces were awaiting
Bank approval at, the time. A detailed Action Plan (AP) was developed (see(f) above) and
discussed with high level GOk authorities and with 'diverse "stakeholders nationwide. It
prioritized the decentralization of deciSion-making and'-inany tasks- from the -VEC to -the
provinceslUEPs, and defmed actions needed for a quantum improvement in efficiency and
effectiveness. Most AP reconunendations were implemented with positive effects, but over a:
much longer period -than expected due to further -deepening of the national crisis -immediately
post-MTR.

2.2.2 Project at Risk Status: The project was declared at risk (i.e.; potential or actual problem -
project) at several poiJ1ts in the period from 2001-2004 due topoorluneven performance, although
many important measures had already been taken by 2002/03 --to re-establish the project's
credentials and accelerate execution.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation aDd Utilizatiob -

  2.3.1 Design: The planned project monitoring and evalUation scheme was as follows: creation
  of a Monitoring Unit within the VEC; a Mid-term Review; -and evaluation Studies by an
  independent agency covering impact, lessons learned and problem-areas in project execution. A
  notable innovation was training provincial implementing entities to -understand and adopt the
  project evaluation system, produce/prepare the required information and reports, draft terms of
. reference and supervise studies.                                                            -

2.3.2   Implementation and utilization:
    •   Established a well-staffed M&E Unit within the VEC in 200S.
    •   Steadily built - with Bank support - an analytical and _ evaluative -program resulting in an
        impressive body of diagnoses, completion and impact studies covering most project
        interventions, and linked. to the PD~ (see Annex 9).                                 -
    •   Disseminated major findings via annual/special seminars and workshops involving all
        relevant sector authorities and stakeholders at the national and provincial levels.
    •   Trained EPDAs in evaluation techniques (several subproject completion reports were
        prepared by EPDAs) database development/management, and promoted a culture of
        evaluation at decentralized levels.
    •   Established a PROSAP website <www.prosaponUne.gov.ar>with access to all project
        studies, and detailed information on project objectives, mechanisins and progress.
    •   Developed a strong database, used to prepare PROSAP II and this ICR.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Social: Project preparation included a social assessment identifying the main socio-
economic and cultural characteristics of rural areas across regions. A follow-up socio-economic
diagnosis was also made of indigenous groups in Chaco Province in 2004 including levels of
organization, land tenure situation, and traditional knowledge J;'egarding natural resources
management and agricultural production. The objective was to build'awareness of the cultural
and environmental appropriateness and sustainability of proposed project activities. This became
the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan under the AF. During implementation, a Bank social
scientist participated periodically in missions and field visits to monitor compliance and provide
guidance to the project implementation team.




                                                9
2.4.2 Environment: Efficient use and better conservation and management of natural
resources were project objectives and several subprojects sought and achieved these outcomes. 14
The OP (and AF) was a Category A due to the Chaco Province Linea Tapenaga Drainage and
Agricultural Development subproject which financed drainage improvements on 85,000 ha and
had its own site-specific Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP), consultedan4 approved
by the Bank. Most other activities were technically Category B.1S Project environmental behavior
was governed by an Environmental Manual. The projeCt's EnvironmentalAssessment (EA) was
updated for the Additional Financing to reflect.safeguards screening and evaluation results for
each subproject, including the newly-added Avian Flu activities. Environmental specialists
accompanied Bank supervision missions and'fapenaga in particular was supervised closely
throughout. The DEC has environmental specialists.on staff. No seriousenvironmental.problems
arose during project execution. See also 4.0.2.

2.4.3 Procurement: The project's procurement load was heavy due to the size, diversity, type
and technical complexity of the subprojects, and the continuous need for· specialist con.sultants.
The DEC procurement team was experienced and well-qualified; Bank Procurement Post-reviews
(PPR) up to 2009 rated procurement performance Satisfactory and risk as Average. An
Independent Procurement Review· in 2007 found that acquisitions and contracting· were using
acceptable technical and managerial practices and following Bank Procurement Guidelines and
provisions of the Loan Agreement. No evidence was found of deviation from Bank standards, or
of misprocurement. The Bank project team· worked closely· with the procurement specialist,
CMU and the UEC to follow up on recommendations of this review including by building
decentralized capacity to manage procurement more. autonomously. A Procurement Post-review
in 2009 however, raised the risk rating to High due to the decentralized nature of the project and
diverse agencies involved at the provincial level, plus evidence that some recommendations from
2008 had still not been addressed. The procurement rating .. was downgraded. to Marginally
Unsatisfactory which, in the absence of a follow-up PPR, remained the IJlting at project closing.

2.4.5 Two issues were problematic: (i) excessive delays in Bank processing of contracting and
procurement "no objections", mentioned by the BeR and independent subproject Completion
Reports. Procurement complexity explains much of·this delay but evidence also suggests that
insufficient manpower· was available to support the no objection workload in the Bank and
maintain a timely schedule of approvals; and (ii) delayed submission of SOEs by international
institutions contracted to support specific subprojects required sustained efforts from the Bank
and DEC to ensure the devolution of unused balances. 16

2.4.6 Financial Management/audit: Financial management (FM)performance was generally
satisfactory, as indicated by the audit archive,since no formal FM supervision missions assessed
the project prior to 2007. The Borrower sent FMreports regularly throughout and audit
performance was also acceptable. Formal Bank FM supervision missions rated the project
Satisfactory with an acceptable control framework and overall FM risk of Moderate. Audit

" The project was approved in 1997 before the new indigenous peoples and resettlement policies carne into effect.

16 Argentine pUblic agencies are under pressure to reduce staffing and this creates a problem for projects requiring high inputs of
specialized professionals. To circumvent the complex chain of approvals required by project agencies. to contract needed expertise,
international entities assumed this function, essentially sub-contracting expertise on behalf of the project.




                                                                10
 performance starting in 2000 was generally satisfactory with opinions on Financial Statements
 and Special Opinions either Unqualified or Qualified-Exception with no significant issues. Audit
 delivery tended to be delayed, but from 2007 on, compliance with the Bank's deadline was good.

 Post·completion Operation/Nex.t Phase

 2.S.1 Transition arrangements to regular operations: All subprojects implemented are in
 the public domain and aU provinces have established procedures and charges for their use,
 although transitional arrangements were not planned in depth at appraisal. Certain subprojects,
 such as irrigation, require organized user involvement and arrangements vary. Some provinces
 need to continue investing in social and institutional capital during the transition period/after. In
 the case of animal and plant health/sanitation, there are potential transitional risks from technical
 and organizational weaknesses in monitoring and vigilance, but not so much from the interruption
 of programs due to changing political andlor economic priority. The smooth transition of
 provincial subprojects depends on a jurisdiction's development level, financing capacity and the
 sector. National institution-building subprojects exposed to political turnover and financing shifts
 require rational budget policies and cost-sharing, including with the private sector. The transition
 of all the national subprojects into mainstream status depends on the extent to which they are
 clearly and deeply rooted in the national plan.

 2.S.2 Operation and Maintenance: Project design fostered the repayment of O&M costs for
 irrigation and rural road improvements to inculcate beneficiary ownership and promote
 sustainability. The emphasis on O&M, and on partial repayment of investments by beneficiaries,
 was an important tool for reducing the fiscal impact on provinces. The project was comparatively
 successful in these goals and PROSAP II is continuing this approach, with the expectation that
 beneficiaries will totally absorb O&M costs longer-term to ensure· sustainability. The following
 summarizes the status of O&M at closing.

 2.5.3 irrigation: The Bank financed five irrigation subprojects of which two in Mendoza
 Province, two in Tucuman and one in Chubut. Mendoza is a national leader in water resources
 management, its irrigators are highly-organized, the sector is publicly-managed (although O&M
 is a shared public/private responsibility), and O&M is financiaUy self-sufficient (water charges
 cover O&Mexpenses). In general, the sustainability of provincial irrigation subprojects is likely
 to be much better in provinces with a long history of organized irrigation, with water user
 associations paying for water costs, organized by local administrations and with high levels of
 user involvement and participation, than in those which lack public, collective systems,

  2.5.4 Th~ Mendoza subprojects financed the strengthening of Irrigation Associations, a
  positive/effective measure for O&M. Irrigation tolls range from US$lS-30Ihalyear based on
  location and system complexity, while beneficiaries must repay 60% of public infrastructure
  investments. In Chubut Province, the subproject financed 18 km of primary and secondary canals
, and water intake pipes. O&M is handled by an Irrigation Association. The irrigation toll is
  US$ISlhalyear. Beneficiaries must repay 20% of the original investment. Under the two irrigation
  subprojects in Tucuman Province, O&M is handled by Irrigation Associations, system operators
 are paid by the province and the irrigation toll is US$20Ihalyear. Beneficiaries must repay 3S%
 of public infrastructure investments.

2.5.S Rural roads: The project financed two rural road improvement subprojects totaling 288

  about 45% of fanners in the newly-electrlfied .zones from co~ing to new lb;1es. 17 These are
  public utilities with consumers paying usage fees to provincial distribution concessions or
  electricity cooperatives as appropriate. Cost recovery in the form of a special levy was. not well-
. understOOd at the time by beneficiaries ,. and better communication from· the .outset was
  recommended for such plans/requirements. Larger producers were routinely using the. electricity
  for productive purposes but small producers were not, importantly because it Wli'Sf01,.md that they
  needed targeted training in the productive applications of electricity.

 2.5.7   National subprojects: The Borrower Completion RePort (PROSAPIUEC 2010) considers

 budgets and other issues could affect this status.in theft¢ure. The sustainability of technology
 transfer (TT) subprojects. rema~ns uncertain - depending again, on the province - given
 beneficiary resistance to paying for such services.

 2.5;8 .Follow-on opeJ1ltion: While PROSAP I launched an important process, critical
 shortcomings persist in rural Argentina, affecting the competitive conditions of small and
 medium.;size producers in non-Pampas re~ons: These become even more critical as the frontier
 for higher-value crops moves outwards, displacing. the production of many commodities and
 products into. the regional economies. The response bas been the Second Provincial Agricultural
 Development Project (PROSAP 11), designed to increase the productivity and sales volume of
 beneficiary small and medium-sized. agricultural prOducers located in non-Pampean regions. A'
 wide range of pre-investment activities are imanced, along with agricultural competitiveness and
 productive investment subprojects. The .operation targets small and medium farmers with a
 certain level of capitalization but with problems accessing services essential to compete.
 PROSAP n design reflects the lessons of its. predecessor. Importantly, the strong national and
 provincial commitment to this program, and the manner in which it has galvanized
 nationaVprovincial collaboration in the sector. are having important spillover effects, contributing
 to the sustainabiJity of PROSAP I interventions.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Higb overall relevance

3.1.1 PRO SAP I development objectives,despitetheir vintage, remain relevant to country and
global ptioritiesandbroadly consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy. The follow-on
PROSAP n operation reflects current practice in its straightforward PDO (to increase the
productivity and sales volume of small and mediwn·sized producers) and new emphases,
explicitly in a stronger focus on sustained growth with equity and social inclusion. the CPS pillars.
The operational focus now reflects·the GOA's strategy of competitiveness within a framework of
improved employment and income distribution,and spatially balanced development. The types of
investments remain similar to PROSAP I but add actions to promote agri-business through
collective action in value chains. and bring poverty and inequality reduction to the fore.
PROSAP I was one of the GOA's core investment instruments for putting government's
investment strategy for the Regional (non-Pampas) Economies into operation and PROSAP II
continues to build on its strengths, core objectives and vision.             .

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives18

3.2.1 PROSAP I fully/substantially achieved its seven objectives but its influence extended far
beyond the sum of these achievements. The project was an innovative and successful experiment
in fostering co-participation between the Federal and Provincial governments on agricultural
development, a critical achievement in a country where agriculture represents over 50% of total
exports. While initial1y viewed as far-fetched, especially in a macro-economic environment
(1990s) not conducive to investment, PRO SAP survived economic crisis and complex operational
issues to become Government's flagship sector investment program. It is widely-viewed as a
model of inter-institutional and cross-sector collaboration, and of a new relationship between the
national and provincial governments and the private sector. At the public sector level, interaction
between the center and the provinces has seen notable change due importantly to the flexibility of
interventions permitted by project design, direct evidence of results, space for meaningful
participation and shift away from the traditional top-down approach, all major catalysts· to
provincial commitment to the program. At the public/private sector level, PROSAP has become
the brand-name public policy instrument for support to small and medium-sized producers
primarily in the regional (non-Pampean) economies and an explicit, counter-weight policy
alternative to programs targeted to export-focused, entrepreneurial and larger-scale commodity
producers of the humid Pampas. In early 20 10, MAGyP established the Unit for Rural Change
(UCAR) to coordinate all Ministry programs with international financing. UCAR is headed by the
PROSAP Executive Coordinator, staffed mostly with seconded PROSAP personnel as an interim
measure, and seen as an important indication of PROSAP's progressive institutional
consolidation and influence in the sector. Achievements by objective follow.

Objective 1: Increase and diversify agricultural production and exports through intensifying
land use, increasing productivity per hectare, and introducing new crops and varieties.

3.2.2     This objective was achieved:

           •    Aggregate area under ,production in six irrigation and rural roads subproject areas
                (Chubut, Entre Rios, Mendoza and Tucuman Provinces) rose from 84,121 ha at
                subproject appraisal to 139,277 ha,an increase of 66%.
           •    Aggregate existing production at appraisal of 193,790 tons in areas designed for four
                irrigation sUbprojects rose to 404,436 tons, an incremental increase of 109%.
           •    An evaluation study in Mendoza Provilwe compared a baseline of 73 producers defined
                in 1993 with their productive, technological and economic reality in 2007, after
                benefiting from three separate irrigation investments. 19 Production had increased
                markedly due to water availability and technical assistance permitting expansion into
                previously abandoned lands, and cropyields had also increased. See Table 1.




       •       Numerous grape producers had made technological and varietal changes, replacing
               traditional table and common wine grapes with finer varieties,
       •       Many prp<iucers had increased or renovated machinery/equipment, demand was growing
               for technical assistance, and incomes were rising.
       •       Ex~post evaluation of two irrigation subprojects in Tucuman Province - Tafi del Valle and
               Lules - showed that' while area cultivated had not changed markedly in either case,
               project-supported technical changes and practices had promoted diversification,
               significantly altering cropping patterns and yields, with positive changes in net financial
               income}O See Tables 2 and 3 below.

    •    Export volumes for six agro-livestock products from PROSAP areas increased from 25%
         (apples) to 1,173% (strawberry) from 2001 to 2008 (PROSAPIUEC, 2009).
    ..   FAO data shows a 47% increase in fruit exports (apples, pears, peaches and cherries)
         from Mendoza Province project-supported irrigation areas in this period.
    @    Other studies indicate sharply increased exports of citrus, fine grapes/wine, soybeans and
         wheat due, inter alia, to PRO SAP-financed rural road improvements, Fruit Fly
         control/eradication, and improved technical packages.

Objective 2: Increase and stabilize the agricultural incomes of 120,000 small and medium-sized
commercial farms.

3.2.3    This objective was substantially achieved:
    •    PRO SAP financed 22 national and provincial subprojects benefiting 108,500 small and
         medi.um farm families (90.4% ofthe original target).
    @    Income data representing updated FARMOD projections for net annual financial income
         based on field surveys of 2,185 farmers in 2010, show incremental income increases
         ranging-from US$2,384 p.a. to US$17,480 p.a. per farm family, i.e., 46.3% to 430.5% at
         full development (Mendoza and Tucuman Provinces).
    ..   Increased incomes are also inferred from data on rural road improvements (Cordoba
         Province) which showed a 37.6% increase in the annual gross value of livestock
         production over three years due to unimpeded transit doubling to 360 days/year.
    •    Successful Fruit Fly, Aftosa and other disease prevention/eradication and control
         investments also suggest positive income effects. via reduced crop losses and improved
         market acceptance.
    •    Reliable water supply, better road conditions reducing product damage (e.g., milk) and
         regularizing transit, and the animal/plant health measures mentioned, are likely to have
         reduced income fluctuations, but income stabilization effects were not formally studied.
    •    The make-up of likely beneficiaries was checked at the subproject proposal stage and
         found to be generally consistent with the characterization of "small and medium-sized."

Objective 3: Itp,pl'ove the effectiveness of basic agricultural support services to increase the
competitiveness of agricultural products, by introducing new and more productive technologies,
increasing quality and improving sanitary conditions of products, and eradicating diseases that
limit access to international markets.

3.2.4    This objective was achieved:




                                                15
         •    New irrigation technologies and better technical packages delivered by public and private
              providers to irrigation beneficiaries increased the production and yields of many crops
              (see Tables 1-3 above).
        •     Project-supported agricuJtura! risk management activities were a factor in the massive
              expansion of crop insurance contracts between the 2002/03 and 2006/07 crop seasons,
              and increased area covered by these contracts from 11-16 million ha in the same period.
        •     Meteorological maps of agro-cHmatic risk, renovation of the Agricultural Risk Estimate
              System (SERA) online public database, and modernization of the online market price
              analysis database were also among the important support services strengthened?t
        •     PRO SAP investments in sanitary and phyto-sanitary services helped keep premium
             export markets (e.g., beef) open and new markets were developed.
        •    Aftosa was controlled, and meat markets closed following outbreaks were re-opened;
             crop losses from diseases in pears and apples, major Argentine exports, were reduced;
             and, iqlportant markets like Brazil whose borders were sealed in 2003 against a
             Carpocapsa moth outbreak, were kept open;
        •    PROSAP investments in the control and suppression of Fruit Fly helped maintain
             Argentina's "free" status in gIobaJ import markets; its eradication in citrus producing
             project areas saw damaged fruits fali from 13% to 0.5% of the crop, representing 138,000
             tons of oranges, mandarins and grapefruit with a final market value of about US$32.0 m.
        •    The Argentina Food Quality Program subproject (PROCAL) of 50 pilot activities had
             positive impacts on the adoption of quality production packages/processes by the private
             sector, and quality standards/controls by relevant provincial public authorities.
        •    These pilots had important multiplier effects as producers/others saw the impacts on their
             neighbors' operations,
        •    1,000 firms and agri-businesses reached higher quality standards in all provinces nation-
             wide; 20 markets were consolidated or opened and 34 quality protocols were established,
             for diverse food products.
        •    21 provincial jurisdictions achieved closer contact with their peers, municipalities,
             legislatures and other authorities on food quality issues; and, numerous inter-institutional
             cooperation agreements were signed to pilot, train andlor disseminate. 22

Objective 4: Improve rural productive infrastructure to reduce production and marketing costs,
through a significant reduction in the risk of losses (crops, ltvestock, equipment andfacilities). as
well as more efficient use and better conservation and management ofnatural resources.

3.2.5        This objective was substantially achieved:
    •        Project-financed studies of the effects of irrigation and roads investments show positive
             impacts on production, daity life and natural resource conservation and management.
        •    Rural road rehabilitation promoted commercial investment in zones where productive
             activities suffered from poor transit conditions, and reduced operational costs through
             savings on fuel and transit time.

 Objective 6: Rationalize public investments and promote an expanded private sector role.

 3.2.7      This objective was substantially achieved:
      1&    Pirker (2006), found that higher productivity from sound public investments is an
            incentive to further investment by the private sector. 27
      1&    Irrigation beneficiaries showed strong intent to invest, ranging from US$2,500 for garlic
            processing up to US$300,000 for export fruit plantations and cold storage facilities.
      1&    Once irrigation was regularized, larger producers expressed multiple investment goals,
            both immediate and 10nger-term?8
      •     Even smaller-scale farmers had already made modest, self-financed investments in tools
            and simple sman ""orks on-farm, with more progress among those organized into groups
            and with free technical assistance.
      •     Animal and plant health status is fundamental to intentions to invest. For large producers
            with access to bank financing, fruit fly control implies diversification, expansion of area
            planted, new varieties, and European market certification,29
      •     Rural road rehabilitation also promotes investment (e.g., poultry) in zones formally
            marginalized by poor transit conditions, and reduces operationaVproduction costs.
      •     Even so, while subproject investments are necessary to stimulate private investment, they
            do not guarantee further investment if financial resourceslHnes of credit are unavailable.
      •     The realism of assuming that infrastructure and higher productivity would catalyze new
            capital inflows may be questioned but this issue has been partly resolved by piloting the
            Non-Refundable Contributions (NRCs), now scaled up under PROSAP n.

Objective 7: To improve maternal and child health through the delivery of quality services, and
to strengthen disease surveillance and control activities. all for purposes of reducing the acute
risk of disease in the Borrower's territory.

3.2.8 This objective was achieved. The Second Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition
Project (PROMIN II) ICR (Report 36544-AR) rated the PRO SAP· supported Health Emergency
Program (HEP) component as Highly Satisfactory. PROMIN n activities were intended to
cushion the health-related impact of the Argentine crisis on the poor and vulnerable population,
under the HEP framework approved by the Borrower by Presidential Decree'ofMarch 12,2002,
and were a mechanism for pooling resources/savings from other projects in Argentina at that time,
including PROSAP. Results for HEP-financed activities include the following:

      •    Infant, neo-natal infant, and post-natal infant mortality rates per 1,000 live births declined
           steadily in PROMIN provinces over the life of the project with pronounced drops from
           2002 to 2004 (HEP period) of 12.7, 7.62 and 22.0 respectively;




27 See: Evaluacion de las Inversiones Privadas promovidas por el PROSAP, E. Pirker, 2006. The study looked at eight diverse
subprojects - roads, electrification, irrigation, commercial development and plW1t health - ranging from about US$2.0 m to US$18.0
million in Chaco, Misiones, Neuquen, Rio Negro, Tucuman and La Rioja Provinces.

28 Pirker found however, that some water user associations (WUA) seemed tentative concerning their organizational role and structure

once modernized irrigation was installed. Further, they saw maintenance as a current expense, not an investment.

29 But eradication of fruit fly does not guarantee further investment. Large producers have many incentives and fruit fly cont;ol is seen
as a collateral advantage. Smaller producers experienced the usual credit limitations on further investment.



                                                                  18
      •    Percentage of malnourished poor pregnant women decreased from 28.3% in 2001 to
           12.9%in 2005;
      •    80% of HEP financing was allocated to the acquisition of fortified milk, which benefited
           about 80%.of children in the universe. of poor women utilizing the public health system,
           making a major contribution to the infant mortality rate (IMR) reductions cited above;
     !II   HEP beneficiaries rose from 203,000 women in 2003· in 9 provinces to 2.3 million
           women in 24 provinces by 2005, representing 45-50% of poor women of fertile age in
           Argentina not covered by a health insurance scheme.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 An economic and financial analysis was performed based on data and information from
original FARMOD models, updated by surveys in 2010 of beneficiary farmers and other
stakeholders involved in five irrigation subprojects in Mendoza and Tucuman Provinces. The
methodology is detailed in Annex 3. Results are as follows:
     .. Expected internal economic rates of return HERR): These ranged from 15% to 40% on
        the seven Bank-supported Group A subprojects (of which only Montecaseros was
        implemented). Estimated IERRs at appraisal of the five subprojects analyzed here ranged
        from 15.2% to 32.7%.
     • Actual IERRs: Ranged from 15.4% to 36.7% for four of the five subprojects analyzed;
        the 16 de Octubre subproject showed a -25% IRR for reasons explained in Annex 3.
    • Ofthese five subprojects, four are economically profitable, three exceeded their appraisal
        estimate, and four were within the original IERR range projected in the SAR.
    • Proiect IERR: 24.1 % compared to the original appraisal estimate of 22.2%.
    • Fiscal analysis: The direct impact of revenue generation is likely to be modest in the
        short run and thus the project's fiscal impact is negative. In the long-run however,
        experience shows that fiscal revenues/impact will benefit from the improved financial
        situation of beneficiaries and its effect on their purchasing power and expenditure
        patterns, as well as organized cost recovery provisions in infrastructure subprojects.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1      The overall outcome rating ofSatisjactory is justified based on the following: 3o
     •     Positive outcomes for all seven project objectives, substantiated by studies/evaluations.
     •     Most project targets/indicators met or exceeded.
     •     Continuing relevance to the sector of all core elements of the original PD~, and of the
           project methodology and design (with lessons-based innovations/refinements).
     •     Promising, albeit preliminary indications of economic and financial efficiency and
           sustainability and of positive fiscal impact.
     •     Good outlook for sustainability of investments, through observed O&M practices,
           enforcement of sanitary control/barriers, and mainstreaming of institutional developments.
     •     Strong GOA commitment to PRO SAP and significant resources leveraged - Bank and
           IDB - for longer-term investment in this evolving program.



30 Note: The final ISR archived at closing (end-May 2010), rated DO as Moderately Satisfactory without the benefit of the exhaustive
review of subproject completion reports and evaluations subsequently done for the ICR.




                                                                19
         •    Aggregate·perfonnance and results including institutionalization of PRO SAP, along with
              full disbursement of both loans, are deemed to outweigh negative aspects - mostly
              beyond the proje9t's control- in the first five years.

 3.5 Overarehing Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
  (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

 3.5.1 Poverty: As noted earlier, the project was not explicitly targeted to the rural poor but it is
 known that the beneficiary population was heterogeneous with a large number of small-scale
 farmers. The income data collected in the field in 2010 suggest that the beneficiaries of irrigation
 works have good prospects for substantially improving incomes and Hving conditions, with the
 caveat that availability of credit· is crucial. The income impacts of roads and energy investments
 are still being studied.

3.5.2 Indigenous peoples: The project was serious about supporting indigenous groups in a
culturally appropriate way (see details on consultative approach in TapenagalEPDAIChaco,
2008); the discussion with ethnic groups about the Linea Tapenaga Water Resource and
Productive Development subproject was comprehensive. 31 Ethnic communities were receptive to
subproject activities, considered an important achievement, and indications of sustainability are
good. Linkages to other projects and incentives for the development of primary and terciary
productive activities integrated with cultural and historical knowledge, practices and skills are
seen as promoting sustainability. Much depends on the continuity of various incentives provided
by the provincial government for indigenous beneficiaries.

3.5.3 Gender: PROSAPsince its inception adopted the policy of equitable attention to women.
This did not include the explicit targeting of women because the former SAGPyA (now MAGyP)
was already implementing gender policies through other Bank and IDB projects (e.g.,
PROINDER and Fida-IDB) and these same policies were assumed to apply equally to PROSAP.
That said, the question of gender was not discussed in the SAR, nor by any of the PROSAP I
studies, so its influence on subprojects in terms of degree of women's participation and/or direct
benefit cannot be substantiated. PROSAP II gives more explicit attention to vulnerable groups
including women; project monitoring and supervision are expected to track their participation in
project benefits under MAGyP social policy standards.

(b) Institutional Change and Strengthening

3.5.4        Institutional evolution is summarized below, complementing Section 3.2:
    •        SAGPyAlUEC's technical, operational and analytical skills, capacity to support and
             cooperate with provinces, promote the program, exploit opportunities, collaborate with
             multiple stakeholders, and conduct sophisticated M&E, showed notable evolution.
        •    At the provincial level, there was marked growth in EPDAs' pro-activity, adaptability
             and general capacity but their contribution to the policy dialogue and their technical role
             remained modest.
        •    Nogueira (2006) views this as more a comment on project ambitions and complexity than
             EPDAs' weak performance; subproject appraisal neglected to analyze EPDAs' capacity




31   See Saneamiento Hidrico y Desarollo Productivo de la Linea Tapenaga, Completion Report, EPDA/Chaco 2008.




                                                               20
            and authority to fonnulate policy/programs and in any case, their real role was the
            subproject cycle_ 32
      •     The perfonnance of PROSAP subprojects was found not to be synonymous with or
            entirely dependent on provincial institutional capacity, relying on diverse organizations,
            the nature of the tasks involved and the social response to individual subprojects.
      •     Even though SUbproject designs unifonnly included institutional development and
            technical assistance components, in practice the focus was stronger on physical works
            resulting in uneven attention to fonnative activities in some provinces.
      •     Institutional change is, realistically, a long-tenn effort and should be planned as such
            from the beginning with adequate funding, tailored programs and a flexible strategy.

 (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.5      These include:
    •      Highly successful pilot program - not contemplated at appraisal - executed by SAGPyA
           from 2005, working with rural youth to develop entrepreneurial skills utilizing training
           centers (Centros de Desarollo Emprendedor (CDE» and specialized TA?3
      •    Strong perfonnance under PROSAP I resulting in IDB re-directing US$200.0 million
           from other loans to PROSAP in late 2005, then subsequently approving a US$200.0 m.
           follow-up loan in January 2008 as the first stage of a Conditional Credit Line Inve.stment
           Project (CCLIP) totaling US$600.0 miJIion. This demonstrates the leveraging power of a
           successful operation with long-tenn buy-in of governments and financial institutions, and
           able to demonstrate and substantiate its impacts through good M&E.
      •    Unexpected gains from the Argentine Food Quality subproject (PROCAL) saw SAGPyA
           helping finns to differentiate their products by creating the official quality seal
           "Argentine Foods: a Natural Choice" which became a national trademark/seal of
           approval for finns in compliance with food quality protocols.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 The Montecaseros and Constitucion irrigation subprojects in Mendoza Province were
initiated in the early stages and were thus appropriate subjects for comprehensive evaluation in
2007. The original baseline survey of 120 producers was conducted in 1993-1994 and by 2007
some 73 were still available for follow-up, an effective rate of 80%. Results were compared to a
control groUp.34 Significant impacts from irrigation investments were reported; an impact
evaluation of investments in Tucuman Province is still being completed. Data showed:
     • 36% increase in cultivated areas
     • Increased yields: grapes 80%, fruits 192%, vegetables 194%


n Contribucion del PROSAP aI Desarollo de Capacidades Institucionales, R. M. Nogueira (2006). The report cites (i) the continuing
dominance of national policies in determining provincial development; (ii) weaknesses of most provinces and lack of technical
capacity; (iii) high levels of indebtedness impeding longer-term planning; and (iv)comparatively weak ability of social groups to voice
their demands at the provincial level.

33 See Evaluacion de Impacto: Proyecto Piloto Jovenes Emprendedores Rurales - Promocion de Cultura Emprendedora, Informe Final,
G. J. Tondi (undated).

34 The baseline infonnation covered only beneficiary producers and thus it was not possible to compare the evolution of the
beneficiary group with the control, the latter developed at random among producers similar to the beneficiaries in the same areas but
where the project had not intervened.




                                                                 21
      •    Significant diversification: e.g., zero fine wine grapes pre~project to 30% of overall grape
           production ex~post.
      •    Water conduction efficiency improved 15% and overall water availability on-farm 16%.
      •    More efficient irrigation and productive systems reduced the need to engage in off-farm
           activities, and increased demand for on-farm labor.
      •    60% of beneficiary producers were hiring workers compared to 40% of the control group
      •    61 % were receiving TA services compared to 12% of the baseline, and 55% of control
      •    66% reported satisfaction with overall· impact of subproject. 60% were satisfied with the
           quantity of water delivered, and 40% with production, yields and income.

3.6.2 The study recommended further comprehensive interventions, including irrigation works,
to update the entire provincial irrigation network, thereby putting the province on par to compete
in an increasingly open global economy amd markets. The suggested strategy included incentives
in the form of non-reimbursable contributions (NRC) to promote complementary on-farm
investments in modem irrigation systems and related assets to support further diversification to
higher value crops and better returns on the additional available water. NRCs were piloted in the
later stages of PRO SAP I and scaled up/mainstreamed under PRO SAP n.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

4.0.1      Sustainability: Factors taken into account include the following:
    •      All subprojects fully implemented to specification and functioning as intended, albeit in
           some cases at an early stage (e.g., SENASA laboratories).
      •    Intense commitment of national and provincial governments and institutions to PROSAP
           with strong likelihood ofthe program being sustained beyond the Bank's withdrawal.
     •     Proven ability of PROSAP to leverage co-participation from financial institutions.
     •     Evaluation studies indicate generally positive financial sustainability of irrigation
           subprojects due to established water payment, cost recovery and systems management
           regimes and arrangements in provinces with irrigation investments.
     •     Generally good sustainability of roads and energy investments with user fees (where
           relevant), formal arrangements and responsibilities established or underway.
     •     Sustainability of roads in particular is motivated/enhanced by savings in time and fuel,
           and cost savings from reduced product losses and better quality/price.
     •     Strong stakeholder demand for maintenance of project-supported sanitary and phyto-
           sanitary controls and systems, but dependent on public budgets and official commitment.

4.0.2 Environmental management: The environmental integrity of subprojects was supported
by the following:
    • Environmental Management Plan, updated for the Additional Financing, governing
        subproject approval and implementation.
    • Environmental screening of all proposals by VEC in-house environmental specialists.
    • Oversight of environmental compliance by Bank supervision missions.
    • Specific natural resource conservation and management objectives of irrigation and
        drainage subprojects, measured by subproject studies with very positive results. 35

        •     Good adoption rates of water resource management technical packages with mUltiplier
              effects to neighboring producers.
        •     Reduced use of agri-chemicals in the environment, an intended collateral effect of the
              animal and plant health control subprojects.

s. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
S.l Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.l.!        This rating is based on the following:
        ..   Innovative approach to fostering co-participation between the federal and provincial.
             governments on agricultural development, and to institutional collaboration across sectors.
     ..      Collaboration with IDB to leverage/maximize investments and impact
     ..      Consistency with national and provincial agricultural strategies.
     ..      Responsible stance on fiduciary analysis of provincial fiscal capacity.
     ..      Attempt to introduce a bottom-up approach to public investment planning and financing
             on behalf of smaner-scale producers.

5.1.2        Balanced by certain weaknesses:
    •        PD~ complex and difficult to measure, with key performance indicators tied to the Group
             A subprojects, not the PD~ elements.
     ..      Readiness to implement Group A subprojects was over~stated, entailing risks to the
             project execution timetable/expectations and massive inputs in specialist expertise.
    •        Sustainability planning was superficial given the nature of planned subprojects, and
             inadequate provision was made for early, systematic engagement with beneficiaries on
             O&M.
    ..       Over~estimation of institutional capacity, especially provincial, and TAltraining programs
             lacked a strategic, tailored and flexible approach,
    It       Inadequate transparency in the identification and justification of investment subprojects.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.3        This rating is based on the following:
    ..       34 missions over 13 years, well-staffed and reported and with strong follow~lJP.
    e        Intense, pragmatic, rigorous efforts to salvage the operation post-crisis when cancellation
             loomed; project outcomes/results underscore the correctness of this strategy.
    ..       Innovative, cross~sector strategy for supervision in the post~crisis period as a realistic and
             successful response to project design/needs.
    •        CMU's direct engagement with project authorities to establish an Action Plan for
             PROSAP's recovery, as part of broader portfolio recuperation effort post~crisis.
    •        FleXible, quality-driven and strategic approach to managing project execution as a central
             instrument for advancing government's agricultural policy agenda.
    ..       Openness to using the project as a vehicle for innovation and emergency activities.
    •        Valuable continuity of Bank Task Manager and technical team during the project's
             recovery.and growth, and leveraging this resoufce/institutional·memory for PROSAP II.
    e        Consistent, intensive supervision of Safeguards and Procurement in the post-crisis period.


                                                      23
     •     Role in helping the UEC develop sustainable, fonnalized, program-based M&E capacity.

5.1.4   Weaker aspects included:
    •   Frequent rotation of Bank project task managers in first five years.
    •   Supervision strong but insufficiently intense in the initial period, given serious problems,
        and issues not brought to management's attention soon enough.
     • Consistent disconnect between supervision ratings and the project's actual perfonnance,
        in this same period.36
     • Excessive delays in processing procurement no objections, due to inadequate allocation
        of manpower to a project with exceptionally high procurement needs and complex issues.
     •. Inattention to fonnalizing changes in/updating key perfonnance indicators.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.5 This rating reflects an attempt to balance performance against a series of complex factors
and events, some of which were entireiy beyond the control of the Bank or Borrower. In key
respects the project was two separate operations, the first period unsuccessful and the second
(post-crisis) with many achievements. Given that the issue is Bank performance over the entirety,
but weighing the outcomes from 2003-2010, on balance the rating is Moderately Satisfactory with
the addendum that this IeR rates the Bank's supervision performance in the latter period as
highly satisfactory.

S.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
5.2.1     This rating is based on the following:
    •     High degree of GOA support for preparation and desire to maximize investments and
          outcomes by exploiting successful economic reforms of the period.
     •    Support for a new, decentralized and demand-driven project approach giving substantial
          latitude to the provinces to determine their rural investment priorities.
     •    But, chaotic political and economic situation put PRO SAP and the entire Bank portfolio
          at risk. While clearly not targeted at PROSAP and 1argely beyond the control of project
          agencies, the impact on PROSAP was disastrous and effort to restore normalcy arduous.
     •    Once conditions improved, Government. adopted PROSAP as the hallmark of its
          agricultural development program and its support, including budgetary, has not waned.
     •    Commitment to the Additional Financing and to PROSAP II.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.2     Performance of the UEC was as follows:
    •     Consistently strong, committed effort, even with formidable obstacles in the earlier years,
          to collaborate with the Bank team in moving the.project forward.


36 Ratings were unifonnly Satisfactory even when Aide Memoires and related documents expressed extreme concern regarding all
aspects of perfonnanceincluding lP, DO, disbursements, project management and counterpart funding.




                                                           24
     •   Coordinated PROSAP with relative autonomy - due to SAGPyA's hands-off attitude - but
         SAGPyA's designation of four Coordinators in five years handicapped the UEC's
         performance.
    •    Acknowledging capacity gaps in the early years and adopting the lOB-sponsored
         Institutional Strengthening Plan, with Bank financing for state-of-the-art administrative
         and monitoring systems, the UEC caught up and learned by doing.
    •    Made major strides in efficiency, management and oversight of project execution, M&E,
         FM and procurement, and promoted PROSAP's longer-term sustainability.
    •    Delivered influential training to provincial technical teams responsible for the multi-
         province, national subprojects; UEC efforts in communication were especially critical.
    •    M&E was a major UEC accomplishment - with strong Bank support - and its progress
         reporting, diagnoses and research products are of excellent quality and utility.
    •    Skills/continuity of the Project Coordinator and UEC technical team were invaluable
         assets and combined with the Bank team, converted the project into a successful program.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.5 On balance, overall Borrower performance must be rated Moderately Satisfactory
reflecting the complex .realities of the initial five years which brought the project close to
cancellation. A rating of the second phase of this project would be satisfactory due to the
professionalism and dedication of the UEC's Coordinator, technical and administrative teams,
close collaboration with the Bank in the post-crisis period to rescue the project, role in bringing
PROSAP I to a successful close, accomplishments in M&E and support for PROSAP II.

6. Lessons Learned

6.0.1    The project generated many lessons, presented selectively below (see also Annex 7):

      • A pre-defined and well-prepared portfolio of investments ready for implementation
 remains prudent, and can mitigate the tendency for innovativeldifflcult projects to absorb
much time in the early years in "learning by doing" but not disbursing. But such frameworks
 still need .to allow a high degree of flexibility in the later stages, early and comprehensive
 attention to institution-building commensurate with the type/difficulty of the subproject and
capacity of provincial and other institutions, and extensive beneficiary consultation on a range of
 issues and throughout the cycle ( a lesson applying to all subprojects, not only pre-defined).
      • Leveraging maximum impact from resources allocated for subprojects. requires the
identification of investment proposals in a transparent, strategic and participatory manner,
promoting competition for support through targeting mechanisms which ensure high quality,
sustainable subproject proposals consistent with project development objectives and sector
priorities.
      • Capacity-building at the provincial level must be tailored to the unique technical,
institutional and financial endowments of each province, avoid standardized training and
technical assistance of uneven relevance and utility, and adopt both demand and supply-driven
approaches. Studies reiterate the importance of high quality. local counterparts regardless of
SUbproject type. The goal ofTA should be provincial independence. For beneficiaries, subproject
design should diagnose and to the extent possible, mitigate implementation risks, including

  starting during project preparation - to leverage sources of expertise in rural areas, and adequate
  resources to fund capacity-building activities.
       • Complex, difficult operations in the rural sector with long lead times and a high degree
  of innovation require an extended horizon, continuous support for progressive capacity-
  building and repeatjinancing to maximize impact, learning and sustainability. The time
  required for projects such as PRO SAP to implement and mature greatly exceeds Bank averages.
 The importance to such projects of experienced, multi-skilled, cross-sector Bank and Borrower·
 project teams with continuity of leadership cannot be over-stated.
       • PROSAP was unique in its intensive, strategic, cross-sector approach to project
 supervision and management from 2002 through closing. This approach - a realistic response
 to project needs and design features - brought sector specialists together, creatively surmounted
 certain inherent budgetary and logistical disincentives in the Bank to use such approaches, and
 contributed directly to the project's outcomes.
       • Absol'jJtive capacity counts. Provinces with established institutions, practices and
 organizational structures tend to be better-jJositioned to demand access to and successfully
 implement projects like PROSAP. This is true of all demand~driven operations whether demand
 originates from a provincial government or directly from a small farm community. This is not a
 criticism of the methodology but does suggest that special effort is needed to bring weaker, less
 well-endowed provinces into PRO SAP-type o.perations and equip them to thrive, as is being done
 under PROSAP H.
       • The need for strategic communication campaigns is a repeating theme in PROSAP
 studies. The stakes are high: experience shows that beneficiaries can/will reject a subproject even
 before its implementation or reduce their interest in its O&M once completed, ifthey believe they
 were not consulted. Information campaigns need attention at the macro level to promote project
 objectives and requirements, and especially at the micro level via clear communication with
 beneficiaries/stakeholders about their rights, obligations, the nature of and rationale for planned
 works, and what happens· once works are completed. PROSAP II has heeded this lesson.
        It Private sector actors in the agro~industrial sector and producers should not be assumed

 capable of responding on their own to public Investments in rural infrastructure and services.
 Project investments are necessary to stimulate private investment but not sufficient to guarantee
 further investment especially if financial resources and lines of credit are unavailable or
 inaccessible. Smaller-scale producers/entrepreneurs in particular lack the organization,
 commercial records and collateral to support loans from regular banks and are likely to remain
dependent on subsidized public resources in the absence of alternative financing strategies.
      • Evaluation results from irrigation subprojects in Mendoza Province suggest that
further, comprehensive interventions are needed to increase provincial competitiveness in open
global markets. This implies incentives to promote complementary on-farm investments (e.g., by
scaling up the Non-reimbursable Contributions (NRC) piloted in the project's final stages) in
modern irrigation systems and other assets, increasing production on available lands and
promoting diversification to higher value crops and thus higher returns on the additional water.
PROSAP II has adopted this strategy including the use of NRC.
      • Formally establishing and staffing an M&E unit in the UEC - which is itself embedded
in MAGyP, the principal sector institution - immediately established the mainstream.
credentials of this important activity. Continuous support from supervision missions and an
increasing body of influential research products and data, plus the creation of a public face
through online access to PROSAP research studies, databases and new developments, provided a
strong incentive to sustain the activity, utilize its products and build further capacity.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by BorrowerlImplementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

Borrower Letter of November 18,2010 commenting on the Bank's draft ICR(see Annex 7):

Comment: The VEC agrees with the ICR's assertion questioning the realism of expecting that
infrastructure and higher productivity would catalyze new capital inflows, but notes that this was
partly resolved by piloting the Non-Refundable Contributions (NRCs), now scaled up under
PROSAPU.
Team Response: This point has been reflected in the final ICR.

Comment: The ICR's reference to the heterogeneity of provincial capacity and use of an overly-
standardized training approach should also mention that the two involved banks instituted and co-
financed Annual Training Plans and provincial Operational Capacity Strengthening tailored to
provincial needs.
Team response: This point has been reflected in the fmal ICR.

Comment: While the macro-economic context at onset of the crisis affected provincial demand
for the project, the Bank's restrictive provincial eligibility standards (compared to IDB) also
played a role.
Team response: This point has been reflected in the fmal ICR.

Comment: The Borrower appreciates this exchange of views which form part of a frank and
open dialogue to jointly advance efficient implementation of the program and continuous
improvenment in public policies linked within this Federal program.
Team response: The Bank team endorses this statement.

(b) Cofinanciers: The IDB prepared a brief "Informe de Terminacion de Proyecto" (July 2006)
which agrees in all key respects with the analysis of the project by the Bank and Borrower.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

2.1    The project had three components, as stated below. Drawing on the Borrower Completion
Report (PROSAP, 2010), a series of Implementation Completion Reports OCR) prepared by
diverse authors (see Annex 9), and other sources, the following summarizes the main
achievements under individual components/sub-components:

Component 1: Subprojects (93% of project coSts)

Overall rating: Satisfactory

2.2     The project was to finance subprojects presented by participati~g provinces, and in cases
where several provinces needed to address a common regional issue through coordinated actions,
the project would fmanqe national subprojects with multi-provincial coverage. Subprojects
represented about 93% of estimated total project costs.

2.3     The project was open to considering all technically feasible, economically sound and
environmentally sustainable subproject proposals presented by provinces, based on priorities and
implementing capacity, and consistency with project objectives and provincial eligibility criteria.
Evidence suggested that project interventions were likely to concentrate in the following areas:
water resources management, rural infrastructure, technological development, animal health,
plant health and commodity quality, market development, agricultural information, production
and regulation of food products, and strengthening of provincial agricultural institutions.

2.4      To be eligible for a subproject, a province had to meet certain requirements and for
investment subprojects these were: (i) current account fiscal balance in the most recent full
provincial budget period; and (ii) debt service ratio below 15%. In exceptional cases involving
investment subprojects for rehabilitation of existing rural productive infrastructure, a province
unable to satisfy these general conditions would be required to have a written agreement with the
Federal Government to implement a provincial reform program acceptable to the Bank, indicating
that it would be in a position to meet the requirements within a specified period. Provinces
participating in "national", Federal Government-financed subprojects, were not required to satisfy
these criteria.

2.5      Project preparation analyzed some 200 provincial proposals for subprojects, selecting 11
(Bank 7, IDB 4) from those considered to have highest development impact - designated as
Group A - and from provincial clients with the most experience in project preparation and
strongest administrative skills. The seven Bank-supported Group A subprojects - ranging from
US$5.0 m to US$20.0 m - had the same structure as a Bank project with full-fledged economic,
fmancial, technical, environmental and social analyses, a log-frame, and with formal rules and
procedures for eligibility, planning, execution and oversight. The project had no precise funding
target in terms of geographic location or subsector and was open to financing any subproject
which met the selection criteria, and was proposed by an eligible province or the Federal
Government.

       @I    Total 35 subprojects were impiemented: 21 Bank-supported subprojects of which 14
             provincial and                and 14 IDB-supported subprojects of which nine provincial
             and five national
       •     108,500 rural families benefited from the Bank-supported investments, 90.4% of original
             target (not adjusted); no data available on beneficiaries of IDB-supported investments.
       ...   Contrary to expectations, about 93% of aU Bank fmancing for subprojects concentrated in
             three investment areas:             and Drainage (59%), Rural Roads (18%) and Animal,
             Plant and Food          (l

2.7     Mendoza Province was a dominant player, capturing around 55% of Loan resources
expended for subprojects, implementing five of the 15 provincial subprojects, and 27% of total
project investments. It was unique in functioning consistently well throughout, sustaining its
demand for project support up to closing, and maintaining the pace and quality of subproject
execution during the critical period when the GOA and Bank were discussing the first extension
of the closing date. The example of Mendoza was influential in the justification for the first
extension of the closing date. The province delivered the most visible results under PROSAP, was
a model for other provinces, as well as provider of technical support to several. Mendoza also
signed an agreement with FAO to create a technical unit within DGI to improve the management
and preparation of projects. Mendoza's subprojects were well-prepared, with good baseline data,
and permitted strong evaluations.

 Comgonent 2: Institutional Development (2% ofproject costs)

 Overall rating: Moderately Satisfactory

 2.7      The primary purpose of this component was to ensure sound subproject implementation,
 and to install within provmcial institutions the capacity to adequately support the agricultural
 sector. The component financed the development of mstitutional capacity at the federal and
 provincial levels and all provmces were eligible to participate with or without a subproject.
 Activities included technical, assistance to provmcial bodies, and training for managerial and
 technical staff in particular. The Federal Government would implement the component through
 the Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock (SAGPyA)/UEC.

 2.8        The component was to finance the following:

       •    permanent operational mechanisms for supporting project implementation - the Central
            Executing Unit (VEC), Provincial Executmg Units (VEP), strengthening of the relevant
            Provincial Agricultural Development Agency in each case (EPDA) and the consultative
            Commissions (CC);
       •    activities to better-d~fine the role of the public sector and increase coordination between.
            public and private entities to' improve their effectiveness;
       •    increased institutional capacity to formulate and analyze agricultural policy, and to design
            legal and institutional reforms to facilitate the transfer of responsibilities to users' groups'
            and promote sector development; and,
       •    identification, preparation, and implementation of agricultural development
            initiatives/subprojects (each investment subproject had an institutional "component")
            while increasing the role of the private sector.

2.9·     Implementation of this component was limited both by its modest allocation relative to
the huge need at the provincial level for capacity building and by the consistent lack of a flexible,
tailored and strategic approach t~ such activities despite the heterogeneity of provinces and its
effect on project/subproject implementation pace and quality.45 As noted in the Project Appraisal
Document for PROSAP II, capacity-buildmg is not a "one-size-fits-aH" activity and its design
must reflect the uniqu~ technical, institutional and financial capacity characteristics of individual
provinces, and on both a supply-driven and demand-driven basis. The same principles should
apply to local-level capacity-building, especially for farmer organizations, WUAs and individual
farm enterprises where needed.

2.10       Project achievements/outputs' under this eomgonent were:

No .output targets were established at appraisal for this component and none were developed
during implementat~on. By end-project the component had done the following:

       •    Established and supported the project organizational structure, and helped define
            institutional relations and responsibilities;
       •   .Improved institutional capacity to adopt and comply with the project Operational
            Manual;


4' Evidence suggests thl'it Argentine authorities have traditionally been reluctant to borrow for institution-building, BIld that the 2% of
total project cost was a notional limit for PROSAP I agreed between the main parties.




                                                                   34
     III   Supported improvement of the physical infrastructure and technical operational
           capabilities of the UEPs, and facilitated technical assistance services where needed;
     III   Provided continuous support to the EPDAs and UEPs for multiple stages of individual
           subprojects
     $     Ensured compliance with implementation, procurement and financial management
           procedures and requirements; and,
     III   Supported preparation of Annual Operating Plans and progress reports.

2.10   Two studies - largely qualitative - describe the impact of Component 2 institutional
development activities, with findings summarized in the Main Text section 3.2. 46

2.11     From 2005 on, training activities were more systematic, through a Training Unit
established in the UEC. Distinct sets of activities were developed, grouped basically into internal
training, post-graduate training, masters and specializations, external training and UEC-sponsored
seminars aggregating the gamut of PROSAP's public and private stakeholders for project
planning and review purposes.

2.12   Internal training included language instruction for about 70 consultants per year, in
English and Portuguese; training in Log Frame development; and PROSAP II preparation
seminars for EPDAs.

2.13     External training from 2006 to 2009 included the participation of PRO SAP consultants at
specialized congresses in six countries; training for UEC and UEP personnel on procurement,
project management, project monitoring and supervision and impact evaluation at special
international seminars, several of which Bank-sponsored.

2.14 The Bank and lOB also instituted and co-financed Annual Training Plans and provincial
Operational Capacity Strengthening tailored to provincial needs.

Component 3: Project Coordination, Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (5% of
project costs)

2.14    This component financed the above-mentioned activities at the national and provincial
levels. No output targets were established at appraisal for this component, nor developed later
during implementation.

2.15    Evidence of productivity under the M&E portion of this component can be seen in the list
of UECIPROSAP-generated analyses and evaluations in Annex 9. The UEC produced aU
required performance/progress and fiduciary reports including independent audits.

Project Costs and Financing:

2.16    Total estimated project cost at appraisal of the original project was US$357.2 million
over seven years. Actual total project cost was US$375.58 mover 13 years, taking into account

the three-year US$41.49 m. Additional Financing and the US$20.0 m reassigned from the OP to
maternal/child health activities under PROMlN.

2.17     As stipulated in the SAR, no single province could implement subprojects exceeding
25% of total project costs, and aggregate national subprojects could not exceed 30% of total
project costs. In practice, Mendoza Province absorbed 27% of total project cost, and 55% of the
total cost of provincial subprojects, while the eight other Provinces absorbed 73% and 45%
respectively. Aggregate national subprojects at closing represented 29.95% of total project costs,
right on target.

2.18     As shown in Annex I, project financing differed from appraisal due to the inability of the
original subproject financing strategy/framework to prevail, combined with substantial cost
escalation in the post-crisis period. For example:

    •   The cost of mRD provincial subprojects was 318.13% of the appraisal estimate because
        in practice, there was no separation between provincial and other subprojects (Le.,
        between Group A and what the SAR loosely termed Group B - a list of potential
        provincial investments at a very early stage of development and to be drawn upon for
        feasibility studies etc. once Group A was underway).
    •   Bank funding for the regional/national subprojects was barely 22% of estimate, while the
        IDB's financing of this same cohort rose to 468% of appraisal.
    •   Expenditure on institutional development was 154% of appraisal, given the realization
        over time that capacity-building was an urgent issue.
    •   In the case of the Additional Financing, expenditures were about 16% less than expected
        to complete the provincial subprojects and about 4%, ,higher for national subprojects.
        Institutional strengthening was just over 100% of estimated.

2.19    Project expenditures for preparation and supervision were very high, totaling US$1.5 m
and US$1.6 m respectively. Both stages had major requirements for specialist consultants, and
both stages were unusually protracted; the supervision stage covered close to 13 years. This can
be viewed as the sunk cost of an intense learning process at both stages and resulted in
comparatively modest preparation costs for the follow-on PROSAP II operation.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A. Analysis orIn-agation    Subproi~ts   (Mendoza, TucumaD and Chubut Provinces>
3.1      Conclusions: Intema~ economic rates of return (IERR) on the seven, pre-defined
irrigation and drainage subprojects described in the SAR (of which Montecaseros only was
implemented) were expected to range from 15% to 40%. Estimated IERRs on· the five irrigation
subprojects analyzed here ranged from 15.2% to 32.7%. Analysis shows actual IERRs ranging
from 15.4% to 36.7% when considering four of the five subprojects included in the analysis, the
exception being the 16 de Octubre subproject which showed a -25% IRR for reasons explained in
Section B below. Of the five subprojects analyzed, four are economically profitable, three
exceeded their appraisal estimate. The project IERR is 22.5% compared to the appraisal estimate
of22.2%.
    (a) Mendoza Province: Montecaseros and Reduccion los Andes

Methodology aud framework:

3.2         Both the ex-ante and ex-post analyses of the Montecaseros and Reducci6n Los Andes
(Mendoza Province) which make up the provincial irrigation program, and subprojects
comprising the Tucuman Province Irrigation Program (PRTP - Tafi del VaHe and San Isidro de
Lutes) were conducted by applying the method of evaluation commonly denominated "cost
benefit analysis of the discounted flow of funds". The FARMOD program developed by the
World Bank and FA was used to conduct this analysis.

3.3      The analysis adopted a discount rate of 12% annual, reflecting the opportunity cost of
capital in Argentina. The time period taken into account to project the discounted flow of funds
was 20 years.

3.4      The ex ~ ante economic analysis of the subprojects used FARMOD archives prepared by
the preparation teams in 1995 and 2002 respectively (Mendoza) and 2002 (Tucuman). To
conduct the ex - post economic analysis of subprojects, the basic structure of the FARMOD
originals was used, but updating the prices of products sold, yields per hectare, area dedicated to
each crop, the pace of entry of each producer, the adoption of technological changes, and costs of
investment for each subproject.

3.5     All data utilized for the update were extracted from subproject completion reports or
information provided by provincial authorities to the PROSAPIUEC Monitoring and Evaluation
Unit. Unfortunately, the provinces did not prepare year to year updates of worksheets on sales
income and production costs per hectare of crops used as representative of each group of products
at the preparation stage of subprojects, and for this reason costs of production could not be
updated (inputs, services and labor).

3.6    To resolve the lack of updated information on production costs, the following method
was adopted:

   •   Determined the percentage represented by annual costs of production in respect to sales
       income/revenue in the financial/economic ex - ante analysis;
   •   Applied the annual percentage to the annual value of sales revenues of the ex - post
       analysis to estimate the updated value of the costs of production corresponding to the new



                                               37
         sales revenue data provided by the Mendoza Monitoring and Evaluation Unit and by the
         SUEC (Tucuman).

Montecaseros Irrigation: Ex-post EconomicAnalysis

3.7      Starting date and duration of subproject works: Subproject disbursements started in
 1998 and not 1996 as expected at preparation. The main cause for this delay in subproject
initiation was delayed signature of the Credit Agreement with the World Bank which had only
just signed it in September 1998. To rescue this situation, the Province of Mendoza financed, up
to 1998, part of the works for sealing/water"proofmg the Montecaseros Canal which was listed as
part of sub-project investments.
3.8     It should also be noted that sub-project execution also suffered interruptions and delays
due to the changing national economic context at the start of the financial and political crisis
which came on in 2001 and, especially, after the strong devaluation of 2002 resulting from
exiting the convertability regime which had fixed the PesolUS$ at parity of US$l.OO to $1.00
since 1991. Execution of subproject works and activities, including the period of financing solely
by the Province of Mendoza, took 12 years (1996-2007).
3.9      Producers and areas benefited: The Project benefited directly the same number of
producersw foreseen/planned during preparation. These 1,279 producers benefited from improved
irrigation systems effected by the subproject and in addition, received technical assistance and
marketing/commercial services provided by the support unit created by/for the subproject.
3.10     Based on data in the subproject Completion Report (Severino 2008), the total area
cultivated by the 1,279 farmers benefited went from 6,227 ha in the "without subroject" scenario
to 6,340 ha· in the "with subproject" situation. This demonstrated that there had not been a
significant change in total area cultivated or in the cropping pattern in the subproject area. What
did occur was a slightly higher level of specialization, less than projected by the preparation team,
in the cultivation of fine grapes. In effect, under the "without subproject" situation, fine grapes
occupied 31.2% of total area farmed, while now they occupy 32.5%.
3.11     Benefits: In addition to the slight change in specialization noted above, the subproject
also promoted an increase in total cultivated area of 1.8%, lower than the preparation estimate of
 10.9%. For this reason, the only incremental benefits considered for the ex - post analysis were
those resulting from technological change (irrigation, production and marketing) promoted and
incentivated by the subproject. Thus, the benefits quantified and calculated by FARMOD were
mainly those derived from increases in yields per ha of the 1,279 farmers who benefited directly
from the subproject.
3.12     Investment costs: In the ex - post economic evaluation of the subproject, all economic
costs of investment initially made by the Province alone, and financed by the World Bank were
input. Based on the data, financial costs were US$5,763,760 and total economic costs from
FARMOD from the ex - post economic analysis were US$4,762,345, realized in the years 1996
to 2007.
Projected results

3.13     Physical aggregates: Aggregated data provided by FARMOD for the total 1,279 fanners
located in the subproject area, pennit an understanding of what were the quantitative increases -
at full subproject development - for each one of the groups of products comprising the cropping
pattern in the area. The average increase in production was 23.6%. Without considering the
increase in area cultivated, the average increase would be 20.9%. The product showing the
greatest absolute increase was fine grapes.

development are compared with those which would be obtained in the "without subproject"
situation. Through this comparison, one can see the total impact on gross value and costs of
production (including labor costs) and on the net incomes of producers as a consequence of
producive and marketing changes derived from subproject works and activities.

 3.17    Positive variations:
     •   The actual IERR was slightly higher than projected at preparation (26.5 % versus 24.8
         %).
     •   The increase in production volumen was slighly higher than expected (23.6% vs. 21.0%).
 3.18    Negative variations:
     •   The expected substitution (diversification) of fine grapes for common grapes foreseen at
         appraisal did not occur.
     •   The final area cultivated in the "with subproject" situation, was 11.2% less than
         projected.
     •   The annual increase in GVP was lower than estimated {24.2% vs. 39.8%).
     •   The economic Net Present Value was lower than expected (US$4.9 m vs. US$9.2 m).
     •               Subproject start-up and the disbursement period suffered a two-year delay,
         including the prior investments made by the Province and total period increased from the
         planned 5 years to 12 years.
    •                  The ratio of total subproject cost and the GVP of annual initial production
         was greater than expected (0.44 vs. 0.36). However, the real ratio was much lower,
         facilitating the profitability of the subproject.

3.19     Conclusions:
    •    The subproject was economically viable and the real IERR is very similar to initial
         projections.
    •    Farmers have the capacity to adapt to the new relative prices.
    •    The subproject permitted a 23.6% increase in annual production volume.
    •    The subproject resulted in a 24.2% increase in the gross value of production (GVP).

 Reduccion los Andes Irrigation: Ex - post Economic Analysis
 3.20    Producers and areas benefited: The subproject benefited directly the same number of
 producers envisaged at preparation. The group of 639 farmers benefited from irrigation and
 drainage works financed by the subproject and in addition, part of the cohort received technical
 assistance and marketing training provided by the support unit created by the subproject.
3.21     Based on data provided by ICAR (Rivadavia Watershed Inspection Association), total
area cultivated by the 639 farmers went from 10,655 ha in the "without subproject" situation, to
 13,707 ha in the "with subproject" situation. These results show that even though there was no
change in the cropping pattern in the subproject area, there was a major diversification towards
the cultivation of grapes to the detriment of other crops and also, there was a significant increase
in the participation of fine grapes.
3.22     In effect, in the "without subproject" situation, grapes occupied 64% of total cultivated
area (32.8% of fine grapes and 32.2% of common grapes), while today grapes occupy 80.2% of
total cropped area (46.5% fine grapes, 33.7% common grapes). It should be noted that the
introduction of horticultural crops did not occur as envisaged at subproject preparation. The



                                                      40
preparation team envisaged that under the ''with subproject" situation, about 670 ha would be- be
diverted to the cultivation of high value horticultural products.
3.23    Benefits: In addition to the productive specialization mentipned, -the subproject also
stimulated an increase of 28.6%, much higher then projected during preparation. The incremental
benefits considered for the ex-post analysis are those derived from an increase in area cultivated,
from technological changes (irrigation, production and marketing) promoted by the subproject
and those derived from the new productive specialization in fine grapes.· The benefits quantified
and calculated by FARMOD are mainly those derived from increases in area cultivated, increased
yields per ha and changes in productive specialization by the fanners who antwalUy comprise the
subproject's direct target population.
3.24    Costs of investment: All subproject investment costs were input into the ex - post
economic evaluation. Total economic costs charged in FARMOD reached USS20,933,628,
realized between 200S and 2009.
Projected Results
3.2S Physical aggregates: Aggregate data provided by FARMOD for the total 639 fanners in
the subproject area enables us to know the quantitative increases which each group of products
comprising the cropping pattern of the are~ will have at full development. The average
percentage increase in production wiJlbe 34.0%. Without considering the increase in area
cultivated, the average increase will be 4.4%. The products which will increase are fine and
common grapes.

       •   The economic NPV was lower than estimated (US$ 5.6 m vs. US$8.8 m).
       •   The IERR was lower than projected (15.4% vs. 26.0%).
       •   Annual production volume increased less than expected (34.0% vs. 40.6%).
       •   The substitution effect was less than expected for common grapes vs. fine grapes.
       •   There was a two year delay in subproject start-up.
       •   The ratio between total subproject cost and the GVP of annual initial production was
           greater than projected (0.91 vs. 0.66). However, the real ratio continues to be low,
           facilitating the profitability/viability of the subproject.

3.31       Conclusions:
   •       The subproject was economically less profitable than expected, above all, due to the
           important increase in subproject investment costs.
   •       Farmers have the capacity to adapt to the new relative prices.
   •       The subproject resulted in a 28.6% increase in area cropped, and 17.2% in total annual
           production volume from the area.

Tali del Valle Irrigation: Ex ~ post Economic Analysis

3.32     Date of start-up and duration of subproject works: Subproject investments and
activities started in 2005 and not in 2001 as planned during preparation. The main cause of this
delay of four years. was the rapid change in the national economic context due to the financial and
political crisis initiated around 2001 and especially, following the strong devaluation of 2002
resulting from ending the convertability. regime which had· been in place since 1991 and
maintained the Peso at 1: 1 parity with the USS. The execution of subproject works took two
years (2005-2006).
3.33     Producers and area benefited: The subproject benefited directly the same number of
producers foreseen at preparation. These 133 farmers benefited. from gravity irrigation under
pressure and in addition, received technical assistance and marketing services provided by the
support unit created for the subproject.
3.34 The total area cropped by the 133 farmers went from 762 ha ''without subproject" to 780
ha ''with subproject". While there was no change in the cropping pattern of the subproject area,
there. was a greater specialization in the cultivation of seed potato to the detriment of lettuce,
strawberry and oats. In the ')'vithout su,bproject" situation. seed potato occupied 19.6% of total
cropped area, and now occupies 61.3%.
3.35     Benefits: Besides the. productive specialization mentioned, the subproject also caused an
increase in total cropped area of 2.4%, lower than the 4.5% projected at preparation. Thus, the
only incremental benefits considered for. the ex - post analysis were those which came from
technological changes (irrigation, production and marketing) which were provided and
incentivated by the subproject. The benefits quantified and calculated by FARMOD are mainly
those derived from increased yields per ha on the part of the 133 farmers making up the direct
beneficiary cohort of the subproject.                                       .
3.36     Investment costs: All economic costs of subproject investment Were input into the ex-
post economic evaluation. According to the data, total economic costs included in FARMOD for
the ex - post economic analysis totalled USSS,022,661 and were expended in the years from 2005
to 2010.                                             .
Projected results

3.37 Physical aggregates: Aggregate data provided by FARMOD for the total 133 farmers
located in the subproject area enable us to know what would be the quantitative increases
expected at full subproject development and for each one of the groups of products comprising
the cropping pattern of this area. The average percentage production increase was 108.1 %.
Without considering the increase in area cropped, the average increase would be 103.7%. The
products with increases are seed potato and peas. :
3.38 Monetary aggregates: The table belowcompares financial results of the subproject as a
whole at full development, with those obtained under the ''without subproject" situation.
Through this comparison, the total impact can be seen on gross value and costs of production
(including labor) and on net income of producers as a consequence of the productive and
marketing changes derived from subproject works and activities.

San Isidro de Lules Irrigation: Ex-post Economie An8lisjs


3.44     Start-up date and duration of subproject works: Subproject investments and activities
started in 2005 and not in 2002 as originally envisaged at preparation. The main cause for this
delay of four years was the rapid change in the national economic context from the financial and
political crisis starting around 2001 and, especially, after the strong devaluation of the Peso of
2002 resulting from ending the convertability regime wbch had maintained the Peso at 1: 1 parity
with the US Dollar. Completion of the works took four years, from 2005 to 2008.
3.44    Producers and area benefited: The subproject directly benefited the same number of
farmers envisaged at preparation. The group of 107 to 162 farmers were benefited by pressurized
gravity irrigation financed by the subproject and in addition received technical assistance and
marketing services provided by the support unit created for the subproject.
3.45    The total area cropped by the 107-162 farmers went from 1,497 ha ''without subproject"
to 1,541 ha ''with subproject". While there was no change in the cropping pattern in the
subproject area, there was greater specialization in lemon to the detriment of sugar-cane.
3.46     Under the ''without subproject" situation lemon occupied 31.2% of total cropped area
while now it occupies 50.6%. Sugar-cane, which covered 44.5% of cropped area ''without
subproject", now occupies only 16%. Also, it should be noted that the preparation team estimated
that the total substitution of sugar-cane by lemon would occur in Year 12 of the ''with subproject"
situation. The team projected that by Year 6 of the "with subproject" situation (2009), the
cropping of lemon would cover an area of 658 ha and sugar-cane area would be reduced to 382
ha.


                                               45
3.47    Benefits: Besides the specialization mentioned above, the subproject also promoted
growth of 2.9% in area cropped, consistent with projections at preparation. The majority of
incremental benefits considered for the ex - post analysis are those stemming·from technological
changes (irrigation, productionaridmark~ting) promoted and incentivated by the subproject, and
those derived from the new specialization in lemon which has a gross and net value per ha
superior to sugar-cane. The benefits quantified and calculated by F ARMOD are mainly derived
from increases in yieldslha and the change in productive specialization by the beneficiary group.
3.48   Investment costs: AU economic investment costs were input in the ex- post evaluation.
Based on the data, economic costs charged to the subproject by FARMOD totaled US$7,061,608
and were realized/expended from 2005 to 2008.
Projected Results


3.49    Physical aggregates: Aggregated data provided by the F ARMOD program for the 107 to
162 fanners located in the subproject area, enable us to understand what were the quantitative
increases which were expected at full development and for each one of the product groupings
which make up the cropping pattern in the area. The average percentage increase in production
was 18.9%. Without considering the increase in area cropped, the average increase would be
15.5%. Products which increased were lemon and strawberry.
3.50     Monetary aggregates: The table below compares financial results for the subproject as a

       •    Volume of export production grew less than estimated (122.2% vs. 181.7%). However,
            the annual supply of exportable fresh lemon from the subproject area increased by 13,025
            tons.
       @    The principal product of the subproject area became strawberry when it was projected to
            be lemon.
       @    Subproject start-up was delayed by three years.
       •    The ratio of total subproject cost and the GVP of initial annual production was greater
            than projected (1.10 vs. 0.66). However, the real ratio continued to be low, which
            facilitated subproject profitability.

3.55        Conclusions:
   III      The subproject was more profitable than expected.
   III      Producers have the capacity to adapt to new relative prices.
   41       The subproject permitted an increase of 18.9% in annual production volume in the area
            and a 122.2% increase in the production of lemon for export.
   41       The subproject produced an increase of 147.5% in the gross value of production in the
            area.

 16 de Octubre Irrigation (Cbubut Province): Ex - post Economic and Financial Analysis


 3.56    Background: The Govemm~nt. of the Province of Chubut, considering the economic
 importance of public investment already made in provincial areas under irrigation and the high
 agricultural potential of irrigated agricUlture, granted priority, within the plan for provincial agro-
 livestock development, -to the expansion and/or rehabilitation of irrigation systems which present
 potential andlor problems and limitations for production. 47

 3.57         Metbodology and framework: The ex - ante economic analysis of the 16 de
 Octubre .subproject was done by applying the method "cost-benefit analysis of the flow of
 discounted funds". FARMOD was used to conduct this analysis, as with theoiiginal analysis in
 2002. The discount rate adopted was 12% annual, since this reflects the opportunity cost· of
 capital in Argentina. The time lapse for projecting the discounted flow of funds was 20 years.
 3.58    An update of the ex - post economic analysis could not be done utilizing FARMOD
 because not all of the data needed for such analysis was available. What was done was a
 comparison between the parameters projected by the original subproject preparation team and the
 data provided by consultants preparing the Project "Development and Expansion of the Irrigated
 Area of the Rio FutaleufU Basin", which could be considered a second stage of the 16 de Oetubre
 subproject. Other data used to do the update were taken from the subproject Completion Report,
 the progress report on the second stage, and information provided by provincial staff on the
 subproject's Monitoring and Evaluation Unit.

Ex-post Economic Analysis
3.59     Starting date and duration of subproject works: Subproject disbursements started in
2004 and not in 2003 as expected. It should also be noted that subproject execution experienced
interruptions and delays due to technical design problems in the irrigation works, changes in the
national economic context due to the political and economic crisis in 2001, and especially
following the devaluation resulting from the abandonment of the convertibility regime which kept
a I: 1 parity between the Peso and the US Dollar. The execution of subproject works and
activities took four years (from 2004 to 2007).
3.60   Producers and area benefited: The subproject benefited directly some 63 farmers
through improved irrigation systems as well as technical assistance and marketing services
provided by the support unit created for the subproject.
3.61     Based on the subproject progress report for the Rio Futaleuru Project (Gonzalez, 2009),
total area cropped or exploited by the 63 producers went from 3,980 ha "without subproject" to
4,409 ha "with subproject". Contrary to what was expected at preparation, there was no
significant change in area under irrigation. In fact, there was a greater specialization in cattle
ranching on natural pasture.




47 In the context of this strategy, the province asked PROSAP to finance the VIRCH and 16 de Octubre subprojects. The VIRCH
subproject was re-directed to IDB and 16 de Octubre to the World Bank.The refonnulation in 2001 of the Program for Management of
Water Resources and Productive Transfonnation of Irrigation Areas, prepared in 1999 - 2000, through a joint decisi6n of the province,
the Bank and UEC-PROSAP, implied a concentration of investments in the Riego del Valle de 16 de Octubre Project.




                                                                48
3.62     Benefits: The subproject has not produced the expected benefits, nor the main impacts
expected during its preparation in 2001. The 16 de Octubre subproject was designed to cope with
situations of extreme drought, conditions which have not occurred since the works were
completed. Thus there are no benefits to report yet, accounting for the low/negative IERR. Also,
the subproject carries Little weight in the overall analysis due to its very small size. Expected
impacts should have been produced by three concurrent factors: (i) increased cropped area under
irrigation which was to go from 163 ha "without subproject" to 2,020 ha "with subproject"; (ii)
increase holding capacity for total animal production in the area derived mainly from increased
area cropped with irrigated alfalfa, cebada, and artificial pasture; and (iii) increased production of
strawberry and vegetables.
3.63    Investment costs: Total real costs of the subproject reached US$1,803,646 and were
realized in 2004 to 2007.
Proiected results

3.64    Monetary aggregates: The table below compares financial results for the subproject as a
whole at full development, with what would have been obtained without the subproject. Through
such comparison, one can gauge the impacto on gross value and costs of production (including
labor) and on net incomes of producers as a consequence of productive and marketing changes
promoted by the subproject.

3.65    Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR): As already
mentioned earlier, the ex - post update of the subproject could not be done using FARMOD,
because not all data needed for this exercise was available. Only a comparison between
parameters projected at the original preparation and data provided by the Rio FutaleufU
consultants, was possible. Despite this, an approximate calculation was made of the discounted
flow of subproject funds, based on actual data extracted from Gonzalez (2009). This flow of
funds resulted in a negative NPV ofUS$ -1.5 million and a negative IERR of -25%.

and differences in the principal indicators taken into account at preparation and at completion.

     3.67     Positive deviations:
         •    Subproject cost was lower than expected (-45.5 %).
     3.68     Negative deviations:
         •    The expected change in productive vocation did not happen (i.e., high value irrigated
              agriculture replacing extensive livestock herding).                        '
         •    The final area cropped under irrigation was 90.4% less than projected.
         •    The increase in annual NPV is significantly less than projected (1,7 % vs. 272.9 %).
         •    The economic NPV is negative and, obviously, lower than budgeted (US$~ 1.5 m vs. 0.6).
         •    The real IERR is negative and lower than envisaged at preparation (-25.0 % vs. 15.2 %).
         •    Project start-up was delayed by one year and the disbursement period went from 3 to 4
              years.

     3.69     Conclusions:
         •     This subproject is not economically profitable/viable, especially because it did not
             . increase the cropped area under irrigation even though it executed the works programmed
             . at preparation.
         •    Producers did not modify their livestock herding vocation. This attitude impeded the
              development of intensive, irrigated agriculture.


     B: Project Economic Evaluation

     3.70    The ex - ante internal economic rate of return (IERR) for PRO SAP - 22.2% - was
     calculated based on streams of estimated benefits and costs for eleven appraised provincial
     subprojects (the original Group A, comprising 7 Bank-financed subprojects and 4 IDB-financed).
     These results were reported in the SAR. Of those subprojects only two were implemented -


                                                         50
Montecaseros Irrigation (Bank-supported)           and   Constitucion    Irrigation   and   Drainage
Rehabilitation (IDB-supported).
3.71    The Montecaseros and Constitucion subprojects were sUbjected to a thorough impact
evaluation (see main results in Annex 5). This was possible because both subprojects were
prepared bearing in mind the need for monitoring and evaluation, and started implementation in
the early stages of PRO SAP, i.e., they had reached a certain level of maturity by Project
completion.
3.72    During project implementation in 2005, a pipeline of 176 subprojects was developed and
submitted by provinces and national institutions. Of the US$1.1 billion in financing proposals
received, 86 corresponded to the categories of irrigation and drainage (57%), basic infrastructure
(23%) and sanitary and quality controls (6%). However, few of these proposed subprojects had
advanced documentation and financial estimates at the time. The PROSAP portfolio was built
from this pipeline.
3.74     Fourteen provincial subprojects were implemented with Bank financing, benefiting over
108,000 farm families. In addition, PROSAP provided financial resources and technical guidance
for national subprojects. Among these, it is worth mentioning those supporting SENASA and the
Secretariat of Agriculture to develop pilot activities that have since evolved at larger scale under
PROSAP H. However, as most of these subprojects are still not mature enough to have visible
impacts on production, they have been excluded from this evaluation. Their impacts, mostly
indirect, will be more clearly observed over the longer nm.

Assumptions and !imitations:

3.75    The economic evaluation of the overall Project was based on those subprojects which had
valid baseline information, showed differentiated effects on production and had relatively mature
investments. However, administrative         other global costs were charged in order to adopt a
conservative approach. Only irrigation subprojects, as discussed individually in Section A of this
annex, show dear and direct           on production in the short to medium run. Also, they have
been appraised using cost-benefit analysis supported by FARMOD.
3.76    Rural road and electrifkation subprojects in turn, were appraised without identifYing
specific production benefit flows and without using F ARl\lfOD. Moreover, their baselines are
now somewhat irrelevant because of the extensive transfmmation which has occurred in the
Argentine agricultural production structure and geographic production patterns as a result of
extreme changes in international relative commodity prices.
3.77    These subprojects were designed bearing in           products and production structures
which were later largely phased out by the expansion of soy bean production. However, there is a
consensus that road and electrification subprojects have had a very positive economic impact as
they contributed to the structural changes in production and to agricultural growth in the
provinces involved. Although it is virtually impossible to distinguish their specific contribution
to the overall economic transformation, there is a consensus that their impact exceeded
expectations.
3.78      While it is too soon to appreciate globa! impacts of that economic structural change in the
many rural areas of Argentina and to assess the long-term economic and social implications,
initial, preliminary results are promising. For example, results for Rural Road Improvements in
Entre Rios Province show that the area dedicated to extensive livestock decreased 50% and area
for soy/wheat doubled. While these benefits cannot all be attributed to the subproject, improved
transitabiiity is certain to have facilitated them. If the land substitution had been 40%, the gross




                                                51
value of annual production in the area would have increased to US$92.0 million, which would
represent an increase of 44%.
3.79     Similarly, a national Fruit Fly Eradication subproject estimated an increase of 14.3% in
gross value of agro-livestock production from physical investments and support services. Results
show that in citrus producing areas, the proportion of fruits damaged fell from 13% to 0.5%,
representing some 138,000 tons of oranges, mandarines and grapefruit worth US$8.0 m and with
a final market value of around US$32.0 m.
 Methodology:


3.80     The methodology used was the traditional estimation of the investment and benefit net
present value (NPV). From the streams of investments and benefits, internal rates of return were
calculated. The cost data were obtained directly from the Project reports. Benefits were
identified for each type of subproject and data collected via field visits and some from previous
studies and expert validation. The time horizon was 20 years, which. was estimated to be
consistent with the expected useful life of the investments. For the calculation of NPV of the
streams of costs and benefits, a discount rate of 12% was used. It utilized the original FARMOD
structure but prices, yields, investment costs and the rate of incorporation of farmers and
innovations were updated.
Results:

3.81      The table below shows the Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR) of selected
subprojects, totaling 37% of all subproject investments, compared to ex - ante appraisal. It can
be seen in five of the seven. cases that performance was better than expected. In the case of .
Reduccion los Andes and Caminos de Cordoba. While lower than expected, the final IERR is
still acceptable.

3.82    Aggregation of the net flows of each of the six positive subprojects and the inclusion of
the Project implementation unit's costs provides a measure of the Project IERR as a whole. Data
shows an overall IERR of 24.1 % compared to the original Project appraisal IERR of 22.2% and
the sensitivity analysis shows switching values of 29% for production costs and -10% for net
income.

 Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

 A. Impact Evaluation of PRO SAP in the Province of Mendoza (CINEAlUNTREF,
 2007)

  5.1    PRO SAP financed an evaluation of two irrigation subprojects - Montecaseros (Bank-
 financed) and Constitucion (IDB-financed) - in Mendoza Province. Both investments were
 prepared and launched in the early stages of the project and thus had a degree of maturity
 permitting comprehensive evaluation.48 A second evaluation of irrigation subprojects in Tucuman
 Province was still under completion at the time of ICR preparation and results were not available.
 The project also financed completion studies of most Bank-supported subprojects which involved
 in several cases non-structured interviews with beneficiaries and other stakeholders to gauge
 more generally their views on their subproject and perceived impacts. Several are summarized
 below. All project studies may be accessed online from the PROSAP website:
 www.prosaponiine.gov.ar.

 5.2     The Mendoza Province evaluation was based on beneficiary surveys conducted in 2007
 with results measured against baseline information collected by interview during project
 preparation in 1993-94, and compared with a control groUp.49 Since the baseline information
 available covered only beneficiary producers, it was not possible to compare the evolution of the
 beneficiary cohort with the control group. The latter was therefore developed based on a random
 sample of 80 producers similar to the beneficiaries in the subproject areas but where subprojects
 had not intervened.

5.3     Both subprojects sought to improve the management· of irrigation and drainage systems
through the rehabilitation of the main irrigation channels and construction of drainage networks.
Agricultural research and agricultural extension services were also included to improve
beneficiaries' production technology. The goal was to (i) increase production and productivity
and reduce production costs through lower electricity consumption from reduced pumping of
underground water; and (ii) increase production of higher quality grapes - from table grapes to
wine grapes- since about 80% of the subprojects' aggregate area was at that time, dedicated to
grape production.

Impacts:

5.4          The following positive outcomes were measured for the areas studied:

        •    Area under cultivation increased 36%
        •    Yields improved: grapes 80%, fruits 192%, vegetables 194%
        •    Crops were diversified: 30% of overall grape production dedicated to fine wine grapes
             compared to zero pre-subproject
        •    Water conduction efficiency improved an average 15%
        •    Intra-farm water use increased by 16%



48   See Estudio de Evaluacion del Impacto de los Proyectos del PROSAP en la Provincia de Mendoza, CINENUNTREF, 2007.

 The original survey in 1993-94 covered 120 producers of which by 2007 only 91 still existed. Of these, a Treatment Group of73
49
was interviewed, an effectiveness rate of 80%.




                                                              56
5.5     The evaluation also showed that more efficient irrigation and productive systems reduced
the need for producers to work off-farm - enabling them to focus on on-farm development - and
increased the demand for on-fann, hired labor. About 60% of beneficiary producers were hiring
workers compared to 40% of the control group, suggesting the potential for more capitalized
business activity in subproject areas.

5.6      Technical assistance support was found to be a strong factor in improved production
results. While 12% of producers in the baseline cohort received technical assistance, 61 % of
beneficiaries were receiving assistance during the survey of which 29% were receiving it
regularly. This compared to 55% and 22% respectively for control group producers.

5.7      The evaluation found that subproject activities .had a positive impact on beneficiary
perception and satisfaction levels. While 56% of interviewed beneficiary farmers were generally
positive about water supply in spring and summer (vs. 16% of the baseline), some 66% were
satisfied with the overall impact of project activities: 60% with the quantity of water delivered,
and about 40% with increases in production volume, yields and income.

5.8     However, the evaluation also revealed several shortcomings. The most significant - at·
that time - was the subprojects' failure to modernize on-farm irrigation systems as evidenced by
producers' continued use of surface irrigation, almost complete absence of advanced irrigation
systems, persistent pumping of underground water among one-third of beneficiaries (as in the
baseline). There was little differentiation from the control group. Further, at the time of the
survey, significant improvements to on-farm infrastructure, applied technology and the
introduction of new machinery were not detected.

Conclusions:

5.9      The evaluation concluded that while good results were registered in production and yields
from improved water availability/regularity and TA activities, further comprehensive
interventions were needed. It was found that about 31 % of idle land in the intervention areas
could potentially also be put into production if additional irrigation water became available. This
proportion was 39% in the control group. The study recommended incentives to promote
complementary on-farm investments, e.g., using non-refundable contributions (NRC), in modem
irrigation systems and other as~ets to increase the production on all available land and further
diversify production to higher-value crops and crop varieties to increase the returns to the
additional water. This lesson was incorporated in design elements of PROSAP II.

B.       Evaluation of Private Investment Promoted by PRO SAP (pirker, 2006)

5.10     A beneficiary sample was interviewed, comprising persons recommended by the EPDA,
extension technicians, and other professionals. The approach was basically qualitative. Types of
subprojects covered included irrigation, rural roads, .and animal/plant health. The working
hypothesis was: (i) that all public investment stimulates further investment within the productive
systems and territories, but that sources of financing are often the critical constraint; (ii) that it is
not possible to isolate completely the impact of one subproject on producers' intentions to invest;
and (iii) that the intent was to capture private sector behavior and not the investments themselves
generated by the subproject.

 (a)        Results: Taft del Valle Irrigation Subproject (Tucuman Province):

        •   Producers indicated strong intentions to make new investments on-farm but finding new
            financing was an important objective and most felt they would have to access public,
            subsidized sources, i.e., the PROSAP investment was a necessary condition for further
            investment but could not guarantee its availability.

        •   Small producers tend to lack organization, collateral and lor commercial receipts and thus
            cannot gain access to regular bank financing.

        •   Rents had increased about 40% but it could not be determined if this was an effect of the
            subproject.

        •   Some producers were branching into other, non-productive activities such as tourism.

, (b)       Results: Agro-Livestock Health Subproject (La RiQja Province):

        •   Most of the producers interviewed were small and micro-scaled and none of them were
            part, of formal marketing groups, none were included in traceable production systems
            with export potential, and none had access to formal financial markets. They lacked
            productive scale, and thus the resources to make further investments.

        •   Most were accessing subsidized public funds for on-farm investment in tools, small lots,
            vehicle repair, and purchase of used tractors.

        •   Most lacked any entrepreneurial vision, were producing at a subsistence level and sold
            their labor off-farm.

        •   Fruit fly eradication had markedly reduced their crop losses but the subproject had not
            promoted new forms of management or organization designed to move such producers
            out of their poverty and marginal productive endeavors.

 (c)        Results: Irrigation and Drainage (Mendoza Province):

   ',.      Producers with complementary off-farm employment had already made investments on
            their properties due to the technical assistance received as part of their subproject.
            Investments' included tools, small civil works and crop conversion with their own
            resources since again, access to credit was virtually zero.

        •   Labor was in short supply but persons applying for jobs often found they were not trained
            for delicate work (fine grape packing).

        •   Irrigation investments as well as technical assistance undoubtedly influenced
            beneficiaries investment planning but Pirker maintains that it would not have happened
            without the Peso devaluation in 2002.

          •     Important investment processes are associated with the construction of rural roads in
                Entre Rios, especially for dairy ventures ;md the future development of chicken
                production in zones formerly un-passable for parts of the year.

          II    The new roads have changed families' social interactions and permitted chidren to
                regularize school attendance and laborers to access ~ork more reliably.

          II   A majority of agro-livestock producers in subproject areas had. already made new
               investments due to the general business environment but also because of the better road
               conditions.

          II   Land prices had increased but more due to the pressure from expanding soybean
               production than the new roads.

          ..   Farmers were found to be variously self-financing new investments ,or accessing formal
               financial institutions.

      ..       Skilled labor was in short supply.

      .. . Newlbetter roads had reduced operational costs through savings in fuel and· reduction in
          time expended. .

      II       Taxation pressures were also found to be discouraging productive investments.

C.              Rural Electrification Subproject in Neuquen Province (Martinez, 2006)

5, I I   Metbodology: This analysis looked at: targeting and accessabiIity; beneficiaries'
perception of the intervention; effects on beneficiaries in terms of quality of life and/or
production; participation of beneficiaries in its development and management;.and,identification
of beneficiary problems and demands. The study used semi~structured interviews of beneficiaries,
public technicians and authorities combined with field wotk. Beneficiaries were characterized as
foHows: little negotiating power; low productivity; scarce application of a technology package;
difficult or no access to credit; deteriorated natural resources situation; high percentage selling
their taopr off-farm; and using anisanal production to supplement livestock-raising. Average
land-holding is four hectares of which they irrigate and cultivate 40~80%. Lackofelectricity was
the main factor limiting their use of irrigation pumps, even though water is plentiful in the zone.
Land tenure is precarious.            .

5.12     Targeting and access While the subproject had no explicit targeting criteria, all
subproject documents showed a strong emphasis on the subproject's social impact, on quality of
life and 011 improving the opportunities for neglected groups. The project gravitated to using
established (indigenous) groups in the area.

Results:

      •        In general, beneficiaries felt that the subproject was consistent with their defined
               problem/need.




                                                    59
•   Beneficiaries expressed un811imouslslltisfaction with the electrification works andtbeir
    opportunity to connect to the lines; and demand for connection was widespread.

•   The vast majority of beneficiaries cited domestic benefits of energy in the first instance,
    such as acquisition of a freezer or television,

•   The educational benefits of electricity were also frequently cited.

•   There was broad .awareness of the potential productive benefits and interest in specific
    uses of the energy, but its installation was too recent for this to have developed.

•   There was unanimous agreement that the training, including in specific productive
    activities, which accompanied the energy connection, was valuable.

•   However, beneficiaries commonly said they had not participated at any stage of the
    subproject's development, and execution and were unaware of any institutional avenues
    for doing t~is.

•   The original intention was to contract indigenous leaders to act as interlocutors and
    organizers but this had not occurred due to a series of institutional and financial
    restrictions affecting this component of the subproject.

•   The study concludes that the original, broad, subproject "vision" was inconsistent with
    the technology introduced by the electricity works. The subproject sought sustainable
    development involving the generation of new technologies, adaptation of existing
    technologies to     the realities of beneficiaries' productive systems, institutional
    strengthening of producer organizations and even the placement of their products in
    different consumer markets, with training workshops supporting the production of
    artisanal goods andagro-tourism development.

•   This inconsistency was attributed to the disconnect between the works themselves -
    managed by EPEN headquarters - and the strategic aspects - developed by EPDA-SUEC
    with the Ministry of ProduCtion and Tourism , and the lack of contact/communication
    between both agencies.

•   Finally, as is common in poorer rural areas, including outside Argentina, the lines
    installed were bi-phasic and did not permit productive activity. Tri-phasic lines are 25%
    more costly, but would have positioned everyone for productive activities.

7.17 . Technology Development: This activity "crossed" all subprojects, implying the
improvement of services to generate and transfer technology, thereby stimulating the participation
of the private sector. Its incorporation showed impact through better productivity and the
modernization and improvement of productive mechanisms.                                .
7.18     Animal Health: . The main objectiVe was to strengthen activities in the fight against
Aftosa fever (foot and mouth disease), BSE, tuberculosis, brucellosis, sarna and garrapata,
through eradication campaigns, systems to prevent re-infection, early.warning systems and the
establishment of areas free of quarantinable diseases. Activities supported mainly, national and
provincial public organisms, as well as private health entities. In this aspect, PROSAP
contributed decisively to recovering control over Aftosa Fever and as a result, recovery of meat
markets which had been closed to Argentina with the outbreak of this disease. The target was
achieved through the construction of six Control Posts for Aftosa Fever monitoring; almost
complete finalization of the Laboratory for the Diagnosis and Monitoring/Control of Animal
Disease NBS2 and NBS3; and, a system ofsanitary and epidemiological control of the movement
of cattle to prevent and control Aftosa Fever. In regard to the prevention of TSE, 7,680
controls/inspections were made of food plants, and 12,125 cerebral samples were analyzed.
Finally, we should reiterate the achievement of certification and maintenance of the "country fee
of Avian Influenza" thanks to activities developed by PROSAP.                        . .
7; 19 ,Plant Health: With the goal of strengthening interventions in the eradication and control
of diseases, early-warning systems, extension services for plant health, control and integrated
management ofpests, transport registration/records, use and storage of agro-chemicals, training in
the rational useof agro-.chemicals, certification of phytosanitary and seed quality, control and
registration of commercial genetic material, phyto-sanitary barriers and chemical control of pests
and diseases, we note special attention to the pests "Fruit Fly", "Canker and Black Spot in Citrus:
and BoU weevil in cotton. Among the most important activities, we note the construction of a bio-
plant for the production of sterile insects, six sanitary control posts, and the carrying out of
important campaigns to prevent and control pests and diseases. In this way, 1,420 ha of
diseased/infected orchards were removed. The results bfiefly described benefited about 40,000
producers in the fruit sector with a total area exceeding 85,000 ha.
7.20     Commercial Development: The project sought to provide assistance to the provinces to
fonnulate activities to promote exports through the identification of potential markets,
establishment of commercial contacts, and detection of the. conditions and requirements for such.
The project supported 1,600 producers in Chaco Province to promote market opportunities for
non-traditional products, e.g., organic honey, meat products etc: Also, the project sought to
generate possibilities for 2,550 young people developing activities linked to agro-livestock
production nation-wide, by establishing and putting into operation 17 Entrepreneurial
Development Centers.
7.21    Food Quality: With the objective of supporting the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock
and Fisheries (MAGyP, the ex-SAGPyA) in its responsibilities related to the development of
technologies, regulation and control of food safety, the project executed 50 pilots in quality
standards for their marketing both internally and externally. Also, 14,000 business-people,
producers and professionals were supported and trained in best practices·for food production.
7.22    Institutional Strengthening: The project implemented training           workshops and
delivered equipment and technical assistance to jurisdictions linked to PROSAP in order to
strengthen their capacity to identify, formulate, evaluate, and execute policies, programs and
projects inthe agro-livestock sector..
7.23    As explained, PRO SAP was executed in a sustained manner since 2003 with marked
progress in its final years. The program demonstrated a high capacity to adjust to the distinct,


                                               64
critical, stagnant or growth periods affecting the country, and even more to maintain its objectives
and benefit about 109,000 small and medium farmers distributed in 22 provinces.
7.24    It is clear that the process of learning which the project's growth implied in its areas of
intervention and in the specific requirements of each province where the project operated, as well
as in the breadth of demand for project activities, required development through a "trial and
error" approach to implementing the subprojects. Improved performance permitted the distinct
areas of PRO SAP to "socialize" these experiences, which facilitated the correct execution of
subprojects and converted the lessons learned into multipliers and facilitators for the distinct
stages beneficiaries went through during the subproject cycle.
Lessons:
Design and institutional hallmark of the program:

    • Objective evaluation of a project like PROSAP requires a precise definition of its
      development objectives, indicators and baseline.

•     For all Programs financed by two or more international financial institutions, dates of
      approval, signature and effectiveness need to be synchronized to the extent possible between
      the institutions. When this is not the case, as occurred with this Program, delays, slow
      organizational processes, declining motivation and unnecessary costs result.

•     Due to the laws of a federal republic, programmed execution times need to take into account
      the obstacles and delays which may result from the need to respect provincial constitutions
      and laws. Projects with "standard" timing are inadequate for such conditions, which may
      merit longer preparation times prior to effectiveness.

•     Technical capacity to prepare, execute and evaluate subprojects involving public investments
      is generally limited and heterogeneous. This creates delays and difficulties and should be
      corrected by differentiated programming based on the capacity of each province and with
      appropriate TA and training from the VEC.

•     Capacity to assume debt and counterpart funding vary greatly between provinces, creating in
      the less well-endowed a vicious cycle of poverty, i.e., the poorest have less capacity to invest
      and this confines them to poverty. This was detected during PROSAP I, leading to the
      explicit recommendation that the program should apply higher percentages of financing for
      less-developed provinces.

•     The long-term sustainability of subprojects is dependent on their execution by provincial
      entities, building capacity and commitment throughout the subproject cycle and strong
      relationships of trust with beneficiary communities.

Results of the Program (products and effects):

•    The main products of the water resources and electrification subprojects (i.e., civil works)
     were implemented with problems and notably, the greater the level of institutional experience,
     the less problems during subproject execution. Thus, in provinces with less institutional
     capacity and experience, projects need to program more intensive technical assistance and
     supervision.




                                                  65
•   The provision of inputs (vaccinations, ramps, signs etc) in all animal andlor plant health
    subprojects was ,largely without technical or logistical problems in subprojects executed by
    national and provincial entities. However, the lessons are: (i) the pace of subproject
    administration (disbursement and procurement) should be adjusted to the operational
    demands of naturaVrural cycles; and (ii) linkage between national and provincial
    ~tivities/players is increasingly essential.


•   The provision of products corresponding to distinct components (e,g., civil works and agro-
    livestock extension services) was sometimes delayed, and not coordinated among the main
    involved players. Lack of harmonization between components (of subprojects) has negative
    impact on expected outcomes.

•   In rural electrification subprojects it was expected that once the primary network was
    installed, homes and properties would be connected. It was learned that this process is not
    immediate and that beneficiaries, generally producers with modest resources, delayed such
    connection. When dealing with poor local people, mechanisms are needed to enable them to
    connect, thereby also sustaining the effectiveness of the works provided by the subproject.
    §imilar1y, irrigation investments require that beneficiaries become connected to water 'user
    assopiations and this needs awareness-building,promotion and diffusion to ensure results.

•   The adoption of new productive technologies (as expected by various subprojects) has greater
    impact when linked synergistically with infrastructure components. Adjustments to design
    and to modalities for executing technical assistance components have been incorporated in
    PRO SAP II to facilitate this.

•    Precesses designed to foster association and organization of the users of irrigation systems
    ,and oth@r infrastructvre works to ensure their maintenance, were not as effective as expected.
     The lesson learned is that it is necessary to increase the allocation of resources for these
     purposes and increase the effort to promote awareness in and build up, water user
     associations.

•   Various expected effects were not achieved due to the relative lack of complementarity
    between PRO SAP and other programs and projects, and with other related sectors, e.g.,
    tran~port and private programs. Thus, the identification of complementary investments and
    programs and active coordination with them should be part of the process of formulating
    subprojects.

•   The effectiveness of SUbprojects is highly-related to institutional and technical
    maturity/experience of the responsible provincial executing agencies. In cases where
    weaknesses or lack of experience are detected, the VEC assigned greater resources ,and
    attention to ensure achievement of the expected effects. Differentiated actions are needed,
    depending on the type of issue and degree of deficiency.

Implementation of the Program:

• Such programs need to incorporate in their design, a new organizational structure for the
  VEC, carefully defining the responsibilities of each of its areas and establishing a heirarchy
  of internal and external controls. The project Manual of Organization and Procedures needs
  to include a destailed description of administrative processes and cycles, as wen as the
  mission and functions of each area of the VEC.



                                               66
II!   The subproject preparation cycle was slow. Serious technical and administrative liniitations
      were detected affecting the pace and rhythm of subproject preparation and assistance to
      affected provinces, during the project's first four years. This was associated with the lack of a
      critical mass of consultants and technical personnel at the provincial level (and to some extent
      national level) due to existing limitations on remuneration, and which created delays and
      sluggish approval and execution of subprojects. Agencies such as neA with institutional and
      technical capacity are useful for resolving such problems.

..    The long-term objectives of national and provincial agro-livestock development require an
      institutional framework longer than what is usually assigned to projects such as PRO SAP (i.e.,
      6-7 years). The greater sustainability of the program derived from a longer trajectory, builds
      harmonization of policies and programs and in relationships with the productive 'private
      sector.

Monitoring and Evaluation:

..    Implementation of the Project Monitoring and Evaluation System (SSEP) enabled the
      homogenization/standardization of infomlatiol1, its availability to all those involved directly
      and indirectly in the execution of each subproject. It was learned that incorporating the
      methodology as an integral part of the Subproject Monitoring and Petformance Report
      contributed to subproject executors establishing mechanisms for attending to deviations from
      expected performance between what was programmed and what was executed.

'"    It is necessary to fommlate, establish and operate a monitoring sub-system for the subproject
      formulation stage. This enables reliable and timely information to be available concerning
      the periods of study and design of each subproject in the portfolio under preparation and acts
      a<; a support to management decisions about these.


@     It is also important to organize and systematize the results obtained in order to review and
      analyze program evolution, and to disseminate experiences and lessons in a timely way.
