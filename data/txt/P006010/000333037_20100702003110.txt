7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
1.
To increase and diversify agricultural production and exports through intensifying land use, increasing 
productivity per hectare, and introducing new crops and modern varieties.  2. To increase and stabilize the 
agricultural incomes of about 120,000 small and medium-sized commercial farms.  3. To improve the 
effectiveness of basic agricultural support services to increase the international competitiveness of 
agricultural products, by introducing new and more productive technologies, increasing quality and 
improving sanitary conditions of products, and eradicating diseases that limit access to international 
markets.  4. To improve rural productive infrastructure to reduce production and marketing costs, through a 
significant reduction in the risk of losses (crops, livestock, equipment and facilities), as well as more 
efficient use and better conservation and management of natural resources.  5. To strengthen national and 
provincial institutional capacity to formulate and analyze sectoral development policy, as well as to 
identify, prepare and implement investment projects.  6.  To rationalize public investments and promote an 
expanded private sector role (e.g., farmers' organizations, NGOs, and service providers) in agricultural 
development.
