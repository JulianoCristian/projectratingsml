2.     Financing. The PROSAP project is currently supported by an Additional
Financing (AF) Loan in the amount of US$37.0 million, which came on top of an original
loan in the amount of US$125 million that is fully disbursed. The original loan (4150-

                                           3
AR) was approved by the Bank's Board on January 20, 1998.. The AF Loan (7425-AR)
was approved by the Board on January 23, 2007, was signed on August 16, 2007 and
became effective on September 10, 2007. Both loans share the overall objectives of,
inter alia, increasing and diversifying agricultural production and exports; increasing and
stabilizing agricultural income for small and medium-sized beneficiary producers;
improving the effectiveness of basic agricultural support services to increase
competitiveness; and improving rural productive infrastructure. The approval of the AF
was based on the good performance of the original loan over the past few years, and to
cover a financing gap of ongoing activities while the Bank and the GoA conducted a
dialogue regarding a second phase of the project.

3.     Disbursements. The project has disbursed 80 percent (US$29.7 million) of the AF
loan to date. The pace of disbursements has been brisk during FY10 since the start of
construction work in the SENASA (National Service for Agrifood Sanitation and
Quality) compound, the main undertaking being supported through the AF. Thus, it is
expected that the remainder of the loan funds will be disbursed by the closing date.


4.      Achievements to date. All of the expected outcomes proposed for the AF, except
for the completion of the construction of a new High (Level 3) Bio-security Diagnostic
Laboratory (HBDL) and the remodeling of existing laboratories and quarantine facilities
belonging to SENASA, have been achieved. Completion of the SENASA activities,
mostly confined to equipping the new and remodeled facilities, will be financed through
the PROSAP II project (Second Provincial Agricultural Project, Loan 7597-AR).

5.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to accommodate the larger than expected
costs for works, and expenditures in consultant's and non-consultant services and training
(due to the extension of the project closing date in 2008 by 18 months), by lowering the
allocation for goods and recurrent costs as shown above. These changes will not have an
impact on achievement of the Project Development Objective since, as mentioned,
unfunded procurement of goods to equip SENASA facilities will be financed through the
PROSAP II project.
