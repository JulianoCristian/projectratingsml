                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         1. To increase and diversify agricultural production and exports through intensifying land use, increasing productivity per hectare, and introducing new crops
                         and modern varieties. 2. To increase and stabilize the agricultural incomes of about 120,000 small and medium-sized commercial farms. 3. To improve the
                         effectiveness of basic agricultural support services to increase the international competitiveness of agricultural products, by introducing new and more
                         productive technologies, increasing quality and improving sanitary conditions of products, and eradicating diseases that limit access to international markets.
                         4. To improve rural productive infrastructure to reduce production and marketing costs, through a significant reduction in the risk of losses (crops, livestock,
                         equipment and facilities), as well as more efficient use and better conservation and management of natural resources. 5. To strengthen national and provincial
                         institutional capacity to formulate and analyze sectoral development policy, as well as to identify, prepare and implement investment projects. 6. To rationalize
                         public investments and promote an expanded private sector role (e.g., farmers' organizations, NGOs, and service providers) in agricultural development. 7.
                         Improve maternal and child health through the delivery of quality services, and to strengthen disease surveillance and control activities, all for purposes of
                         reducing the acute risk of disease in the Borrower's territory.
