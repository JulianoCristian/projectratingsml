The following lessons can be drawn:\n            1) It is crucial to rely on continuity and not sacrifice\n            project supervision while prematurely preparing a parallel\n            project. 2) Technical assistance needs to be carefully\n            monitored and based on clear terms of reference and if well\n            targeted can support local capacity and help develop a\n            greater sense of responsibility and ownership from the\n            central and local governments. 3) Effective and efficient\n            solid waste collection can be provided in large cities like\n            Conakry by small scale local private contractors using low\n            cost technologies. 4) Financing of solid waste collection\n            can be achieved through direct collection of user charges\n            when services are regularly provided and households are\n            willing to pay. 5) Up front and appropriate compensation and\n            clearing of customary land tenure are fundamental to any\n            urban land development program. 6) Bank and borrower\n            commitments are paramount for project success."}, "docdt": "1998-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
