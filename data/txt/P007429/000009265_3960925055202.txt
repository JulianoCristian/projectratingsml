13      The sec'ond factor affecting pr!j.ct implementatiwi ultimately had
'poAitive impacti on' *f focti7eness of the proj ct investmentes   The rapid
growth and hlg^ level of sauceses of the HIARE  training system dur*ng 1983
and 1984, ind tho significant oxpansion of the Ministry of Education (MOE)
techical and vocational training system  "sisted by financi4g from other
&ap,urc*9, led to a Government decisiati to phase out the inadequately
financed MM skill training system.  Consequently the decision va. made,
and a#eeod to by the Bank in late 1984q to substitute HEART tra4ning
centers for the MOY-IPC centers.  Although this change resulted in a 17
month 4ncrea.e in the t4me re,.,guired for iqmpletion of the project, it was a
positive 's'1ep in itreamlining tbe skills training system and improving (its
e ffi4        and effectiveness t"rough the adoption of an improved training
model.

16.     Imua-t of Project.  (a)  Sectoral' Gowth andI Policy  ttainment.
The qualitative and quantitative developments in the CAST and HEART train-'
ing oystems, and in the VTDI in-plant'instructor training progrsam, have
provided the inst*tutional base for the attainmept of sectoral policy
goals; and (b)  faniower. Emolovment and Industrial Develovmqnt'i  The HEART
trainlng centers are, for the first time In tamaica, making it possible for
o4-acf-school youtY_ and _ adults, who may not- havo, completed secondary

tions 'in the. areas of hotel asd tourlm skills and applied 'agricultural
production.  Employmentjopportuinities i4 the former are' \xcellent, and,' as
diversification and-p rductivity increases in agricultur, are a government
priority, employment opportunities fotXihe latter are expected to increase.
At the time of. pom,pletiont 171 trainees had praduated fro4t the hotel and,
toiriem programs and  ll of them were promptlr employed by major touriqt
resorts.  In ttW first'year of operation, 260 e  loye.s of touriist villla,

*.  Proiect Sustainablitv
17.     Major achievements of,Jamaica's decade-long commitment to economic
adjustment has been the restoration of econot c growth and a sharp increase
of public financing for social services, including education and traizing.
Th*s. more solid fiscal foundation helps ensure, continuing finance of op'ra-
tions.   Sustainability is also secured as the result of the expanding
demand for services and through selected institutional efforts at genera-
tion of additional revenue through cost recovery schemes.  There is no
doubt that the REAR1, Hotel and Tourism Skills' Training Center is sustain-
able over the medium and longer terms. The design output of 250/year from
the hotel and tourism programs is only 2.5S of the work force in the
tou4sm ind4stry, or barely enough to replace attrition losses in the
\sectdr:  The very high quality and location of the physical ilant and the
quality 'and realism of its training program (it has its own 20 ,room delu*e
hotel and provides additional restaurant service 'to a group ot nearby
villa.) assure' a steady flow of incomes In addition to the hig8 quality of
the' physical plant, equipment,.and the large and practical livestock,and
crop production facilities of tAe Agricultural Training Center, the effec-
tLve management of the center by the Ministry of Agricultural helps to
a ssure the sustainability of this training center. The sustainability, of,
the CAST programs is also high due to:  (a) day students' fees finance
about 20S of per student costs; at the same time t.he recent 131 total
"enrol1mint increase, in.new and well equipped facilities, wa entirely in
-  art-time and evening classes with the latter making up 701 of the toual;
(b) the evening class students ara lrgely employed workers whose feet pay
a highei percentage of the total costs than those of day students; (c) the
t'chnlic4 teacher training program is the only source of  +eachers for the
expanding.teebhn.ic 'secondary school system$ (d) its programs are the only
source of medium = end higher level technicians and technologists in the
ountry for the major employment.growth sectors of the economy (manufac-
. turin, construction and setvices) whose growth during the 1980 to  387'
period ranged from 502 tQ 802; 'and (e) recent permission, t grant adjunct
'faculty statu  to paFt-tile.and evening class faculty will help to assure
better quality faculty 'and reduc  unit costs.  Althpugh it is the only
source of certain types of in-plant industrial ski-lls instructors, the VTDI
a, vocaticial instructor training program may not be sustainable in its
present form. Twenty-eight, of the thirty-two industrial training centers
of the MY, for which VTDI suppXied instructors, have been closed since
1983.  Although it trains some instructors for the HEART and.maintenance

instructors/woikers for the miltary, the future of VTDIs 18 unce"tain as i 
is now constituted.  Its role for the 1990's must be're-deftned'. With th4
cooparation of CAST and others a more viable med*m term role is currently
bding prepared.
H. Bank Performacea
18.     Esior Strengths and Weaknesses.  Bank staff contrlbuted to the
asof the project through supportive working relationships and profes-
sio1al advice.,, However, some ohortcomings vore evidents' () the initial
delays in construction could possibly have been reduced ,if the Bank had
followed-up immedistely after negotiations to eusure timely Governmeui
saction on civil works contr.cting.  In fact, a supervision mission with
essential technical staff was delayed until January 1983. By this tim  the
civil works scheduli vas 4-5 months behind schedule (Annex 3, Table 5); and
(b) after'the March-April 1984 mission through project closing on June 30,
1988, some project changes occurred and moderate problem  in civil works
and equipment procurement were common (Part TII, para. 35 and table 12).
But during the last fourvyears of projedt. implementation of this technical-
vocational project, only two ot the six supervision missiond included a
technical educator.  In the interval from November 1984 to October 1985 no
supervision mission was  carried out.  During this period the National
Development Agency (IDA)t the PIU, was dissolved..
19.    \LSlons Lg#xMd.. The pri#aipal lessons learned or again con-
fitrmed, with implications to other projectst as a result of the experiences
during prqject implementation and the preparation of the PCR are suuarized
below.
(a)  Project Implementation and the Bank0s monitQring should begin
immediately after negotiation.
(b) When a \supervision mission finds unanticipated and aigni-
Ificant delays in implementstion, it should inform government
authorities as to the delays and requept them to seek solu-
tions.  A prompt follow-up mission sta'ffld with appropriate
technical specialistW should be agreed and comfirmed by Bank
management.                                               -
(c)  Supervision missions should, in-so-far as logistically
possible, be fielded at appropriate and flexible intervals
for \ timely interventions ia the prevention of problems or
reduction in the severity-of their effect.
(d) 8upervision missions occasionaily lacked continuity of
,members fully knowledgeable of the ptoject, or members with
the proper specialications to aid the PIU and participating
irAnstitutions in implementation matters.

£') Whenever a loan is amended to change the composition and size
of project coaponents, the Bank sbo-*ld inform the PIU and the
new organi tioniss to the amount of loan funds available, by,
'categorles of expenditure, and ensure that appropriate
accounting practices are in plaee to track expenditures by
ca!omnent and participating institutions.
(f) Whenever a major change is made iQ the local organization
responsible for project coordination, Bank supervisory staff
should practice the ame rigorous pr6tedures $n assessing the
new PIU as were used in the approval of the ir'iginal one.
I.   Borrowe  Performance
20.     Malor 8trenetho and W aknesses.  Except for the initial delays in
4intiation,of civil works tend4ring and contracting (Part I, paras. 8 and
9), the NDA performed well   the PIU until it was dissolved in early 1985.
After that date implemetation (largely managed by the participating
training systems themselves) suffered from the lack of guidance and cc+ rdi-
nation, particularly reporting on cOaitments and expenditures, even though
the Project Division of the MOE was assigned as the PIU. '.During this
period, implementation of the two HEART centers was carried out well in
view of the substantial increases in the amount of civil works.  The tech-
nical assistance:comp9nents-of each of the training systems was implemented
efficiently and effectively.   The specifications. of much of th4 early
equipment packaiea required considerable reviiion, and additional time,
before being successfully tendered.
21.      Lessons Learned.  The major lesson learned by the participating
tratza   systems, after the dissolution of the *DA, Vas that an externally
finaneed project incLuding several independent organizations requires
central coordination if it is to advance smoothly.  A second lesson worth
noting was that even though preLiminary equIpment lists 7re available, say,
at n6gotlations, equipment specifications may well require additional
preparation and thorough review by supervisors or a PIU equipment specia-
list.  It is common to underestimate the additional technical work and time
re 4ured to finalize the bidding documpnts.

this project (Part I, paras. 15-16),  esspite the unexpected problem of
diisolut40n of the PIU, is. a result of thae aaal  trking relatiotiships
between the Bank and the Borrower, and between the Various participating-
groups themselves. An additional contributing factor was the high level of
professLonallsm of all parties involved.

24.     Ade-qacy of Staff Apnral(al Renort and Ma'jlr Workins Papors.
Original docu4entation for the project vas adequate. A number of working
papers which \are most necessary to project implementation' could be bound
separately as an Implementation tool for the PIU,  participating institu-
tions, and Sank supervision staff. Easy access to this format would help
ensure iFstitutional _meory if project 'taff change or, as in this case, if

25.     Avalalbility of Rejevant Data to PCO Mission.  Although a pre-
mission seminar was conductid with senior staff of partiqipating, institu-

II.. PROJJCT REvIEW PBiOIIO   IRLS PERSPECTIVE
A. Adeuuscv and Accuracy of  gactual Information In Part III
26.      The country data, defining  the project profile at completion as
preqtented in Part III, was prepared by the particips+tlng institutions and.
discussed thoroughly in the field. It was collated into the four master
tables in Annex 3, cross-checked with-the field tables, and these served as
the basis for the tables in Part III.
B. Evaluation of rank's -Performance and Ltgson Learned
27.      Bank peroonnel were recognized as professional in all respects.
While mlssidi members were always highly qualified in their respective
flelds, there were occasions when the composition.of supervision missions
was not appropriate to addresd the kinds of implementation problems occur-
a ring.  The length of time between some missions, especially the 12 mouth
interval betmeen  the October 1984 and October 1985 missions which came-at'
a time of significant changes in the project sandproblems in Implementa-
tion, was excessive.
28.      The malor lesson learned is that the overall communications
between the Bank and the Borrower, including aecounting of commit ents and
drawdown of losan proceeds, should be sufficiently well documented so that
when the changes in government or mission personnel occur such changes will
not unduly affect project implementation.
C. Evalustion of-Borrover' s Own Performance and Lessons Learned              - - 
29.      The performnuce of the partic4ating- iinstitutions in overall
project planning wa  quite good.  T4e Implementation of the specialist
asoistanca-ndT fellowship programs, and especially in cErriculum upgrading
and improvements in planning and administration of traintng programs, were
carried out with little or no problems.
30.      The \equipment specifications for the first ICB tender were not
adequate for tendering and required considerable revision by the British
Crovn Agents, who were contracted as proc4rement agents.  This had little
negative effect on project implementation;\ however, if there had been no
delays in the completion of civil works, this deficiency could have been
costly.
31.      After the dissolution of the MDA, ihich had been operating quite
effettively as the PIU, no formally constituted and effectively operating
PiU was frganised.  Each participating group - CAST, HEART, VTDI and the
primary textbo k team - was made responsible for implezenting its own
component. Consequently, there were no cleat lines of autho*ity in project
management and no coordinatio of the various project compon¶nts. Unfortu-
nately, one of the participats, as a result of not knowing the amount of
loan funds available for e4uipment, overspent its allocation.   This  ' 
resulted in a corresponding shortfall in the funts for one of the other
Institutions, X difference that was made up by thI  government.

of equipmuent specification. before going out to tegderg and (0) any

agency, should hpve a central coordinating unit with clearly stated respon-
sibilities and authority throughout the life of the project.

proposed ,project belig placed on 'hold" In midr4979. After the 1980 4anmge
in the Cov'ernaient, discussion. between the Baok and the ',:ew administration
Kvere re-ooened and led to an ftreeumet to re-appraise the' proposed 'project
to re  .c   hg#i   h             oconomic  setting and to Incorporate -the~
plane of the new administration. Those circuawnetsce which. resulted in 
some initial delay, nsvertbelese, lttuately led to two positlve develop-
mute. *The-, first of these vas the creation of the NUAT training system, 
which quicklyv grew out of the project requirement that a N41,onsl Training
,Board be promptly dovelop,d (Part I., para. 4). The second was the avail-
ability of more adequate counterpart funding for the expanded civil works'
trora of CAS9 which enAbled it to become' asucizessful post-secondary
tchnician training institution *A  additional positive t~esult of the
dlely vas that the rapidly inproviung seoa and political clinate, under.
the new adaAnietration,, attracted a large aomout of bilae\eral specialist

39.      Staff In.tVs.   ;n regard to the reductions in staff-weeks of
supervision frot44 Weeks pr year to an average of less than 3.5 weeks per
year, attention is called to Table 12 on mission d4ta. - t can.\be seen th~at
during the last half of the implementation cycle, when overall projkct
management was de#eriorating and financing and4procurement were never above
the moderate problem levels, the average otaff weeks per year of supervi-
sion was only about 502 that of the fi*st half of the cycle,l and no
te¢hnical educator was i*cluded in any of the mi8sions.  This add other
evidende discussed in Part I, Section 1, Project Implementation, clearly
in4icate that the reduction in supervisory staff and, the type of staff
pr4bably contributed to the three year overrun in implementation.,
