expansion of three\n            small and overcrowded harbors on the mainland, where part of\n            the evacuated Vestmannaeyjar fleet of 80 vessels has\n            currently taken refuge. The project comprises: (1) detailed\n            engineering (including a model hydraulic study) and\n            construction of a new breakwater, basin and quays at\n            Thorlakshofn; (2) construction of new quays, dredging of the\n            basin, rockblasting and dredging of the channel and entrance\n            at Grindavik, and; (3) construction of a new quay at Hornafjordur."}, "docdt": "1973-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
