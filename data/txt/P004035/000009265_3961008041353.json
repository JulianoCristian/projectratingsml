Both private sector imports will be eligible\n            for financing, subject to a positive list. Counterpart funds\n            generated by the Credit will be utilized in budgets agreed\n            with the Government in the context of the Policy Framework\n            Paper (PFP) negotiations and directed toward priority\n            investments that have been evaluated by the Bank in\n            preparation for donor coordination meeting in 1994 and 1995.\n            The funds will make it possible for the Government to: (i)\n            increase public expenditures on health, education, and other\n            social programs; and (iii) finance priority investments\n            carried out by the Government, without donor assistance, in\n            the provinces."}, "docdt": "1995-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
