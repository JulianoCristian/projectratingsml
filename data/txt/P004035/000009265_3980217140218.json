(ICR) for the Cambodia Economic Rehabilitation\n            Credit. The Economic Rehabilitation Project (ERC) had three\n            objectives. The overall objective was to assist\n            Cambodia's recovery and its continued transition to a\n            market economy. More specifically, the ERC was to support\n            the Government's effort to stabilize the economy,\n            finance the balance of payments without jeopardizing future\n            creditworthiness, and support growth. The project\n            substantially achieved its agreed objectives. Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Measured in terms of\n            responsiveness to Cambodia's needs, Bank performance\n            was highly satisfactory, as indicated in the\n            Government's own review of this operation. Bank\n            performance regarding processing and supervision was\n            satisfactory. The ERC for Cambodia yielded three main\n            lessons: 1) An ERC is most effective when used as an\n            intermediate step to a policy-based structural adjustment\n            operation. 2) An ERC is also most effective when accompanied\n            by a Technical Assistance Project. 3) The link between the\n            ERC and the IMF program, although weak, is extremely useful."}, "docdt": "1997-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
