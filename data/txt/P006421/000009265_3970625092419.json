The project\n            consists of:  (i) irrigation sector studies; and (ii)\n            preparation for appraisal of twelve irrigation projects,\n            covering an area of 500,000 hectares, and preparation for\n            construction of some of these projects involving a potential\n            area of 300,000 hectares.  It furthermore involves; (iii)\n            construction of two pilot irrigation schemes; (iv)\n            institution building measures affecting the executing\n            agencies; and (v) drafting of safety guidelines for small dams."}, "docdt": "1986-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
