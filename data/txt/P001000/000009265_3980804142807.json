{"cdata!": "The Energy Project in Guinea-Bissau\n            project partially achieved its objectives particularly due\n            to the corrective measures after its restructuring. The\n            major factors that affected implementation of the project\n            were as follows: Non-materialization of co financing, (ii)\n            High inflation, which accelerated from 15 percent to 57\n            percent increased osts, and affected Electricidade e Aguas\n            da Guinea-Bissau (EAGB) assets, which became undervalued,\n            (iii) Distribuidora de Combustiveis e Lubrificantes (DICOL)\n            complex legal and institutional situation. The development\n            objective of the project was to increase the sector's\n            efficiency. To that end, the outcome of the project is fully\n            satisfactory for the petroleum and institutional\n            strengthening components and marginally satisfactory for the\n            power component. The experience gained in the execution of\n            the project was useful for the design and preparation of the\n            proposed Water and Energy Project. This follow-up project\n            should help in deepening reforms in the sector, allowing\n            further private participation, strengthening institutional\n            capacity and sustaining operations and maintenance of the\n            country's infrastructure for the energy sector."}, "docdt": "1998-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
