SUMMARY
1.     The Development Objective of the Avian and Human Influenza Control and
Preparedness Project in Lao People’s Democratic Republic is to assist in implementing
Government’s National Plan, specifically to contribute to minimize the threat posed to
humans and to the poultry sector by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection
and other zoonoses in Laos, and to prepare for, control, and respond to influenza
pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans. This is being
accomplished by assisting the Government in implementing its National Avian Influenza
Control and Pandemic Preparedness Plan (National Plan). Financing has been made
available from the following sources of funding through the World Bank:

          •   IDA Grant (H243-LA) of SDR2.7 million (US$4 million equivalent);
          •   Avian and Human Influenza Facility (AHIF) Grant (TF057185) of US$2
              million from the European Commission (EC) window;
          •   Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) Grant (TF056737) of
              US$2 million; and
          •   AHIF Grant (TF090764) of US$2.4 million from the multi-donor window.

2.      Prior amendments included reallocation of proceeds and extension of the closing
date for the AHIF Grant (TF057185). The current changes proposed to the Agreements
are the result of experiences gained during implementation and aim to enhance the
capacity to respond to the prevailing situation; to reallocate proceeds of the Grants; and to
extend the closing date of all but the multi-donor window trust fund (TF090764) to allow
for completion of ongoing civil works and installation of goods. Given the emergency
nature of the Project, the need for such adjustments were fully envisaged during the
design phase. Following are the proposed changes:

PROJECT STATUS
4.      The Project became effective on December 11, 2006. Progress towards attaining
the development objective has been satisfactory, as evidenced by the attainment, in most
cases, of the targets set for the National Plan. Ratings from the last three Implementation
Status Reports are:

5.      Implementation progress continues to be rated Moderately Satisfactory due to
delays associated with three activities totaling an estimated US$3 million. An action plan
to bring the project back to Satisfactory status is underway as follows: First, Government
has been following up closely on the civil works aspect (two tenders estimated at
approximately US$2.5 million) which have commenced for the National Animal Health
Center, and the National Center for Laboratory and Epidemiology. Second, the
equipment list for health care waste management equipment (estimated at US$0.8
million) supported by the Project has recently been approved by WHO, and the tender
has been advertised. The extension of the closing date would allow for completion of
these three activities which are expected to contribute substantially to sustainability of the
support.
5
    S=Satisfactory; MS=Moderately Satisfactory; MU=Moderately Unsatisfactory.
                                                   2
6.     Financial Management was initially rated moderately satisfactory as a result of
delays in clearing advances; an ongoing observation of the auditor. The downgrade in
the rating in June 2010 was the result of findings that the Project had applied
US$17,528.87 in per diems to TF090764 that are ineligible for financing. The Project
has provided evidence of a transfer request, dated June 17, 2011, from the Project to the
World Bank in repayment of the ineligible expenditures.

7.      Procurement. In the absence of a full-time Procurement Specialist on-site, the
quality of the procurement was affected. Notwithstanding the current full-time presence
of the Specialist, the moderately satisfactory rating has been given as a result of the
delays in clearing backlogs in the proper filing of procurement documents at NEIDCO.
This is expected to improve by the time of the next review.

8.      Audits and Legal Covenants. There are no overdue audit reports, and the Project
is in compliance with all the legal covenants.

9.      Monitoring and Evaluation. Tracking of Government’s progress in implementing
its National Plan is achieved through the use of a set of agreed to indicators; 27 of these
are presented in the Technical Annex. Although information on the indicators has always
been available upon request, such information was not always made available prior to the
reviews; this merited a rating of moderately satisfactory. Information on the indicators
was made available to the team prior to the last review and a number of activities were
carried out between the reviews with to the aim of meeting the targets set by the
Government. As a consequence the rating was upgraded to satisfactory. Good progress
has been made in most of the areas being tracked, and most targets have been surpassed.
However, the requirement to update some baselines and to change some targets to reflect
the current emphasis of the response more accurately, there is a need to amend some of
the indicators.6


10.     Intensive supervision has been undertaken, including formal annual World Bank-
led Joint Implementation Reviews in which all involved Government agencies and the
principal financiers of Government’s Plan participate actively. Implementation, from the
disbursement perspective, has been slower than anticipated (IDA Grant at 45%, AHIF-
EC at 68%, PHRD at 85%, and AHIF-multidonor at 88%) as a result of (a) Government
prioritizing time-bound financing from other partners; and (b) the delays in carrying out
three tenders (estimated at US$3 million) as described above.

PROPOSED CHANGES

    •   Results/indicators. Changes are proposed to: (a) the baselines and targets of some
        indicators; (b) reflect evolving Government policy; (c) reflect the realities on the
        ground; and (d) replace one indicator that, as currently formulated, could not be
        tracked (see Annex 1).

6
    None of the four indicators listed in the Grant Agreements are being amended.
                                                   3
•   Financing
       o Disbursement arrangements. Inclusion in operating costs of “translation
           services”.
       o Reallocation. Previous changes have been made to the allocation of Grant
           proceeds, including an amendment to the percentages financed by IDA
           and the AHIF (TF057185), and the need for IDA to finance 100% if the
           AHIF-EC window were to close, as originally planned, on July 31, 2009.
           With an extension of the AHIF-EC closing date, the percentage to be
           financed by IDA should now revert to 41%, and TF057185 should finance
           59%; IDA financing will cover 100% upon full utilization of TF057185.
           Reasons for the change by category are as follows:
               ƒ Goods (H243-LA and TF057185). An increase in this category as
                   a result of the (a) purchase of (i) surveillance equipment (including
                   scanners, thermometers, and medical kits), (ii) transportation
                   (vehicle and motorcycles), (iii) communications equipment (such
                   as faxes); and (b) printing materials in response to the declaration
                   of a pandemic by WHO and the need for increased/improved
                   surveillance.
               ƒ Civil Works (H243-LA and TF057185). Some of the financing
                   originally anticipated to be paid from IDA and TF057185 has been
                   financed from TF090764.
               ƒ Consultants (TF056737). Increase required to cover financing of
                   consultants to supervise the civil works, additional costs for health
                   care waste management consultants, and financing consultants
                   (both administrative and fiduciary) during proposed extension
                   period.
               ƒ Training and Workshops (TF056737). Reduction in required
                   needs due to financing of activities by other development partners.
               ƒ Training and Workshops (H243-LA and TF057185). Increased
                   costs due to financing of participation in international fora on
                   H5N1 and A/H1N1, as well as support for advocacy and lesson
                   learning meetings held in-country to increase awareness.
               ƒ Operating Costs (H243-LA and TF057185). Reduction from
                   original allocation as a result of the timing of procurement.
               ƒ Compensation Funds (H243-LA and TF057185). Reduction to

               ƒ Pilot Research Fund (H243-LA and TF057185). This source of
                   funding is being reduced because no approved mechanism for
                   implementation is in place.
           Government’s request for reallocation was received in November 2009,
           and delays in processing the request were encountered pending
           satisfactory resolution of amounts indicated as ineligible expenditures. A
           revised table for reallocating all sources of funds has been used to derive
           the numbers presented here. This reallocation has been made based on
           Government's request, but modified to reflect current disbursement
           actuals, as well as the latest information available on anticipated usage of

                                         4
            funds. The proposed reallocations for each source of funding, including
            the foregoing explanation, are provided in Annex 2.
        o Project Costs. The reallocation of cost by Component is provided in
            Annex 2.
•   Procurement. Government has requested that the threshold for shopping for
    goods be raised from US$20,000 to US$30,000 to bring this in line with the
    current thresholds being used in-country. This has been approved by the World
    Bank and has been reflected in a revision to the Procurement Plan.
•   Closing Date. Government has written requesting a one year extension for all
    sources of funding. The closing date of the multi-donor window of AHIF is not
    being extended so no extension will be granted for TF097064, which is expected
    to be fully utilized by the current closing date. An extension of the closing dates
    for H243-LA and TF056737-PHRD is being sought from June 30, 2011 to June
    30, 2012. In the absence of an extension of the EC window of the AHIF an
    extension of the Closing Date for this source (TF057185-AHIF) is being sought
    from June 30, 2011 to September 30, 2011; once the overall EC window is
    extended, a request to extend this source to June 30, 2012 will be made. The
    proposed extension is necessary to allow for the completion of civil works already
    underway, and delivery and installation of health care waste management
    equipment for hospitals (for which tendering is about to commence). The original
    closing date for the AHIF Grant (TF057185) was tied to the closing date of the
    parent trust fund, consequently the initial closing date was July 2009, or 14
    months prior to the closing date of the other sources of financing. The current
    extension will result in a cumulative extension of two years for H243-LA and
    TF056737-PHRD, and a 35 month extension for TF057185-AHIF.
•   Implementation schedule. Once the restructuring is approved, the disbursement
    estimates for all sources of funding will be revised to reflect the revised
    projections.
•   Definitions. The National Avian and Human Influenza Coordination Office
    (NAHICO) was renamed National Emerging Infectious Diseases Coordination
    Office (NEIDCO) during the H1N1 pandemic, to reflect the fact that it was not
    solely concern with avian influenza. This will be reflected through the inclusion
    of NEIDCO in the definitions.
