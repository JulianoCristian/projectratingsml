Human\n            Influenza Control and Preparedness Project for Lao PDR were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was high; Bank performance was satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: collaboration among sectors. The lesson is\n            that collaboration across sectors is possible, but it\n            requires substantial dedicated resources and an impartial\n            lead partner. An emergency and interest from senior leaders,\n            technical teams, agencies and partner countries help\n            facilitate coordination as well. Excessive gaps between\n            animal health and human health systems persist. The lesson\n            is that the next emergency response to a zoonotic disease\n            threat should endeavour to more adequately address a key\n            factor giving rise to the emergency-the inability of country\n            public health and veterinary systems to protect public\n            health and economies from infectious disease outbreaks. A\n            formal arrangement and positive incentives for cross-support\n            will have facilitated the team's work with Ministry of\n            Agriculture (MOA). Partner continuity between the emergency\n            and a program for medium long-term systemic improvements\n            will likely help the transition succeed. The participatory\n            design of indicators and their alignment with the national\n            plan's overarching objectives supported coordination.\n            The systematic supervision approach encouraged coordination\n            and is an example of best practice."}, "docdt": "2012-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
