The authorities in Lao PDR rapidly prepared a\n            program to strengthen their capacity for surveillance of\n            animal diseases and containment of outbreaks. Better public\n            knowledge of avian and pandemic flu and training of\n            veterinary and health workers will encourage prevention and\n            reporting of disease. Should a pandemic occur, preparedness\n            would reduce its impacts. As a result of this project, Lao\n            PDR responded effectively to contain several avian flu\n            outbreaks. Because avian flu did not spread, there have been\n            no reported human cases of the disease in Lao PDR since 2007."}, "docdt": "2012-04-17T04:43:03Z"}
