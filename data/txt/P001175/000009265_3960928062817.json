and regional income disparities.\n            Measures will be taken to : 1) improve the domestic terms of\n            trade in favor of agriculture, 2) shift incentives in favor\n            of crops with high comparative advantage away from crops\n            that have declining economic benefits such as cocoa, 3)\n            decrease costs in the agro-industrial sector to restore its\n            competitiveness on domestic and external markets, 4) reduce\n            public sector involvement in directly productive activities\n            and increase the efficiency of parastatals providing basis\n            support services to farmers, 5) improve rural financial\n            intermediation and farmers' access to savings and\n            credit facilities, and 6) improve the management of the\n            country's natural resources, in particular by promoting\n            the protection and sustainable exploitation of natural forests."}, "docdt": "1989-09-15T00:00:00Z"}
