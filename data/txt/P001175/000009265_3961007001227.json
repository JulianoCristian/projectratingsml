the Agricultural Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project for Cote d'Ivoire was\n            satisfactory. The project achieved most of its objectives,\n            institutional development was modest, sustainability is\n            uncertain, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, in some areas, the vagueness of\n            conditionality worked against program success, while in\n            others it \"bought time\" until the political\n            situation changed sufficiently so that successful policy\n            dialogue could occur. Second, the presence of strong field\n            staff at the Resident Mission was critical to the initiation\n            of a constructive dialogue process. Third, the developmental\n            impacts of policy change should be monitored more closely in\n            the future. Finally, broad participation of all parties\n            concerned is necessary for policy reform programs to succeed\n            in the first place and be sustainable in the long run."}, "docdt": "1994-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
