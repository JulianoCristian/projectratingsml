Lessons underline the\n            unique, and significant nature of this project,\n            demonstrating that, by and large, a community-based\n            nutrition project can produce impressive results. It has\n            shown that an emergency situation effectively dealt with,\n            can become the starting point of a larger-scale national\n            operation, whose key success was the involvement of an\n            experienced private sector management institution, of a\n            strong political commitment, and of an empowered community\n            participation. However, on project design, and preparation,\n            it would have been better had the roles, and\n            responsibilities of the coordinating been clearly defined,\n            to avoid unnecessary delays, or lack of human, and financial\n            resources. The ambitious performance criteria led to too\n            much focus on treating symptoms, than on prevention, whereas\n            a flexible approach could have adapted appropriately to\n            implementation needs. These implementation needs showed that\n            more information on cost-effectiveness, and the longer-term\n            impact of the approach was needed to evaluate results,\n            including the evaluation of contracting to different\n            providers. From the institutional point of view, it is\n            important to allow for competition among executing agencies\n            to promote capacity building, and stimulate\n            cost-effectiveness, by testing different approaches for\n            adequate delivery services."}, "docdt": "2001-07-17T00:00:00Z"}
