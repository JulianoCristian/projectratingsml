(malnourished children under 3 years of\n            age and pregnant and nursing mothers) in targeted poor urban\n            neighborhoods; 2) provide potable water to unserviced\n            neighborhoods of the nutrition program; and 3) enhance\n            household food security in poor rural and urban areas during\n            critical periods of vulnerability. Its implementation\n            objectives are to demonstrate the feasibility of targeted,\n            efficient and cost-effective delivery of community nutrition\n            interventions and execute a poverty-oriented program through\n            a privately operated agency. The project consists of three\n            major components. The first encompasses a nutrition program\n            consisting of information, education and communication (IEC)\n            interlocutors supported by supplementary feeding for the\n            target population in urban areas and a small fund for\n            research and development. The second component funds a water\n            program in the targeted neighborhoods of the nutrition\n            program. The third component is a pilot rural household food\n            security program. As an integral part of these components,\n            there will be a package of managerial health and technical\n            assistance and training to build local capacity for\n            nutrition/health services delivery, and a management\n            information system for monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1995-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
