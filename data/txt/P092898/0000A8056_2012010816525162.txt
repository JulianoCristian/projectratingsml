                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         To enhance capacity, performance and accountability of MDAs in the use of public resources and service delivery to levels consistent with timely and effective
                         implementation of the strategic and priority programs under the MKUKUTA. Enhanced performance will be evidenced by: (i) improvements in the policy-making
                         and regulatory capacity of MDAs that will contribute to a more predictable and well regulated environment for service delivery institutions and for private sector
                         development; (ii) improved use of performance management systems by MDAs and their linkages to service delivery; (iii) improved management of public
                         servants; and (iv) greater access to information and responsiveness to the demands of stakeholders that contributes to greater transparency and accountability
                         of government and improved governance.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A formal request to restructure the project was received from the Government of Tanzania on August 16, 2011 in line with the discussions held between the government, other
                         Development Partners participating in the basket and the Bank. The government has extended its Public Service Reform Program from the original closing date of June 30, 2012 to
                         June 30, 2014 in recognition of the low achievements in the first year of the program (2007-08). Canada (CIDA), one of the basket partners, has also extended its support to the
                         PSRP from the earlier closing date of March 31, 2013 to March 31, 2015. The government has adopted a revised PDO which reflects the Development Partner concerns on account
                         of the level of ambition, realism and relevance. The government has also adopted revised PDO Outcome and Intermediate Outcome indicators suggested during the restructuring
                         exercise by the Development Partners and the Bank. the government has also suspended the "demand led approach" whereby funds were allocated to individual MDAs to implement
                         reform tools independently though in consultation with POPSM. This was a recommendation of the Mid Term Review in May/June 2010. The government has also made an advance
                         provision of Tsh 1 Billion in their budget to support PSR in Zanzibar in anticipation of the PRAP restructuring along those lines. This will enable the interventions to start off as soon as
                         PRAP restructuring is approved in the current year itself without waiting for budget allocations for the next year.

                         There has been significant progress towards enhancing results on the ground in the year 2010-11 and in the first quarter of 2011-12. Some highlights are given below:

                         Records Management: Work has continued on making records management more efficient. In the case of subject records all ministries (26) and all Regional Secretariats (21) and 48
                         out 132 District Offices have been upgraded. In the case of personnel records, 14 out of 26 ministries have been upgraded. Work is ongoing during the current year to upgrade the
                         remaining 12 ministries and 18 out of 21 Regional Secretariats. It is proposed to take up the remaining 3 Regional Secretariats and 84 District Offices in 2012-13. The construction of
                         the archives (National Records Center at Dodoma) is nearly complete and it is expected to be handed over in February 2012.

                         HCMIS: 59 out of 103 MDAs and 40 out of 133 Local Governments have been covered by the upgraded Human Capital Information Management System. All the remaining MDAs
                         will be covered by December 31, 2011 and the remaining LGAs by December 31, 2012. The implementation of this upgraded system enables decentralized management (additions
                         and deletions or amendments) of the HR database, empowering local mangers in HR functions. As a result during the period July to September 2011 it is estimated that Tsh 2.5
                         billion were saved due to on time retirement of employees which in the past often overran the due date by six months or more.

                         Public service Pay and Incentives: The Strategy Paper to implement the new Pay and Incentives Policy has been prepared and it is expected that its recommendations will be
                         incorporated into the 2012-2013 budget. This will serve to rationalize allowances; provide financial and non financial incentives to staff for working in hard to serve areas and better
                         manage the fiscal impact of salaries.
                         e-governance: The e-government portal is ready and three e-governance services are being loaded on to it. By June 2012 the government directory; business registration and land
                         records will be available for access through the portal . This will enhance access to public information and facilitate business transactions.

                         Gender Responsiveness: The program to support women government officials to gain their Masters degrees is being continued and 240 women have benefited from it. A Tracer
                         Study conducted in August 2011 shows that 52% of those which attained their masters degrees oout of a sample of 28 women have been promoted to the Manager cadre which

                         signals the effectiveness if this strategy to empower women in government.

                         Monitoring Performance Management: The government has already started the process of collecting data according to the changed performance indicators. The state of
                         implementation of the four performance management tools in 18 MDAs was assessed in September 2011 and in 65% of the cases the implementation was satisfactory. This
                         compares with a satisfactory implementation base line of 62% in 2009.

                         Public Perception of Satisfaction with central Government Services: A survey is currently being done to assess the satisfaction level of users and citizens against the base line of a
                         satisfaction level of 75% in 2004-2005.

                         POPSM has submitted a detailed report on the misuse of funds by five MDAs under the "demand led approach" and the steps taken to address the issue which is satisfactory.
