and\n            Accountability Project for Tanzania were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a rigorous\n            assessment of political economy (PE) risks and the\n            formulation of risk mitigation strategy are the key to the\n            project success. The complexity of programs and projects has\n            to be limited to the existing and likely capacity of\n            borrowers and implementers. Reform programs need to be\n            aligned with the level of monitoring systems available or\n            those which can be reasonably embedded during the project\n            period. The low capacity to monitor and coordinate across\n            Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) should have\n            indicated that limiting the range and scope of the project\n            will be beneficial. Adaptable Program Lending (APLs) also\n            tends to bind down the overall structure of the program\n            which needs to be related to emerging priorities over time.\n            A more efficient way of managing temporary load of work is\n            to staff the project with core specialists, recruited for\n            the project period, who will work with the designated\n            officials and support them. The Public Service Reform\n            Program (PSRP) primarily focused on improvements within the\n            public service with no direct linkage to the delivery of\n            services. Standardization in assessments can ensure that\n            across the government performance and accountability is\n            measured routinely in a commonly acceptable manner. The\n            public service practice needs to define better the links\n            between capacities building in specific sectors and impact\n            on service delivery. Similarly the link between incentives\n            and public service performance needs to be defined more\n            credibly. Participation in funds should be selective and\n            restricted to areas where there is significant commonality\n            of purpose and commonly agreed sector assessments; where\n            sector plans are well developed and where the government has\n            demonstrated commitment to implementing them. Opportunistic,\n            targeted and flexible interventions by the Bank are more\n            likely to be successful in public service reform rather than\n            large across the board reform programs."}, "docdt": "2013-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
