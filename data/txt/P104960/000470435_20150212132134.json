Going forward it was\n            determined that the Bank should be willing to take risks,\n            including in innovative project concepts, but targets should\n            be conservative and the restructuring bar should be set\n            correspondingly low. It was also determined that carbon\n            finance is a results-based instrument that is very closely\n            linked to successful implementation of the underlying\n            project, and that decisions regarding location of solid\n            waste infrastructure in urban areas should be settled fully\n            before appraisal. There were also instances where the Bank\n            faced conflicts of interests, resulting from its\n            representation of multiple stakeholders' interests in\n            this project."}, "docdt": "2014-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
