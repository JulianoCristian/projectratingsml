                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The development objectives of the proposed project are to strengthen the operational, financial, and environmental performance of MSWM in Amman. Specifically, the
                         project will help achieve the following:
                         (i)       Environmentally upgrade and expand the existing municipal solid waste landfill to meet the city➢❨ s disposal needs up to 2013 and generate electricity while
                         mitigating GHGs; and
                         (ii)     Improve the cost effectiveness of the existing municipal solid waste collection and transport system and improve overall cost recovery.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         The Project is scheduled to close on June 30, 2014. The Project Development Objective (PDO) will only be partly achieved, given the extensive delays in the start-up of the $25m
                         landfill gas design-build-operate contract (LFG DBO). Significant progress has occurred over the last few months however and it is expected that the first phase of the contract will be
                         satisfactorily completed by the Loan closing date.
