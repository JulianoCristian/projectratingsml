                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The development objectives of the proposed project are to strengthen the operational, financial, and environmental performance of MSWM in Amman. Specifically, the
                         project will help achieve the following:
                         (i)       Environmentally upgrade and expand the existing municipal solid waste landfill to meet the city➢❨ s disposal needs up to 2013 and generate electricity while
                         mitigating GHGs; and
                         (ii)     Improve the cost effectiveness of the existing municipal solid waste collection and transport system and improve overall cost recovery.

                         The Project is scheduled to close on June 30, 2014. It remains in Unsatisfactory status; however the situation could somewhat improve as physical implementation of the main
                         contract, the $25m landfill gas design-build-operate contract (LFG DBO), has finally started.

                         Details:
                         In the months following the February 2013 mission, GAM faced continued difficulty and delays in reaching an agreement with the Operator that would have enabled works to proceed.
                         Numerous iterations and discussions took place between GAM and the Operator from February 2013 until November 2013 about how to resolve the question of the site conditions
                         and resulting necessary change order, and the Project Steering Committee met repeatedly to discuss the situation. By May 2013, agreement between GAM, its Supervising Engineer,
                         and the Operator, could be found on a technical design but not on its impacts on cost and time. Faced with this, and following the Bank's August 2013 supervision mission that
                         reminded GAM of the Project's upcoming closing date, GAM decided to write to the Operator to accept the changed design but not its effect on time nor cost, and to request the
                         Operator to mobilize and implement the changes "pending agreement", as allowed by the contract.

                         This lead to further talks and finally, at the beginning of December, a full agreement on a change order could be found between GAM, its Supervising Engineer, and the Operator, to
                         which the Bank provided its no-objection on December 16, 2013. Site mobilization has started and the new agreed date for Phase 1 completion is June 15, 2014.

                         As for the institutional component, despite some slippages, all activities are still on track to be completed before the Loan closing date.
