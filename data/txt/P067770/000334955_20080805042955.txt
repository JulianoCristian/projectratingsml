F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The Sustainable Livelihoods Program, Adaptable Program Loan (APL), was designed to support
a strategic shift in the Government of Mongolia's anti-poverty strategy (please see details in
Section 1.1 Context at Appraisal) and to be implemented in three Phases over twelve years
beginning in 2002. The Sustainable Livelihoods Project was designed to support Phase I of the
Program. The development objective of the project is "an effective approach to promoting
improved, secure, and sustainable livelihood strategies developed, demonstrated, and validated
in selected areas, and institutional capacity created so that these strategies can be replicated and
scaled-up in Phase II of the Program".

              Although there was no specific definition of "adequate preparations" in the indicator, it

Comments      can reasonably be taken to mean i) adequate hay and fodder preparation and ii)
              construction of livestock shelters. The number above is from an independent evaluation
              of the PRM which provides information on the change of attitude, based on the herders'
              recollection.

              Note that it is difficult to attribute this reduction to the project. No significant dzud took
Comments      place during the project period, so it would be expected that animal losses would
              decrease.

              While not a measure of the area improved, 59 percent of herder group respondents felt
              that pastures had improved considerably - a perception shared by 30 percent of non-group
Comments      herders. If the perceptions are assumed to reflect the area managed by herders, and group
              and non-group herders are roughly equal in number, then the result would indicate an
              improvement in only slightly less than 50 percent of the area.

                                                  MONGOLIA
                             SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOODS PROJECT
               IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT



1.       Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1.     Context at Appraisal

1.1.1. During the initial years of economic transition in the 1990s, and despite four years
of modest economic growth and low inflation in the second half of the decade, poverty
and inequality were serious problems in both rural and urban areas of Mongolia.
Research1 showed that the overall head-count measure of poverty remained stable, at 36
percent, between 1995 and 1998 but that the depth and severity of poverty worsened.
Social services delivery in rural areas also deteriorated, reflected through the high costs
and low quality of health and education, as a result of dysfunctional institutional
structures and inadequate capacity.

1.1.2. The primary goal of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2 in effect during the
period of project identification and preparation was to support the government in its
efforts to transform the economy from a "command and control" model into a market-led
approach in order to raise living standards and reduce poverty. The project directly
supported the fourth CAS goal: to promote equitable development through direct poverty
alleviation assistance to ensure continued support for vulnerable groups.

1.1.3. Between 1994 and 2000, poverty reduction was pursued mainly under the
National Poverty Alleviation Program (NPAP), an inter-sectoral program supported by
multilateral and bilateral agencies and NGOs to which the Bank was the major
contributor. The NPAP provided valuable support to local governments for the
rehabilitation of social and economic infrastructure but its effectiveness was limited as
there was little opportunity for local populations to express their preferences and views to
their elected representatives.

1.1.4. After 2000, the Government made poverty reduction one of the highest priorities
in its Action Plan that addressed the marked urban-rural divide with a stronger focus on
rural development. The serious losses of livestock caused by the three consecutive
winter-spring dzud3 in 1999/2000, 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 emphasized to the
government and the donor community the importance of the livestock sector in the rural
economy and the need to enhance pastoral risk management. Furthermore, financial
services that would enable households to make productive investments, diversify income
opportunities and weather economic shocks, were not accessible to the vast majority of
the rural population due to weaknesses in the financial system. According to 1999


1Living Standards Measurement Surveys of 1995 and 1998
2Country Assistance Strategy: Report No. 17604-MOG of April 1, 1998
3Dzud can be defined as the occurrence of an exceptionally harsh winter, frequently following a long and pasture-
   killing summer drought, that causes high livestock mortality rates.



                                                         1

estimates, about 95% of the cash circulating in the economy was concentrated in
Ulaanbaatar, while the vast proportion of trade in rural areas remained on a barter basis.


1.2.    Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators


1.2.1. The project was the first phase of the three-phased Adaptable Program Loan
supporting the Sustainable Livelihoods Program. The Program development objective is:
"target groups and individuals adopt improved strategies that build and maintain,
human, social, financial, physical and natural capital while reducing vulnerability to
shocks".

1.2.2. The project development objective (PDO) defined in the PAD is "an effective
approach to promoting improved, secure, and sustainable livelihood strategies developed,
demonstrated, and validated in selected areas, and institutional capacity created so that
these strategies can be replicated and scaled-up in Phase II of the Program".

1.2.3. It should be noted that the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) contained a
different formulation of the project's objective, stating it to be "... to assist the Borrower
to reduce the incidence of poverty among poor and extremely poor households and to
prevent non-poor households from falling below the poverty line, by (i) developing and
implementing, on a pilot basis, secure and sustainable livelihood strategies, and (ii)
building the institutional capacity for large-scale implementation of such strategies." In
the DCA, therefore, reducing poverty is stated as an explicit part of the objective whereas
it is implicit in the PAD. This may have reflected confusion between the Program's
higher level goal and the project's specific objective. The Project's design did not include
measurements of poverty incidence or poverty-related statistics among its performance
indicators. For the purposes of this ICR the project will be evaluated against the PDO as
set forth in the PAD.

1.2.4. The Key Performance Indicators at the outcome level at appraisal were:

A.      Improved pastoral risk management strategies to be adapted in core aimags.
     · Proportion of herding households making adequate winter preparation increased by 33%
        in project areas by comparison with the start of project and/or non-project areas
        representing similar ecological zones;
     · Dzud-related animal losses reduced by 33% by comparison with the start of the project
        and/or non-project areas representing similar ecological zones;
     · At least 50% of the grazing land area under improved management in project areas by
        comparison with the start of the project;
     · A discernible positive impact to be achieved on range-vegetation condition in project area
        by comparison with non-project areas representing similar ecological zones and
        precipitation conditions, and as measured by a normalized differentiated vegetation index
        (NDVI, data obtained from remote sensing) or a similar indicator.

B.      Micro-finance services to be made accessible to and used by poor households to build
assets and smooth consumption on a financially and institutionally sustainable basis in remote
areas of target sums:



                                                 2

    · 10 percent of target beneficiaries in the eight selected aimags use financial services;
    · Quantitatively and qualitatively measurable improvement in livelihood security of
       targeted beneficiaries (precise indicators to be selected in design of base-line survey);
    · Less than 10 percent of total loan portfolio of selected Revolving Loan Funds (RLFs)
       past due;
    · 50 percent of selected RLFs receiving additional funding privatized;
    · index-based livestock insurance (IBLI) scheme developed and operational.

C.     Basic district- and community-level infrastructure to be improved and maintained in core
aimags
    · 75% of target community members satisfied with the procedures for the identification,
       selection, and implementation of sub-projects;
    · 85% of target beneficiaries of sub-projects satisfied with infrastructure activities
       implemented; and
    · Options identified for integrating needs-driven public expenditure allocation with regular
       local government budgeting.

A detailed discussion and assessment of KPIs are provided in Section F.

1.2.5. In addition to KPIs, a set of performance triggers were defined in the PAD. These
triggers would be used as a basis to determine whether the Program could proceed from
Phase I (SLP) to Phase II (SLPII). The triggers, listed below, are complementary to the
KPIs and should be considered alongside the KPIs:

Pastoral Risk Management
    · Institutional framework for PRM established and functioning
    · Soum level management plans under implementation
    · Herder organizations established and functioning
    · Group-based approach to well management implemented
    · PRM strategies successfully implement in different agro-zones
    · Fodder and hay making activities successfully demonstrated

Local Initiatives Fund
    · Management capacity at soum level created for implementing LIF
    · LIF investments reflect community priorities
    · The management and flow of funds are competently handled
    · Legal and policy instruments in place for fiscal decentralization
    · Output indicators met or exceeded
    · A participatory M&E system is operating effectively

Microfinance Outreach
    · MDF established and operational
    · Microfinance products tailored to the poor piloted in core aimags
    · Revolving Loan Funds (RLF) ­ three triggers
    · Index-based livestock insurance scheme developed and operational


1.3.   Revised PDO and Key Indicators




                                                3

1.3.1. The development objective and key indicators were not revised. However, one
trigger was waived and three others became non-applicable (see section 1.6 below):


1.4.    Main Beneficiaries (original and revised)


1.4.1. The Project target group, as defined in the PAD, was the "able-bodied poor" and
"low-income-households near the poverty line who are at risk of falling into poverty as
consequence of external shocks". These households would be both direct and indirect
beneficiaries; however, this does not mean that the project would only benefit these
groups. All rural communities would potentially benefit from improved access to social
infrastructure (schools, healthcare centers etc.) responding directly to the expressed needs
of the communities themselves; herder households would benefit directly from
investments in improved pastureland management; and rural entrepreneurs would benefit
from improved access to financial services.

1.4.2. In addition, the project would support the establishment and strengthening of
institutions and institutional procedures at the local and national level providing services
to the primary target group. This would include local community institutions, including
local councils and authorities, and, at the national level, commercial banks and non-bank
financial institutions and national government.

1.5.    Original Components (US$ as in the PAD/ US$ actual)

The project had four components. The costs at appraisal, as shown here, included price
but not physical contingency provisions.

1.5.1. Component 1: Pastoral Risk Management (US$5.70 M/ $4.18 M) was
designed to reduce the vulnerability of herders and enhance their resilience to drought,
dzud and other shocks through four sub-components:

    (a) Risk Forecasting and Contingency Planning, with the emphasis on improving the
    coverage and dissemination of weather forecasting data and developing sum-level
    contingency plans;

    (b) Grazing and Pasture Management, under which support to different types of community-
    based pasture management initiatives was envisaged, e.g. pasture mapping, seasonal pasture
    rotation, rehabilitation of emergency grazing reserves, group based well rehabilitation, etc;

    (c) Herder Self-Help Initiatives would provide organizational strengthening and matching
    loans to assist groups of herders to establish revolving funds to finance livestock
    productivity-enhancing investments;

    (d) Hay and Fodder Enterprise Development to test business models for hay making and
    concentrate feed production and support aimag- and sum-level fodder reserves. It would
    begin in 16 pilot sums and be expanded to all 143 sums in the eight pilot aimags.

The outcome would be an integrated strategy developed, piloted and adopted in eight selected
aimags for managing covariant risk in pastoral livestock production, with a primary emphasis on
risk preparedness.



                                                4

1.5.2. Component 2: Micro-Finance Outreach (US$6.01 M/ $5.95 M) was designed to
provide financially- and institutionally-sustainable micro-finance services to targeted poor and
vulnerable non-poor households and individuals in remote rural areas of eight core aimags
through three sub-components:

    (a) Creation of a Micro-Finance Development Fund, a wholesale lending facility that was
    expected to provide funds under sub-loan agreements to accredited Micro-Finance
    Institutions (MFIs) for on-lending to the target population for the expansion and
    diversification of livelihood sources and rural incomes;

    (b) the Strengthening of Revolving Loan Funds was designed to improve the operational
    efficiency and financial health of the micro-credit Revolving Loan Funds (RLFs), owned and
    operated by local governments, which were created at the sum level under the NPAP. As
    conditions for disbursement under this sub-component, the Borrower would: (a) establish a
    MIS adequate for monitoring micro-finance portfolio quality; and (b) prepare a detailed
    Action Plan for the used of these funds, acceptable to IDA, with the objective of
    strengthening the selected RLFs.

    (c) the Development of an Index-Based Livestock Insurance Scheme, under which a risk index
    was to be developed, based on objective third-party verifiable indicators, on the basis of
    which eligible participating private insurance companies would offer insurance to individual
    herders, herding households and others owning livestock to cover the covariant risk arising
    from dzud, drought or other weather-related events.

1.5.3. Component 3: The Local Initiatives Fund (US$9.16 M/ $12.03 M) was designed to
provide community-driven mechanisms to identify, define priorities, select, co-finance and
implement investments in basic infrastructure and social services in rural and peri-urban areas
(covering all 143 sums in the eight core aimags ). The component had three sub-components:

    (a) Investment Funds. The Local Initiatives Fund (LIF) was piloted in the eight core aimags
    and one duureg (the peri-urban district of Ulaanbaatar) to provide decentralized sub-project
    approval at the level of the sum and bag. The Local Development Fund (LDF), piloted
    during the NPAP, would finance investments in the remaining 13 aimags and eight duuregs.
    Under the LDF, decision-making would remain at the aimag level;

    (b) Training and Capacity Building would be focused mainly on the sum and bag levels in
    the eight core aimags to develop skills in administration (including community-based
    procurement and disbursement of funds);

    (c) A Fiscal Decentralization Initiative was designed to explore the operational requirements
    of a "needs-driven" approach to public expenditure allocation at the local level through a
    three-year action and research program.

1.5.4. Component 4: Project Management and Policy Support (US$1.25 million/ $2.71 M)
was designed to create an efficient, decentralized project management system and a policy
framework for promoting sustainable livelihoods. It would make use of, and build on, the
existing program management structure, and the strengthening of existing institutional capacity
would be the main priority.

Further details on project components and outputs under each of them are given in Annex 2.


                                                 5

1.6.     Revised Components


1.6.1. Changes were made to three sub-components during implementation:

     (a) Micro-Finance Outreach ­ Index-based Livestock Insurance: the development and
         introduction of an IBLI scheme was replaced by a self-standing IBLI project, a Credit
         4069-MOG in support of which was approved by the Board on May 26, 2005. Decision
         to go ahead with a self-standing project was confirmed during the mid-term review.

     (b) Micro-Finance Outreach ­ Revolving Loan Funds: A condition for disbursement to
         support RLFs, as set forth in the DCA, was a detailed review of their performance. This
         review found that performance of the RLFs had not improved and that additional support
         to the RLFs would continue to support unsustainable microcredit services and could
         further exacerbate the problems and jeopardize the sustainable microfinance services that
         were being provided by both commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions.
         $500,000 originally allocated for the RLFs was reallocated to the MDF in support of
         sustainable microfinance services. Consequently, RLFs were cancelled from the project
         and relevant triggers became non applicable.

     (c) Local Initiatives Fund: The fiscal decentralization sub-component was made inoperable
         by reforms to the government's fiscal policy framework, which the Bank supported, that
         were implemented to increase the centralization and effective control of the fiscal and
         budgetary system shortly after the Credit's approval.      As a result, the requirement
         (covenant under DCA Schedule 4 Section D para 16) and the associated trigger were
         waived by the Bank with effect from December 7, 2005.

The modifications introduced were made at the regional management level and did not require
Board approval.


1.7.     Other Significant Changes


1.7.1. In December 2006, the project was extended for twelve months in response to the
government's request. This allowed the following: (i) an increase of the benefits to
herders and rural communities by continuing successful components under the projects;
(ii) enabling the completion of further capacity building activities to lay a solid
foundation for the second phase of the program; and (iii) avoiding a major gap between
the first and second phases of the project, therefore maintaining continuity of the
institutional implementation structures developed under the project.

* There was a significant increase in the US$ value of the Credit caused by the appreciation of the
SDR during the life of the project. The original amount of the Credit, SDR15.0 million, was
equivalent to US$18.73 at the time of appraisal. At the Closing Date, the Credit was equivalent
to US$23.64 million of which US$1.58 million was un-disbursed and the amount invested in the
project was US$22.06 million.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1.    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1. The project quality at entry was satisfactory. The project responded to the
Government's priorities in several key areas and maintained its overall strategic
relevance throughout the implementation period. Objectives were set clearly in the
context of the CAS and Government strategies. It built on a rigorous background analysis
and data from a participatory living standards assessment, as well as other sectoral
studies. In addition, it reflected lessons learned under NPAP to which the Bank
contributed through Poverty Alleviation for Vulnerable Groups project, and utilized the
institutional structures already in place for preparation and implementation of the project.
Specific components and activities planned contributed to the overall objective and were
mutually reinforcing. They were designed to address unmet priorities and complementary
to other donor-funded projects and government initiatives.

2.1.2. The design provided an appropriate bridge from approaches that were already
established under NPAP to the new approaches being piloted under the project. In this
regard, it was appropriate to maintain support for some of the approaches developed
under NPAP, while piloting new ones. For example, the LDF continued in aimags not
receiving support for the LIF. The RLFs were also a legacy of the previous government
program. At preparation, it was agreed that if these could be run to commercial standards
of performance then the project would provide additional support. However, this did not
occur and, as mentioned above, it was cancelled and resources were reallocated to MDF.

2.1.3. It should be noted that as a first operation in a multi-phase program, the design of
the project was quite complex, with a large number of activities across several sectors
and geographical regions. While issues that the project was trying to address were well


                                                7

known, some of the approaches and activities were very innovative, particularly in
relation to pastoral risk management and linkage to financial sector services. For
example, Mongolia was the first country to develop and pilot index-based livestock
insurance, introduced under this project.

2.1.4. Overall risk assessment for the project was adequate. In fact, anticipated risks
included possible resistance at the level of ministries or a change in policy on the part of
government concerning decentralized public investment management. As
implementation would show, this concern was well-founded, and the whole initiative
embodied in Sub-component 3 (c) was abandoned shortly after the project began and the
trigger was waived.

2.1.5. One weakness in the design was a failure to fully anticipate the technical
assistance that would be required to develop the capacity of local communities to learn
and adopt the new approaches piloted under the project. Lack of such funds under the
project delayed the start-up of some of the activities. The JSDF Grant received shortly
afterwards provided additional funds for technical assistance.

2.1.6. In relation to this, the objectives for achieving institutional change and reforms at
the national level were likely too ambitious, in particular in the creation of a well-
functioning pastoral management institutional framework and the progress towards
greater fiscal decentralization. In addition, KPIs were overly ambitious (and sometimes
ambiguous and/or unrealistic) for the expected outcomes .

2.1.7. There was no QAG "Quality at Entry" assessment carried out.


2.2.    Implementation


2.2.1. Implementation progress of the project was satisfactory. No major factors outside
government or implementation agency's control affected project implementation. There
was no restructuring necessary during project implementation, neither was the project at
risk at any stage during project implementation. There were some reallocations between
the categories as a result of cancellation of the RLF sub-component, separating IBLIP
into a self-standing project and US dollar depreciation.

2.2.2. The responsible agency for project implementation was the Household Livelihood
Support Program Office, which reported directly to the National Committee, chaired by
the Prime Minister and including Ministers and senior officials from relevant government
and non-government agencies. The original intention was that the project would be one
of several initiatives supporting the country's poverty reduction program. However, no
other initiative was ever financed, and this created a false expectation that the project was
accountable for delivering the government's poverty reduction goals, which were more
far-reaching and demanding than the project's objectives. This disconnect between the
National Committee's broad mandate and the project's narrower objective created
confusion at the national level and led to unjustified criticism of the project. On
occasions, this caused delays in project implementation, for example, delays in the



                                               8

approval of the operating budget for the HLSPO. Effectiveness and to some extent
quality of the project implementation was also affected by the high staff turnover,
particularly in M&E, procurement and financial management.

2.2.3. As noted above, the design of the project failed to anticipate the considerable
resources that would be required to strengthen community capacity for implementing the
project. The implementation of the PRM component was particularly slow due to weak
capacity of herders and responsible government officials at the local level. Here the Bank
team's efforts to solve some issues at the entry should be commended. Quest for
additional resources to strengthen the capacities at local level resulted in an application
for the JSDF Grant (TF51703) to support local community mobilization and capacity
building and to establish a participatory monitoring and evaluation system. JSDF Grant
played an important role for this project. The implementation of the grant activities was
largely successful and contributed greatly to the overall successful project
implementation.

2.2.4. One major factor within the Government control was a reversal from fiscal
decentralization policy. While the Public Sector Financial Management Law of 2002 has
streamlined budgeting procedures, limited fiscal resources of the government in fact
reversed even the existing degree of decentralization. At mid-term, it was decided to
modify the sub-component and refocus it to enhance state-citizen engagement in fiscal
decision making, transparency and accountability.

There was no QAG "Quality of Supervision" assessment carried out.


2.3.    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization


2.3.1. Monitoring the implementation and impact of the project was challenging given
the scale of the activities and the multifaceted components. The KPIs and triggers were
poorly articulated at project design and it is difficult to isolate the changes in variables
that could be confidently said to reflect solely the effects of the project. In some cases
they are not specific; for example, expressions such as "functioning institutional
framework", "adequate winter preparations", "improved management" of grazing land
area, and "improvement in livelihood security" were not fully defined and left open to
interpretation.

2.3.2. A monitoring specialist in the HLSPO was responsible for consolidating
information provided by the three operational components of the project, and the majority
of the inputs for the system were designed to come from the M&E systems of the three
components. The main structure of the monitoring system was designed to carry out the
day-to-day monitoring of activities at the aimag- and sum-level HLSCs.

2.3.3. M&E Implementation. The base-line survey4 to define the values of key
indicators for the evaluation of the outputs and impacts of the project was carried out in
July and August, 2004, two years after the start of implementation, with an attempt to

                                                        9

assess the conditions existing in the previous year. While providing lots of data, the
baseline survey produced very little data relevant to monitoring of KPIs. There were
efforts made to modify the indicators, as recommended by supervision missions, to
reflect better the attribution to the project (for example, for Component 1 in September
2005), however, the changes were only partially addressed in the final evaluations.

2.3.4. In 2004 JSDF grant was mobilized to support the development of a Participatory
Monitoring and Evaluation system for the SLP components and to facilitate its effective
implementation at the local and community levels in order to improve transparency,
inclusion and participation in the project's implementation. It was initially piloted in 16
soums, and eventually was scaled up to all 143 soums of 8 pilot aimags. It contributed
substantially to improving the M&E system for SLP, developing participatory data-
collection methodology/toolkits, redefining indicators, modifying PM&E forms for PRM
and LIF, streamlining the procedures of reporting, information flows and institutional
responsibilities to avoid duplications, strengthening capacity and empowerment of local
communities to achieve transparency and accountability of project and grant
implementation.

2.3.5. Prior to the project's schedule closing date in late 2006, separate impact
assessments were conducted for the three main project components. The local consultant
teams were required to measure and evaluate progress on the KPIs, though as noted
above, these were often not clearly articulated, and the information from these studies is
incomplete. Nevertheless, all the studies were used to a certain extent for project
evaluation purposes.

2.3.6. M&E Utilization. The delay in conducting the base-line study and the
"retrospective" approach taken to reconstructing data for the base year (2003) in 2004, as
well as the fact that it does not cover most of the KPIs are obvious flaws in the
methodological soundness of the M&E system. Consequently, the use of baseline survey
for evaluation of project outcomes was very marginal.

2.3.7. The M&E system by the end of the project had: (i) compiled a detailed data-base
of the project's outcomes for the period 2003 ­ 2007; (ii) synthesized the key findings of
the pilot project on participatory M&E in eight pilot aimags; and (iii) prepared for the
integrated and outcome-based M&E system for the SLP II to support the second phase of
the Program.


2.4.    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1. Environment. The project triggered three environmental safeguard policies:
Environmental Assessment; Natural Habitats and Pest Management. Problems with
environmental screening and assessment mechanisms were identified earlier on during
project implementation and then rectified shortly. Regional reviews of EA
implementation were organized by HLSPO during the implementation process and
environmental capacity building was provided to soum secretaries, agricultural, land and
environmental officers. One issue identified during Bank supervision was that well
rehabilitation was potentially and inadvertently threatening the khulan or Wild Asiatic



                                                10

Ass Equus hemionus classified as `Vulnerable' by IUCN. As a result, a study was
undertaken in conjunction with the Netherlands-Mongolia Trust Fund for Environmental
Reform. The study5 indeed confirmed that development of additional livestock watering
facilities can reduce khulan access to habitat and increase livestock-khulan conflict.
Corresponding mitigation measures were proposed which were further monitored during
implementation of the PRM component.

2.4.2. Indigenous People. An Ethnic Minorities Participation Framework was prepared
to help ensure adequate participation of ethnic minorities in the project. On average, the
Kazakh ethnic minorities constitute about 85-86% of project beneficiaries in Bayan-
Ulgii, the Buriat ethnic minority comprises 85%-88% of beneficiaries in Dornod, and the
Bayad and Dorved ethnic minorities constitute between 83% and 90% of the beneficiaries
in Uvs. These results are in line with the percentage of minority ethnic group
representation in the population of the three aimags where significant ethnic minorities
are present. As the Kazakh-speaking ethnic minority is not fully literate in the Khalkh
Mongolian language, the SLP PIMs and the M&E forms have been translated into
Kazakh and distributed to the minority population of Bayan-Olgii.

2.4.3. Involuntary Resettlement. A Resettlement Policy Framework was developed to
protect those who might be affected because of possible community demand for land for
small scale infrastructure development. However, its application never materialized.
Only 12% of sub-projects were new facilities or an expansion. None involved land
acquisition.

2.4.4. Procurement. There were no major procurement issues during the initial periods
of project implementation. However, some issues became apparent towards the end of it,
problems occurring mostly at the aimag level and below. Some examples are:

    · Liberal interpretation of selection criteria. For example, the lowest bids were sometimes
         rejected, because the supplier had no prior experience of supplying goods to that specific
         aimag, even though this was not a criterion for evaluation. This was clearly an indication
         of inadequate procurement capacity and the Bank rightly recommended that HLSPO
         conduct a close monitoring of procurement in the field, followed up by an additional
         training provided to aimag and soum secretaries.

    · In some soums, procurement of goods was occasionally organized through a community
         participation method. There was confusion over the eligibility of this procurement
         method, due to different interpretations of the English and Mongolian versions of the
         Procurement Manual, which was later clarified.

    · Failure to check technical specifications laid out in quotations against technical
         specifications of actually delivered goods resulted sometimes in acceptance of sub-
         optimal quality goods. Where goods of poor quality have been provided, the Bank team
         urged soum governors to enforce the warranty clause of the contracts to ensure that poor
         quality goods were replaced.

     · Lack of packaging of contracts providing the same goods to a number of different soums
         at the aimag level. The Bank supervision team noted several times that the efficiency of
         the aimag tender committee could have been improved if it had grouped similar items
         into single contracts for invitations to quote.

Intensive upfront procurement capacity building program is envisaged for SLPII, building on the
experience of SLP.

2.4.5. Financial Management. High fiduciary staff turnover was a continuous
challenge for this project, at times leading to mistakes in disbursement related work, such
as incorrectly prepared applications and/or duplicate payments, at times leading to low
overall efficiency of financial management. The areas identified for improvement
include: (i) improved financial planning and budgeting and reflection of the variance
analysis in the quarterly FMRs; (ii) provision of evidence/documentation in support of
incurred expenditures; (iii) proper cost categorization, as improper classification of
expenditures among cost categories was resulting in inconsistencies with legal
agreements; and (iv) systemic preparation of monthly bank reconciliations. At the soum
level the main problems were: (i) failure to properly enter and record local contributions
in MIS; (ii) inaccurate filing of financial documents; and (iii) initial permanent deposit
(in some cases, up to 30,000 MNT) and bank charges for transfers were not originally
considered as potential costs, and thus no allocation for that was made under operational
costs budget. Based on these experiences, provisions and adequate safeguards for proper
financial management of SLPII were developed. Adequate FM capacity at different
levels is a condition of SLP II effectiveness (FM manual and staff at SLPO) and
disbursement (recruitment and training of aimag accountants).


2.5.     Post-completion Operation and Next Phase


2.5.1. As already mentioned, the project led to two further Bank investment operations:
(i) the IBLIP, which was spun out of the Microfinance Development component; and (ii)
the second Phase of the Sustainable Livelihoods Program. The sequencing of these
operations was as follows:

                              Sustainable          Index-based Livestock       Sustainable

2.5.2. The IBLI project is designed as a pilot operation to operate in three aimags; its
development objective is to ascertain the viability of IBLI to reduce the impact of
livestock mortality on herders. In effect, the IBLI project represented an evolutionary
step that built on the early achievements of the IBLI sub-component of the project, and
articulated: (i) the commitment of the government to strengthen measures to reduce the



                                                   12

socio-economic impact of livestock losses resulting from dzud in order to achieve its
objectives on poverty reduction; and (ii) a growing level of interest on the part of the
domestic insurance sector. The initial studies on IBLI conducted under the SLP indicated
that to pilot the new insurance products with the private insurance market would be
technically complex and demanding, and therefore it was justified to create a new
investment operation to support this.

2.5.3. The design of the Second Sustainable Livelihoods Project built on the experience
derived from SLP I . It intends to scale-up institutional mechanisms that reduce the
vulnerability of rural communities throughout Mongolia at national, aimag and soum
levels. SLP II maintains the same component structure with certain modifications and re-
naming of parts.

    (a) The Pastoral Risk Management component builds on the functioning mechanisms
    developed in eight pilot aimags under the SLP I and replicates at the national level the
    effective identified strategies to prepare for and respond to pastoral risk. Design changes
    introduced include the development of a livestock early-warning system6, soum-level pasture
    land management plans and decision-making, an expansion of the coverage of demonstration
    areas, and strengthened coordination among institutions involved in PRM policy and
    response.

    (b) The Community Initiatives component combines the previous two funds (LIF and LDF)
    into one ­ the Community Initiatives Fund. Two institutional models are introduced for
    appraisal and approval of sub-projects using existing structures and participation, to which
    are added the flexible allocation of funds between soums (based on levels of population and
    poverty) and increased local contributions.

    (c) The Micro-Finance Development component maintains the structure of a Micro-Finance
    Development Fund channeling funds to participating financial institutions (PFIs). The SLP II
    is designed to: (i) increase the volume of funding and to diversify the products offered by the
    MDF to the PFIs; (ii) provide grant funds for innovative activities and loan funds for non-
    collateral lending to the rural poor; (iii) provide technical assistance in the design of
    regulatory and supervisory systems for non-bank financial institutions and (iv)design,
    launching and cost-sharing with the financial sector, national campaigns of consumer
    financial education.


3.       Assessment of Outcomes

3.1.     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1. Project design and implementation have maintained their relevance. The project is
consistent with the then current 2004 CAS7 and 2005 CAS update, a main pillar of which
is reducing household vulnerability, including that of herders, by improving access of
rural and urban poor to social and basic services and the sustainable management of
natural resources. The new draft Country Partnership Strategy FY09-12, currently under
discussion, is built on three platforms, one of which is "Improving rural livelihoods and
environment". The objective of the project therefore remains fully consistent with

current priorities, also manifested by continuation of support for the Sustainable
Livelihoods Program through the implementation of SLP II.


3.2.     Achievement of the Project Development Objectives


3.2.1. The primary objective to develop, demonstrate and validate an effective approach
to promoting improved secure and sustainable livelihood strategies, and to create
institutional capacity so that these strategies can be replicated and scaled up in Phase II,
was achieved. SLP II will build on the approaches tested under SLP I and will cover all
aimags and soums of Mongolia.

3.2.2. Each "thematic" component has specific objective which contributes to the
achievement of the overall project objective. Detailed assessment of outcomes under
each component is presented below, along with assessment of triggers.

Pastoral Risk Management

3.2.3. Outcome: an integrated strategy developed, piloted, and adopted in eight selected
aimags for managing covariant risk in pastoral livestock production, with a primary
emphasis on risk preparedness.

3.2.4. The Pastoral Risk Management component achieved its objective and is rated
Satisfactory. As mentioned in Section 2.1 (Project Design), indicators for measuring the
expected outcomes are ambiguous and not all of them address the causes. However, the
project substantially achieved the component outputs and, to a considerable and
satisfactory degree, achieved the triggers for transition from Phase I to Phase II (see table
below). The outcomes were largely achieved in terms of the adoption of an integrated
strategy.

implement in different agro-     aimags, in 20 demonstration areas, in four agro-ecological
zones                            zones ­ forest steppe, grass steppe, shrub steppe, and desert.
                                 Strategies included mapping, assisting in the understanding of
                                 resource distribution, use and capacity in specific locations;
                                 plans developed to address local priorities for wells, hay-
                                 making opportunities, or reserves, as necessary; and herders
                                 having options to develop income-generating livelihoods suited
                                 to inputs and markets available.

Fodder and hay making            34 inter-aimag and inter-soum hay and fodder reserves have
activities successfully          been rehabilitated for emergency use, with agreed use and
demonstrated                     management plans in place

3.2.5. The impact evaluation shows major behavioral changes and an increase in
activities contributing to contingency risk planning, such as the percentage of households
making hay and fodder preparation, improvement of hayfields, joint building of new and
repairing of existing winter shelters. Patterns of pasture land use also improved
compared to 2004: (i) the numbers of herders' groups exercising joint protection and use
of pasture increased by 18 percent; (ii) the number of groups using grazing resources on
seasonal division and rotational grazing increased by 57 percent; and (iii) the number of
groups that have created grazing reserves increased by 19 percent. Substantial capacity
was built through training of about 84 percent of the bag governors, 87 percent of the
leaders of herders groups, and 32 percent of all herding families (in pilot aimags) in
different activities related to basic mapping, pasture land management and risk planning.

Micro-Finance Outreach

3.2.6.   Outcome: the outreach of financially and institutionally sustainable micro-finance
services to targeted poor and vulnerable non-poor households and individuals achieved in
remote rural areas of eight core aimags.

3.2.7. Micro-finance outreach component is rated Satisfactory. The main sub-
component for the Micro-Finance Outreach component was the establishment and
operation of the Micro-finance Development Fund: a wholesale, revolving credit facility.
Increased outreach to poor and vulnerable households in remote areas by the MDF was to
be achieved primarily through placing conditions on the use of the funds provided
through the MDF, notably that 75 percent of loan source were required to be made at the
soum level or below and 40 percent of the borrowers had to be below the poverty line.
To promote sustainability, the funds were on-lent to PFIs at market based rates, and
participating financial institutions set the on-lending terms and conditions, including
collateral requirements. Indirectly, outreach was also achieved by creating more
competitive conditions in rural financial markets by injecting additional liquidity into the
market.

3.2.8. The achievement of performance triggers is detailed in the table below. The MDF
out-performed its original targets. By project end, approximately $7.13 million had been
allocated to the PFIs as wholesale loans, from which a total of $17.0 million has been on-
lent to rural residents (including revolving re-disbursements). A total of 29,021 sub-loans


                                               15

had been disbursed to 141,602 beneficiaries (direct and indirect). The quality of the
PFIs' portfolios has been high with a repayment rate of 98.9% on the sub-loans.
Targeting of poorer households was also successful, with 47% of sub-loans lent to
households below the poverty line. Over 67% of the on-lending has been provided at the
soum-level or below.

Triggers                        Status and Achievements
MDF established and             MDF was established and operational since 2003, with a total

                                disbursed US$7.13 million through PFIs in 21 aimags and one

and operational

3.2.9. The wider institutional development in rural financial services provision during
the project's lifetime was significant. Increased competition between commercial banks
and non-bank financial institutions has increased, and the majority of soums are now
served by at least two financial institutions. This has had a favorable impact of real on-
lending interest rates and collateral requirements, both of which have decreased
significantly. Although it is difficult to directly attribute these advances to MDF, it is
reasonable to conclude that the MDF has contributed to this and therefore achieved the
component's objective.

3.2.10. As noted above, the other two sub-components (RLFs and IBLI) were not
implemented under the project. More details on these sub-components are also provided
in Annex 2.

Local Initiatives Fund

3.2.11. Outcome: efficient, socially inclusive, and transparent community-driven
mechanisms were identified and established to facilitate community prioritization,
selection, co-financing, and execution of investments in basic infrastructure and social
services provision in rural areas, combining local resource mobilization with government
grants based on clear and transparent criteria for inter-governmental transfers.

3.2.12. The LIF component is rated Satisfactory. Under this component, the mechanisms
designed during the preparation of the project have worked well to identify, select and
implement local social infrastructure projects. Awareness and capacity has been created



                                                16

at the aimag and soum level (including governors, a range of local staff and NGOs) for
implementing the LIF community works in all 143 soums in the eight pilot aimags,
achieving considerable efficiency and outreach, and satisfactory results in terms of
improved services. Evaluations showed that such capacity and its results in community-
identified investments lead to high levels of satisfaction among officials and
beneficiaries.

3.2.13. The average satisfaction rate with infrastructure activities implemented was 86
percent. High levels of community satisfaction with outcomes suggest that the processes
are working well to identify and select local priority projects. Community mobilizers
added value, as measured through the use of community scorecards, and there are
positive trends in increases in soum/bagh meeting participation. A functional
participatory M&E system has been developed and operational since 2006. The role of
communities in assessing project progress is seen as positive by local officials, though
some participants believe that they lack engagement in the bidding and selection process
of contractors. Overall, the process actively engages citizens, which is a new opportunity
for participation in government program on a scale which has not been done before in the
country.

3.2.14. On the whole, the process of sub-project identification and prioritization has been
carried out satisfactorily and with considerable efficiency. Implementation of sub-
projects under LIF/LDF has been much faster than that of similar sub-projects through
the line ministries. The average number of months from LIF/LDF sub-project approval at
soum level to project completion has been just below nine months (government
investments, often bigger, can take 2-3 years for approval and 1-2 years of
implementation)8. Considering the large number of sub-projects and activities in all
soums, the processes used have been very open and generally transparent. Overall, the
LIF/LDF processes used are much more transparent than regular government investment
activities.

A participatory M&E system is      A functional participatory M&E system has been developed
operating effectively              and tested that actively engages citizens since 2006.

3.2.15. A total of 1,729 sub-projects in health (26%), education (57%) and infrastructure
development (17%) were implemented in all of the pilot soums. Over 10% of the LIF
was funded by contributions from local communities and individuals. Combined
LIF/LDF activities benefited approximately 91% of all secondary schools and 89% of
kindergartens and school dormitories, improving learning and the living conditions of
rural children. As a result of the activities under this component, 1,561 people were
provided with temporary jobs and 135 new public service centers were established in
remote rural areas.


3.3.    Efficiency


3.3.1. Pastoral Risk Management. The benefits anticipated from the component were
the reductions to be achieved in livestock losses caused by dzud. The analysis in the
PAD concentrated on the potential impact of PRM on livestock losses, and assumed that
the adoption on a nation-wide basis of the PRM strategy would reduce losses in dzud
years to the long-term average rate of mortality. There was no major dzud over the
lifetime of the project, and while there was an almost 46% reduction in livestock
mortality in pilot aimags, it is difficult to attribute it to project interventions.

Conventional ex-post economic analysis was carried out for the LIF component, because:
    · Almost 50% of project costs went to this component;
    · Efficiency of the activities under LIF/LDF was one of the declared objectives

3.3.2. The analysis covered a sample of 100 sub-projects, such as school and dormitory
rehabilitation, school and dormitory refurnishing, kindergarten rehabilitation,
rehabilitation of school heating systems, public bath houses, hospital rehabilitation,
drinking water supply and maternal rest home refurnishing.

Type of Sub-Project                    Principal Benefits Identified
Hospital and school renovation         Measureable increases in the number of students and
and/or extension                       patients
Wells for potable water                Improved health, potential income for the soum/bagh
                                       from leasing management to an operator
Ambulances and motorbikes for          Better coverage for treatment and prevention campaigns
soum doctors                           such as vaccinations
The solar batteries for schools and    Running costs are low, patient care and student study
hospitals                              possibilities improved




                                                18

3.3.3. The findings of this analysis also indicate that most sub-projects have a good cost
benefit ratio and economic rate of return (ERR), ranging from 6% (dormitory heating
system) to 30% (ambulance for a soum hospital) with an overall average of 20%. Only
one investment has a negative ERR - public bath houses - mostly because of the
combination of low user rates and high running costs.

3.3.4. Other sub-projects that would most likely have a high rate of return but are
difficult to measure include materials and equipment in kindergartens and dormitories.
The investment is relatively small but the benefits are qualitatively estimated to be high.

3.3.5. The findings of the analysis suggest that delivery of services through sub-projects
supported by the component is cost effective. As compared to similar government civil
works, the duration from project submission to project completion is relatively shorter for
projects supported under the SLP I.


3.4.    Justification of the Overall Outcome Rating


Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1. The project achieved its objective to develop, demonstrate and validate an
effective approach to promoting improved secure and sustainable livelihood strategies,
and to create institutional capacity, all of which is being scaled up and replicated
countrywide under SLP II.

3.4.2. While the design of some elements of the project, particularly of KPIs, was overly
complicated, it nevertheless supported the achievement of the intended outcomes and
objectives. Moreover, the objectives, design and implementation retained their overall
relevance and remained fully consistent with Mongolia's development priorities and with
the Bank's country and sectoral assistance strategies.

3.4.3. The level of efficiency was high. Project costs were justified, as benefits out
weight the costs substantially.


3.5.    Over-arching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts


(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

3.5.1. There are no direct measures of the poverty impact of the project, however, all
components explicitly or implicitly targeted poor households, and there is evidence that
these households benefited from the project.

3.5.2. The Ex ante assessments from the LIF/LDF sub-project proposal forms indicate
that roughly 30 percent of the targeted beneficiaries were considered poor or very poor.
There are indications that several types of projects would have large relative benefits
across the population and to rural bag residents and households with lesser access to
services in general. Some projects are useful to the general population such as primary


                                              19

schools. Herder families, who are often poor and among the most vulnerable, would
benefit to a greater extent from dormitories for their children (30,784 schoolchildren from
poor and vulnerable households), as well as maternity rest homes where most of the
family members live in distant grazing areas. Other projects such as kindergartens, tree
planting, pipe heating systems and drinking water sub-projects tended to provide greater
benefits to soum center beneficiaries, who may not be as poor but who also have a
considerable share of people living in poverty9. Overall, learning environment
improvement, i.e. school rehabilitation, furniture procurement, etc., significantly
benefited girls (316,333 out of 575,552 direct beneficiaries), while temporary job creation
due to infrastructure rehabilitation clearly benefited the very poor (1,331 out of 1,561).

3.5.3. Almost half of the microfinance beneficiaries were poor and from low-income
households -- 92.3% of the loans were for income generating activities. The Impact
evaluation study (ME Consulting, 2006) revealed improvements of the borrowers'
livelihoods and positive changes in income structure, e.g. from increased profits from
private businesses and informal sector activities.

(b) Institutional Change and Strengthening

3.5.4. The project's concept evolves around institutional change and strengthening, and
institutional development is an inherent outcome of this project. Under each component,
institutions and capacities were established to support sustainable livelihood strategies,
for example substantial progress was made in developing soum level capacity in
preparing and using pastoral management plans. Progress was made in (i) the
development of the institutional framework for pastoral risk management at the national
and local level (through development of organizations, development and testing of
procedures and building capacities at the local level) for the establishment of MDF and
development of herder-tailored loans, and (ii) the establishment of efficient and
transparent community-driven mechanisms for basic infrastructure and social services
provision in rural areas.

3.5.5. There are two areas of limited progress with building capacity for institutional
change and strengthening:

    · Despite the fact that the National Coordinating Council on Pastureland Management was
        established in 2005, it has not been active since then. While no doubt the establishment
        of the NCCPM raised the profile of pasture risk management issues in the country, the
        lack of a working level body/secretariat limited the functionality of this institution.

    · The institutionalization of procedures established under the LIF component was hindered
        by the government's decision to recentralize its fiscal management, leaving little
        opportunity for the project's mechanisms to be incorporated at the local level.

3.6.    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops


N/A

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome


Rating: Moderate

4.1.1. There are two main risks to sustainability and development outcome: (i) lack of
adequate funding of organizations responsible for pastoral risk management; and (ii)
implementation of a regionalization policy might cause restructuring of budgetary entities
and planning processes in aimags and soums.

4.1.2. Funding of organizations responsible for pastoral risk management. There are
two-tier issues here: funding provided at national level for policy development and
funding provided at local level for actual implementation of PRM strategies.

    (a) Based on NCCPM's recommendation, a specialized pastureland management division
        was set up in the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA). The division is currently
        being funded from UNDP - the "Sustainable Grassland Management Project", which is
        closing at the end of December 2008. The Transition of funding arrangements from
        UNDP to the Government was expected to take place in October 2007; however, this has
        not happened as yet. It is envisaged that the division will officially become part of
        MOFA's institutional structure after the June elections, when the new government is
        formed and a new MOFA structure is approved.

    (b) Institutional framework of PRM at aimag land soum levels has been established and
        functioning well. However, funding of actual PRM activities remains a concern. They
        largely remain as self-standing activities and hence lack financing beyond the project
        investments. SLP II introduces PRM Fund, which is expected to test and examine options
        for sustainable financing of PRM, integrated with local and planning and budgeting.

4.1.3. Implementation of regionalization policy might cause restructuring of budgetary
entities and planning processes in aimags and soums. The Medium Term Strategy on
Regional Development 2001-2010 (adopted by the Parliament in 2003) identifies key
regional centers -Western, Hangai, Central and Eastern regions and Ulaanbaatar city, and
aimags to be incorporated into each. If implemented, this could potentially cause a
restructuring of the administrative structures of the aimags and soums. It might also have
resource allocation implications, including infrastructure and social service delivery.
Current planning processes established under the project rely on existing administrative
structures and thus institutional sustainability is highly vulnerable to such changes. This
risk is being recognized under SLP II, and while the institutional arrangements are still
largely the same, the project will attempt to establish principles for and experience with
local management of budgetary resources that surpass higher level changes.

In addition to these two main risks, there are two secondary risks:




                                                 21

4.1.4. Political pressure might force the PFIs to reduce the lending rates for special
target groups, e.g. herders. This would cause declining profits and lead to lower
engagement in rural lending. It would also eventually prevent the achievement of the
objective of substantial improvement in microfinance outreach to the poor in rural areas.
Lending terms, and particularly interest rates, are subject to continuous political
speculations. There is a wide belief among politicians that interest rates for loans to
herders should be subsidized, without consideration of transaction and opportunity costs.
SLP II will need to engage in substantial policy dialogue with all stakeholders and
improve public awareness on these issues. Provisions have been made for this, e.g.
developing a publications relations campaign under SLPII.

4.1.5. A large-scale dzud could potentially overwhelm capacity and affect a still nascent
institutional framework. While no major dzud occurred during the life of SLP I, climatic
variability in Mongolia is very high, thus the likelihood of dzud. Improvement of pastoral
infrastructure and planning capacity in pilot aimags should in principle mitigate this risk
to some extent, and IBLIP could in principle provide supplementary support to herders,
albeit in three pilot aimags only.


5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1.    Bank

(a) Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.1. The Bank's performance in project identification, support for preparation, and
appraisal is rated satisfactory, despite some minor shortcomings in the design:

    · optimistic expectations concerning decentralization policy and setting ambitious targets
        for fiscal decentralization, while recognizing the high risks of this agenda;
     · failure to fully anticipate the technical assistance that would be required to develop the
         capacity of local communities;
     · complicated design of performance indicators that were often difficult to use to measure
         the progress towards or achievement of project objectives.

5.1.2. Nevertheless, the project was consistent with the Government of Mongolia's
priorities to address poverty and vulnerability, inadequate capacity and community
participation for service delivery, and under-development of rural financial systems. Its
objectives are also closely linked to the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy both then
and now. Despite its complexity, covering numerous sectors and themes, the project
design allowed for the delivery of project goals.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.3. Bank supervision was adequate and satisfactory. The Bank team provided timely
responses, actions and clearances and met internal reporting deadlines. Continuity of the
Task Team was a particular supervision strength ­ even though the project effectively
had three TTLs, all of them were long members of the task team, and therefore transitions


                                                22

were smooth. The technical skill mix was also adequate and continuous, with the
exception of M&E part, which was reviewed by a number of people. Supervision
missions included regular site visits, updates and agreements on follow-up steps. The
fact that the TTL throughout most of the project was based in Beijing also helped, as he
was available to visit Mongolia on demand, especially during critical situations.
Continuous presence of fiduciary staff in the project team merits particular mentioning,
as detailed procurement and financial management reviews identified and addressed
many issues which would have otherwise hampered implementation. Throughout the
entire implementation period the project team maintained a close and collaborative spirit
with the National Council and HLSPO, as well as the technical working groups.

5.1.4. The Bank team was also flexible and proactive in addressing major issues which
could have otherwise had serious impact on the project performance, including:

    · Cancelling support to non-performing and unsustainable RLFs

    · Helping the counterpart to access resources for implementation of the M&E system and
        capacity building activities (through JSDF grant); and

    · Exploring alternative avenues for addressing fiscal decentralization issues in light of
        government's change of policy

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.5. Despite some minor weaknesses at the entry, the Bank actively worked with all
counterpart agencies and stakeholders which ensured satisfactory outcomes of the
project. In light of the above, the overall bank performance is rated satisfactory.


5.2.    Borrower Performance


(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1. The Government of Mongolia provided strong political support during project
preparation and, despite frequent changes, it maintained its commitment to the project
throughout the entire implementation period, albeit sometimes with different
interpretations as to the project's objective. The Government also maintained the
structure of the National Committee which oversaw the implementation of the project,
which to a certain extent ensured coordination and communication among the different
agencies.

(b) Implementing Agency (or Agencies) Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.2. The performance of the HLSPO, which was the implementing agency for the
SLPI is rated satisfactory. Its special status, not being affiliated with any of the



                                                23

ministries, provided a certain advantage, but also posed difficulties. It should be
acknowledged that the HLSPO was functioning under difficult circumstances, being
impacted by frequent changes in the Government. A High turnover rate, especially
among the M&E, procurement and financial management and disbursement staff,
eventually had some impact on performance in these areas. By contrast, PRM and LIF
coordinators were with the project throughout the entire implementation and to a large
extent ensured its' success. Overall, HLSPO was able to carry out a project
implementation of high quality. Staff at all levels (soum, aimag, HLSPO) was well
qualified and extremely dedicated.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.3. In view of the above, the Borrower's overall performance is rated satisfactory.


6.      Lessons Learned


6.1.1. A number of lessons were identified during implementation and have largely been
incorporated into the design of SLP II:

6.1.2. Subsidized credit and credit delivered through non-financial institutions is not a
sustainable approach to rural finance and innovation. The project design included three
approaches to providing credit in rural areas: (i) subsidized credit under the PRM
component; (ii) credit offered on commercial terms under the MDF; and (iii) RLFs
operated by local authorities. Of these three approaches, only the MDF approach proved
viable and sustainable. The performance of the subsidized credit and the RLFs was
weak, the former having low repayment rates and weak administration and the latter
dropped from the project due to weak performance. The MDF did demonstrate the
feasibility of increasing micro-finance outreach through the commercial financial sector.
Over the course of the project, many citizens were able to receive credit for the first time,
and the performance of the borrowers in terms of repayment was very strong, despite
market determined interest rates. SLP II will build on this to enable financial institutions
to offer a broader range of products in rural areas and increase the capacity of both
commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions to service rural clientele.

6.1.3. Fostering community participation is a continuous on-going task that
requires explicit attention and resources. Although the project has been largely
successful in bringing communities into the development process, especially under the
LIF, the resources required for this were under-estimated during the project design. Even
with the additional support from the JSDF grant, mobilization of communities will be an
on-going challenge for the second phase and beyond, and will be critical for longer term
sustainability. The approach for SLP II will be to work more closely in communities to
institutionalize community mobilization and strengthen mechanisms for participation.

6.1.4. Institutional change takes time and requires work at multiple levels. In
hindsight, the project was overly optimistic about the extent of institutional change that



                                             24

could be achieved in the project's lifetime. The project successfully achieved its
objective to demonstrate successful approaches to create sustainable livelihoods, though
less was achieved on institutionalizing these approaches into policy. The largest
challenge was to forge linkages between the project and broader government policy. The
main mechanisms for achieving this were the National Committee and component
Technical Working Groups. Although in practice this structure provided guidance for
project implementation, the links with policy formulation were not strong. Under SLP II
the composition of the National Steering Committee and working groups has been re-
thought to enhance links with key policy makers. Even so, it should be recognized that
consensus building leading to policy development takes time.

6.1.5. Information on project implementation and outcomes, increasing public
awareness of the project, and a strong communications strategy are essential for
successful implementation. Project implementation was occasionally held back by a lack
of understanding of the project's objectives and approach. Even though a monitoring and
evaluation system was established under the project, more attention could have been
provided to presenting and disseminating information to a range of audiences, including
the beneficiary communities, the general public and non-governmental organizations,
Government and Parliamentarians and other interested parties.


7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower, Implementing Agencies and Partners


(a) Borrower/Implementing Agencies

7.1.1. Migration stabilization could be affected by a number of factors, including
alternatives available in urban areas, natural conditions, terms of trade, etc. Over the last
few years there was no major dzud, thus no major catastrophic losses that would force the
rural-urban migration were faced. Besides, cashmere industry enjoyed relatively positive
terms of trade, making herding viable again. While SLP certainly helped to improve the
delivery of services in rural areas and established the basis for mitigating pastoral risk, it
can not be claimed with full confidence that the project had an impact on population
migration.

7.1.2. Comments were received from the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor and the
Financial Regulatory Commission on the Microfinance Outreach Component. All
comments are forward looking, proposing aspects where more could be done to improve
the component's performance under SLP II. One challenge for the MDF is to move
beyond its role as a wholesale lender and increasingly push the boundaries of financial
system development. The focus in the comments on improving education and business
skills is well placed and capacity within the MMO is being increased to enhance training
programs. There are no funds under SLP II, however, to construct a training center: as far
as possible training will be conducted on location, especially in rural areas.

7.1.3. Savings and Credit Cooperatives are recognized as potentially important financial
institutions for rural populations, though were not eligible for support under the project.
Under SLP II, once performance criteria are established for SCCs and a lending policy



                                             25

for SCCs is agreed, these institutions will also be considered for MDF loans. As under
SLP, the on-lending interest rates proposed by competing financial institutions will be an
important criteria for the selection of PFIs.

2.2.     Capacity Building. A considerable amount of capacity building was done under the PRM
component through manual distribution and seminars for existing aimag and soum land,
environmental, agriculture and other officials. They, in turn, provided the main facilitation of
meetings and interactions with herders. This put in place a basic understanding in pilot aimags
and soums, of developing basic mapping, pasture land management and risk planning among
officials. Trainings covered: (i) the use of pasture maps for pastoral management; (ii) how to
develop a land management plan; (iii) using GPS; (iv) estimating carrying capacity; (v)
alternative methods of rodent control; (vi) well selection and maintenance; (vii) migration and
conflict resolution; (viii) regulating stocking densities; (ix) emergency migration routes. In
addition to this, extensive training program was provided to herders and herder groups through
direct training provision, exchange of best practices/experience, and study tours in project
aimags. About 70 events were organized with the participation of 27,767 participants from 499
soums (includes double counting). Overall, the local training covered 83.8% of bag governors,
87.1% of leaders of herders' groups and 31.7% of herding families.

1. Risk Forecasting and Contingency Planning




                                                  29

2.3.    A Livestock Early Warning System (LEWS) has been piloted in the Tuv aimag since
2006. LEWS is based on a PHYGROW rangeland production model. The model builds on site
information, surface hits, plant species, plant habit, grazing preferences of the livestock and
production of vegetation. Bi-monthly forage growth maps were provided to all soums of Tuv
aimag during 2007. Dissemination techniques and appropriate ways of feeding the information
provided by the LEWS to aimag and soum level planners and to herders were tested. Training
was provided on LEWS for stakeholders on interpreting and using LEWS, including at aimag and
soum levels.

2.4.    Long-range weather forecasting bulletins have been prepared and distributed to herders
and the local population in all pilot aimags and soums. The bulletin was published 7 times with
45,600 copies. Bulletins are the second most important source of information for herders, after
Mongolian public radio. The Herders' assessment is that the bulletin provides useful input for
househods in terms of preparedness to climatic shocks.

2.5.    Several risk management brochures and handouts were developed and disseminated to
the local stakeholders, including:
                  · Guidelines for development of a soum pastoral risk management plan
                  · Long-term weather forecasting and early risk warning
                  · A methodological guidance for exploration and documentation and
                       dissemination of best experiences and innovative skills
                  · A manual for local trainers "Herders group-based pasture and risk
                       management" (delivered to 657 individuals)
                  · A manual for herders "Herders group-based pasture and risk management"
                       (delivered to 23,674 khot ails)

Herders reference manuals and trainers manuals were also delivered to non-pilot aimags.

2. Grazing and Pasture Management

2.6.    Pasture maps were developed for 138 soums in 8 aimags, containing: (i) base map, by
winter-spring and summer-autumn seasons (scale 1:100.000); (ii) pasture stocking rate map by 4
seasons and by annual means (5 separate maps differently scaled, depending on the size of soum
territory); (iii) well mapping with surrounding areas; (iv) seasonal pasture division map; (v)
current stocking density map; and (vi) estimated carrying capacity mapping.

2.7.    These maps have proved to be very popular with soum resource management officials
and receive extensive use during discussions with herders concerning pastureland use, including
supporting herder groups to make and self-enforce agreements on seasonal pasture rotation.
Seasonal stocking density maps are also being used to assist in predicting possible scenarios for
animal disease outbreaks and for making quarantine arrangements.

2.8.    The pastureland demonstration program, based on the knowledge and experiences under
SLP, attempted to pilot institutional frameworks. It established a system, building on the
capacities of local stakeholders, and has been tested in the soums of Erdene and Erdenesant of
Tuv aimag. The demonstration program was designed with the participation of the soum, bag
officials from 2 pilot sums and the land and agricultural offices of the Tuv aimag. Consultations
were held with key national stakeholders such as the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the
Agency for Land Relations, Geodesy and Cartography, relevant donor programs and tertiary
education institutions.



                                                  30

2.9.     A total of 483 wells were rehabilitated in all pilot soums mostly under group
management. This helped to better distribute grazing pressures, but it could also bring with it the
risks of opening-up areas to regular grazing that should remain as reserves for critical times. It
appears though that the selection of wells did broadly follow the agreed pasture management
plans.

3. Herder Self-Help Groups

2.10.    The project worked in 655 bags of 142 soums of 8 pilot aimags. In total, 313 NGOs
were established and officially registered, with 6,313 members from 2,532 households. 42
cooperatives and 189 informal herder groups have been strengthened. While formation as NGOs
was seen as a quicker option for formalization, and certainly a necessary first learning step in
most cases, there are some limitations of this set-up in terms of potential group business
development and marketing, and access to formal credit. Herder groups have been active in and
benefiting from PRM activities, including:

    · Involvement in soum-level PRM planning and awareness of its benefits
    · Increasing cooperative behavior on grazing land and camp-sites
    · Group-based approach to well rehabilitation and management for 483 wells

2.11.    The establishment of herder groups has led to many other significant initiatives,
indicating the usefulness of the groups to their livelihood development, such as:

    · Setting up their own internal savings and loans funds and initiated other self-help
         activities
    · Accessed RLFs for income-generating activities in virtually all of the 142 soums of the
         eight core aimags, mainly for felt making and vegetable growing
    · With cooperative herding have been able to diversify other activities.               There are
         anecdotes from several areas of pooling of small animal herding, which has been
         allocated to younger members.
    · Show mutual support activities within groups, including providing help to poorer
         members.
    · Feed production and distribution of herder-led innovations in demonstration areas.

2.12.    An average recovery rate on herder loans is 82.2% (from MIS data source, December 20,
2007). Subsidized loans do not provide a sustainable basis for providing credit to herders or
herder groups, as they undermine normal credit channels provided through commercial banks.
Under SLPII, more herder-tailored loans will be developed and made available to herders and
herder groups under the Micro-Finance Development component.

4. Hay and Fodder Enterprise Development

2.13.    Twenty one hay and fodder-making enterprises/cooperatives in Ulaankhus soum, Bayan-
Olgii aimag, Tarialan, Ondorkhangai, Zuungobi and Baruunturuun soums, Uvs aimag,
Ugtaaltsaidam, Tseel and Jargalant soums in Tuv aimag, Kherlen soum Dornod aimag, Adaatsag
soum in Dundgovi aimag and Dalanzadgad, Gurvantes, Nomgon soums in Omnogobi aimag
were provided soft loans. The project was initially providing equipment to enterprises. Uptake
was relatively slow and there was greater demand for cash. Based on the number of requests from
hay and fodder enterprises, the provision of equipment loans solely was lifted (the DCA was



                                                  31

amended in May 2005), and the process has accelerated since then. The repayment of loans is in
accordance with the loan agreements and repayment schedule.

2.14.   The rehabilitation of emergency hay and fodder storage facilities (34 storage houses) in 8
aimags including inter-aimag otor grazing reserves area in Kherlenbayan-Ulaan, Kentii aimag
and Argalant, Gobi-Altai aimag has been completed under phase I of the SLP. Tuv aimag did not
have an aimag level hay and fodder storage before the SLP investment, hence the new one was
built (with 130 tons of hay storage capacity) in Bayan soum, providing an opportunity to
distribute hay and fodder from the storage house to 10 different neighboring soums under
emergency situation. Overall, the project more than doubled hay storage and tripled forage
capacity in pilot aimags. These facilities are being incorporated into annual contingency plans.
However, there is little information on the sustainability and effectiveness of use, especially by
more vulnerable households. It is noted that establishment of soum hay and fodder reserves has
not been popular because of low hay yields and climatic factors. No soum or bag funds for
reserves have been established by local authorities, and fodder conservation is largely done by
herders.

Component 2. Micro-Finance Outreach ($6.01 Million / $5.95Million)

1. Micro-Finance Development Fund

2.15.   Approximately $7.13 million had been allocated to the PFIs as wholesale loans from
MDF, from which a total of $17.0 million has been on-lent to rural residents (including revolving
re-disbursements). A total of 29,021 sub-loans had been disbursed, comprising 141,602
beneficiaries (direct and indirect) in 21 aimags and Bayangol district of Ulaanbaatar city. The
amount includes the World Bank's financing of US$ 4.3 million, which was disbursed through 8
tender announcements for the selection of PFIs, and the loan source repaid from the PFIs.

2.19.    As of IV quarter of 2007, the repayment of micro loans disbursed to sub-borrowers by the
total amount of loan disbursement and redisbursement was 98.9%, while the MDF's wholesale
loan repayment was 100%.

2. Strengthening of Revolving Loan Funds (RLFs)

2.20.    This subcomponent was envisaged to improve the operational performance and financial
health of the existing, local government-owned and -operated micro-credit RLFs that were
created at the soum level under NPAP. The conditions for disbursement of IDA funds allocated
to the provision of sub-loans by the selected RLFs stipulate that the Borrower: (i) would establish
a MIS adequate to monitor micro-finance portfolio quality; and (ii) prepare a detailed Action Plan
for the use of these funds, acceptable to IDA, with the objective of strengthening the selected
RLFs. In 2003, the RLF review identified significant problems in the quality of the overall
portfolio. The recovery rate of short terms loans disbursed was around 63%. Almost 60% of the
sums operating RLFs reported recovery rates of below 70%, with some starting as low as 24%.
Close to 77% of total outstanding loans were considered to be non-performing loans. On the
basis of these findings it was decided to cancel the support to RLFs, and re-allocate the resources
to MDF.

3. Index-Based Livestock Insurance Scheme

2.21.    The development objective of the pilot program is to ascertain the viability of index-
based livestock insurance in Mongolia. The IBLI pilot program started on September 2005, and
has already completed 2 sales seasons (with the third one underway). The IBLI program is being
piloted in three selected aimags: Bayankhongor, Khentii, and Uvs.

2.22.    The insurance scheme is based on an innovative combination of self-insurance, market-
based insurance and social insurance. Herders retain small losses that do not affect the viability
of their business, while large losses are transferred to the private insurance industry and
catastrophic losses are transferred to the government. The private sector product where insurance
companies retain risk is known as the Base Insurance Product (BIP). The BIP is written on a
layer of risks using as the index the best estimates of the soum-level mortality (e.g., soum
mortality rates between 6 to 30 percent in Uvs aimag). The government compensates herders for
the most extreme losses with the Disaster Response Product ­ DRP (e.g., losses between 30
percent and 100 percent for Uvs aimag). The DRP also addresses a level of risk that is typically
subject to cognitive failure, meaning catastrophic risks typically fall outside the scope of planning
and risk management strategies.

2.23.    Payments are based on estimates of the soum level livestock mortality rates from January
through May. Indemnities are generally paid in late July or early August after the estimates of
mortality are obtained from a newly developed mid-year livestock survey.

2.24.    Index-based mortality insurance is not linked to the dzud event itself, but to the outcome
that is of most concern ­ large numbers of livestock mortality. Importantly, it provides strong
incentives to individual herders to continue to manage their herds so as to minimize the impacts
of major livestock mortality events (i.e. individual herders receive an insurance pay-out based on
regional mortality, irrespective of their individual losses).



                                                  34

2.25.   The IBLI pilot program has four major components: (i) Implementation of the IBLI Pilot;
(ii) Promotion and Public Awareness; (iii) Institutional Capacity Building; (iv) Monitoring and
Evaluation.

2.26.   By many accounts, the pilot project has exceeded expectations:

     · BIP sales are greater than anticipated: Around 2400 policies were sold in all 56 pilot
        soums in 2006 sales year (9% of eligible herders) and over 3700 policies were sold in
        2007 (14% of eligible herders) ;
     · 50% more herders purchased BIP in year two than in year one;
     · 100% of herders who were entitled to indemnity payments in 2007 received them;
     · Four insurance companies participated with 153 sales agents in the 2006-07 season;
     · Capacity building with insurance companies has shown significant progress;
     · Over 90% of herders in the pilot aimags have heard of IBLI;
     · Herders have a very positive view of the project, including confidence that the indemnity
        payments will be made;
     · Around 60% of herders express an interest in purchasing IBLI products;
     · IBLI MIS Software which consists of Data Entry, Portfolio Risk Assessment and MIS
        components has been developed and proven to be instrumental in implementing the
        program and understanding the risk;
     · Lenders have offered lower interest rates and better terms on loans to IBLI insured
        herders;
     · IBLI designated accounts for the LIIP, BIP reserve, and DRP reserves were opened and
        administered using Khaan Bank.

1. Local Initiatives Fund

2.27.   Since the beginning of the SLP I project in July 1, 2002 until December 31, 2007 1, 729
sub-projects in health, education and infrastructure development were implemented in all pilot
soums and duuregs. For the implementation period of SLP I 7, 814 million tugrugs were
disbursed (including local contribution) for the sub-projects in 8 pilot aimags and 1 duureg of UB,
of which 26% for health, 57% for education, and 17% for infrastructure sector . Over 10% of the
LIF is funded by contributions of local communities and individuals.

2.28.   Between the start of the LDF in July 1, 2002 and December 30, 2007, the total of 1,602
projects with the total funding of 7,137 million tugrugs were implemented in 13 non-core aimags
and 8 duuregs.

2.29.    Investment in the education, health, infrastructure within the LIF/LDF component
resulted in the improvement of access of the rural community to basic social services. Project
activities encompassed 91% of all secondary schools, 89% of all kindergartens and school
dormitories improving learning and living conditions of the rural children. Project activies
included:

    · Investments in education by implementing rehabilitation, facilities improvement projects
         in 561 secondary schools, provided 575,552 childrens with appropriate learning
         environment, innovating classrooms in almost 100 schools. Out of 575,552 children
         11,8692 are poor, 31,6333 are girls. 8,276 drop-out- children returned to the schools by
         improving facilities at the non-formal educational centers and living conditions in school
         dormitories.
    · 111,049 children, out of which 77,958 are from herders' and 30,784 are from poor
         households, improved their living and learning conditions in dormitories. They were
         provided with warm blankets and sheets, new beds and withrows, tables and facilites for
         reading and playing, learning rooms, baths and washing rooms. As a result the number of
         herder and poor children living in dormitories increased by 12,762.
    · Rehabilitation, facilities improvement, and mobile ger kindergarten projects have been
         implemented to improve appropriate learning conditions for 94,183 children, out of


                                                 36

        which 23139 are from poor families. As a result, 12,778 children have been provided
        with a quality learning environment. As a result of the project investments in the
        extention of kindergarten buildings, furnishing, and the provision of new equipments for
        kitchens, 12,778 young children were newly enrolled.
    · The project had a major impact on the quality and access of rural communities to basic
        health services.    The project has reached almost all soum hospitals.          In total, 85
        ambulances were distributed to aimag and soum center hospitals, while 450 bagh doctors
        were provided with motobikes which improved family based health services by
        increasing the number of visits to families. Almost 180 soum hospitals were provided
        with ultrasound and other diagnostic equipments.
    · The number of women served by maternal rest room reached 24,945 and the number of
        home births decreased significantly.
    · Diagnostic services of the hospitals in remote soums improved and the number of people
        diagnosed by the new equipment,(ultrasound and blood testing), increased from 1,055 in
        2005 till 7,991 in 2007.
    · In total, 414 doctor and nurses learned how to maintain new medical equipments and
        improved their professional skills.

2.30.   The following contributed to the improvement of living conditions of rural communties:
112 projects on the rehabilitation, building, facilities improvement of public baths, 176 projects
on the rehabilitation of drinking water wells, 23 projects to improve heating of public service
places, 85 projects to build, rehabilitate local roads, bridges, 16 projects in environment such as
foresting, fencing of springs, rivers, etc

2.31.   In total, 1,561 people were provided with temporary jobs by participation in the above
projects in reconstruction of roads, bridges and other reconstruction work - out of these 1,561
people, 1,331 are poor. The above activities positively influenced the overall stabilization of
migration to aimags from soums, and from aimags to cities. From 2003 to 2007, 35 new public
service centers were established in remote areas.

2. Training and Capacity Building

2.32.   A variety of training and capacity building activities have been carried out during the
implementation of the LIF component. The fact that 3,330 sub-project activities have been
implemented according to PIM criteria demonstrates that the HLSPO staff, aimag and soum
councils and bag leaders have a clear understanding of LIF operational procedures and are
capable of mobilizing community participation and of eliciting sub-project proposals. Two study
tours were organized for aimag secretaries and members of the LIF working group to learn from
the experience of other countries about community driven development mechanisms and
outcomes.

2.33.   A major community mobilization program was initiated with the support of the JSDF
grant (approximately US$450,000) in two phases. The first phase was implemented in 16 pilot
soums of 8 aimags; the second phase expanded into 143 soums of 8 amiags. Under the project,
local community mobilizers were selected in each soum and that person collaborated with the
soum HLSP council members and the council secretary to mobilize local citizens. According to
the research conducted among the communities in the pilot soums, 82.8% of the population has
been supported by project related information, and about 40% of the population covered by the
project participated in the prioritization and selection process of the soum sub-projects.

3. Fiscal Decentralization Initiative

2.34.   Based on the activities undertaken in the scope of the FG sub-component, there was
research conducted on Fiscal decentralization and local public finances in Mongolia. The main
purpose of the research was to define the governance structure of soums and aimags, their
revenue structures and main financial constraints, describing local budgetary process and
expenditure structures, main shortcomings of local public finances and submit optional proposal
for fiscal decentralization process. The issues paper has been prepared, disseminated and debated
at a workshop held at MOFE in 2005 and an action plan for pilot action research on fiscal
decentralization was prepared. The Government though after considering the issues and options,
decided not to proceed with pilots. The original design of the sub-component was based on an
assumption of greater progress being made by the Government on decentralization. However,
due to a combination of factors including the government's limited financial resources for soum
and aimag levels, fiscal decentralization was reduced.

2.35.   At the mid-term of the project, it was decided that the fiscal decentralization component
of the project should be refocused to enhance state-citizen engagement in fiscal decision making,
transparency and accountability. The sub-component was renamed "local fiscal governance".
The second research was to investigate the fundamental ways to effectively manage project funds
with the participation of communities and individuals. The report includes frameworks for
conducting this same research in the second phase of the Project. The report specifically
describes how and where the research should be performed. It was also presented to all the
pertinent organization.

Component 4. Project Management and Policy Support ($1.25 million / $2.71 million)

1.Information dissemination and communications.

2.36.   Contracts were signed with five daily newspapers ("Unuudur-Today, Ardyn Erkh-
People's Right, Mongolyn Medee-News of Mongolia', Zuuny Medee-Century's News", "Urdiin
sonin ­ Daily News"), Mongolian National Public Radio, "Channel 25" TV, etc. A variety of
events were organized. More than 50 daily materials were published during 2007 only, and five
20 minute radio programs focused on aimags were broadcast on national public radio. Mass
media caravans were organized in pilot aimags. The project participated in the Mongolia
Development Marketplace. Different kinds of contests were organized, e.g. the best article on the
topic of "My contribution to livelihood" among secondary school students. More that MNT6.6
million was spent on local mass media campaigns.

Project Orientation and Training

2.37.   Orientation training for Governors (in both core and non-core aimags) were organized,
which then followed with detailed orientation of pilot aimags only. Several consultative meetings
on SLP at national level were organized. 8 experience sharing workshops and training among
core aimags were organized. Results based trainings, workshops and seminars were organized for
all 143 soums in 8 aimags.

Capacity building program for HLSPO was also implemented, including trainings abroad and
study tours.

2.38.   The main outputs under this sub-component are: (i) a detailed data-base of the project's
outcomes for the period 2003 ­ 2007; (ii) a synthesis of key findings of the pilot project on
participatory M&E in eight pilot aimags; and (iii) preparation of the integrated and outcome-
based M&E system for the SLP II to support the second phase of the Program. Improvement to
the M&E system which occurred after the introduction of the Participatory Monitoring and
Evaluation (PM&E), with support of the JSDF grant. It was first introduced in 16 pilot soums and
was afterwards scaled up to include all 143 soums of 8 pilot aimags. Below is the list of training
and capacity building activities carried out for introduction and expansion of the PM&E system:

Annex 3:     Economic and Financial Analysis

3.1.    The economic analysis presented in the PAD was not based on a cost/benefit analysis
(because most of the benefits were considered to be unquantifiable) or on an assessment of cost
effectiveness. Instead, that was described as "alternative approaches and illustrative analysis"
was carried out for one component and several sub-components.

3.2.    Pastoral Risk Management. The benefits anticipated from the component were the
reductions to be achieved in livestock losses caused by dzud. Such losses include direct costs (the
value of livestock) and wider economic and social costs (e.g., reductions in cashmere wool and
milk production, tree-felling for fuel to replace dungas the fuel in ger stoves). The analysis
concentrated on the potential impact of PRM on livestock losses, and assumed that the adoption
on a nation-wide basis of the PRM strategy would reduce losses in dzud years to the long-term
average rate of mortality (i.e., eliminating completely any "spikes" in mortality caused by the
dzud event). There was no major dzud over the lifetime of the project, and while there was an
almost 45% reduction in livestock mortality in pilot aimags, it is difficult to attribute it to project
interventions.

3.3.    Local Initiatives Fund. Conventional ex-post economic analysis was carried out in the
LIF component. The analysis covered a sample of 100 sub-projects, such as school and
dormitory rehabilitation, school and dormitory refurnishing, kindergarten rehabilitation,
rehabilitation of school heating systems, public bath houses, hospital rehabilitation, drinking
water supply and maternal rest home refurnishing.

3.4.    The findings of this analysis indicate that most sub-projects have a good cost benefit ratio
and economic rate of return (ERR), ranging from 6% (dormitory heating system) to 30%
(ambulance car for soum hospital) with an average of 20%. Very few projects appear to have a
demonstrably low cost efficiency level. This may be partially because the need is so high that
almost any type of community initiated project is likely to be useful. Only one investment has a
negative ERR (public bath houses), mostly because of the combination of low user rates and high
running costs.

3.5.    Other sub-projects that probably have a high rate of return but that are difficult to
measure include materials and equipment in kindergartens and dormitories. The investment is
relatively small but the benefits are qualitatively estimated to be high.



                                                  40

3.6.     The average number of beneficiaries in the education sector is comparatively lower than
in the health, infrastructure and other categories. This does not mean though that the later are
more cost efficient. The average cost per direct beneficiary of education sub-projects is about
40,000 MNT. Due to high variations in the number of beneficiaries in health sub-projects, the
cost per direct beneficiary varies from MNT168 to 134,336. The average for the sector projects is
about MNT 34,000. It is lower for infrastructure projects, about MNT10,000.

3.7.     The findings of the analysis suggest that delivery of services through sub-projects
supported by the component is cost effective. As compared to similar government civil works,
the duration from project submission to project completion is relatively shorter for projects
supported under the SLP I. As compared to Government projects, the LIF/LDF tender process is
more localized which is perceived as better than government systems. The government often
selects Ulaan Baatar based companies, which results in less efficient implementation monitoring.
The LIF monitoring is considered better even where local citizens do not have the technical
competency to carry it out.

3.8.     Microfinance Outreach. Economic rates of returns for a selected sample of income
generating activities supported under the MDF indicate a good return on investments, according
to findings of an analysis of about 70 sub-loans in February 2007. The sample included loans
from Khaan Bank, Xac Bank, Credit Mongol and CapMon NBFI, covering four aimags (Uvs,
Bayankhongor, Dundgovi, and tuv). The average loan size of the sample was between



                                                 41

MNT1,100,000 to MNT1,350,000 and included income generating activities only (trading,
services, manufacturing and animal husbandry). According to the study, returns on investments
from loans varied between around 20 for trading to around 50 percent for services, manufacturing
and husbandry. In a different study carried out in June 2006, an attempt was made to measure the
impact of the loans on the households' income and livelihoods. The survey covered a sample of
266 sub-borrowers in 48 soums of all eight pilot aimags. According to the study, about 96% of
borrowers have experienced changes in their livelihoods, out of which 76% had an increased
monthly monetary income, 45% purchased some property, and about 25% borrowed for paying
tuition fees, etc. The average monetary income increased by almost 30%, while those who
borrowed for income generating activities saw a 36.2% increase in their income. Table below
provides the details on some selected indicators.

livelihood sources. Survey results argue that women were more efficient in this regard and are
better loan utilizers. Among the factors affecting monthly monetary income improvement the
