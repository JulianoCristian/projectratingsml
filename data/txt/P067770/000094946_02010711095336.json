Sustainable Livelihoods Project\n            consists of three main components: pastoral risk management\n            (PRM), supporting the preparation and implementation of an\n            integrated strategy to reduce herders' vulnerability to\n            drought; microfinance service outreach (MSO), supporting\n            structural change in commercial and civil society provision\n            of microfinance services; and local initiative funds (LIF),\n            supporting demand-driven mechanisms for beneficiary groups\n            to select, co-finance, and execute investments in basic\n            infrastructure and social services. This environmental and\n            social assessment suggests that the project has the\n            potential to deliver an overall positive environmental\n            impact through a contribution to reduced land degradation in\n            PRM. The environmental assessment has considered all of the\n            potential negative impacts of the project activities and\n            provides details on several activities that may have\n            negative impacts and proposes mitigation actions. These\n            activities include: community-based rodent control,\n            community-based control of predation, community-based\n            construction and rehabilitation of wells, emergency\n            restocking, haymaking, intersum/inter-aimag otor reserves,\n            and veterinary services. The potential of the project to\n            deliver positive improvements in reduced land degradation\n            should far outweigh any localized environmental impacts of\n            the project activities."}, "docdt": "2001-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
