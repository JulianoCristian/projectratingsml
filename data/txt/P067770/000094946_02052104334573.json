Although by and large, no\n            resettlement, nor land acquisition under the project is\n            anticipated, possible small-scale infrastructure\n            sub-projects may impact local communities negatively. The\n            resettlement principles are as follows. Land acquisition,\n            and/or involuntary resettlement will be avoided as possible,\n            to minimize negative impacts on PAPs. Houses and other\n            affected structures, will be compensated at replacement\n            costs, with no deductions for depreciation, nor for salvaged\n            materials for potential new structures. Land losses will be\n            compensated in terms of land-for-land of equal agricultural\n            productive capacity, or in cash at replacement costs.\n            Residential land, and/or premises shall be compensated at\n            equal size. Transportation, and moving assistance allowances\n            will also be provided. This framework stipulates the\n            entitlement policy, including full, and partial\n            resettlement, and the institutional arrangements, in\n            accordance with the consultations with PAPs."}, "docdt": "2002-05-02T14:43:00Z"}
