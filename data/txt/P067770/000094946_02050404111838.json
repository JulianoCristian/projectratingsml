The social assessment\n            argues the project does not create conditions by which\n            ethnic minorities will benefit from the development process,\n            nor does any legal, or practical difference exist in the\n            entitlement of, or access by different ethnic groups to\n            natural resources. For this reason, rather than an\n            indigenous peoples plan, this EMDS is seemingly a more\n            appropriate instrument to benefit ethnic minorities. The\n            EMDS is based on the legal framework of the Constitution of\n            Mongolia, which stipulates the principles that all citizens\n            have equal rights, and on the policies of the Bank on\n            indigenous peoples. Under the Local Initiative Fund\n            component, particular flexibility will be allowed for ethnic\n            minorities. Areas for support will be on women's health\n            to reduce the high maternal mortality rates, in particular\n            among Kazakh minorities - an issue to be explored further,\n            since it is contradictory to the low infant mortality rates;\n            and, on education, and the medium of instruction - up to the\n            secondary level, instruction is in Kazakh language, a\n            conflicting issue upon accessing higher education, for the\n            official prevailing, language is Mongolian. Information\n            dissemination programs will be established, and, capacity\n            building, and training carefully planned, and monitored.\n            Summaries of the Resettlement Policy Framework, and Ethnic\n            Minorities Development Strategy are included in Vol. 2."}, "docdt": "2002-05-02T16:42:03Z"}
