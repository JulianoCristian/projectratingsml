The project will bring an effective approach to\n            promoting improved, secured, and sustainable livelihood\n            strategies developed, demonstrated, and validated in\n            selected areas, and institutional capacity created so that\n            these strategies can be replicated and scaled-up in the\n            second phase of the Program. The project consists of four\n            components: 1) Pastoral risk management will reduce the\n            vulnerability of herders and enhance their resilience to\n            drought, dzud (winter disasters), and other shocks through\n            risk forecasting and contingency planning, grazing and\n            pasture management, herder self-help initiatives, and hay\n            and fodder enterprise development. 2) Micro-finance outreach\n            will provide micro-finance services to targeted poor and\n            vulnerable non-poor households and individual achieved in\n            remote rural areas of the eight core aimags through the\n            creation of a micro-financed development fund and the\n            strengthening of revolving loan funds. 3) Local initiatives\n            fund will establish effective mechanisms by which all\n            members of the targeted communities can come together to\n            identify their key infrastructure development needs and\n            prioritize them for potential sub-project financing. 4)\n            Project management will build on existing program management\n            structure for project implementation."}, "docdt": "2002-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
