Sustainable Livelihoods\n            Project for Mongolia are as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory, risk to the development outcome was Moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also rated as satisfactory. Some of the\n            lessons learned included: 1) subsidized credit and credit\n            delivered through non-financial institutions is not a\n            sustainable approach to rural finance and innovation. The\n            project design included three approaches to providing credit\n            in rural areas: (i) subsidized credit under the Pastoral\n            Risk Management (PRM) component; (ii) credit offered on\n            commercial terms under the Micro-Finance Development Fund\n            (MDF); and (iii) Revolving Loan Fund (RLFs) operated by\n            local authorities. Of these three approaches, only the MDF\n            approach proved viable and sustainable. The performance of\n            the subsidized credit and the RLFs was weak, the former\n            having low repayment rates and weak administration and the\n            latter dropped from the project due to weak performance; 2)\n            fostering community participation is a continuous on-going\n            task that requires explicit attention and resources; and 3)\n            information on project implementation and outcomes,\n            increasing public awareness of the project, and a strong\n            communications strategy are essential for successful\n            implementation. Project implementation was occasionally held\n            back by a lack of understanding of the project's\n            objectives and approach. Even though a monitoring and\n            evaluation system was established under the project, more\n            attention could have been provided to presenting and\n            disseminating information to a range of audiences, including\n            the beneficiary communities, the general public and\n            non-governmental organizations, Government and\n            Parliamentarians and other interested parties."}, "docdt": "2008-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
