1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country, Political and Economic background. The Republic of Madagascar is the fourth-
largest island in the world. Until the late 18th century, Madagascar was ruled by a fragmented
assortment of shifting socio-political alliances and by the early 19th century, most of the island
was united and ruled as the Kingdom of Madagascar. The monarchy collapsed in 1897 and the
island was absorbed into the French colonial empire. Since Madagascar gained independence from
France in 1960, the country witnessed a significant downturn, with real per capita Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) declining by over 25% during the last four decades to US$290 in 2005, at the time
of project appraisal. Caused in part by inward looking, highly protectionist policies and poor
governance, this economic outcome resulted in significant deterioration of physical and human
capital. The country also went through several political transitions marked by numerous popular
protests, several disputed elections, impeachments, two military coups and one assassination. In
fact, since the early 1990s, the country experienced three separate political crises, in 1991, 2002
and 2009. In 1991, after contested elections in 1989 and subsequent violent protests, International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank assistance was suspended. Conditions for the resumption
of aid were not met until the President was impeached and an interim government established later
that year. In 2001, another political crisis lasted for eight months leading to an economic downturn,
with GDP declining by 13%, costing Madagascar millions of dollars in lost tourism and trade
revenue as well as damage to infrastructure.

The negative economic impact of the 2001 crisis was gradually overcome through progressive
economic and political policies. GDP growth rebounded, reaching 9.8% in 2003, and the economy
continued to grow at 5% per year for the next several years. Similarly, progress was made to
reduce poverty, which declined to 66% from its peak level of 80% at the time of the 2002 crisis.
Having met a set of stringent economic, governance and human rights criteria, Madagascar became
the first country to benefit from the Millennium Challenge Account in 2005 and the IMF agreed
to write off half of Madagascar's debt in 2004. However, in the latter half of his second term,
President Ravalomanana was criticized for his increasing authoritarianism and that benefits from
his policies were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the
increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the
middle class.

Despite this marked economic recovery under Ravalomanana, Madagascar was still among the
world's poorest countries. Compounding this, 2004 (start of project preparation), was marked by
exogenous shocks including two cyclones, a sharp depreciation of the exchange rate and a 27%
inflation rate (although it declined to 10% by 2006). At the time of project appraisal in 2005, the
population of Madagascar was estimated at roughly 18 million, 70% of which was rural, (77% of
the rural population living in poverty as compared with 44% of urban inhabitants in 2001). The
main reasons for persisting poverty and low levels of development included: (i) lingering effects
of the kleptocratic rule which prevailed under Ratsiraka (during that period, GDP per capita
decreased by 40%), (ii) an economy mostly tied to resource extraction, (iii) lacking infrastructure
(10% of roads paved), (iv) geographic isolation, (v) relatively small population to incentivize the
development of foreign trade, (vi) generally poor education outcomes, and (vii) environmental

                                                 1
degradation of 90% of Madagascar's forests while 25-30% of the country burned every year from
agricultural fires. Soil erosion was and continues to rob the country's agricultural capacity and
further impoverish rural populations. In sum, since independence, Madagascar has experienced
continuous cyclical fragility as a result of political and economic crises and exogenous shocks.

Health sector outcomes. Progress was made to improve health services and outcomes in the two
decades preceding project appraisal. Child immunization rates against such diseases as hepatitis
B, diphtheria and measles significantly improved (60% increase in 20 years) indicating low but
increasing availability of basic medical services and treatments. The number of births assisted by
skilled medical personnel had increased although the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was still
extremely high at roughly 530 per 100,000 births in 2005 (DHS). Infant and child mortality rates
had declined significantly by mid-2000s. Between 1990 and 2004, under-five mortality rate
declined from 166 per 1,000 live births to 94, on target to achieve 47 by 2015 (MDG goal). Infant
mortality rate (IMR) was 58 in 2004 vs. 102 in 1990. While short term malnutrition had decreased,
children continued to face a significant morbidity risk due to poor nutrition, with 50% of under-
five being stunted due to chronic malnutrition.

Despite progress made, access to quality medical care remained beyond the reach of many.
Improving health outcomes became a key goal of the second-generation poverty reduction strategy,
the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP), 2007-2011, which set very ambitious targets in the areas of
maternal and child mortality, fertility rate, malaria, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases and
HIV/AIDS prevention, and reduction of malnutrition in children under the age of five. In line with
the MAP, the health sector strategy formulated by the Ministry of Health, Family Planning and
Social Protection (MOH) in the Plan de Développement du Secteur Santé (PDSS), identified a
number of key bottlenecks to increased access and use of health services and improvements in
health indicators in Madagascar: (i) poorly equipped health centers and low levels of capacity to
produce and deliver health services, especially in rural and remote areas and weak managerial
capacity at the level of communes; (ii) inadequate and uneven staffing of health facilities,
especially in rural and remote areas; (iii) low levels of health financing and inefficiencies in
resource allocation (Madagascar spent around US$6 per capita on health care in 2005, significantly
lower than the average for sub-Saharan Africa, excluding South Africa, of US$15.4 per capita);
and (iv) inadequate demand for health services and low levels of utilization (only 10 percent of the
population reports an illness annually, and of this, only 40 percent seeks care from qualified
medical personnel).

Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS. Madagascar’s rates of STIs, a key risk
factor and contributor to the spread of HIV/AIDS, were and remain among the highest in the world.
A 2000 study of 1,000 sex workers in two regions revealed that 82% had at least one STI. Syphilis
among pregnant women was 14.8% in 1998 and was reduced to 6% by 2003 (DHS 2003-2004)
but remained high among sex workers at 16.6% in 2005 (it was as high as 35% in some regions in
1998). The 2003-2004 DHS found active syphilis prevalence was 6.3% among adults aged 15-49.
As mentioned above, the quality of health services remained poor, with frequent interruptions in
the supply of basic medicines affecting the ability to diagnose and treat STIs.
HIV/AIDS was first diagnosed in Madagascar in 1987, but unlike many other Sub-Saharan African
nations, the HIV prevalence has remained under 1% despite high rates of STIs. The epidemic was
mainly concentrated within high-risk and vulnerable groups such as sex workers, truck drivers,

                                                  2
uniformed personnel, and youths, and is concentrated in particularly vulnerable communes judged
to be at high-risk of sexual transmitted infections (PLACE study 2003). These include areas
around mines, meeting places such as cattle/zebu markets, tourist sites, ports, train stations,
airports, alcohol sale sites, etc.

In 2005, HIV prevalence was estimated at 0.7% (UNAIDS) of the adult population. In pregnant
women, HIV prevalence was 1.1% according to a 2003 survey study (corrected in 2005 to 0.95%).
Among STI patients, HIV prevalence increased from 0% in 1999 to 0.58% in 2005, and among
sex workers, from 0% in 1996, 0.25% in 1998, and to 1.3% by 2005. The 2005 Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) noted that the apparent paradox between high STIs and low HIV prevalence
may be due to: (i) relatively low herpes prevalence, (ii) generalized circumcision, (iii) limited
transport infrastructure, and (iv) the island’s isolation, although this factor has and continues to be
questioned. While these factors certainly play a role, the large discrepancy between high STI rates
and low HIV prevalence rates is still not entirely clear today.

This paradox is further complicated by persistently low levels of knowledge about HIV/AIDS and
very high risk behaviors among the general population, particularly among the highest-risk group
categories such as sex workers, military, youth, IDUs and MSM. 2005 data shows that only 19.4%
of males and 15.7% of females (respondents aged 15-24) could correctly identify ways of
preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and reject major misconceptions about HIV
transmission and prevention. The same data shows that 66% of youths (15-24), 50% of sex workers,
48% of military, and 52% of truckers could cite three methods of HIV/AIDS prevention. Among
the youths (15-24), roughly 8% claimed they had received an HIV test and knew their result.
Almost 50% of sex workers claimed they were tested and knew their result (2006 data).

Meanwhile, risky behaviors among high-risk groups included early initiation of sex, simultaneous
multiple partners, and unprotected sex. For example, condom use was extremely low in 2005
despite distribution of 32 million condoms and intensive promotion of condom use through mass
media campaigns and sub-projects carried out under the first International Development
Association (IDA) supported HIV/AIDS project (MSPPI) which was implemented between 2001
and 2007. In the general population (15-49 age group), only 4.6% of males and 13.1% of females
reported using condoms the last time they had sex. In the same age group, 38% of males and 16.8%
of females (as reported in the 2004 DHS) reported having sex with a non-regular partner in the last
12 months. Only 5.4% of females and 12% of males (aged 15-24), 54% of truckers, and 56% of
military reported the use of a condom in their last act of sexual intercourse with a non-regular
partner in the last 12 months. In 2005 (ESC), 76% of sex workers reported the use of a condom in
their last act of sexual intercourse with a client.

The country’s low levels of knowledge about HIV/AIDS and high-risk behaviors were reflected
in an extremely high prevalence of stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS
(PLWHA). The DHS 2005 data showed that 94% of women (ages 15-49) and 87% of males (15-
49) reported discriminatory attitudes towards PLWHA. Notably, these rates are similar (and even
more alarming than those in some of the neighboring African countries; e.g. in South Africa, 37%
reported having accepting attitudes toward PLWHA (defined as a composite of 4 indicators - 2003
DHS). Likewise, in Tanzania, only 27.2% of women and 36.7% of men had accepting attitudes
towards PLWHA (HIV indicator survey 2003-2004).

Government strategy to fight HIV/AIDS: At the time of appraisal, The Government of
Madagascar (GOM), at the highest level, was deeply committed to curbing the spread of
STI/HIV/AIDS. President Marc Ravalomanana personally spearheaded the national response to
the epidemic. At the end of 2002, he established the National AIDS Committee (Comité National
de Lutte Contre le SIDA – CNLS) and appointed an Executive Secretariat (ES) to coordinate the
implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Program. Under the President’s leadership, the ES
mobilized public opinion and worked closely with non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
community-based organizations (CBOs) and church groups to ensure that HIV/AIDS awareness
was created at the community level, with active support for the promotion of condoms. In line
with the UNAIDS “The Three Ones” principle, the GOM adopted a National Strategic Plan for
HIV/AIDS (NSP) (2001-2006), one single Monitoring and Evaluation Plan, and a National
HIV/AIDS Communication Strategy, which had two key pillars: (i) media campaigns focusing on
the general population; and (ii) targeted community-level communication to affect behavior
change and reduce stigma. A thematic group, made up of the representatives from the UN agencies
and the World Bank, was established under the auspices of UNAIDS to advise the GOM on
developing and implementing the response to the epidemic. All HIV/AIDS related activities
undertaken by donors and other development partners were consistent with this NSP.

Rationale for Bank Assistance: Support for the Second Multi-sectoral STI/HIV/AIDS Project
(MSPPII), approved in 2005 and the Additional Financing for health, nutrition and STI/HIV/AIDS
activities approved in 2012, need to be seen as part of the broader continuous effort by the World
Bank and the entire development community to improve Madagascar’s health and nutrition
outcomes as well as to curb the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The Bank had supported these sectors
through a number of health specific and multi-sectoral projects as well as continuous policy and
program dialogue. These included the Health Sector Improvement Project (1991-1999) and the
follow-on Second Health Sector Support Project (1999-2007). These projects supported the
improvement of the population's health status through more accessible and better quality of health
services, especially primary health care services in rural areas. The second project received a
supplemental credit of US$18 million in May 2005 to support priority health programs (with an
emphasis on endemic infectious diseases, reproductive health and nutrition) and to strengthen
health sector management and administrative capacity within MOH, especially at provincial and
district levels. This was followed by a third project - Sustainable Health Systems Development
project, US$10 million (2007-2009). During this time, the Bank provided support to the MOH to
transition to a pooled financing arrangement and a sector-wide approach with the signature of the
International Health Partnership Compact between the GOM and 22 development partners in 2008.
The Bank also supported two nutrition projects, the Food Security and Nutrition, US$21.3 million
(1993-1998) and the Second Community Nutrition Project, US$47.6 million (1998-2011). All of
these operations were successfully implemented and rated as Satisfactory in their final evaluations
and confirmed as such by the World Bank Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). Currently, the
Bank is also financing the Emergency Support to Critical Education, Health and Nutrition Services
Project, US$65 million and US$10 million Additional Financing which ends in July 2016.

From 1999-2007, the Bank financed the first Multi-sectoral STI/HIV/AIDS Project (MSPPI),
US$20 million. The rationale to support the follow-on MSPPII by the Bank was mainly to ensure
the continuation of the efforts made under the MSPPI and to help mobilize the needed resources


                                                4
for the NSP at the urgent request of Government. In 2005, the Global Fund just began its efforts
by financing US$6.3 million under Round 2 (2004-2007), to complement financing for HIV/AIDS
testing and treatment. Therefore, the Bank’s US$30 million support to MSPPII was critical to the
program in order to continue and reinforce efforts already made as well as to expand support for
STI control, care of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and more intensive targeting of
prevention measures to high-risk groups. Indeed, the Bank’s financing also had the advantage of
needed flexibility to finance activities, including treatment, as a donor of last resort, if and when
there were gaps in the program financing. Lastly, the Bank was also uniquely positioned to share
its cross-country experiences in the design, implementation and evaluation of the Bank’s Multi-
country AIDS Programs (MAP). By 2005, the Interim Review of the MAP was completed and
the Bank team was able to introduce some of the lessons of the review into the design of the project,
namely the high cost-effectiveness of prevention interventions focused on high risk groups.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The MSPPII's development objectives were the same as those of the first project (MSPPI). Those
objectives are “to support the Government of Madagascar’s efforts to promote a multi-sectoral
response to the HIV/AIDS crisis and to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS on its territory.”

Even though the official objective in the legal agreement and in all internal Bank documents
remained as stated above, it is important to note that the PAD elaborated in the paragraph directly
under the PDO statement that the project was a departure from the first project because it would
also provide support for increased access to medical and non-medical care for PLWHA and that it
would put a stronger emphasis on at-risk groups in high prevalence areas (highly vulnerable
communes). 1

The key performance indicators are presented in the ICR Datasheet, above, and marked whether
they were “original,” “revised” or “new”. Section 2.3 on Monitoring and Evaluation below
provides a detailed description of the Results Framework, including the changes introduced during
the project.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The December 2011 Level 2 restructuring revised the Results Framework substantially (see
Section 2.3); meanwhile, the PDO remained the same.



1
  These communes were to be identified through a “PLACE” study in 2005 based on a PLACE pilot which
was carried out in May 2003. This method used ethnographic and contextual data rather than blood testing
to identify areas judged be at high-risk of sexual transmitted infections, such as mines, cattle markets, tourist
spots, ports, etc.). The preparation of the 2005 PLACE study was ongoing at the time of Board submission
of this project, as reflected in the PAD.




                                                       5
The Additional Financing (AF), approved on June 14, 2012, changed the PDO: “To increase
utilization of STI/HIV/AIDS, and maternal and child health, nutrition services in project areas.”
The AF also revised the Results Framework again to reflect the new PDO and new and revised
activities under the AF. This is further detailed in Section 2.3 below.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

This second multi-sectoral STI/HIV/AIDS project was to intensify and build capacity of key
government institutions dedicated to combatting HIV/AIDS to carry out the national response to
HIV/AIDS and STIs, a key risk factor for and contributor to the spread of HIV/AIDS. Therefore,
the beneficiaries were to be those institutions and the population of Madagascar (the 15-49 age
group). However, given the worrisome epidemiological situation at appraisal, the project was to
put an even stronger focus than the original project on activities for at-risk groups in high
prevalence areas. This meant a focus on 15-24 youth, sex workers, truckers, and the members of
the military. The project was also to expand services to other affected groups (e.g., orphans and
other vulnerable children). Lastly, the project was to improve the quality of life of persons living
with HIV/AIDS through increased access to quality medical care and to non-medical support
services.

Under the Additional Financing, the main beneficiaries were to be pregnant/lactating women and
young children who would benefit from nutrition and health services, in addition to the 15-24
youth and sex workers who would benefit from HIV/AIDS interventions.

1.5 Original Components

Component 1: Harmonization, donor coordination and strategies (US$1.5 million). This
component included: (i) Development of mechanisms for coordinating donor activities in the
Sector to ensure better impact and cost-efficiency of HIV/AIDS interventions; (ii) Reviewing and
updating the National Strategic HIV/AIDS Plan (2001-2006); (iii) Implementation of
STI/HIV/AIDS communication strategy and action plan through carrying out of mass media
information campaigns and supporting NGOs and CBOs with communication materials and
toolkits to implement grass-root communication sub-projects; and (iv) Financing of Sector
strategies and action plans in each of the Sectors (limited to 2-3) which focus on high-risk groups
and which have been found to be most effective (through the “impact effectiveness” assessment
supported under the component). Institutionalization of the relationship with the various sectors
would be supported (e.g. periodic working groups, participation in strategic decisions, such as the
revision of the NSP).

Component 2: Support for health sector response (US$3.5 million). This component
complemented funding to the health sector provided under the Second Health Sector Support
(SHSS) project (US$40 million) that was approved in 1999 and received AF US$22 million in
2006. The SHSS closed on December 31, 2007. This component was to provide a stronger role
for the health sector in combatting STI/HIV/AIDS, specifically: (i) support for STI control through
improved training on a syndromic approach and financing STI kits; (ii) support for care and
treatment of PLWHA through expansion of Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) centers in
all 111 district hospitals and health centers in high-risk areas, psycho-social, nutritional and other

                                                  6
support, and financing Antiretrovirals (ARVs) (complementing funding of ARVs by the Global
Fund) and drugs for opportunistic infections, and prevention of MTCT; and (iii) other health sector
activities such as support for the establishment of laboratories, blood transfusion centers,
installation of incinerators, training of staff and medical waste management.

Component 3: Fund for STI/HIV/AIDS prevention and care-taking activities (FAP)
(US$16.5 million). This component was to continue to support the FAP established under the
MSPPI but reoriented its focus on places where the population was at the greatest risk of being
infected (75% of the FAP funds were to be allocated to these high-risk areas). The FAP was to
finance Grants to support STI/HIV/AIDS prevention sub-projects undertaken by the private sector,
civil society and not-for-profit organizations, including: (i) condom distribution; (ii) grassroots
communication activities that shift focus from general knowledge to behavioral communication
for change; (iii) home-base care and other support for PLWHA; (iv) programs for orphans and
vulnerable children; (v) activities with at-risk groups to increase their demand for HIV/AIDS
services, (vi) training of peer educators and community-based counselors, (vii) activities that aim
at reducing stigma and discrimination against PLWA; and (viii) workplace HIV/AIDS plans for
the public sector. This component was also to finance the management and operation of the FAP.

Component 4: Monitoring and Evaluation (US$2.9 million). This component was to support
the national Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) plan through a single M&E system, specifically:
(i) the development of a management information system (MIS) to generate and collect key
performance indicators data, financial data, input and operational data for the project; (ii) track the
evolving status of the epidemic by carrying out epidemiological surveys (second generation
surveillance), including annual behavioral surveys among high-risk groups to measure behavioral
change and knowledge, and sentinel surveillance surveys of clients at antenatal clinics (pregnant
women, STI patients, and SWs), as well as special purpose studies on specific target groups; and
(iii) carry out impact studies to inform the course of the epidemic and any required reorientations
in the National HIV/AIDS program.

Component 5: Project Management and capacity building (US$2.5 million). This component
was to support the institutional and operational modalities established under MSPPI at the central
level (CNLS, MSPPII Council and UGP) and new structures established at the regional level
(BCR), following the creation of regions in 2004. This component was to finance staff, equipment
and operating costs at each level of implementation as well as technical assistance and training
based on annual capacity building plans.

1.6 Revised Components

The components were revised twice, during the December 2011 restructuring and during the 2012
Additional Financing, as follows:

December 28, 2011 Level 2 restructuring: This restructuring was actually planned since 2008
and most of the elements were outlined in an in-depth Midterm Review (MTR) Report in
December 2008; the review recommended a number of changes (discussed in detail below in
Section 2.2), including changes to components. The changes were meant to be formalized in a
restructuring paper soon after the MTR but this was not possible due to the political crisis which

                                                  7
ensued at the start of 2009 preventing Bank staff to interact with any ministerial appointee. At that
time, as a result of the political crisis, the Bank suspended the entire Madagascar portfolio and
only lifted the suspension in 2011 (formally approved by the Bank’s senior management) which
subsequently allowed for the preparation of the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) and for the portfolio
to be restructured. This also allowed for projects such as this one to be restructured. Hence, the
official project restructuring took place only in December 2011. Nonetheless, practically most of
the changes were in fact put in place by late 2009/early 2010 (when the project suspension was
lifted for Components 2, 4 and 5 on humanitarian grounds). In other words, the project needs to
be considered as de facto restructured as of early 2010 albeit legally the changes were only
recorded in December 2011. This restructuring introduced the following changes to project
components to improve their overall effectiveness:

   Component 1: completed and closed at the end of 2008.

   Component 2: The total estimated cost of this component more than tripled from US$3.5
   million to US$12.5 million in order to further strengthen the health sector response particularly
   affected by the political crisis and its aftermath. Specifically, the component was expanded to
   finance: (i) additional support for STI control through improved training, and acquisition and
   distribution of laboratory and testing equipment, condoms, in addition to STI kits; (ii) support
   for care and treatment of PLWHA through expansion of VCT centers in district hospitals and
   health centers, acquisition of laboratory and testing equipment and ARVs, acquisition and
   distribution of diagnostic tools and drugs for prevention of MTCT and treatment of
   opportunistic infections, and training of health personnel; (iii) other health sector activities
   such as support for the establishment of laboratories, blood transfusion centers, installation of
   incinerators, training of staff and medical waste management; and (iv) contracting NGOs using
   performance-based contracts to support the provision of package of health and related services
   targeting most-at-risk groups (sex workers, military and youth) and PLWHA, including STI
   and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment activities.

   Component 3: This component was dropped from the project, reserving US$7.4 million to
   finance activities carried out prior to restructuring. It was essentially replaced by Component
   2 as the FAP activities proved to be less effective at targeting highest at-risk groups and also
   suffered from governance issues which came to light through a 2008 Special Audit. The audit
   revealed US$745,569.36 in ineligible expenditures which the Government had to return (see
   implementation section below).

   Component 4: This component was increased by US$1.4 million to a total of US$4.3 million
   to reflect even greater support to information systems, surveys and strengthening internal and
   external verification mechanisms. Specifically, in order to enhance the overall evidence base
   of the epidemic, and to improve the use of program data for decision-making, three additional
   studies were to be financed: (i) Enquête Comportementale et Biologique to measure outcome
   level indicators; (ii) Study on Chemo – sensibility to antibiotics; and (iii) Etude sur la stratégie
   de prise en charge des infections sexuellement transmissible to provide information on
   developing future approaches to combatting HIV/AIDS.




                                                  8
   Component 5: This component was increased by US$1.5 million to a total of US$4 million,
   as presented in the restructuring paper. This increase reflected the need to finance operating
   costs associated with the extension of the project Closing Date by one year and to make up for
   the short-fall in financing since the original funds were meant to last only until 2009 (original
   closing date).

Additional Financing June 2012: The AF provided (approved June 14, 2012) US$6 million to
mainly further increase support for the Health Sector Response, under Component 2, by expanding
financing to health service providers to strengthen their capacity in the provision of maternal and
child health services as well as nutrition services at facility level in a selected number of poorest
districts in 5 regions. This was meant to bridge the gap in the Bank’s support for the health sector
in a context of severely constrained resources at a time when Bank financing for a health project
was not yet available. The ongoing Emergency Support to Education, Health and Nutrition Project
was only approved on November 29, 2012 and is building on previous interventions as well as on
work carried out under MSSPII’s AF. The AF also continued the financing of HIV and STI-related
interventions, focusing on testing, treatment and Behavior Change and Communication (BCC) for
high-risk groups (sex workers, military and youth) using performance-based contracts with NGOs.

Component 2 now included additional US$5.18 million for the following specific activities:
  (i) Integrated package for pregnant women at facility level (US$1.28 million) during
  antenatal consultations, including: prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT),
  tracking and treatment of syphilis, supplementation of iron and folic acid, tetanus vaccinations,
  intermittent preventive medication against malaria, and distribution of impregnated mosquito
  nets.
   (ii) Integrated package for children under five at facility level (US$0.18 million):
   Promotion of good practices and breastfeeding and nutrition for mothers and children, Vitamin
   A supplementation, vaccinations, distribution of impregnated mosquito nets, treatment of
   diarrhea with oral rehydration salts and zinc, prevention and treatment of malaria, and
   integrated treatment of childhood diseases (IMCI).
   (iii) Support to Health and Nutrition services at community level (US$1.44 million):
   Provision of nutrition inputs, recruitment of NGOs to support community nutrition sites, and
   support to community workers for nutrition assigned to Community-based Nutrition Program
   sites in Fokontany, in an effort to enhance their skills in awareness raising and counseling,
   referrals of malnourished children, weighing, and culinary demonstrations.
   (iv) Support for HIV/STI prevention among the most-at-risk population (US$1.42
   million): Continued support to at-risk populations, including professional sex workers, military
   and youth between ages 15-24 in BCC, distribution of condoms and VCT. Syphilis test and
   consumables for pregnant women would also be provided.
   (v) Improving quality of treatment to PLWHA (US$0.56 million): Support for operational
   costs of treatment centers for PLWHAs and of associations engaged in psychosocial treatment.
   (vi) Continued support for implementation of Medical Waste Management Plan
   (US$0.15 million): including supervision and maintenance of incinerators.


                                                 9
   (vii) Design and implementation of a results-based financing pilot (US$0.15 million): in
   a few districts, to support health service delivery at health facility and community levels.
Component 4: Monitoring and Evaluation (US$0.42 million): This component was to continue
to fund original activities as well as the following additional activities:
    1. Monitoring and Supervision (US$0.71 million): This was to include (i) putting in place
        an information system to rapidly collect data for monitoring of project activities; and (ii)
        provision of mobile phones to Basic Health Centers and community health workers to
        facilitate reporting and communication.
    2. Evaluation (US$0.35 million): This was to include: (i) continued support for the
        Independent Verification Agency to evaluate progress of implementing NGOs in health,
        nutrition and HIV/AIDS; (ii) execution of second surveillance study; and (iii) final
        evaluation of the Project.

Component 5: Project Management and Capacity Building (US$0.40 million): This
component was to continue to provide support for technical supervision by the PIU and relevant
functions within the MOH related to project activities, including the SE and the CNLS.

   1.7 Other significant changes

In addition to the revisions discussed above, the following changes were made during the project’s
implementation:

1. Suspension of Bank’s portfolio (March 17, 2009) subject to OB/BP 7.30 Dealing with a De
   Facto Governments, whereby all applications for replenishment of Designated Accounts were
   put on hold. As of November 10, 2009, disbursements for key projects in Madagascar,
   including for Component 2, 4 and 5 of this project were allowed to resume on an exceptional
   basis for humanitarian reasons.
2. Extension of the Closing Date (letter dated December 29, 2009) by 24 months until December
   31, 2011 in order to ensure the completion of project activities due to early delays in
   implementation and delays caused by the 2009 political crisis.
3. Change in implementation arrangements was made following recommendations in the
   December 2008 MTR to refocus the role of the Executive Secretariat (ES) of the CNLS vis-à-
   vis the project. In early 2010, the responsibility for project implementation shifted from the
   ES/CNLS PIU (which managed funds by the Global Fund, Agence Française de
   Développement and resource from the Government of Monaco to the Ministry of Health PIU
   which had the required capacity given its involvement in the implementation of several Bank
   supported health projects.
4. Level 2 restructuring approved on December 28, 2011 (Amendment to the Development Credit
   Agreement, dated February 15, 2012) to extend the Closing Date by an additional 12 months
   until December 31, 2012 to complete implementation of activities delayed due to the political
   crisis under a new component structure (discussed above), to change the Results Framework,
   and to reallocate funds across different expenditure categories. (see table below)
5. Cancellation of SDR 604,607.58 from the original Credit (letter dated June 25, 2013) which
   represents an unspent amount from the original Credit.



                                                10
 6. Additional Financing was approved on June 14, 2012 and became effective February 22, 2013,
    revising the PDO, adding funds for new and revised activities, and changing the Results
    Framework.
 7. Level 2 restructuring approved on August 5, 2014 (July 24, 2014 restructuring paper) to change
    indicator baselines and targets to more appropriately reflect the effective start date of the AF
    and to reallocate funds under the Additional Financing Credit to ensure the financing of the
    Results-based financing (RBF) pilot. (See table below).

 2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

 2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

 Timing of preparation: The second Multi-sectoral STI/HIV/AIDS Prevention Project (MSPPII)
 financed by an IDA Credit of US$30 million was prepared just under 6 months (from Project
 Concept in February 22, 2005 to Board approval on July 12, 2005) as a repeater operation of
 MSPPI which was a US$20 million IDA Credit approved on December 14, 2001 and still under
 implementation when MSPPII was approved. In fact, the preparation of the follow-on project was
 undertaken jointly with the MTR of the first project in December 2004. At that time, there was a
 strong Government commitment and demand for this repeater operation, with the original
 Government request being US$10 million higher than what was subsequently approved. The
 ES/CNLS estimated that even with the Global Fund contribution of US$6.3 million (2004-2007)
 and the expected contribution of US$9 million from the AfDB (2005-2007), there would be a
 financing gap of US$31 million to finance the necessary activities until the end of 2007. The MTR
 confirmed that there was indeed an urgent need to prepare the second project, estimating that the
                                                  11
first project would be fully disbursed by December 2005. At MTR, the total disbursements for the
first project were only 54% and the Closing Date was December 31, 2006. Although questions
about the realism of the plan to fully disburse the remaining 46% of project funds in 1 year were
raised at the February 2005 PCN meeting for MSSPII, the team replied that the majority of these
funds were already committed and reinforced the Government’s request to prepare the project
urgently. This was confirmed by this ICR in discussions with the Task Team Leader at that time.
The minutes of the February 2005 PCN meeting reflect full agreement by the meeting’s chair to
proceed with a very tight preparation timetable, scheduling appraisal within 2 weeks of the PCN,
in March 2005. Actual appraisal took place in April, with negotiations in June and approval in
July 2005.

Lessons: The design of this repeater project, could therefore only rely on the lessons reflected in
the 2004 MTR of the first project. Some of the lessons were subsequently also endorsed in the
MSPPI ICR completed three years later, in June 2008 (MSPPI was actually extended for a year
until December 31, 2007 due to implementation delays as well as a change in the project’s
orientation towards smaller sub-projects implemented by CBOs). The MTR lessons included,
inter alia, the: (i) need to focus on high risk groups given the low prevalence of the epidemic, and
more emphasis on financing sensitive HIV surveillance surveys; (ii) lack of a uniform system of
monitoring indicators among donors and by CNLS, requiring a better coordination and
harmonization mechanism and strategy for better use of data for decision making; (iii) inadequate
counterpart funding to support project activities; (iv) the need to develop a national
communications strategy; (v) the need to strengthen project implementation arrangements; (vi) the
need for a stronger and more direct health sector involvement in the management of the response;
and (vii) the need to improve the quality of medical care and non-medical support services for
PLWHA by financing a more comprehensive approach to addressing HIV/AIDS, through
prevention, care and treatment.

Project design: While many of these important lessons were taken into account in the design of
the MSPPII, as clearly visible in the structure of the components (see above), several key elements
of the design could have likely benefitted from a more thorough appraisal. First, the PDO was
kept the same as the first project, and while broadly consistent with the overall National Program
objectives and the thrust of the project, the PDO did not reflect the important changes envisioned
by the second operation, i.e. a much greater emphasis on targeting high risk groups through a
comprehensive approach to the epidemic, including a greater role for the health sector. The focus
on targeting high-risk groups was mentioned in a supporting paragraph of the PDO, but was not
reflected in the main PDO statement, nor was it included in the legal agreement and in subsequent
project documents. The decision to retain the same PDO may have been a simple reflection of the
need to demonstrate continued support to Madagascar’s efforts in the fight against HIV/AIDS.
However, in retrospect, this reflected an old strategy adopted under the first project which did not
prove to be effective because most of the effort was focused on the general population and was not
targeted (the MSPPI was downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory for outcome by the World
Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group mainly due to its limited ability to target high-risk groups
and affect behavior change among high-risk populations most exposed to the risks of transmission).

Secondly, the MSSPII’s intention, as presented in the PAD, was to re-orient a larger volume of
financing toward high-impact activities in a much more limited geographic area, focused on high-


                                                12
risk communities. In fact, the PAD mentions that the project would undertake a demographic and
epidemiological profile to identify “hot” spots. In addition, the PAD mentions that a cost-
effectiveness analysis would be undertaken to assess which of the eligible sub-project activities
are likely to be the most effective in changing knowledge and behavior in high-risk areas. These
pieces of critical analysis were clearly not completed during project preparation even though the
minutes of the PCN meeting specifically requested the team to carry out this work urgently. The
PAD does not include an economic analysis, and only refers to the general analysis carried out for
the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for the Africa Region as a whole. Instead of carrying out
more in-depth analyses, project preparation was done very quickly in 4.5 months (unnecessarily
in retrospect since the first project continued for another 2 years), and the repeater operation, like
the first project, essentially began continuing broad support for general information, education and
communication activities through CBOs and NGOs carrying out hundreds of projects throughout
the country. A more targeted approach was adopted in 2010 in response to the acknowledged
relative ineffectiveness of the originally designed project to target high-risk groups.

Implementation arrangements: A third area which likely required additional in-depth analysis
at preparation was the implementation arrangements; specifically, no review was carried out of
institutional/organizational arrangements and the roles of various parts of the structure and the
complex arrangements were not mentioned as a potential risk in the PAD at all. Instead, the same
arrangements developed under the first project were continued under the second project, and the
opportunity to revisit and revise these in view of the intended changed nature of the project was
lost; likely, it was not perceived to be necessary since the 2004 MTR of the first project noted that
these arrangements were carefully designed and seemed to be working. Interestingly, the PAD
did not say that these arrangements were complex and potentially inefficient and that only half of
the local structures established to support the Fund for STI/HIV/AIDS prevention and care taking
activities (FAP) were actually operational (this was pointed out in the ICR in 2008 that by the end
of the first project in 2007, this was the prevailing situation). The PAD questioned whether the
Project Implementation Unit (UGP) would have the capacity to re-orient the project activities to
target more at risk communities, but noted that this would be mitigated by having the review of
the “hot” spots carried out and the hiring of Facilitating Organizations (OFs) to help communities
develop local plans to fight HIV/AIDS and to help CBOs develop their applications for sub-project
financing. Later on, the 2008 MTR Issues paper for the second project, and the ICR for the first
project, clearly raised implementation arrangements as a major issue in delaying implementation
because of the multi-tier review process, as well as their inability to truly target areas of greatest
need. In fact, the 2008 MTR recommended an in-depth review of roles and responsibilitiES/CNLS,
as well as the actual suspension of Component 3 which supported the FAP.

2.2 Implementation

The project had a complex history, with many changes taking place, and was implemented for
more than 9 years since approval on July 12, 2005 to closure on September 30, 2014. This period
can be generally broken into five separate distinguishing reference points, each representing and
explaining key factors behind implementation progress and changes made during the course of the
project.




                                                 13
1. Delayed project start-up: While project effectiveness was originally expected in October
2005, it was delayed until January 5, 2006. Reasons cited for the effectiveness delay was the hiring
of project auditors. However, first disbursements under the project were not registered for another
year and a half, until mid-2007 (only an advance to the Special Account) and Bank ISRs report
limited progress mainly due to capacity weaknesses of the PIU in the ES/CNLS which was
challenged with coordinating the implementation of the HIV/AIDS program with multiple donors
and managing projects funded by five difference sources (Government budget, IDA project,
UNDP, GTZ and the Global Fund). Also, the focus was not so much on starting the new project,
but on the completion of the first project. As noted above, the risk of MSPPI not fully disbursing
by the end 2005 was pointed out during the Concept review meeting for MSPPII in early 2005 by
two peer reviewers and their caution unfortunately proved to be correct. In fact, the first project
needed to be extended until December 2007 to complete all activities (a 2 year delay from original
expectations at the time of preparation of MSPPII). In retrospect, neither the Government nor the
Bank adequately assessed the realism of completing implementation in 2005 which led to a
decision to rush the preparation of MSPPII (as the minutes of the Decision meeting suggest).

Following a 2-year period of limited progress, a number of the implementation and management
weaknesses started to be addressed and project disbursements rapidly increased, reaching US$12
million by December 2008. This Phase I saw a flurry of nation-wide prevention activities in 22
regions under Component 3 (targeting 761 communes of the total 1,549), with 2,817
communication and prevention sub-projects. During this time, the HIV testing was significantly
scaled up with the number of VCT centers increasing from 49 in 2004 to 779 by 2009.

During this early period of implementation, one issue emerged which required a substantial
amount of attention from both the Government and Bank teams, and its resolution lasted until the
end of 2012. This also affected the continuation of Component 3 and contributed to the subsequent
restructuring. During the October 2008 supervision mission, the Bank was informed by ES/CNLS
about allegations of corruption in the implementation of Component 3 - the Fund for Prevention
of STI/HIV/AIDS (FAP) in the regions of Diana and Sofia. On this basis, the Bank requested that
all further implementation of the FAP be suspended, and that contracts with the Financial
Management Agency (AGF), recruited to manage this Component, and the Facilitation
Organizations (OFs) be put on hold. A Special Audit was carried out by Ernst and Young and their
report presented in January 2009 identified that ineligible expenditures under Component 3 were
incurred as a result of inadequate book-keeping and accounting practices on the part of the CBOs
and weak supervision on the part of the AGF. The total US$745,569.36 of ineligible expenditures
took a considerable amount of time to agree on as it required a detailed review of all documentation.
In October 2010, the Bank sent the notification letter with the final calculated amount to the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) requesting a repayment schedule. In a letter on January 7, 2011, the
MOF proposed a repayment schedule through December 2013. Regrettably, due to internal
management decisions on the status of the Madagascar portfolio, the Bank was only able to
respond to the MOF 10 months later, in a letter dated October 17, 2011, requesting a revised
repayment schedule from the Government with the full amount to be repaid by the end of 2012.
In the meantime, in August 2011, the Government already made the first reimbursement tranche
totaling US$74,557 and proposed a revised schedule, complying with the Bank request. These
actions resulted in the Bank’s ability to upgrade the Financial Management (FM) rating of the
project to Moderately Satisfactory. These actions were critical as they enabled the Bank to obtain

                                                14
a policy exception from the Vice President of Operations Policy and Country Services (VP OPCS)
and the VP and Controller on December 22, 2011 necessary to approve the second extension of
the Closing Date which was required due to these outstanding ineligible expenditures. The total
amount was subsequently fully reimbursed by the GOM in November 2012 in accordance with a
repayment schedule agreed with the Bank, satisfying the Bank requirement that these ineligible
expenses needed to be returned by the Closing Date of the original project (December 31, 2012).
2. Mid-term Review (MTR). This joint review with Government was very participatory,
(including attendance by the President), and had the effect of significantly and positively impacting
on the future course of project implementation by laying out the issues impeding implementation
and recommending several key changes which were eventually made and improved
implementation effectiveness. In November 2008, the Bank team prepared a MTR Issues Paper,
analyzing roughly 2 years of implementation, to be used during the December 2008 MTR. At that
point, the project had disbursed US$12 million, representing 40% of the total Credit, with one year
to go before the original Closing Date. Following allegations of inappropriate use of funds which
emerged in October 2008 and the subsequent Special Audit, the Bank downgraded the rating for
Component 3 to Unsatisfactory and the overall rating for implementation progress to Moderately
Unsatisfactory. Against this general background, some of the main findings and recommendations
of the MTR were as follows:
    (a) Institutional/management issues: Program and project management by the ES/CNLS
    was found to be inefficient, with a complex top-down hierarchical organizational structure, a
    multitude of staff with unclear roles and mandates (resulting in high staff turn-over), lack of
    delegation, poor internal communications, ineffective program coordination with other sectors
    and partners because staff were busy managing donor funding, including for this project, and
    chronic implementation delays due to weak project management. The MTR recommended to:
    (i) clarify/rationalize the ES/CNLS mandate as the HIV/AIDS coordinating, monitoring and
    evaluation body to which all stakeholders in the HIV response are accountable; (ii) streamline
    ES/CNLS size and clarify staff roles and responsibilities; (iii) transfer the responsibility for the
    HIV/AIDS response to regions with greatest needs (8 priority regions were to pilot the new
    approach) in line with the Government’s decentralization policy; and (iv) separate the project
    management function from the ES/CNLS’s core responsibility for program oversight.

   (b) Implementation challenges of the Fund for STI/HIV/AIDS Prevention (FAP): This
   local response funding structure for sub-projects by CBOs and NGOs had a multi-tier complex
   review process with different entities responsible for reviewing proposals depending on their
   amount. Proposals over $100,000 were reviewed by the Project Council, proposals between
   $25,000-$100,000 were reviewed by a Technical Review Organization (ORT) based in the
   UNAIDS office, while small proposals over $3,000 were first reviewed by the Facilitating
   Organizations (OF) (one in each region) before the final review by ORT. The OFs were also
   responsible for helping CBOs to draft proposals. Lastly, a Financial Management Agency
   (AGF) was to approve the financial viability of proposals and make payments to CBOs and
   NGOs for approved sub-projects. Exacerbating this complex structure, the December 2008
   MTR found numerous problematic issues. Firstly, the 2008 institutional audit carried out
   before the MTR revealed that 50% of OFs (rehired by regions as part of the new decentralized
   approach) did not have the necessary capacity; this was not surprising given that most were
   only hired in April 2008 and did not receive training until September 2008. The revised
   Procedures Manual for the FAP was also only completed by October 2008. Secondly,

                                                  15
   exceedingly large numbers of applications approved were less than US$3,000, thus making it
   virtually impossible to carry out any evaluation of these and also raising the possibility of
   systemic avoidance of oversight. Thirdly, there were reports by local technical staff about
   some NGOs receiving funds without having undergone any reviews while other NGOs waited
   for months to get funds for approved proposals. Lastly, because the focus was so much on
   approvals and financing, little work was done to evaluate the actual results of these sub-projects.
   As mentioned above, the FAP was suspended before the MTR and remained as such until
   Component 3 was officially cancelled during the December 2011 restructuring. The MTR
   proposed that a new simpler mechanism at the regional level is used to target high-risk groups,
   with technical support in the regions to be provided by the Regional Coordination Unit in line
   with the Government’s decentralization approach. The ORT would be kept to review proposals
   after the regional review.

   (c) Other operational weaknesses were identified, as follows:
       (i)     Mixed response from an estimated of 10 originally envisaged sectors in the
       development of their sector strategies with four sectors, National Defense, Civil Service,
       Education and Health establishing and implementing their strategies. This response was
       due to lacking ownership from some sectors, lack of specificity in their plans which were
       subsequently rejected by the ES/CNLS, and structural changes within sectors. The result
       was that Component 1 which supported this work was declared closed after the MTR and
       all work except in the mentioned sectors was put on hold.
       (ii)    Disbursement delays for critical health sector activities underscored the need for
       greater implementation autonomy of MOH to enable effective acquisition of necessary
       health sector inputs for the diagnosis, ARV treatment, opportunistic infection treatment
       and nutritional support for AIDS patients. To correct this, a separate Special Account was
       opened by the PIU in the MOH so that the availability of funding would not be a constraint
       for the implementation of Component 2. The MTR noted that MOH needed capacity
       building both in terms of technical leadership and rational planning of inputs, such as drugs,
       test kits which experienced periodic stock-outs. To improve this situation, the MTR
       recommended stronger coordination with regional and district staff in the planning of
       inputs as well as improving the VCT strategy, including post-test counseling to ensure
       better results in the continuum of care, and improving access to screening by integrating
       VCT in the minimum package of basic health training and services.
       (iii) The MTR also found that there was insufficient use of M&E data for decision-
       making and delays in implementation of various surveys, particularly sentinel surveillance
       studies. The MTR recommendation was to intensify the work on surveys and thereby
       improve access, analysis, reliability and use of statistical data for decision making,
       especially data concerning key sectors which would allow them to integrate their efforts in
       a multi-sectoral approach to the national response on HIV/AIDS. The MTR also suggested
       to revise the RF of the project to better reflect the PDO and component activities.

As mentioned above, the intention following the MTR was to restructure the project in order to
streamline implementation and improve the chances for the project to meet its objectives.
Unfortunately, directly following the MTR came the January 2009 political crisis which played a
role in delayed restructuring until it was finally completed in December 2011.

3. Political Crisis of 2009. The project was severely affected by a popular uprising in early 2009
when opposition leader and then-mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, led a protest movement
in which President Ravalomanana lost power in an unconstitutional process widely condemned as
a coup d'état. In March 2009, Rajoelina was declared by the Supreme Court as the President of
the High Transitional Authority, an interim governing body responsible for moving the country
toward presidential elections. As a result, many bilateral donors and intergovernmental
organizations froze aid and suspended regular diplomatic relations with Madagascar, causing
economic development to stagnate and reversing many of the gains achieved under the previous
administration. On March 17, 2009, the Bank suspended all disbursements under the Madagascar
portfolio in line with Operational Policy 7.30, Dealing with De Facto Governments. In November
2009, this suspension was lifted on exceptional basis for certain projects on humanitarian grounds.
This included resumption of financing for this project with implementation allowed under three
components (Components 2, 4 and 5). Component 1 was completed by the end of 2008 and
Component 3 was suspended as a result of corruption allegations and because it was deemed to be
ineffective in delivering interventions to the targeted population. Although disbursements and
activities were allowed to go ahead, it is important to note that the Bank team was not authorized
to have dialogue with Ministers and other high-level decision makers, thus making it hard to
resolve more complex operational issues that required a political decision.

In 2010, a new constitution was adopted by referendum, establishing a Fourth Republic, which
sustained the democratic, multi-party structure established in the previous constitution. Following
a lengthy mediation process led by the Southern African Development Community (SADC),
Madagascar held UN-supported presidential and parliamentary elections in 2013. Former finance
minister Hery Rajaonarimampianina defeated Ravalomanana’s favored candidate Jean-Louis
Robinson in a presidential runoff and was inaugurated in January 2014.

Effects of the 2009 political crisis. Madagascar's GDP in 2009 was estimated at US$8.6 billion,
with a per capita GDP of US$438 with approximately 69% of the population living below the
national poverty line threshold of one dollar per day. The 2009 political crisis significantly
weakened the economy and quality of life remains low for the majority of the Malagasy population.
Tourism dropped by more than 50% in 2009 compared with the previous year, and many investors
were wary of entering the uncertain investment environment. GDP growth rate declined from the
previous average of 7% to 2.6% by 2013 and per capita income was barely US$400 by 2011. The
Bank’s 2012 Interim Strategy Note pointed out that poverty levels increased by 9 percentage points
since 2005, with 76.5% of households living below the poverty line in 2010, one of the highest
rates in Africa (2011 World Development Indicators). Indeed, it has been estimated that by 2012,
there were additional 4 million people in poverty compared to 2008.

While Madagascar already lagged behind on key health and nutrition indicators, the political and
economic crisis had the effect of reducing both the external and internal funding for the health
sector. The government budget for the operation of the health centers at the district level was
reduced by 30% in 2010 as compared to 2008. Likewise, external funding declined from 16.3% in
2008 to 3% in 2010. This reduced financing resulted in the closure of 10% of primary health care
facilities and associated reduction of antenatal care coverage from 73.4% in 2008 to 62.1% in 2010.
Utilization of basic health centers and prenatal consultations decreased by 20% from 2008-2011.
By 2010, Madagascar had an average of three hospital beds per 10,000 people and a total of 3,150

                                                17
doctors, 5,661 nurses, 385 community health workers, 175 pharmacists and 57 dentists for a
population of 22 million. Therefore, whatever gains were made prior to the 2009 crisis were
quickly erased. By 2012, MMR was 478 per 100,000 births (MDG Survey), compared to 498 in
2008 and far from the MDG of 149 per 100,000. The IMR in 2011 was 41 per 1,000 births, with
an under-five mortality rate at 61 per 1,000 births. Chronic malnutrition remained highly prevalent,
with 50% of children under 5 being stunted, severely underweight and 27% of pregnant women
being severely underweight and anemic. Alarmingly, the rate of acute malnutrition, climbed from
4.7% in 2008 to 7.4% in 2011 for children under 5. Additionally, the lack of hygiene (10% of
rural population with access to improved sanitation facilities, 2009 data), and the lack of access to
drinking water (29% of rural population with access to improved water source, 2008 data)
significantly exacerbated these poor health outcomes, only encouraging the development of such
infectious diseases as respiratory ailments, tuberculosis and hepatitis.

4. Changed implementation arrangements and refocused project activities (2010-2012).
Following the MTR, and because of the political crisis and the suspension of the project, during
2009, many staff resigned in the ES/CNLS. Therefore, by the time the suspension was lifted in
November 2009, there was a renewed challenge on how to improve project performance given the
constraints and past history. It was also clear that the project needed to be extended in order to
fully complete its activities which became all the more critical given the political and economic
situation. Therefore, a decision was taken to implement the recommendations of the December
2008 MTR, first by making a change in implementation arrangements. The Bank-supported
Sustainable Health Systems project closed in December 2009 and its PIU (in the MOH) had the
necessary capacity and experience, and was already directly involved in the implementation of
Component 2. Therefore, instead of recruiting new ES/CNLS staff, it was agreed to shift project
implementation to the MOH PIU. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed on February 10,
2010 between ES/CNLS and the PIU which outlined the new implementation structure until the
new Closing Date of December 31, 2011. The responsibility for project oversight and coordination
remained with the ES/CNLS while the MOH PIU took on project management responsibility. The
ES/CNLS Executive Secretary still maintained the role of the National Director of the project
while the National Coordinator of the PIU became the Assistant Director.

The second major change was a refocused effort on prevention activities targeted on high risk
groups. Since Component 3 was suspended, the decision was made in 2009/2010 to hire 5 national
and international NGOs on performance-based contracts, directly targeting youths, sex workers
and the military. The first set of contracts (2010-2012) were carried out in 17 regions (38 districts),
and the second part was carried out from 2012-2014 in 10 regions (21 districts). This new
implementation modality was instrumental in changing the course of the project. More details on
this work is found below in the project outcome section.

5. Additional Financing (2012-2014). The impetus for preparing this AF was to provide urgently
needed support for health and nutrition services following the 2009 political crisis by filling the
financing gap left by the December 2007 closure of the successful eight-year Bank-financed Health
Sector Support Project II, the December 2009 closure of the Sustainable Health System
Development project, and the July 2011 closure of the Second Community Nutrition Project. The
Bank team had initially prepared a US$63 million Joint Health Sector Support Project which was
meant to be presented to the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors in January 2009, but given the

                                                  18
political crisis, the Bank could not approve the operation at that time. Therefore, the AF, approved
in mid-2012 (as part of the Madagascar portfolio restructuring), served as a bridge financing
arrangement while a new health operation was under preparation. The AF continued the Bank’s
long engagement in the health sector, using resources pulled from other projects as part of an
intensive restructuring of the Bank’s Madagascar portfolio. Its implementation had the positive
additional aspect of supporting the established implementation capacity and a partnership
arrangement with other donors in the sector. Because of Government approval delays in
Parliament (AF document was submitted late), the AF only became effective on February 22, 2013,
eight months after Board approval and three months after the approval of the Emergency Support
to Critical Education, Health and Nutrition Services Project (approved November 29, 2012). This
effectiveness delay left only a year and half for implementation of the AF activities until the
September 2014 Closing Date. Despite the delays and the overlap with the new multi-sectoral
project, the AF still served an important purpose of carrying out critically important health and
nutrition activities, a results-based health pilot, and continued prevention activities through five
NGOs, under performance-based contracts. Therefore, the AF allowed the new operation to build
on its lessons as well as laid a useful foundation for any future operation involving these sectors.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design: The PAD Annex 1 contained 10 PDO indicators (of which targets for 4 indicators were
subsequently revised during the December 2011 restructuring). This original design of the RF and
M&E arrangements was generally reflective of the project design, i.e. the PDO indicators included
HIV/AIDS knowledge and behavior indicators focused on youth 15-24, broader population 15-49,
and high-risk groups which the PAD defined as sex workers, military and truckers. The high-risk
group did not include Injection Drug Users (IDUs) and MSM, for example, and the PAD does not
specifically address why these particularly high-risk populations were not included. However, it
was clarified during the ICR preparation that the choice to support select high-risk groups was
based on a division of responsibilities among donors; for example, the Global Fund was supporting
IDUs and MSM under its program. The entire set of indicators was validated by the UNAIDS
Thematic Group in April 2005. In terms of intermediate outcome indicators, the PAD contained
13 indicators which were linked to the five project components. The PAD included baselines for
9 out of 10 outcome indicators and there were targets provided for all project indicators. The data
was based on existing DHS and behavioral surveillance surveys.

The project (through its Component 4 on M&E) aimed to strengthen the national M&E system
which was initially developed with support from the original MSPPI project. Although significant
progress was made under MSPPI, this project needed to ensure a fuller integration of the
Management Information System (under a common platform) and better use of second generation
surveillance data for national programming and decision-making. Therefore, MSSPII included
financing for the collection of additional data through epidemiological and behavioral surveys and
ensuring its real-time use. M&E specialists were to be placed in the Regional Coordinating
Bureaus to guide the implementation of M&E system at the sub-regional level and to ensure good
quality data collection. The project was also to finance a consultant to work closely with the
ES/CNLS staff to analyze this data on an annual basis and make programmatic recommendations.
Lastly, Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) was to support collection of data in project areas
and measure project–specific impact.

                                                19
Implementation: The Results Framework was officially revised for the first time on December
23, 2011; however, plans existed to revise the indicators as early as 2008, prior to the MTR (as
reflected in Implementation Status Reports). The November 2008 MTR issues paper
recommended to broaden the high-risk groups from sex workers to include military and pregnant
women. It also claimed that some indicators were measuring only 15-49 age group when in reality,
of the 10 outcome indicators, only 1 was exclusively focused on that group. In fact, all other
original indicators were designed to measure progress by gender and by the different age groups.
Nonetheless, the 2011 Restructuring Paper claimed that the original set of indicators needed to be
streamlined and certain indicators needed to be modified to reflect strengthened focus on high risk
groups and to rectify the existing disconnect between activities and intermediate and outcome
indicators. Indicators which were no longer relevant or measurable were dropped. The proposed
changes to the RF were in fact reflecting the accompanying re-focusing of the project to support
better targeting on high-risk groups, to reinforce the supply side of the fight against STI/HIV/AIDS
and to improve the care and treatment of PLWHA.

Indeed, as a result of the December 2011 restructuring, 5 of the 10 PDO indicators were dropped,
leaving 1 indicator on syphilis prevalence among sex workers (#1), 1 knowledge indicator on citing
three methods of HIV/AIDS prevention expanded to include youth and dropping the truckers (#3),
and 3 behavior indicators on use of condom among youth and sex workers during the last sexual
intercourse with a non-regular partner (#8, 9, 10). The targets of four of the five remaining
outcome indicators were also changed at that time. In addition, 3 new indicators were added (#13,
14, 21), 2 of which measured percent change among youth and sex workers who received an HIV
test in the last 12 months and knew the result and the third indicator was a core sector indicator
measuring number of beneficiaries in line with the new internal mandate by the Bank to collect
standardized data across projects. During this restructuring, 8 new intermediate outcome
indicators were also added (although the restructuring paper does not include the mention of that
change; the paper breaks the list of original and revised PDO indicators into 7 outcome and 7
intermediate outcome indicators. In the subsequent ISRs and in the AF paper, this distinction is no
longer made, however.) While the December 2011 restructuring paper explicitly intended to
eliminate the stated disconnect between project activities and indicators, the paper did not go into
detail about how this was actually accomplished. The December 2011 restructuring also further
strengthened Component 4 focusing on the M&E system. An additional three studies were
included in the project to provide biological and behavioral data, as well as sensibility to antibiotics,
and data from the experience of NGOs on how best to develop future approaches to combatting
HIV/AIDS on a national scale.

The 2012 AF made further revisions to the RF, but mainly focused on adding indicators to reflect
the changed nature of the project, expanding utilization of maternal and child health and nutrition
services. At this time, 7 new outcome indicators were added (#4, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20), 3 of
which are HNP core sector indicators. Baselines and targets were also changed for 1 outcome
indicator (#8). Also, 11 new intermediate outcome indicators were added at this time, 2 of which
are core sector indicators. Baselines and targets were also revised for 2 intermediate outcome
indicators. The design of these indicators appears to be thorough, based on latest estimates and
survey data, and the AF paper is detailed and provides information on sources of data.



                                                  20
The RF was further revised in August 2014 to change baseline data for some indicators from 2010
to 2012 and to revise targets downward. This was done at the request of the Government to
correctly reflect the revised implementation period (April 2013-September 2014) due to the 9-
month delay in the start-up of the AF. The August 2014 restructuring changed baselines and
targets for 5 outcome indicators and 7 intermediate outcome indicators. While the general
sentiment behind this change of the RF is entirely understandable, changing targets for indicators
1.5 months prior to project closure did not make a great difference in terms of achievement of
targets. Indeed, in several cases, actual achievements were already known to have been reached
and yet the targets were still revised downward. These indicator targets would have been met
regardless.

Utilization: The project provided support for key surveys which would not have otherwise been
carried out due to their prohibitive cost. These surveys were instrumental in providing evolving
information and data to enable policy makers to closely monitor the epidemiological and
behavioral trends. The ES/CNLS greatly appreciated the project’s contribution in this area and has
utilized this data to develop and implement its revised National Strategic Plan 2013-2017.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Procurement. The ES/CNLS was responsible for all procurement under the project, supported
by consultant specialists. Considering the success of the MSSPI, the risks were rated as moderate.
The procurement officer was recruited in 2008 and procurement activities were well advanced
until 2009. However, at this time, the Borrower had to deal with the repayment of the amount
ineligible due to the mismanagement of the FAP. It was decided to transfer the management of the
Project and mainly procurement to the MOH PIU (UGP/Santé) which has always demonstrated its
efficiency in project management. In 2010, and taking into account the progress made since the
resumption of the project, and the quality of the documentation of procurement packages, the
rating for procurement was Moderately Satisfactory. In 2011, despite some delays, goods were
delivered and procurement was found to be Satisfactory and this rating was maintained until the
end of the project in 2014.

Financial management. The FM aspects of the project were initially handled by a FM team under
the ES/CNLS. However, following the 2009 Special Audit, US$745,569 was identified as
ineligible expenditures under Component 3 (Fund for STI/HIV/AIDS Prevention and Care-Taking
Activities) which were incurred as a result of inadequate book-keeping and controls on the part of
CBOs and weak supervision on the part of the Financial Management Agency hired to manage
those activities. At that stage, FM was assessed as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Starting from 2010, project management was moved from the ES/CNLS PIU to the MOH PIU in
order to improve FM and ensure the functioning of appropriate internal controls. As mentioned
earlier, the project was also restructured to exclude the activities under Component 3 which had
entailed ineligible expenditures (these were fully reimbursed to the Bank).

Subsequent to changes made in the December 2011 restructuring, the project had adequate FM
arrangements over the remaining implementation period. The quarterly financial reports and
annual audit reports were submitted to the Bank on a timely basis and recommendations made
during implementation support missions were appropriately implemented. Internal controls were
                                               21
spelled out in a Procedures Manual and compliance with the procedures was monitored by the
Internal Controller. As a result of the improvement measures, the project’s FM was rated
Satisfactory at the project’s final closing date.

Safeguards. MSSPII supported activities to strengthen the health system and enhance the MOH’s
institutional capacity to improve access and utilization of health services, especially those linked
to testing and treatment of STIs/HIV/AIDS. This could lead to increased medical waste production
in the different types of health facilities which could adversely affect the environment and affect
the local population if not managed and eliminated appropriately. Therefore, OP4.01
Environmental Assessment was triggered and the environmental category of the project was “B”.
With technical assistance from the Bank, the GOM prepared a national Medical Waste
Management Policy in July 2005. Subsequently, a National Medical Waste Management Plan
(MWMP) was developed and the supervision missions noted the MOH’s strong commitment to
the implementation of the plan. Project support as well as support from other donors contributed
to MWMP implementation which was rated Satisfactory and Moderately Satisfactory during the
life of the project.

The MWMP included proper disposal of hazardous bio-medical waste and a bio-safety training
program for staff of all hospitals, health centers and community-based programs, including
traditional midwifes and practitioners, who may be involved in HIV/AIDS testing and treatment.
Operational activities were conducted mainly to disseminate tools for the elaboration of medical
waste management plans in health facilities, trainings of health staff and provision of incinerators
to hospitals. The implementation of the MWMP recorded the following results:
    • 200 small-scale burners to burn medical waste in all 200 health centers rehabilitated under
        CRESANII;
    • 61% of public hospitals (77 health centers) sensitized to the National MWMP;
    • 30% (or 37 health centers) elaborated medical waste management plans;
    • 10% of the CSB (120 health facilities) sensitized to develop their own medical waste
        management plans;
    • 44 incinerators built;
    • The National Policy and its tools have been circulated to the partners, the DRS, the DSSS
        and 120 public hospitals and health facilities;
    • The training modules are available on CDs;
    • The cascade training processes have been provided to the hospitals and health centers at
        the interregional and regional level: 16 regions, 1044 (DSS and CHD) trainers have been
        trained;
    • In the health sector, a coordinator unit (SAGS), in charge of the supervision and monitoring
        of the implementation of the National Medical Waste Management Policy is operational.




2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase



                                                22
Previous efforts by the Bank, including under the original project and its AF, led to scaled-up
interventions currently supported under the Emergency Support to Education, Health and Nutrition
Services Project (approved in December 2012 and closing in July 2016) in the total amount of
US$65 million, of which US$37 million supports health and nutrition interventions. The ongoing
project also includes an estimated US$2.42 million for HIV/AIDS activities (of which there is a
performance-based contract with an NGO for prevention activities in the amount of US$956,078).
In February 2014, the Bank approved US$10 million in AF for this emergency operation to support
nutrition activities. Future Bank support will be based on the program outlined in the upcoming
Country Partnership Framework (CPF) which is expected to be discussed at the Bank’s Board of
Executive Directors by the end of 2015. To inform the CPF, a Systematic Country Diagnostic is
being finalized and is expected to be presented to the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors in May
2015. Based on the past 25 years of Bank experience in Madagascar and lessons learned in
HIV/AIDS, health and nutrition, future engagement will not likely include a stand-alone
HIV/AIDS project, but will be a multi-sector comprehensive approach focusing on critical areas
where the Bank can be most effective with close linkages to international partners working in these
sectors.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

The following assessment of project outcomes is based on analysis of three project phases because
of the distinct features of each phase. Phase 1 (2005-2009) encompasses the original project design
prior to the MTR and restructuring. Phase 2 (2010-2012) assesses the original project in its
redesigned form, taking into account the restructuring which was formalized in December 2011
but which in fact was already in effect since the start of 2010. Finally, Phase 3 (2012-2014)
assesses the period of AF.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Objective: The project development objectives were directly relevant and consistent with the
National Strategic Plan (NSP) for HIV/AIDS (2001-2006), the subsequent NSP of 2007-2012, and
remain relevant to the current NSP of 2013-2017. Control over STIs and HIV/AIDS remains a
priority for the GOM. Even though HIV prevalence is estimated at 0.4% in the 15-49 age group,
HIV prevalence is significant among high risk groups (14.7% among MSM, 7.1% among IDUs,
and 1.3% among sex workers). Likewise, STI infection rates remain stubbornly high in the general
population and among these high risk groups, with rates of syphilis at 15.6% among sex workers,
16.7% among members of the military, and 3.4% among pregnant women. Also, major efforts are
required to control vertical HIV transmission with only 2.8% of HIV positive pregnant women
receiving ARVs (the use of antenatal care is only 50%, with only 56% of health care centers
offering HIV testing). Likewise, there is a significant gap between those currently receiving ARV
treatment (695), those needing treatment (19,000), and the total estimated number of people living
with HIV/AIDS (54,000). Meanwhile, high risk behaviors, low knowledge, and very high stigma
against PLWHA only fuel the epidemic. Hence, the targeting of prevention interventions on high-
risk groups remains the main objective of the current NSP, as well as improved health response to
diagnose and treat HIV-infected individuals. The NSP also places importance on reinforced
communication campaigns for high-risk groups and for the general population in the most
vulnerable areas of the country.

                                                23
The original project objectives were and also remain consistent with the Millennium Development
Goal 6 (to halt and reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS and malaria and other diseases by 2015; to
develop a global partnership for development). The project was part of the broader Multi-Country
HIV/AIDS Program for Africa (MAP) which the Bank supported to realize the UNAIDS principle
of “The Three Ones”, one national authority for HIV/AIDS, one strategic framework, and one
monitoring and evaluation system. The 2004 Interim Review of the MAP by the Bank made a set
of recommendations which the MSPPII adopted in its design, inter alia, taking into account the
needs of the entire health sector in the response to the epidemic, and tailoring project design to
unique epidemiological, economic, behavioral and social circumstances of individual countries.
Lastly, the project was consistent with the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (October 2003)
under pillar 3.

While the PDO during Phase 1 was Substantially relevant to the country’s goals (and for
continuity and expediency reasons for a repeater project), it became only Modestly so during
Phase 2. While the re-designed project placed emphasis squarely on targeting high-risk groups,
the PDO remained as it was under Phase 1. To be entirely relevant, it should have likely been
adapted to reflect the new emphasis placed on targeting high risk groups and to reflect a greater
role to be played by the health sector in relation to management of STIs and treatment and care of
PLWHA.

The relevance of the AF PDO during Phase 3 was and remains High given lagging indicators
concerning pregnant women and children under five which were further exacerbated after the 2009
political crisis, as discussed above. The PDO is entirely consistent with the Bank’s Interim
Strategy Note (2012) which explicitly proposed that the Bank needs to continue to intervene in
health and nutrition as priority sectors. The AF PDO was also consistent with MDGs 4 and 5 on
maternal and child mortality and was also in line with the MOH strategy for the health sector. In
relation to HIV/AIDS, the AF PDO was very relevant and realistic, specifically mentioning project
areas where services and interventions were to be rendered.

Design: The project design evolved in line with the changes made in the NSPs and was coordinated
at the highest level with the Executive Secretary of CNLS in charge of the national HIV/AIDS
response. Indeed, by looking at the original project design and its subsequent important
restructurings, clearly, the project modified activities from ones focusing on mass communication
campaigns as supported by the MSPPI for the general population to those targeted to the highest
vulnerable communes and the highest risk groups within them. Indeed, the project design meant
to target interventions on high risk groups using a vulnerability analysis of communes (carried out
in 2006 and repeated in 2012, financed by UNDP) as a key element to make interventions more
effective. The project also improved on the original design by including support to the health sector
in order to ensure a more comprehensive approach to HIV/AIDS; this included intensive screening,
treatment and support for PLWHA as well as support for STI management. Therefore, on balance,
relevance of design was Modest in Phase 1 (2005-2009) and was Substantial for Phase 2 (2010-
2012). Under the AF, the health sector received additional support for STI/HIV/AIDS as well as
reproductive and nutrition services which were all Highly relevant and consistent with global
lessons on HIV/AIDS prevention, with lessons from MSSPI and previous health and nutrition
projects supported by the Bank. Implementation of the AF was targeted to the Madagascar’s five


                                                 24
most vulnerable regions. Although imperfect in implementation (particularly in the early period
when many sub-projects were implemented with varying degrees of effectiveness), the project’s
design remained relevant and consistent with the NSP. The design of the RF, as discussed above,
was also relevant to the overall objectives (despite the many changes). Indeed, the current NSP
(2013-2017) includes eight top priorities to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic, all of which were
essential elements of project design. 2

Implementation: The relevance of the implementation approach used to support the main
prevention measures under Component 3 was Modest during Phase 1, using the mechanism
developed under MSSPI. This involved continued reliance on a multitude of NGOs and CBOs
implementing an assortment of small-medium size sub-projects which ranged from various forms
of communication campaigns to raise awareness among the general population, encouraging
testing among certain target groups, prevention measures such as distribution of condoms. These
interventions were targeted on severely and moderately vulnerable communes and interviews with
stakeholders demonstrated that these efforts were positive in raising the overall visibility of the
National HIV/AIDS Program. However, stakeholders also acknowledged that the epidemic is
concentrated in high-risk groups and that direct, focused efforts carried out in the later part of the
project through a limited number of larger NGOs (5) under performance-based contracts made
more sense and were more effective. Therefore, relevance for implementation was Substantial in
Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the project. However, the recommendation from numerous interviews
conducted by the ICR author among various stakeholders pointed out that the scope of the effort
certainly needed to be further widened, particularly with respect to youths who are susceptible to
getting infected given the persistently poor indicators in terms of their behavior and knowledge.
Had this targeted and focused approach been used from the beginning, there could have possibly
been even more progress in changing attitudes and behaviors among the most at risk groups.

The overall rating for project relevance is Modest for Phase 1, Substantial for Phase 2 and High
for Phase 3 in view of the above arguments.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The achievement of the project development objective is based on the original and revised PDO.
The original PDO was to “to support the Government of Madagascar’s efforts to promote a multi-
sectoral response to the HIV/AIDS crisis and to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS on its territory.”
The assessment of this objective is based on progress against key performance indicators and
overall project implementation during Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 each of which represents a
clear distinction in terms of implementation before and after the 2009 political crisis as well as a
different implementation approach used in Phases 2 and 3. The revised objective under the AF


2
 The NSP 2013-2017 priorities are: (i) intensify efforts to promote safe sexual behaviors, especially among
key high-risk populations; (ii) strengthen supply of syndromic STI management; (iii) improve quality of
VCT with increased coverage of high-risk groups; (iv) expand and improve prevention of PMTCT; (v)
ensure blood safety; (vi) expand and improve quality of care of PLWHA; (vii) create a more favorable
environment for the care and development of orphans and other vulnerable children; and (viii) strengthen
monitoring, evaluation and coordination mechanisms for a national response to HIV/AIDS.

was “to increase utilization of STI/HIV/AIDS, and maternal and child health, nutrition services in
project areas.” The table below presents a summary of achievement of PDO and Intermediate
Outcome indicators (IO) across the three phases to facilitate understanding of the otherwise
complicated history of RF changes and achievement.

average was calculated using the following scale (Surpassed=1.5x; Achieved=1x; Partially
Achieved=0.75x). The ratings were not weighed in favor of the last 2 phases or their timing even though
it is clear that the project greatly benefitted from changes made in the design and was thereby able to meet
its objectives despite political turmoil.

PDO #1: Original & revised project (Phases 1 and 2)
The objective was to provide support to the national effort by: (i) promoting a multi-sectoral
response, and (ii) containing the spread of HIV/AIDS. In terms of the first sub-objective, the
project was moderately successful as only a few sectors, notably National Defense, Civil Service,
Education, and Health and Family Planning, all prepared their sector strategies and plans. The
project began with a plan to work with 10 sectors in total, but in the end, only these few prepared
their sector actions plans. According to the ES/CNLS, a number of other plans were rejected as
they did not meet the ES/CNLS standards. Importantly, the sectors which did participate were
some of the most important, and while they progressed in the implementation of their plans
successfully, their involvement was short-lived as this work was carried out under Component 1

                                                    26
which closed at the start of 2009 after the political crisis and was not rekindled under the project
as only critical components were left. Component 1 was deemed essentially achieved by the Bank
team, with the final rating of Moderately Satisfactory given the engagement of key sectors and
because the Component also supported a number of important activities to strengthen the NSP and
its implementation (capacity building in setting up regional and local coordination units) as well
as development and implementation of a communication plan. Clearly, after the closure of
Component 1, work continued to be carried out by the various sectors, in spite of the project, e.g.
the education, defense, and health sectors were extensively involved in this effort during the entire
project period. It must be noted that the multi-sectoral approach indeed permeated the entire set-
up under the national program, with regions and districts heavily involved in prevention and
communication efforts through the Government’s new decentralized approach, relying on a variety
of agencies, CBOs, NGOs, and media. Multi-sectoral activities were carried out jointly with a
number of other donors, with clear separate mandates for each. Therefore, the efforts made under
the project need to be seen in this light as well. Overall, the achievement of this objective can be
considered as Moderately achieved (the rating of Modest does not reflect the efforts made while
a rating of Substantial implied only minor weaknesses).

The second sub-objective to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS was aided in two ways: (i) screening,
prevention and treatment efforts; and (ii) improved M&E. The first part of this effort entailed
prevention, treatment and care measures, including, inter alia, communication and outreach to the
general population, targeted prevention for high-risk groups, condom promotion and distribution,
significantly increased screening/testing for HIV/AIDS, provision of drugs for PLWHA as well as
for opportunistic infections, care of PLWHA. The list of all activities undertaken particularly
under Component 2 and 3 are described in Annex 2 and the exhaustive list and a map of communes
targeted is in Annex 10. The efforts made need to be assessed separately for each project phase.

Phase 1 interventions were carried out nationally, across 22 regions, targeting “hot” communes
identified to be most vulnerable (communes identified in the UNDP financed 2006 vulnerability
study). 3 A total of 761 of 1,549 communes were reached, with 2,817 communication and
prevention sub-projects of which 1,745 were completed (contracts with 57 NGOs/CBOs and 724
associations). Interventions were mainly focused on two levels of vulnerability, “severely
vulnerable communes” (94 of 119 reached=79%), and “moderately vulnerable communes” (193
of 338 reached = 57%). A total of 76% of FAP funds were focused on these most vulnerable
communes. One of the most enduring and successful aspects of this work was the significantly
increased testing which was strongly encouraged as part of awareness messaging. As a result,
while in 2005, only 11,146 people were tested, in 2007 the number reached 351,806 and 427,800
in 2008. Likewise, the number of VCT centers increased from 49 in 2004 to 779 by 2009 during
this time to support this increased demand. A number of other health interventions were also
carried out in support of prevention interventions, such as acquisition of STI treatment kits,
reagents, ARV drugs, training materials for health centers, and the acquisition of 15 million
condoms. The total population targeted through these efforts (of estimated 23 million people in
Madagascar) is presented below. The calculation is based on the total number of people targeted

While this was a significant effort, the types of interventions were mostly communication and
awareness for the general population and for some high risk groups which tends to have lower to
medium impact than targeted prevention measures under Phase 2 (see more details on the
Economic analysis below). Indeed, despite previous efforts of similar nature and during Phase 1,
the outcomes of these interventions are mixed for the general population in Madagascar. For
example, the current syphilis prevalence among sex workers(15.8%) is essentially the same as it
was in 2005 (16.6%) and prevalence of other STIs remains high; general knowledge of HIV/AIDS
transmission is still low among youths and only marginally better since 2005 (PDO indicator 2)
although improvements were made among sex workers, military and truckers (10-20% points
increase in knowledge- PDO 3,5); meanwhile, discriminatory attitudes towards PLWHA are
incredibly high (95% average – PDO indicator 7); high risk behaviors remain a concern (low
condom use in the general population- PDO indicator 8) although progress was made in this regard
in project areas among sex workers and the military (PDO indicators 10, 12) and incidence of sex
with non-regular partners was reduced (20 percentage point reduction from 2005 - PDO indicator
9). Therefore, on balance the types of interventions to contain HIV/AIDS carried out during Phase
1 are likely to have had a modest/moderate impact although the impact of increased testing was
very high.

By contrast, Phase 2 and Phase 3 interventions were intentionally targeted by 5 NGOs on a select
high-risk group (150,325 people) in 120 communes (reaching 72% of “severely vulnerable”
communes – see table below) in 16 regions, focusing their efforts on sex workers (12,412), military
personnel (13,004) and youth ages 15-24 (124,909). The results of these interventions were much
more encouraging as most of the work was done using peer educators closely engaged with each
type of group. For example, average 71% of youth knew three main modes of transmission in 2014
as compared with an average of 49% in 2010 (PDO indicator 4); the indicator for condom use


                                                28
among the youth surpassed the target by 23% on average (PDO indicator 8); the same indicator
for sex workers was also met, achieving 86.3% by 2014 (PDO indicator 10).

A final independent verification survey of activities carried out by NGOs under performance based
contacts was completed in 2014. Each NGO had to meet a certain percentage of agreed
performance targets (quantitative and qualitative) in order to get fully paid for the work. As the
table below shows, the overall performance of these NGOs was found to be excellent with just a
few exceptions. One NGO in particular had challenges working with the military, pointing out
that while prevention activities were successful in the first round, the second round was not as
successful because the group targeted changed in composition entirely due to military movements
in 2013, and therefore, the survey likely did not do full justice to the actual achievements.
Nonetheless, the tables clearly show that overall performance targets were largely met, and
therefore, Phase 2 and Phase 3 prevention interventions are considered as Substantially achieved.

In addition to prevention, the project also supported the acquisition and distribution of 17.6 million
condoms per year in project areas, the purchase of STI treatment for 5,822 health centers (3.5
million STI treatment kits sold in public and private sector), screening for HIV/AIDS of sex
workers, military and youth (127,092 tested in one year-2014), testing and treatment of pregnant
women for syphilis (2139 women), expanding VCT to all district hospitals and basic health centers
(CSB2), treatment and care sites for AIDS patients, purchase of treatment of opportunistic
infections for reference centers, strengthening the network of psychosocial support in 8 regions
using the MADAIDS NGO network, and establishing a Logistics Management Information
System to monitor drug supplies (using mobile phones). These health sector interventions were a
critical part of ensuring that key population groups such as pregnant women and high-risk groups
received testing and that treatment and care was provided to PLWHA.

The second part of the effort to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS was the projects’ great emphasis
on improving M&E capacity through recruitment and training of M&E specialists at central,
regional and sub-regional levels, revision of the National M&E Plan and information system, the
development of tools and surveys, including strengthening of the epidemiological surveillance of
STIs, TB and HIV/AIDS, carrying out second generation (biological and behavioral) surveys and
other specific studies. This combined effort enabled the collection, analysis and dissemination of
data across all levels for a more informed response in the fight against HIV/AIDS. A total of 13
different surveys were carried out under the project. This work was closely coordinated with the
UNAIDS.

Although additional studies need to be carried out, such as a more in-depth study on syphilis and
its relation to HIV/AIDS, data collected has provided UNAIDS with information to better and
more accurately estimate the trends in the epidemic. According to the latest UNAIDS estimates
(May 2014), prevalence rates among adults aged 15-49 have decreased from 0.7% in 2005 to 0.4%
in 2014. This is based on data collected during the course of the project as well as through surveys
financed by other donors. Although an overall reduction in prevalence cannot be a single measure
of success or failure in curbing the HIV/AIDS epidemic, because increased testing and treatment
measures may actually increase prevalence in the short-term, the data does indicate that the
epidemic is still contained within high-risk groups. According to the 2014 ES/CNLS Report on
the AIDS Response, 99.3% of new infections come from groups including MSM, IDUs, sex

                                                 30
workers and their clients. HIV prevalence is 14.7% for MSM, 7.1% for IDUs, and 1.3% among
female sex workers. Given the relatively large portion of financing by the project in support of the
National AIDS response, it can be inferred that the project did contribute to the containment of the
epidemic.

PDO#2 – during AF (Phase 3)
The objective under the AF was to increase utilization of STI/HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health,
and nutrition services in project areas. The support for the STI/HIV/AIDS under the AF was
roughly 30% of the total AF cost and the success of these prevention and treatment services are
described above. The main part of the support during this AF phase was to provide bridge
financing before the Emergency Support to Critical Education, Health and Nutrition Services
Project was approved in November 2012. Therefore, the effort on maternal and child health and
nutrition was limited to the poorest areas in 5 regions (143 health centers and 659 nutrition sites).
The services included antenatal consultations, PMTCT, iron and folic acid supplementation,
vaccinations, vitamin A supplementation, distribution of mosquito nets, prevention and treatment
of malaria, integrated treatment of childhood diseases, and provision of nutrition inputs, culinary
demonstrations, awareness raising and counseling, and referrals of malnourished children. This
work was also supported through performance based contracts and a voucher system for drugs.

The outcomes of these interventions, inter alia, include:

(i) increase in pregnant women receiving antenatal care during the visits to a healthcare provider
from 57,242 in 2012 to 140,989 by 2014, surpassing the target (PDO indicator 17);
(ii) increase in the number of children 0-24 months from 48,200 in 2012 to 51,834 in 2014)
obtaining monthly adequate minimum weight (PDO indicator 18);
(iii) increase in the number of children immunized from 53,214 in 2012 to 132,226 in 2014 (PDO
indicator 19);
(iv) increase in the number of people with access to a basic package of health, nutrition and
reproductive health services from 283,203 in 2013 to 403,025 in 2014 (PDO indicator 20);
(v) number of pregnant women receiving folic acid increased from 81,994 in 2012 to 184,482 in
2014 (IO indicator 11); and
(vi) increase in the number of children receiving vitamin A more than doubled from 2012 and 2014
(IO indicator (12).

A number of other indicators also shows overall increased access to services and increased
utilization. On the basis of this highly concerted and effective effort over a period of less than 2
years, the overall rating for PDO2 is High.

3.3 Efficiency

Economic impact of prevention and treatment. An economic and financial analysis (see Annex
3) was carried out during the preparation of this ICR using available data from ES/CNLS, UNAIDS,
and the MOH PIU. The analysis demonstrates that the overall impact of interventions is
Substantial.




                                                31
While it is not feasible to estimate the precise economic and financial benefits for Phase 1, the
types of interventions carried out (mass media, communications, education, screening, condom
promotion and distribution for the general population and some target groups such as sex workers
and youths aged 15-24) point to a low to medium range impact, based on the findings of an
economic analysis on HIV/AIDS done under the Bank Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for the
Africa Region (2004). In the case of Madagascar, a low prevalence country, the report suggests
that the most cost-effective interventions are targeted prevention measures on the highest risk
groups such as sex workers, as well as on PMTCT, rather than on general communication
campaigns. Therefore, efficiency for Phase 1 is relatively Modest given that some important
prevention work was indeed carried out among high-risk groups in highly vulnerable areas.

Given the exact available data on the types of interventions and the number of people reached
during Phase 2 (2010-2014), the economic and financial analysis was carried out on the prevention
and treatment and care activities. The analysis reveals a positive return on investment which makes
these interventions economically worthwhile, with efficiency for this Phase 2 rated High given
the benefit-cost ratios calculated. With respect to prevention, the project averted an estimated total
of 1,683 new HIV infections. Based on high and low averted productivity loss estimates, the Net
Benefits of prevention is between US$17,115,734 and US$24,831,254, with benefit-cost-ratios of
4.7/1 and 6.4/1, respectively. The HIV treatment and care component financed the treatment of
695 HIV patients. That resulted in a Net Benefit of US$3,783,421, with a benefit-cost-ratio of
9.8/1.

Cost-effectiveness of Maternal and Child interventions: The AF supported an integrated
package of services provided for pregnant women and children under 5 in the poorest areas in five
regions. The package included health and nutrition services considered to be low cost and yielding
high and immediate impact on the lives of women and children. These services were carried out
through an NGO network that also used an innovative voucher system for medicines as well as
performance-based contracts. The efficiency of these interventions was High given the very short
and focused time frame available. The project reached beneficiaries in 143 health centers and 659
nutrition sites through 33 NGOs and was able to fully disburse all available funds.

Efficiency of implementation: The length of the project period (with two extensions of the
original Closing Date), was affected by start-up delays when the first project was still being
implemented, and then by the 2009 political crisis, without which the project would have likely
been implemented in 5-6 years which is an average implementation period for Bank-financed
projects. Therefore, given that project implementation actually started in mid-2007, and
considering the constraints faced and the efforts made to improve implementation to enable the
project to disburse fully, the overall efficiency of implementation is considered as Modest to
Substantial.

Based on the individual ratings above, the overall rating for efficiency is Substantial.

Given the above analysis by the project’s three phases, the final outcome rating could be
Satisfactory using the ICR guidelines. However, given the less than satisfactory performance
during Phase 1 of the project, it is more fitting to rate the project as Moderately Satisfactory. This
rating is also supported by the analysis of weighted ratings against project disbursements (see table
below). Three scenarios were used to calculate the rating in order to demonstrate the effects of
restructuring of December 2011. Overall, the ratings under the three scenarios provide an average
weighted value of 4.34 which is consistent with a Moderately Satisfactory rating.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
While the project was not an explicit poverty-targeted intervention, the prevention activities were
targeted to the most at risk communes in the 22 regions of Madagascar. The ranking of these
communes took into account the overall health indicators, access to health services, overall
prevalence of risk behaviors, and a variety of other factors, many of which are directly correlated
with increased poverty. Also, the activities under the AF focused on 5 regions with especially
high poverty and low maternal and child health outcomes, in line with the 2011 poverty map and
the DHS 2009, with the exception of the results-based pilot which was implemented in 29 health
centers of 1 district, in 1 better-off region. The poverty ratios in the 5 regions ranged from 55.5-
94.4% for urban areas against a national average of 54.2%, and from 84.7-94.5% for rural areas
against a national average of 76.5% (2010 data). This clearly indicates that the poorest regions
benefitted under the project. Also, given the exceedingly high poverty levels overall, with almost
80% of the population living on less than US$1.25/day, and 92% living on less than US$2/day,
measures supported by the project to provide testing, counseling and treatment for STI/HIV/AIDS
as well as preventative and curative maternal and child health and nutrition services had clear
direct poverty impacts on the population as these high-impact low cost interventions tend to do.
In addition, the longer-term effects of prevention activities will be felt in the future in terms of
averted direct and indirect costs of treatment and care as well as in terms of increased productivity
of PLWHA and improved overall livelihood.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The project had a Substantial impact on institutional development, both in terms of providing the
necessary support to the development of an effective mechanism at the ES/CNLS but also in
expanding capacity of line ministries, and strengthening capacity at regional and district offices
charged with the implementation of the HIV/AIDS and health response. Institutional
strengthening was a major part of the project design, with a stand-alone component on Monitoring
and Evaluation which provided critical financing for important surveillance work which would
otherwise not have been financed. This has increased the availability of quality data on the variety
of HIV/AIDS and STI indicators and has thereby increased overall awareness about the main
drivers of the epidemic.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial
The risk to development outcomes is considered to be Substantial. Although the NSP has general
support in the GOM and the ES/CNLS is equipped to coordinate and manage the response to
STI/HIV/AIDS, with close collaboration from MOH and other relevant sectors, financial resources
for the program are simply insufficient to manage an effective response. Total funding for the
HIV/AIDS program (of which 90% is financed by international donors (see Annex 1 Table C for
a summary of program financing from 2006-2014) has been cut in half from 2011 to 2013, while

                                                 34
the Government share of that reduced amount has actually increased from 2.4% to 9.1% in the
same period. The Global Fund is expected to provide US$17 million from 2015-2017 (next round
approval expected July 2015) but this will only cover an estimated 15% of the needs in the sector.
Meanwhile, subsequent to this project, funding from the Bank for HIV/AIDS has been limited to
a very small amount as part of the support under the Emergency project currently under
implementation. The ES/CNLS has very limited funding (US$400,000) per year (staff salaries,
costs for meetings and supervision activities), sufficient to only coordinate activities financed by
other sources. In view of these financial constraints, the ES/CNLS, with technical support from
UNAIDS, is preparing an Investment Case Concept Note which will lay out the needs of the
program and demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and the urgency of investing resources in a low
prevalence setting, such as Madagascar, by targeting prevention activities to high risk groups in
the most vulnerable communes. This Concept Note is expected to show that making these
investments now rather than waiting for a generalized epidemic would be the best use of limited
resources available to Madagascar. This Concept Note will also be used to coordinate a
comprehensive response, including support from Government, international and bi-lateral donors
as well as the private sector.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
This repeater project was prepared very quickly, with preparation finalized in roughly 4.5 months.
This rapid response by the Bank was a direct reflection of the Government’s expressed strong
interest and commitment in the follow-on operation which was highlighted in the internal Bank
reviews. The project built on the original operation but improved on the earlier approach by
including a health component to respond to the testing and treatment needs and by using a
prevention approach to be implemented in the most vulnerable communes (75% of project funds
were to be allocated to “hot” or high-risk communes). The design also relied on small sub-projects
to be implemented at the grass-root level by CBOs. The Bank team ensured that the project was
aligned with the existing CAS and the National HIV/AIDS Program, and provided a continuum of
support from the original project, without interruption in service delivery. The project ensured
that the financing gap calculated by the Government would be covered for the next several years.
Indeed, the Bank’s support for the National Program was absolutely critical given that its financing
would account for roughly 30%, with the Global Fund financing another 15%. The risks were
reasonably well identified and the RF was developed using the standard HIV/AIDS indicators
which were endorsed by UNAIDS. Implementation arrangements were the same as used by the
National Program and by the original project for continuity purposes. Therefore, the overall sense
was that the preparation time was commensurate with the final design.

In retrospect, however, project preparation was carried out too quickly without a more in-depth
appraisal of several key issues, including: (i) completion pace of the original project was
overestimated (only 53% was disbursed by September 2006 whereas the Bank expected the project
to be fully disbursed by the end of 2005); (ii) analysis of “hot” communes was planned but could
have been carried out if the preparation time was longer; (iii) recommended analysis at the PCN
and Decision meeting of effectiveness of interventions under the original project was not carried

                                                35
out, again because of the tight timetable to deliver this project; (iv) a more in-depth institutional
review of capacity for project and program management by the main implementing agency,
including the capacity of CBOs and NGOs, was not carried out although the Bank did acknowledge
that this was likely a risk; and (v) economic analysis was not carried out although a reference was
made to a general analysis done for the MAP which concluded that the cost-effectiveness of
HIV/AIDS interventions depended on the type of the epidemic and the types of targeted
interventions. Even though a low prevalence scenario indicated that the most effective
interventions were those targeted on sex workers and PMTCT, the project design was focused on
communication campaigns in high-risk areas, which is a higher cost and lower impact design. The
fact that the project was re-designed mid-way to correct this emphasis indicates that the preparation
could have benefitted from a more rigorous effort. Therefore, the overall rating for the Bank at
entry is Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
During the early phase of the project, there was very limited activity, with the Bank team mainly
supervising the original project which was extended until December 2007. The same Task Team
was involved in supervision as during preparation for the first five years although the Task Team
Leader changed after two years of implementation. During this initial two-year period, the Bank’s
ISRs were essentially the same, rating the project as Satisfactory saying that start-up delays were
due to the original project still being active and that the ES/CNLS PIU was focused on multiple
donors and that it was hard to concentrate on this project. Government sources also point to
insufficient communications with the Bank during this initial period with late Bank no-objections
blamed for delays in implementation. The first time that any data was entered for the project
indicators was October 2007 at which time a decision was also made to delay the MTR to the end
of 2008. The overall realism of Satisfactory project ratings by the Bank has to be questioned for
this early period when the total disbursements were only 15% in October 2007, 2 years from
project closing. There were also some internal inconsistencies between ratings and the text of the
ISRs, e.g. Component 1 was described as not-successful and yet rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
The overall rating for implementation progress and other components fluctuated several times
between MS and MU although there was actually little implementation progress. In general, this
period saw little progress and mixed reporting by the Bank although there were regular, well-
written Aide-memoires and good recommendations to improve progress.

While the start-up phase was challenging, subsequent Bank efforts to turn this project around were
significant. When implementation picked up in 2007 and 2008, the Bank did a thorough review
of progress and recommended a number of improvements. These were described in detail in the
Implementation Section above. The Bank also took immediate corrective steps in suspending
Component 3 when corruption allegations surfaced and recommended a Special Audit that later
identified ineligible expenditures. The Bank team prepared an excellent MTR Issues Paper in
2008 and kept a very close eye on the project, undertaking regular reviews and ensuring that steps
were taken, especially concerning the resolution of the ineligible expenditure issue. During the
political crisis, the Bank was also very responsive and flexible in allowing three components to be
implemented during the suspension period of the entire portfolio. This was critical for the
continuity of service provision and greatly impacted the eventual outcome of this project. Also,
when the health project closed in 2009, the Bank used the opportunity to improve the management


                                                 36
of this project by recommending to transfer the responsibility to the MOH PIU. This turned out
to be a very effective decision. All these recommendations were finally reflected in the formal
project restructuring in December 2011 which the Bank team clearly wanted to undertake ever
since 2008 as this is mentioned in almost every ISR. Unfortunately, the restructuring was delayed
as a result of the political crisis and the suspension of the portfolio, as discussed earlier. Importantly,
the necessary corrective measures were taken and were already being implemented and there were
frequent and regular Bank supervision missions which reviewed project progress in detail and
attempted to resolve additional bottlenecks through this process.

Lastly, the Bank did an excellent job in ensuring continuity of support for the critical needs in the
health sector through the preparation of AF which also provided funds for NGO contracts for
targeted prevention of HIV/AIDS. The design of the AF was very poverty focused and included
a number of innovative approaches such as the results-based financing pilot and the voucher
scheme providing free medications for pregnant women and children under 5. The design of the
AF was effective and the lessons of its implementation have been used by the Emergency project
currently under implementation. The Government programs targeting women and children will
also be able to build on these lessons.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The overall rating reflects the Bank’s overall positive and strong support to the GOM’s efforts to
fight HIV/AIDS and to strengthen the health and nutrition sectors during the last decade. Issues
during the design phase as well as the political constraints outside the Bank’s control had a negative
effect on the project. However, through a number of concerted efforts such as flexibility during
implementation, restructuring and AF, the Bank was able to impact positively on the final outcome
of the project. Therefore, on balance, the rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
During project preparation and subsequent several years, the Government of Madagascar was
deeply committed to curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS with the program personally spearheaded
by the President from 2005-2009. The Government had and continues to have a clear National
Strategic Plan, aligned with UNAIDS “Three Ones” principle. The Government has an established
mechanism for the coordination and management of the program and the project financed by the
Bank as well as other donors. This includes the CNLS at the center with its ES to oversee and
coordinate the program (Executive Secretary overseeing project implementation), the Regional
HIV/AIDS Prevention Committee (CRLS) and 22 Regional Coordination Units (UCR) charged
with day-to-day management of activities and liaising between the ES/CNLS and Local HIV/AIDS
Committees (CLLS) which are in turn responsible for developing a local plan in the fight against
HIV/AIDS and mobilizing the local population and resources.

During project implementation, the Government took steps to improve the operational
effectiveness of the program at all levels, through an external institutional review which was
carried out in 2008 (see below). The Government also responded effectively to necessary changes
in the project design and to the need for greater effectiveness in project management. The decision

                                                   37
by Government, under advisement by the Bank and the ES/CNLS was to transfer responsibility
for day-to-day project management to the PIU of the health project to manage the remaining period
of implementation (2010-2014), which greatly improved implementation. Also, the Government
took on the challenge associated with corruption allegations in 2008 by carrying out the 2009
Special Audit, and took steps to correct the identified ineligible expenditures by returning the funds
per agreements with the Bank. The Government also supported the proposed project restructuring
and was eager to ensure that resources would be spent on the most effective interventions.

Clearly, the 2009 political crisis had a major deleterious effect on the country and also on the
project. This resulted in serious implementation delays which required two project extensions
until the end of 2012. Despite the enormity of the challenge, the implementation mechanisms put
in place turned out to be quite effective and the project was able to fully disburse its funds and
complete all planned activities. The implementation of the AF was especially effective, with all
funds disbursed within 1.5 years.

The Government (with ES/CNLS in charge) clearly understands the overall need for a targeted
response to HIV/AIDS. With reduced donor funding, the Government has increased its own share
of the budget, as discussed above. Nonetheless, this only represents 9% of the program needs and
the Government has to take a proactive approach to ensure that the program remains viable in order
not to lose the momentum gained during previous years.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall responsibility for program implementation rested with ES/CNLS, with the ES (Project
Director) overseeing day-to-day project implementation by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
inside CNLS. Initial years of implementation were marked by inefficiencies and delays, including
delays in initiation of key activities, hiring consultants, conducting various studies, approving
annual work plans, procurement plans, carrying out evaluations of activities, etc. The heavy
organizational structure of the ES/CNLS with 76 staff (one of the largest national AIDS
committees in the world) and the PIU suffered from a lack of internal communications, lack of
delegation of authority and weak management capacity of staff. In response to these challenges,
and to align itself with the Government policy on decentralization, in 2008, ES/CNLS took on an
institutional review of its functions. The review identified several constraints and recommended
steps required to improve existing arrangements, including the need to: (i) revitalize the ES/CNLS
mandate on being in charge of setting strategic directions of the HIV/AIDS response, i.e. to focus
ES/CNLS’s role on coordination, planning, monitoring and evaluation of the HIV/AIDS Program;
(ii) delegate the management of the response to the regions in accordance with the national
decentralization policy by transferring to regions funds management responsibility; (iii) clarify
roles and responsibilities of the ES/CNLS staff, also streamlining staff composition; and (iv)
separate program coordination functions from project management functions.

Based on these recommendations, a new organizational structure was put in place which reflected
reorientation from centralized management to delegation of authority to the regions, more rapid
decision-making, and more clarity and efficiency of processes. Importantly, the responsibility for
project management was transferred to the PIU already in place in the MOH. The initial step in


                                                 38
this transfer was already made in 2008 when MOH took over the direct responsibility for
implementing Component 2 of the project (health response) by taking over procurement, FM and
disbursement (under its own Special Account for that component). The previous arrangement of
having a single Special Account managed by the ES/CNLS proved to be ineffective with severe
delays in disbursement of funds for MOH activities. Subsequently, at the start of 2010, the
PIU/MOH took over the responsibility for overall project management, with ES/CNLS continuing
its oversight and coordination functions. Given that only three components were left to be
implemented, including the latest Component 2 on health response, this new set-up made much
more sense.

After this change, the PIU/MOH worked effectively to jump-start the implementation of the
project and implementation became much more effective, also enabling the ES/CNLS to focus on
the priorities for the national program, coordination, partner dialogue and monitoring and
evaluation. Project implementation improved to the point where project ratings for both the PDO
and IP were upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory by November 2011. This also enabled the AF
to be prepared and approved given that one of the pre-conditions for AF was satisfactory
implementation of the parent project. Given the urgency to address the needs in the health sector,
the turning-around of this project was all that more significant. All in all, 60% of total project
funding, plus the new AF, was disbursed in 4 years despite the effects of the political crisis which
lingered until the end of 2013 when national elections took place.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The overall rating for the Borrower performance is a reflection of a challenging project start-up,
the highly challenging political and economic context, and the immense efforts made to implement
a project which changed its design and management structure mid-way. The rating is a testament
to the willingness and ability of the original implementing agency to learn and adapt to changing
circumstances, and the energy with which the new PIU took on its new role.

6. Lessons Learned

The lessons of this project can be broken down into two categories, i.e. those reflecting (a)
project weaknesses that other projects should aim to avoid to ensure a more effective
implementation; and (b) project strengths that could be inspirational for current and future
operations.

(a) Project weaknesses
    • For repeater projects to be effective, (i) sequencing/timing needs to be considered carefully
       to avoid a situation, as in this project, where the first two years were spent on completing
       the implementation of the first project rather than starting the second; (ii) teams need to
       take time to carry out the necessary analysis in order to identify the most effective activities
       and approaches carried out under the original project; (iii) implementation arrangements
       should be re-assessed; (iv) lessons of the parent project should be taken into account.
    • If project restructuring involves substantial changes to the design of components, and re-
       aligning of RFs and costs, teams should review more carefully if the PDO should also be
       changed to adequately reflect the restructuring.

                                                  39
   •   In countries such as Madagascar, where high-risk groups are still the main drivers of the
       HIV/AIDS epidemic, project efforts and expenditures should be concentrated on these
       groups to yield maximum results. Given that youth (under 15 years of age) represent
       roughly 50% of the population, are prone to high-risk behaviors and have low levels of
       knowledge about transmission and high stigma, awareness efforts through peer educators
       should be targeted on this group more forcefully.

(b) Project strengths
    • Rigorous selection process (clear selection criteria, terms of reference, competitive process,
       including an interview) for peer educators is critical to ensure that they can be effectively
       trained and carry out prevention activities in the way intended.
    • Use of mobile phones to simplify/reduce time lags, for example for updating information
       on drug stock-outs in health centers, should be considered by similar projects as a
       potentially very low cost and very high impact design feature.
    • A flexible approach to implementation, including finding non-traditional solutions to
       resolving implementation bottlenecks, should be systematically encouraged. In the case of
       this project, a transition to an experienced MOH PIU mid-way was a critical decision which
       paved the way to a successful completion of the project. The alternative would have been
       a painful lengthy process of re-hiring and training of staff of the previous PIU which would
       have taken substantial time and may not have led to the same results.
    • As this project demonstrated in its efforts to improve data collection and analysis,
       approaches to management of HIV/AIDS programs need to be periodically reviewed and
       rethought based on latest data and implementation success rates. This requires a
       continuous learning process among key partners and stakeholders involved so that lessons
       are regularly incorporated for better management of the program.
    • In active fragile state contexts, Bank financing can play an important role in protecting
       valuable and well-established implementation and program management capacity, which
       is critical for both current and future implementation of sectoral programs. In the case of
       Madagascar, the US$6 million in Additional Financing was critical to the preservation of
       institutional structures, service delivery systems and capacities built over several years and
       this incremental investment was significantly less than building systems from the ground
       up if these institutions and systems collapse.
    • Challenging contexts can be seen as an opportunity to find more creative mechanisms to
       continue support for critical services to beneficiaries. Rather than exiting the country
       completely or solely relying on parallel systems with NGOs, the Bank worked with the
       client to design financing that largely focused on existing regional, district and community
       level systems to maintain service delivery while ensuring that adequate fiduciary
       safeguards were designed for the context.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies: The ICR was shared with the Government of Madagascar
(including ES/CNLS and the MOH PIU) and comments were received from the Executive
Secretary of the ES/CNLS acknowledging the opportunity which this ICR has provided to re-
evaluate the mixed and challenging history of the last decade of the fight against STIs, HIV/AIDS
and the need to continue a more focused effort on high-risk groups.

  Amounts as presented in the Project Paper for the Additional Financing, May 31, 2012. Using the SDR/US$ exchange rate of
December 23, 2011 when the restructuring was approved, the total amount is essentially the same, US$31 million (Component
2 being $12.4 million instead of $12.5 as presented above.)

 The actual component costs at the end of the project were confirmed by the Project Implementation Unit (UGP of the MOH).
However, historical disbursed total in the Bank’s Client connection for the project is US$35.71 million for the original project
and AF, not US$37.1 million. In fact, SDR 604,607.58 was cancelled (component 3) and the AF did not disburse SDR
460,808.28 (US$653,117.41 equivalent).

   Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

   1. Introduction
   Madagascar is among the few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with low prevalence of
   HIV/AIDS, estimated at 0.4% in 2013. An estimate by UNAIDS is that 54,000 people were living
   with HIV/AIDS in Madagascar in 2013. There were approximately 3,100 new HIV infections in
   2013, showing a 39 percent decline in the number of new infections from about 5,100 in 1990. It
   is estimated that HIV prevalence among adults gradually increased from 0.2% in 1990 to 0.7% in
   2006. Since then, it has been on a declining trend. Meanwhile, deaths due to AIDS have remained
   at roughly 5200-5500 people per year since 2005, according to UNAIDS estimates. The literature
   indicates that the relatively low HIV prevalence can be attributed to a combination of factors
   including geography (i.e. being Madagascar being an island), the limited infrastructure capacity
   curtailing movement of the population within the island, and the widely spread practice of
   circumcision (about 95 percent of males were circumcised in 2013).

2. The Economic Impact of HIV Prevention Activities

Phase 1 (2005-2008): No economic or financial analysis was actually carried out during the
preparation of this project or during project restructuring. The PAD did refer that project design
was informed by the detailed economic analysis on HIV/AIDS done under the Bank Multi-Country
HIV/AIDS Program for the Africa Region (Report No. 20727 AFR, paragraphs 76-78 - 2004). The
analysis demonstrated the impact of the epidemic on economic development and poverty as well
as the cost-benefit of HIV/AIDS interventions. This report presented results of models of the cost-
effectiveness of different interventions in different prevalence situations, assuming various levels
of effectiveness in terms of proportion of infections averted. In a lower prevalence situation, such
as in Madagascar, the report indicated that prevention among sex workers (SW) is most cost-
effective, while PMTCT and workplace programs have a medium level of cost effectiveness and
medium impact. Blood safety and condom distribution have a medium cost-effectiveness and low
impact. The report also showed that community mobilization, mass media, STI treatment, and
education interventions are least cost-effective with low impact in a low prevalence situation. The
majority of activities carried out during Phase 1 included mass media, communications, education,
screening/testing and condom promotion and distribution for the general population, as well as for
some target groups such as sex workers and youths (15-24). Therefore, it can be inferred that the
impact of these activities was in the low to medium range. However, it is important to note that
such models cannot account for the particular circumstances of each country. For example, it is
clear that in Madagascar, despite its low HIV prevalence, the high STI rates make condom
distribution and STI screening and treatment more cost effective than the model would show.

                                STI treatment
                                Education

Phase 2 (2010-2014): The prevention efforts under this phase included peer educator outreach
(incl. training and education of peer educators), condom distribution, promotion of screening tests
for STIs and HIV/AIDS, outreach activities for youths, plays, leaflet distribution, local radio
announcements, training to department officials, heads of communes and health centers. These
prevention activities carried out by the 5 NGOs successfully targeted high-risk population groups,
including the youth between the ages 15-24, military personnel and sex workers. The prevention
activities targeted a total of 150,325 beneficiaries, 124,412 of which were the youth (83 percent of
all beneficiaries), 13,004 were military personnel (9 percent) and 12,412 (8 percent) were SWs.
Caveats. First, it was not possible to calculate the exact number of new HIV infections averted
each year and averted productivity losses annually, as it was not clear how many beneficiaries the

                                                50
project was able to reach annually. Therefore, the calculation of averted infections uses the total
number of beneficiaries targeted during the 4 years. Secondly, available prevalence rates of HIV
for each risk group were used as proxies to estimate the averted number of new HIV infections.
However, these figures should be interpreted with caution, as HIV prevalence, by definition, not
only represents the new HIV infections but also older cases at a specific point in time.

Methodology. Despite these difficulties, the impact of project activities could be assessed by
estimating (i) the total number of productive life years saved, (ii) the averted loss of productivity,
and (iii) the averted high cost of treatment. The average number of productive years saved per
person is estimated by subtracting the retirement age from the average year of HIV infection. The
averted loss of productivity is calculated by multiplying the number of averted new HIV infections
by the average lifetime productivity loss averted. Calculating the average lifetime productivity loss
averted entails establishing a low- and a high-estimate. The low-estimate indicates the total
productivity loss averted over the productive life span if the individual is infected with HIV in the
absence of prevention activities and receives adequate care. In this scenario, adequate care is
assumed to avert some degree of productivity loss and increases life expectancy compared to an
infected patient without care. The high-estimate assumes that the infected patient receives no care,
resulting in further deterioration of productivity and lower life expectancy compared to an infected
patient who receives care.

The assumptions are as follows:

     •   The prevalence rate for each high-risk group are 1.16% for the youth, 0.5% for military
         personnel and 1.36% for SWs.6
     •   On average, an averted infection provides an individual with 29 more years of productive
         life. This is calculated as retirement age of 60 years minus the average age of HIV
         infection of 31 years. 7
     •   The average value of the first year of productive life saved is US$463 in 2013, the
         equivalent of GDP per capita (current US$). The average value of the subsequent
         productive years until retirement were discounted with a rate of 3%. It is assumed an
         annual GDP per capita growth rate 8 of 0.2% over the period.
     •   On average, it takes 5 years for the disease to progress and translate into productivity
         losses and health care costs for individuals.


6
  The HIV prevalence for military personnel was not available at the time of writing this report. This
calculation assumes that the prevalence of HIV for military personnel is the same for all adults. This figure
is considered a conservative estimate keeping in mind that military personnel has higher prevalence of
syphilis, the presence of which increases the risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV.

7
  The average age of HIV infection is calculated by averaging the HIV infection age of 27.5 years for
females and 34.4 years for males.

8
 This figure is from the latest available data with a positive growth value from World Development
Indicators, 2015.


                                                     51
     •   On average, an infected patient with adequate care lives 25 years after infection and loses
         10% productivity after infection.
     •   On average, an infected patient without adequate care lives 8 years after infection and
         loses 20% productivity. This may be a conservative estimate since the loss of productivity
         may be experienced earlier or at greater level.
     •   The average cost of care per patient is US$457, which is calculated as the weighted
         average of the cost of first line of ARV treatment of US$403 and the cost of second line
         of ARV treatment of US$583 (7:3 ratio). This figure does not include treatment cost of
         opportunistic infections.
Summary of findings. Table 2 summarizes the benefits of averting new HIV infections and is
comprised of the number of averted HIV infections, years of productive life saved, loss of
productivity (by averting infection avoiding loss of productivity and shortened life expectancy),
and the averted cost of care.

Based on the attribution rates (prevalence) for each high-risk group, the project averted a total of
1,683 new HIV infections, the majority of which are the youth between the ages of 15-24.
Furthermore, the prevention activities covered under the project averted loss of productivity
between US$2,487,591 and US$10,203,111. These activities also resulted in savings of
US$19,225,620 from AIDS treatment.

The HIV prevention activities targeted towards these high-risk population groups have additional
benefits that are not captured in this assessment. Firstly, by targeting the youth, the project helped
efforts to address the spread of HIV among young people in reproductive age, which results in
decline in life expectancy, labor supply and overall productivity. The young people in Madagascar
are particularly at risk of HIV infection due to injected drug use, unfavorable sexual behaviors (e.g.
unprotected sexual activity, multiple sexual partners) and the lack of HIV/AIDS awareness.
Furthermore, it should be noted that the main benefits of these prevention activities are borne from
targeting a large number of the youth population. In fact, the benefits of targeting the youth is
arguably greater since the low- and high-estimate figures do not take into account the long-term
benefit of maintaining a healthy youth population on the labor force (e.g. averted high rates of
absenteeism, high labor force turnover, increased healthcare cost).



                                                 52
Secondly, by targeting the military personnel, the project contributed efforts to address the high
prevalence of STIs among the members of military. The literature indicates that the presence of
STIs increase the risk of HIV transmission. The recent studies show that the prevalence of syphilis
is significantly higher for military personnel (16.7%) than the overall national average (3.8%).
Finally, the literature shows that the SWs are among the most vulnerable to HIV infection due to
having multiple sex partners, inconsistent condom use, social and legal factors (e.g. stigmatization
and marginalization), injected drug use and mobility. They are also among the most perceptive to
HIV prevention efforts 9 and in general, the most cost-effective group to target.

The total cost and estimated total benefits from STI/HIV/AIDS prevention activities is shown in
Table 3. Based on the estimated total benefits and cost, the project resulted in net benefits between
US$17,115,734 and US$24,831,254. Keeping in mind that the annual government budget for
HIV/AIDS was about US$4 million, including loans, the benefits of the prevention component are
high.

3. The Economic Impact of HIV Treatment and Care Activities
The World Bank provided US$430,567 for HIV treatment and care activities, including
procurement of ARVs for a portion of infected patients under treatment between 2009 and 2014
(695 by 2014). Prior to project implementation, in 2008, there were reported 384 people were
living with HIV and 162 infected patients received HIV treatment and care, corresponding to about
42% treatment coverage. In the course of project implementation, the reported cases of people
living with HIV/AIDS and the number of treated patients increased steadily. By 2014, there were
reported 1,191 people living with HIV and 744 people received treatment and care in 2014. Based
on these estimates, treatment coverage reached 62% in 2014. It should be noted that there are
significant disparities between these actual numbers and UNAIDS estimates (see Figure 1) of
people living with HIV, new HIV infections, and AIDS deaths.

  Efforts to achieve sizable reductions in national HIV prevalence in countries like Cambodia,
the Dominican Republic and Thailand were supported by initiatives targeting SWs and their
client networks.

Methodology. The economic impact of HIV treatment and care activities carried out under the
project component can be estimated in terms of (i) the number of productive life years saved and
(ii) the averted loss of productivity. To estimate the averted loss of productivity, it is assumed that
the beneficiaries of treatment and care component would not have received adequate care in the
absence of the Project. As before, it is assumed that on average, an infected patient with adequate
care lives 25 years after infection; it takes 5 years for the disease to translate into productivity loss;
and the average value of the first productive life year saved is as before US$463 in 2013.

Findings. Table 4 shows the stream of benefits from HIV treatment and care component of the
project. The treatment and care activities carried out under this component targeted 695 infected
patients and resulted in 17,375 years of productive life years saved and averted loss of productivity
valued at US$4,213,988.

The stream of costs and benefits of HIV treatment and care activities under the project component
is shown in Table 5. An annual break down of costs associated with the treatment component of
the Project was not available. In the absence of this data, the annual costs are extrapolated based
on the assumption that the yearly cost of treatment and care activities is proportional to the number
of patients received care in that year.

Project Background, Development Objectives and Design
Between 2005 and 2012, the epidemics type concentrated within key populations that are the most at risk
of infection in Madagascar is confirmed by epidemiological surveys surveillance. HIV prevalence is
evaluated less than 1% (0.4% in 2013) in the adult population at large. But the high prevalence of STIs,
including syphilis (6.4% among women- EDS 2008-2009) would be a major cofactor of HIV transmission.
This also reflects the magnitude of risk behaviors. Moreover, growing poverty remains a major vulnerability
factor. The broad guidelines in response to STIs, HIV and AIDS in Madagascar drew their sources from
three (3) basic documents: (i) the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP); (Ii) the Madagascar Action Plan for
an effective response to HIV and AIDS; and (iii) the National Strategy for the Fight against STIs
2007-2012.

The legal framework of PMPS II and FA is defined, in addition, by bilateral agreements between the
Republic of Madagascar and the International Development Association (IDA): Credit Agreement No.
4104-MAG dated July 13, 2005 of       a SDR 20.2 million amount for the PMPS II (US$30 million) and
Credit Agreement No. 5124 concluded July 27, 2012 in a SDR 3.9 million amount (i.e., US$6,000,000) for
the PMPS II - Additional Financing.

Development objectives for PMPS II consist in supporting the Government's efforts to promote a multi-
sectorial response to the HIV/AIDS crisis and containing the spread of HIV/AIDS over its territory.
Moreover, it initially includes five components, namely i) Component 1: Harmonizing, coordinating donors
and strategies, (ii) Component 2: Support to the response of the health sector; (iii) Component 3: Support
funds to the prevention of STIs, HIV and AIDS and management; (iv) Component 4: Monitoring and
evaluation; and (v) Component 5: Project Management. The PMPS II runs from 2005 to 2012.

The Additional Financing (AF) or PMPS II - FA expands the scope of PMPS II Project with a view to
providing a set of low-cost, high-impact essential interventions in the areas of health, nutrition and
HIV/AIDS, to vulnerable groups, namely pregnant women and under five years old children and to the
populations the most exposed to HIV/AIDS risk, thus helping to mitigate some of the negative impacts of
the current political crisis that the country is currently experiencing regarding population well-being. For a
period of 18 months extending from April 2013 to September 2014, PMPS II FA is structured as follows
(i) Component 1: Strengthening Health, Nutrition and HIV/AIDS Services; (ii) Component 2: Monitoring
and Evaluation, and (iii) Component 3: Project Management and Capacity Building

1. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Results
PMPS II was designed in 2005 and started only in 2007. Although POA PMPS II 2006 obtained the notice
of non-objection in November 2006, no implementation was completed in 2006 given that GIS was not yet
functional. The National 2007-2012 Strategic Plan served as a reference framework. And a Project
Implementation Manual was designed in February 2006. Two institutional audits of central and peripheral
levels were made in 2008. It was found out that few structures created in 2002 worked and fulfilled their
mandates. The various committees and councils left the ES/CNLS without control and the latter, in
agreement with the PTF, and facing the difficulty of outsourcing some of its actions, has evolved into an
executive agency rather than a multi-sector coordination structure. Restructuring was necessary.

Component 1 relating to harmonizing and coordinating donors was suspended from 2010, most set goals
were reached. For Component 2, support to the health sector to provide care and support to PLWHA was
provided more or less normally. In addition, allegations of resources misuse in implementing FAP
component 3 came out of supervisions. Some dysfunctions in processing tenders and awarding funding to
FAP subprojects have been reported while those in charge of monitoring, supervision and evaluation of
subprojects were overwhelmed by the excessive number of sub-projects. The institutional audit also noted
the low level of technical capacity of OFs in charge of supporting local response sponsors. FAP activities
were suspended temporarily and permanently thereafter. The arrangements put in place, such as AGF and
OFs have been cancelled. The mid-term in December 2008 issued the need to restructure the ES/CNLS and
the update of the Project Manual. Component 4 relates to monitoring, to collection of epidemiological data
and to audits and evaluations. Finally, component 5 has experienced management punctuated by
amendments, suspensions, and restructuring at the beginning of the project. It was more stable afterwards.

The 2009 political crisis occurring in Madagascar has led to the suspension of disbursements. Furthermore,
ineligible expenditures worth approximately US$509,344.36, of which US$434,010.36 on the FAP had to
be repaid by the Borrower, by instalments and become conditionality. Thereafter resumed disbursements
in late 2009 involved only 3 components (2, 4 and 5) and a two-year extension was secured taking into
account of funds availability (January 2010 to December 2011). A reformed second Implementation
Manual was designed. Following the suspension of disbursements in 2009, much of the key personnel at
the UGP PMPS in the ES/CNLS left. The remaining team, composed mostly of assistants could not respond
satisfactorily and opportunely to the requirements of the Project. PMPS II management was then transferred
to the UGP Santé. ES/CNLS therefore fulfilled the role of National Project Director in charge of
management and coordination while the CN-UGP Santé played the role of Assistant Manager by assuming
with his team the technical and fiduciary management of the Project. The project was restructured in
December 2011. This consisted in (i) maintaining the deemed relevant project components, i.e., Component
2 (the health sector response) component 4 (Monitoring and Evaluation) and component 5 (Project
Management); (ii) reallocating existing funds, (iii) revising the indicators to achieve the project
development objectives; and (iv) extending the closing date until the end of 2012. In February 2012, the
appointment of a new National Coordinator of the UGP was carried out without the prior agreement of both
parties, so which was not consistent with the terms set in the initial Credit agreement. The request by the
Bank to begin a process of repealing the Decree was honored. Finally, a two year (2013-2014) Additional
Fund for revising the Project development objectives terminates PMPS II which thus extends from 2005 to
2014.

Achievements per component were at 86% of the amounts programmed in 2010-2011.
Components 1 and 3 - not eligible for the extension phase of the PMPS II - and Component 5 paid budgeted
arrears on each component. Deliveries and payments were spread over two years 2010-2011. More or less
important delays by suppliers in relation to delivery dates agreed in contracts have been recorded thus
postponing the start of activities. The year 2012 still experienced another restructuring of forecasts or allocated
credit. Disbursement by expenditure category is then as follows:

For the year 2012 the project disbursed an amount estimated at US $ 2,627,463, distributed to component 2 -
Support to Health Sector response, in component 4 - monitoring and evaluation, and to component of Project
management.
In sum, US$29,000,000 was allocated to PMPS II from 2007 to 2012. And the total disbursement during
this period, which is the total duration of PMPS II, is US$28,816,026, i.e., 99.37% of the credit allocated.

The problems encountered are at the level of (i) relatively low disbursement at the beginning of period because
of an overestimation of the estimated budget, the non-occurrence of a large part of the activities by similarity
with the activities of PMPS I, the strategy change or the slowness of preparations; (ii) the suspension of FAP
in October 2008 owing to irregularities in Fund management; (iii) the socio-economic problems experienced
by the country in 2009 followed by a suspension of any supply of the project account, resumed only in 2009
for arrears payment; (iv) the numerous restructuring experienced by the project during extensions. The financial
part of PMPS II is rated moderately satisfactory.

Disbursement amounts to US$4,459,978.48 as of August 31, 2014 - equivalent to 74.33% of initial amount
Remaining balance is estimated at US$1,540,021.52, i.e., 25.67% of the initial amount allocated.

The difficulties encountered are (i) the delay in the date of entry into force and the first disbursement which
caused a delay in implementation and low disbursement; (Ii) the recruitment of 33 NGOs for the implementation
of nutrition activities which was delayed because of the legal status of some NGOs; and (iii) the budget allocated
to the implementation of the funding model based on the results, which was underestimated at planning. The
financial part of FA is rated satisfactory.

     4. Institutional Audit
The Institutional Audit assesses institutional capacity in the implementation of PMPS II and FA project. Two
implementation manuals of PMPS II were developed: the first one in February 2006 and the second one in
January 2010. In addition, two institutional audits were conducted together under the Project. The first one
performed in May 2008 relates to external institutional audit of the organization' of response to HIV at the
central level. The second one of the same type approached the peripheral level. As described previously,
institutional arrangements were restructured after 2009 with the extension of the project in 2010. Innovations
have still been introduced with the second extension. The period of the 2013 -2014 Additional Fund is another
step of the Project. For the second Manual of 2010, institutional arrangements for PMPS II include several
levels: 1) the PMPS II advisory, supervision and coordination bodies; 2) the management bodies and 3) the
technical implementation bodies.

        4.1 PMPS II ADVISORY, SUPERVISION AND COORDINATION BODIES

Two bodies are involved in advising and overseeing the implementation of the PMPS: a) PMPS Board; and b)
the ES/CNLS.
a) PMPS Board: PMPS Board is the structure for monitoring and coordinating PMPS II. PMPS Board consists
of seven (07) members representing the following institutions and organizations: The Presidency, the Ministry
of Finance and Budget (MFB), the Ministry in charge of Health, The Executive Secretary of CNLS,
international partners, the civil society and associations of PLWHA.
b) ES/CNLS (ES/CNLS). The ES/CNLS is the body that provides strategic guidance in responding to
HIV/AIDS, and ensures the effectiveness of the three principles of oneness. It provides policy and strategic
support, promises partnerships, mobilizing resources at the national and international levels and guarantees the
protection of human rights. As a guarantor of the alignment and harmonization of contributions from
stakeholders in responding to AIDS, ES/CNLS sees to the implementation of PMPS II in accordance with the
National Strategic Plan. The management of PMPS II was then delegated to UGP Santé. Moreover, with the
extension of the project, arrangements for conducting the implementation concluded between the ES/CNLS and
the UGP define the obligations of the ES/CNLS. The fact of being connected to the President’s office of the
Republic witnessed the importance granted to the country regarding the fight against HIV/AIDS. The Executive
Secretary of CNLS is the National Director of PMPS II FA in charge of steering and coordination. As such, he
provided donor coordination and, for other sectors, coordination with the latter’s sub-projects and the
corresponding Strategic Groups - Infrastructure, Tourism, Transport and Population, as well as implementation
of mechanisms responsible for regional coordination of the AIDS response.




                                                           68
         4.2 MANAGEMENT BODY
The main management body the Unit for managing the Projects supporting the Health Sector (UGP). It is
under the technical supervision of the Ministry in charge of Public Health 10 of which it is connected to the
Secretariat General Staff according to the organization chart. Its main task is to coordinate the implementation
of activities of PMPS II, to ensure effective and efficient management of the resources available to the project,
and ensure the proper implementation of the project. The Unit for managing the Projects supporting the Health
Sector (UGP) provided the management of PMPS II and FA in the second phase of the Project. Effective
collaboration between UGP and ES/CNLS has led the project to completion. ES/CNLS provided the National
Project Management. The National Coordinator of the UGP Santé played the role of the Deputy Director. The
rest of the team is based within the UGP Santé: The National Director and Deputy Director played a key role
in representing the national side for negotiating disbursement resumption, repayment terms, the two extensions
of the project and obtaining the Additional Fund. Fiduciary management is provided by the UGP Santé under
the guidance of National Project Coordinator.

       4.3 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION BODIES
Such implementing agencies include: a) The Ministry in charge of Public Health and b) the Civil Society
Organizations (OSCs).

a) The Ministry in charge of Public Health, called Vice Prime Minister’s office in charge of Public Health was
between August 2009 and July 2010 responsible for the management of the health sector facing HIV and AIDS
by Decree No. 2009-1220 of 6 August 2009. The Service for Fighting against STIs and AIDS (SLISTS) 11 is
the structure within such ministry that is responsible for implementing and monitoring programs for prevention
and therapeutic management of STIs and HIV according to established norms and standards, and according to
the broad lines of the National Strategic Plan (PSN). The areas of prevention and management under biology
as well as essential studies and surveys are devoted to the Service of National Reference Laboratory (LNR).
). SALAMA Central Purchasing body provided remarkable services in the acquisition and delivery of
essential products and medicines to the fight at the Health Districts services. Contracts with the technical
assistant to the PNLS (previously SLIST) and technical assistance with the SLNR have been carried out, given
the proven importance of their input in implementing the activities of their assignment entities.

b) The Civil society. The Civil society relates to Grassroots Community Organizations (OCB) involving the
population, to associations of PLWHA and to those of other people most at risk such as MADAIDS or other
FIMIZORE, or MSM FIFAFI. The activities of psychosocial support associations helped find again lost sight
of PLWHA in the intervention regions, thereby keep the active file of monitored PLWHA. NGOs were also
mobilized throughout the PMPS II and FA. Existing NGOs which were proven and documented are a little
different; as they were financed on results, on well-defined targets in priority areas in a given period, they
contributed positively to reaching the objectives set at the end of PMPS II and FA: PSI, MSM, ADRA, ASOS
and SISAL that were recruited during the Project extension phase depending on performance-based contract in
120 communes in 16 Regions of Madagascar. The cost for funding NGO participation remains high and difficult
to sustain. However, the concept of civil society, mobilizing the population on a voluntary basis, including

 Prior to 2009, the Ministry in charge of Health is called Vice Prime Minister’s office in charge of Public
Health (VPCSP); it is only during the transition from 2009 to 2013 that the department became again Ministry
of Public Health.

11
     SLIST became PNLS afterwards = National Program for the Fight against STI / HIV / AIDS.



                                                       69
people involved in a cause and a work that improves their living conditions, which may require from
government authorities transparency and good governance remains to be developed thereafter.

The First Implementation Manual differs slightly from the above -mentioned structures. Prior to 2009, the
coordination structures were reinforced by (i) the Multi-sectorial Technical Committee (CTM), which was
mandated to ensure that the multi-sectorial nature of the fight is reflected in the operationalization of the
National Strategic Plan In order to remedy the absence of CNLS, ES/CNLS initiated the partners forum in
which the Government, the United Nations system, the bilateral and multilateral cooperation agencies, the civil
society and the private sector are represented. The terms of reference that were developed are not specific
enough and such forum, an informal body, was not endowed with power, or organization. It cannot act in place
of CNLS and does not have the rights required to drive the ES/CNLS. However, such forum is a place for
exchanges among various actors involved in the fight against HIV/AIDS.

At the intermediate level, the Inter Regional Offices and the UCR (Regional Coordination Units) contributed
to the development of Regions integrated plans and served as a reference to any action at the intermediate level.
Unfortunately, the process of decentralization in the country did not experience tangible and significant
progress; as sectorial efforts that were almost deprived of resource allocation, of power and skills transfer are
not viable and sustainable. Significant efforts were also provided to the peripheral and local level, with the
implementation at local level of Local committees to Fight against AIDS (CLLS). Plans to Fight against AIDS
were thus developed. In 2008, the 1254 communes had CLLS and 832 ones had their PLLS. And municipalities
were categorized into highly vulnerable and moderately vulnerable. It should however be noted that the
suspension of funding for OCB in the implementation of local plans acted as a brake to, or even wiped out the
gains in local response.

In accordance with the content of some components, the organization of the Project benefited from the following
structures before 2009: (i) The Agency for Financial Management (AGF) is a consulting firm in charge of
managing the Fund to support Prevention (FAP). Such fund seeks to implement response strategies by civil
society. In addition, the Agency shall review the eligibility and financial validation of sub-projects under
component 2. Decentralized branches of AGF were at the provincial level. (ii) The Facilitation bodies (OF), a
consortium of international NGOs, recruited and trained to provide the establishment and capacity building of
CLLS, the coaching of developers in the development and implementation of sub-projects, in the
implementation of interventions and the development of business relations under the FAP, and (iii) The Board
of Technical Review ORTensures the technical review of sub projects from components 1 and 2. Proposals of
basic projects submitted to FAP for an amount exceeding USD 10,000 were reviewed by ORT; those exceeding
US$100,000 should be approved by the PMPS Board. A sub-component financed the establishment and
operationalization of the structures involved in the management of FAP. The suspension of FAP II was decided
following irregularities noticed in the management of the Fund: allegations of corruption, dysfunction in the
processing of files submitting subprojects, and statement of low-capacity of mechanisms for monitoring,
supervision and evaluation compared to the very high number of financed sub-projects. Therefore, all the
activities of the Financial Management Agency were suspended in 2008 while an operational and financial audit
of the FAP was conducted by an international firm.

The results of audits carried out in 2008 include an almost universal non reference to the "Three Principles of
Oneness" thus creating a leadership deficit in the fight among the decentralized entities. In addition, there is a
lack of local control vision centered around the universal principle of access by any Malagasy to information
and services on the fight against STIs and HIV/AIDS. Such lack of local vision makes it difficult to detect the
immediate and future impact of activities fighting STIs and HIV/AIDS on the population.

In sum, the current laws were more or less respected; bodies such as the CNLS did not work as they should.
The partner forum could partly compensate for such failure, but requires more restructuring. In addition, the
effective decentralization of the fight experienced a remarkable jump early in the project but that was difficult


                                                       70
to sustain with no more resources and coordination. The use of civil society sometimes requires sometimes
costly measures and requires close monitoring and objectives, as well as outcomes contracted in a well-defined
area. However, tangible results were achieved at the end of the Project. A drastic change in direction occurred
with the FAP in 2008. The Project leadership bodies demonstrated a significant and persistent management
capacity to carry out the PMPS II FA. The institutional part of the report ICR is considered moderately
satisfactory.

5. Evaluation of the Performance of the Bank (IDA) and of the Borrower (Malagasy Government and
implementing agencies)

Performance of the Bank (IDA)
-Despite the obstacles and difficulties encountered during the ten years PMPS II and FA existed, the Bank found
the ways and means to complete the project by negotiating with the national party and in compliance with the
procedures and requirements of the Bank: restructuring components, two extensions of project closing,
transforming project profile into humanitarian actions with OP 7.30, integration of additional actions of the
Bank in the continuation of the AIDS project such as nutrition and health, and the nature of the Emergency
support of PAUSENS project targeting the Education, Nutrition and Health sectors.
-Such perseverance was thus well appreciated in the effort through the portfolio review, the observance of
current standards, in compliance with the changing situation in Madagascar and strengthening the sectors which
have benefited from support. The project targets had to be changed, while maintaining the initial development
objectives
-The Bank has a pool of experts deemed very effective by the national party with regard to support and
supervision of project activities: health, environment, procurement ... The support is nearby because the experts
reside in Antananarivo ensuring regular and appropriate monitoring of the project progress. Regular
supervisions by Bank missions, accompanied by field visits and meetings with national and international
officials throughout the project were well appreciated. Aide-memoires from such missions were very useful for
documenting PMPS II and FA. The support of the Bank is complementing financing from other donors such as
the Global Fund and the United Nations System. Indeed, the PMPS II provides its support through capacity
building among health workers, providing health centers with equipment, drugs for antiretroviral treatment, for
the prophylaxis and treatment of opportunistic infections, and in reagents and consumables for biological
monitoring of PLWHA. -The PMPS I and PMPS II are engaged in the decentralized and local response of fight
actions. Moving in such direction ensures sustainability of the achievements. Suspending halfway such strategy
is seen with suspicion by all national stakeholders. The phase-out measures from the perspective of financing
of decentralized structures would have a less negative impact. The Bank has its share of responsibility in the
structures institutionalized during PMPS and deleted afterwards. -The overlap of PMPS I and II PMPS was not
always easy. If the procedures should be observed in justifying such overlap, it would be better to accelerate
the steps wherever possible. The slow and cumbersome Bank procedures were considered moderately
satisfactory by the national party. Often, finalization and validation of business plans are delayed because the
notice of no objection from the World Bank on the POA and the PPM was received in April and May, as in
2008. A great number of interventions of the World Bank were deemed satisfactory.

Performance of the Borrower (Malagasy Government and Implementing Agencies)
-The ES/CNLS was attached to the President’s office of the Republic of Madagascar. This demonstrated to the
whole world the importance of the fight against AIDS granted by Madagascar. Such leadership at the highest
level had significant impact on the success of the struggle to maintain the prevalence below 1% and was well
appreciated. Commendable efforts led to the multisectoral aspect of the fight against AIDS. Sector strategic
plans were developed and implemented: tourism, work environment, population, education, health, and national
defense. Although enhancements in involved sectors still deserve to be revitalized to maintain the gains, such
aspect is considered moderately satisfactory. The state has a regulatory role in the continued effectiveness of
the plans developed.



                                                       71
- The performance of the national party on the fiduciary and technical management was appreciated in certain
periods of the Project, particularly during the extension periods and continuing to the allocation of additional
funds. The terms of the Financing Agreement (FA) and all other agreements were completed most of the time.
The agreed activities deadlines were then observed. Such skill that was largely acquired in the management of
projects financed by the Bank should be transferred to the whole Ministry of Health, including at intermediate
and peripheral levels and even to all sectors, public, private, and civil society.

- Failing reliable and timely data, the first National Strategic Plans to fight against HIV targeted at first the
general population and the country as a whole. OCBs in the whole territory were included in the strategies and
PMPS I and II were thereto aligned. All resources and efforts were mobilized in this direction. Further to the
results of studies conducted in the course of Projects, amendments complied with the course of action
conducted by focusing further on real groups deemed at risk (TDS young ..) in specific priority areas with
appropriate NGOs (ADRA, ASOS, SISAL, PSI ..). Such lack of database handicaps the actions of the Bank and
the Borrower.

- The CNLS never worked as it should despite the formalization by decree of the members regarding their duty
and operation. ES/CNLS has more or less provided the substitution of such important institution by mobilizing
all other sectors involved in sectorial strategic plans. The forum of partners, though representative of
stakeholders, cannot substitute the CNLS. Such handicap deserves more attention at the Borrower level.

-In The first phase of the Project PMPS II, ES/CNLS under the President’s office of the Republic of Madagascar,
as a Project Implementation Unit provided both the coordination of activities and stakeholders, a well as the
responsibility for implementing certain activities. In addition, the Secretariat managed a great number of
projects related to the fight against HIV/AIDS funded by several donors. The PMPS II was then run as a
Program not as a Project. The new implementation modality of PMPS II adopted by the Borrower as from 2010,
namely the greater support from the Ministry of Health in implementing the health sector response and using
qualified organizations, resulted in better performance in the second phase of the project: fiduciary management
was entrusted to the UGP Santé and restructuring to strengthen the health sector was conducted. ES/CNLS kept
its coordination function and the development of HIV-response strategies. - Component 3 of the initial project
that was implemented largely by the Financial Management Agency (AGF) responsible for Support Fund to
Prevention (FAP) was suspended temporarily and then permanently after statement of irregularities and
unsatisfactory use resources through the financial audit. The Procedures Manual relating to this part of the
Project contained inaccuracies and shortcomings sometimes resulting in ineligible expenditures that had to be
repaid by the Borrower who fulfilled its commitments.

Such component 3 contributed however to considerable awareness raising on HIV/AIDS in the whole territory
of the country, at all levels of responsibility and among populations at risk, even partly. From the denial of the
existence of HIV, knowledge about the disease improved and the national response experienced remarked
developments, as evidenced by the three National Strategic Plans 2001-2006, 2007-2012, and 2013-2017
experienced by the PMPS II and FA.
- Decentralization was always a high and strong strategy advocated by all successive leaders of the Republic of
Madagascar. All agree that such component is a major prerequisite for any harmonious and successful socio-
economic development. Also, any socio-economic project is based on the progress of such strategic approach
as PMPS. Efforts need to be supported to carry out this process.
- The PMPS II and FA lasted about ten years and covered three strategic control plans. The skills of the country
improved and are waiting to be tapped in the overall governance of Madagascar. The rating assigned is
moderately satisfactory.

    6. Assessment of Risks from Development Results

The sustainability of the results obtained under the PMPS II and FA that came to an end remains a major
challenge for the country. The risks of keeping the gains, or not, exist since the country should always later deal
with contingencies and uncertainties. Key points were recorded in that respect. A study action plan to be
conducted (type, periodicity, targets, areas ...) complementing the monitoring and evaluation plan addressing,
among others, studies on HIV to establish and update a national multi-sector database remains crucial to the
fight against poverty in general. Thus, actions conducted with donors would be more documented and decisions
based on reliable information. Resource saving will then be effective. Distributing the annual reports from all
sectors, results of studies and evaluations accessible to all, including policymakers, national and international
stakeholders in socio-economic development and researchers on the web site would also contribute to the
completeness of such database. Such action plan and such measures are needed now that the PMPS II and FA
are closed. Project verticality harms strengthening the Health Sector. Most donors (Global Fund, United
Nations, European Union ...) in their interventions see to the health sector's ability to cope with their ministry,
not only to the actions directed towards priority vulnerable groups (Mother, child, youth, disabled ..) and
towards the fight against endemic diseases. Madagascar should be in a position to maintain the achievements
of the projects and continue the targets set. This remains a major prerequisite for the continuation of
development activities. Major basic functions should maintain a rational management of the entire system:
planning activities, monitoring and evaluation, national information system, qualified human resources,
allocation and management of financial resources, leadership among officials, governance of the entire system
construction and infrastructure maintenance system ... Ensuring the strengthening of such functions in any
project is a necessity.

The existence of the current Strategic Plan for the Fight against HIV and AIDS 2013-2017 is the guarantor of
the continuity of actions conducted under PMPS II and Additional Fund. However, the allocation of government
effective equity and the continued contribution of TFP to a maintenance fund would condition the sustainability
of the achievements. The estimate of the funds required implementing such PSN amounts to at least $150
million for the upcoming 3.5 years.

Collaboration with NGOs was most of the time the approach advocated by the Project in both the first phase at
the end of project. Such process is expensive and puts at a disadvantage sustainable actions, especially with
NGOs and Associations working only in HIV. It would be more appropriate to adopt a more integrated approach
(development -health) for OSCs for more efficiency and effectiveness and to encourage more initiatives by
mobilizing resources. Partnership with the private sector, such as major development projects still remains to
be promoted; this can greatly help in responding to HIV.

For the Health Sector, a National Community Policy exists to harmonize the various actions conducted at
Community level and funded by various donors: Nutrition, Immunization, Water, Hygiene and Sanitation, Fight
against Malaria, Family Planning.... The effectiveness of actions relating to the implementation of such
Community policy is necessary for any community action against HIV/AIDS in collaboration with NGOs or
not. Actual decentralization remains a major prerequisite for the local response in the fight. As long as the
resources, skills and development plans are properly managed at all levels, from the central to the peripheral
and Community level, the sustainability of the achievements of any social action can be only effective. It is a
significant and unavoidable risk. And sustainability is in stable structures of the public sector. The launching
initiative up to a cruising speed is part of actions by the sector and NGOs and associations. The commitment of
the population and structures of decentralized government ministries remains indispensable.

Actions conducted under the Project will serve for the continuation of upcoming interventions for the country.
These include, amongst others, the development and implementation of the National Communication Strategy,
which is admittedly developed at the PMPS I but which remains a reference and has always been very helpful
not only for the fight against HIV/AIDS. There should also be noted staff training on blood transfusion safety

and universal precautions and on blood quality management. Finally, for injections security and waste
management, the program supported the construction of Monfort incinerators in many hospital centers, along
with training of site managers. After 2015, a key period for the MDGs, the sustainability of all was undertaken
is the cross-sectional section to be considered. Indeed, all unsustainable development actions are inefficient
resource uses. This is the great challenge of development.

    7. Lessons Learned

Project Start

The PMPS II experienced a slow startup. If initially the project duration ranged from 2006 to 2009, the
beginning was effective only in February 2007. There were multiple reasons for that: the overlap of the
management of PMPS II with PMPS I which was still under way, slow IDA procedures, the time taken by start-
up procedures, the delay in planning due to the strategic reorientation of the FAP, which was the largest
component of PMPS II, the organization that was affected by the institutional arrangement, etc. Now, such
situations would be avoided by bypassing the parallel management of two or more projects, by considering the
time required for the various prerequisites to the implementation of a project and by intensifying communication
between the UGP and IDA. Anticipatory appropriate steps in the preparation and start-up process are still
needed, particularly in terms of advocacy with national authorities (parliament and government).

Decisions on Institutional organization
Admittedly the PMPS II and FA Project lasted about ten years (2005-2014) with phases of extension,
restructuring and change in development objective. During these years, there was shift from the institutional
arrangement for activities in prevention, care and treatment of HIV/AIDS of Project Approach to Program
approach and vice versa. However, the program approach required an institutional organization of CNLS which
resulted in delays in the implementation of project activities. The institutional audit conducted for this purpose
led to the restructuring of the ES/CNLS by refocusing its role in the coordination, monitoring - evaluation and
mobilization of resources while the own management of project operations was entrusted entirely to the Project
Implementation Units (UGP), which will have some autonomy in the daily management of project activities.
The Project implementation unit of the Sustainable Health Project (PDSSP), which proved its ability and
experience in terms of observance of financial procedures and of the World Bank procurement was designated
to assume such responsibility in the management and the implementation of PMPS II activities from its second
phase . The Project management transfer to the UGP as from 2009, including the fiduciary and technical part,
was carried out by assigning human resources from the UGP and the ES/CNLS. This measure satisfied the Bank
and the Borrower and helped lead the project to completion.

The funding for Regional Coordination Units UCR was stopped and this had its impact on the implementation
of the decentralization of response management of STIs and HIV/AIDS. This fact had huge influence on the
implementation and monitoring of response activities at regional and local level. The efforts commissioning the
unique system of monitoring and evaluation, among others, could not be maintained while data from peripheral
and reports found it hard to recover. It was better not to establish them rather than establishing, and to delete
them afterwards. The implications are difficult to manage.

Overcome the Malagasy socio-political crisis
Despite the constraints and challenges faced by the project, of which the political crisis since March 17, 2009
and which placed Madagascar into the context defined by the OP/BP 7.30 procedures of the World Bank, the
multiple exchanges, sometimes sustainable between IDA and the Malagasy government, helped to make
decisions appropriate to national circumstances in accordance with the objectives of the Project while changing
targets and intervention areas.




                                                       74
Fund to Support Prevention or FAP
In the first phase of PMPS II project, a device consisting of AGF, ORT and the OF was set up to manage
Component 3. Indeed, much of the allocated funds was devoted to such component relating to the FAP
(Prevention Support Fund) to reach the target populations (including vulnerable groups) through the local
response. Unfortunately, such mechanism did not prove successful and the project had to suspend the
component to set up the performance-based contracting strategy with specialized NGOs to remedy the situation
and to build on the achievement of its objectives with the highest risk groups. Good results were obtained, but
sustainability is still a major challenge. For component 3, recourse to qualified non-governmental organizations
working in development in an integrated manner for supervising OCB and local associations would be more
efficient, coupled with the implementation of appropriate risk management system.

Reliable and timely data.
The National Strategic Plans for the Fight against AIDS suffered from a lack of reliable and timely data. The
establishment of a national multi-sector database is part of the existence of a long-term National development
Strategy as a reference to all sectors and dictating the data needs to be collected. Currently, the development
of a Development Plan of the Health Sector takes it long for lack of data which may serve as for the years to
come. It is therefore essential to have an integrated and performing monitoring and evaluation and
epidemiological surveillance system to assist in strategic and operational planning. In addition, the Integrated
Management System (SIG) held a prominent place in the management of PMPS II and FA data. SIG
restructuring has been operated to integrate the monitoring and evaluation component for the updating of data
and consolidation of reports received. However, over time the updating of GIS was not effective until the end
of the first phase, which explains its ineffectiveness in the coordinated management of technical and financial
project data. Such aspect recommends us on how important the study of the implementation of SIG, as well as
the scheme to be applied as soon as the project setup phase. Similarly, capacity building among the units
responsible for monitoring and evaluation at central and decentralized levels was always required: recruitment
of qualified people, updating and designing appropriate documents such as the Monitoring and Evaluation Plan
accompanying the 2007-2012 National Strategic Plan; the document analyzing Madagascar HIV
epidemiological profile; and the Regional Integrated Plan to fight against AIDS. Indeed, data management is
very important in project management and although culture of data collection, exploitation, dissemination and
use remains to be instilled at all levels in Madagascar, it can be said that through good collaboration between
the monitoring and evaluation officials of the ES/CNLS, PNLS and the UGP, the existing data helped the project
monitoring and evaluation in PMPS II management.

Management of PLWHA
Strategic Plans of Response to AIDS also benefited from the contribution of recent discoveries about the
transmission of HIV. A good psychosocial and medical management of PLWHA would significantly reduce
HIV transmission. Unfortunately, many HIV-positive are not managed. According to data from PNLS in 2011,
while 409 people were tested HIV positive, only 190 new infections are enrolled in management. In the same
year, as estimated by UNAIDS, the number of adults and children living with HIV was estimated at 42,000,
whereas the number of people living with HIV in need of antiretroviral treatment in late 2011 was estimated at
19 400. A small portion of those HIV positive people are currently managed. However, this allowed for the
Project to rectify focusing actions on those most at risk - such as Partners of Sex Professionals clients, PS clients,
Sex Professionals of the (PS), and MSM female Partners. Having timely and reliable data proves paramount for
response. Each region has at least one referral physician based at a university hospital CHU or CHRR. In
addition, so-called network physicians received training for locally managing PLWHA and as relays with
referral physicians. They are located at the district level and even at the level of municipalities. In order to
facilitate care continuum and patient follow-up, a diagram showing referral and counter referral of patients were
well developed, but were never made functional in most cases. Now, the well-being and good health of PLWHA
could rely only on a continuum of appropriate and operational care. To do so, commitment, collaboration and
commitment of all actors involved in the comprehensive management of PLWHA is highly recommended.



                                                         75
Furthermore, the existence of the ignorant HIV positive people is a major challenge in fighting HIV/AIDS.
HIV-positive people who are not yet detected, and /or people already tested but lost sight of, primary or
secondary, are reaching a certain proportion in Madagascar. Related strategies are known; but deserve to be
evaluated, and the bottlenecks hampering their effectiveness should be analyzed for possible strategic for
seeking the ones lost sight of and support for PLWHA. Although interventions on awareness raising and
mobilization of the population, especially the people the most exposed to risk to be tested, exist, further efforts
are still to be deployed to find the estimated HIV positive nationally. As regards the psychosocial management
right from screening up to treatment follow-up, many of interventions were conducted, and MADAIDS network,
along with other partners continue their commitment in that direction. However, faults are noticed with the
existence of lost sight of who are unrecovered and who should lead us towards a new reflection on psychosocial
management policy.

Contracting with NGOs
Contracting with NGOs characterized by the Result Based Financing (RBF) Approach is proven. Indeed, this
is an innovative strategy implemented with a view of making interventions more effective and efficient. In
addition, it guided the project to expand its intervention with the RBF pilot project in the health facilities in
order to improve health indicators on maternal and child health. The products are sold and funding, as well as
collaboration with NGO providers are packaged. We thus professionalized the approach and results were
obtained. The results of early experiences helped the project to develop more elaborate mechanisms by crossing
quantitative with qualitative results to improve performance. However, the need to hire an outside independent
verification agency in verifying the authenticity of the results and the quality of service makes this a very costly
approach, and deserves more elaborate ideas and studies to find a more sustainable mechanism in terms of
efficiency.

Integrating activities
Integrating Nutrition, Health and HIV operations is still in effect even under the FA. It should be especially
noted that there is no direct link between nutrition and HIV in the FA in terms of activities and results. The
intervention sites are often different and stakeholders are not always the same. Maybe HIV testing would be
the intervention that can always be integrated, such as Family Planning. Until today, a mobilization of HIV
seropositive for good management remains a major challenge in the fight against HIV / AIDS. Effective
integration of awareness raising to testing and management should amount to a multi-sector action directed at
the highest level of the government.

Waste Management
Taking into account the cross-cutting issue of environmental protection through the medical waste management
plan initiated by the project helped to educate the health staff on practicing daily management of waste in health
and hospital environment and to foster in them the conscious habit of managing them effectively. However, its
extension is a challenge to be implemented at national level.

Monitoring and Evaluation
The monitoring-evaluation part is an important component during the PMPS II and FA. The actions advocated
in the plans deserve a regular and ongoing support to any actor involved in the PMPS II and FA. The existence
of a monitoring plan is an important aid and deserves to be extended to all partners collaborating in the project.

Human Resources
Capacity building among staff and national organizations was mentioned and appreciated by various
interviewees: in the form of training, study tour, international conferences, support and supervision. Workshops
at regional, national and international level were organized as part of the Project, and this left positive impact
on the skills of officials with responsibilities relating to the management of PMPS II and FA. Training on project
management, procurement, financial management or disbursement were very beneficial, and remain as a
contribution of the Project to national competences. These assets could be used in other projects or simply in


                                                        76
improving the overall governance of the organizations involved. Nevertheless, the impact of such activity in
improving project performance should be measured and felt. Furthermore, frequent in-project changes by
decision-makers within ministries responsible of key sectors which are the national representatives of the
Borrower, hampered the smooth running of the project implementation. This affects not only the quality of
planning but at the same time delays the implementation period of activities with impacts in terms of process
indicators and results.
