                         outcome indicators will take place after the next combined Biological and Behavior Study scheduled to go into the field in December 2012. All of the PDO indicators are on track to be
                         achieved. All of the intermediate indicators are on track or have already been achieved. This is a very positive sign towards achieving the PDO by the end of the project and as a
                         result the DO rating has been upgraded to Satisfactory. Project Implementation has remained at Satisfactory, indicating that the Project continues to be implemented in an adequate
                         manner despite a challenging country context.
