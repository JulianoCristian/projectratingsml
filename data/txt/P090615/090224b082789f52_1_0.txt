                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         As agreed during the last mission (May 5-16, 2014), the Project was restructured in July 2014 to allow for a reallocation of remaining resources to the RBF pilot and to better align the
                         baselines and targets to the actual implementation period of the Project. The Project will close as scheduled on September 30, 2014.
