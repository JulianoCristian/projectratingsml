                         The project development objective (PDO) is rated Satisfactory based on the performance of the PDO level indicators (Parent Project). As agreed during the last mission. The Project
                         will be restructured by the end of June to allow for a reallocation of resources to the RBF pilot and to better align the baselines and targets to the actual implementation period of the
                         Project.
