The women in development component\n            includes: (a) strengthening of institutional capacity to\n            better address the needs of women; (b) improvement of\n            women's legal rights through the preparation of a\n            family code; (c) preparation of an action plan to enhance\n            women's participation in development, particularly\n            women's education.  The third component is an\n            accelerated teacher training program which includes: (a)\n            accelerated training of 250 new primary school teachers.\n            Staff training will be included in each of these components\n            to develop the Government's capacity to incorporate the\n            social dimensions into adjustment and development policies\n            and programs."}, "docdt": "1991-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
