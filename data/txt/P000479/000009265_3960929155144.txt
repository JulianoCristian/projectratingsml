MEMORANDTIM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
FOR A SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF ADJUSTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Central African Republic in the amount of SDR
5.6 million (US$6.5 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms with a
maturity of 40 years to help finance a Social Dimensions of Adjustment
and Development (SDAD) Project.
2.    Country Background.  The Central African Republic (CAR) is a
landlocked country, the size of France, in the heart of the continent,
with an estimated population of some 2.9 million in 1989. With a per-
capita GNP of US$419 in 1990, it belongs to the group of least developed
countries. The primary sector, including agriculture, forestry, and
fisheries, is the mainstay of the economy. It accounted for 43 percent
of GDP and 41 percent of commodity exports in 1990 and is estimated to
occupy four-fifths of the population. Mining, manufacturing and
utilities (15 percent), construction (2 percent), and services
(41 percent) account for the balance of GDP. Except for life expectancy
at birth which, at 50 years, is within the average for Sub-Saharan
Africa, the adult literacy rate of 40 percent and a primary enrollment
ratio of 66 percent, the human resource profile for the CAR is below
average for Sub-Saharan Africa.
3.    Sustained attempts at moving away from the economic mismanagement
of the late 1970s, which had caused considerable social and economic
dislocation and international isolation, began only in 1982 when the
Government renewed efforts to promote economic recovery. Between 1982
and 1985 the IMF supported a stabilization program with three stand-by
arrangements. In 1986 a program to lift the structural constraints to
growth was initiated. This has been supported by two structural
adjustment credits (SDR 26.3 million SAL I in 1986, and SDR 28.9 million
SAL II, in 1988), a US$10 million Technical Assistance II credit (1985,
restructured to support SAL I in 1986), and a US$13.2 million Economic
Management Project (EMP), approved in FY89. The African Development
Bank, the EC, and France, along with other bilateral donors, have also
provided substantial financial support to the CAR's adjustment effort.
In 1987 the IMF provided a 12-month stand-by arrangement and a first
tranche of a three-year arrangement under the Structural Adjustment
Facility (SAF); the second tranche was released in December 1988.  A
Policy Framework Paper (PFP) was approved by the Executive Boards of the
Fund and the Bank in May 1990, at the same time as a third-year SAF
program was approved by the Executive Board of the Fund.
4.    In spite of the progress made to date in creating a favorable
environment for a resumption of growth and better utilization and
management of CAR's resources, the current economic situation remains
precarious and the country faces severe development constraints.
Particularly important are the continuing dependence on large injections
of concessional external financing to support the budget and the balance
of payments, deficient domestic resource mobilization, an extremely weak
human capital base and administrative capacity, and poor physical
infrastructure.



-2-
5.    Certain social problems, essentially transitory in nature, have
been exacerbated by some adjustment measures and by CAR's protracted
economic decline to the point where they are continuing to impede
successful implementation of the Government's overall adjustment
efforts. As a zesutl of stagnation in private sector growth and the
freeze on civil service hiring, unemployment and underemployment have
risen. With the voluntary departure program under the civil service
reform, there has been a large loss of primary school teachers in an
educational system with already high student/teacher ratios.
Additionally, the social and economic position of women, who have
suffered more than men from declinirg enrollment rates in schools and
the decline in the provision of primary and motherichild health care, is
a growing social concern. Finally, the Government has insufficient
mechanisms through which to promote the participation of the poor in the
process of social and economic development.
6.    As part of the current phase of Struct4ral Adjustment in the
Central African Republic, the Government is committed to incorporating
the social dimensions into adjustment policies and implementing actions
both to mitigate negative effects of adjustment and economic stagnation,
and to promote the participation of the poor in economic development.
Priority activities include: strengthening the information base and
institutional mechanisms to foster the integration of social
considerations into development policies while better defining target
groups for protective and social development actions; improving the
supply of appropriately trained primary school teachers; and enhancing
the productive role of women.
7.    Proiect Description.  The proposed project would, over a four-year
period, help the Government incorporate the social dimensions of
adjustment into its economic and social policies. It aims ats
(a)   Strengthening of Social Policy and Planning (US$4.7 million
equivalent) by: (i) developing a national information system
based on household and community surveys which would provide
the Government with baseline social data and allow the
identification of poor and vulnerable groups;
(ii) developing a study program to provide the Government
with an increased understanding of the causes of poverty,
and help it to monitor the evolution of welfare and the
effects of adjustment meascres on households throughout the
adjustment process; and (iii) assisting the Government to
translate this information and the experience gained through
the implementation of the other Project components into
improved policies and actions that target poor and
vulnerable segments of the population.
(b)   Supporting the Implementation of the Government's National
Policy for the Promotion of Women (US$0.7 million
equivalent) through: (i) institutional strengthening of the
division of the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs
dealing with women's affairs; (ii) preparation of a family
code; and (iii) on the basis of studies of adult literacy,
school dropout rates and vocational training for women,
preparation of an action plan to improve female education.



- 3 -
(c)   Implementing an Accelerated Teacher Training Program (US$1.0
million equivalent) to remedy the shortage of trained
primary school teachers that resulted from the overall civil
service reform and the voluntary departure program (DVA),
and to improve the functioning of teacher retraining
efforts, including those being supported by the IDA-financed
Third Education Project.
Each of the above components would include staff training activities.
Their prime focus would be on developing the Government's capacity to
factor the social dimensions into adjustment and development policies and
programs.
8.    Proiect Implementation.  To compensate for the current weakness of
the Planning Ministry, a Social Dimensions of Adjustment and Development
(SDAD) Secretariat, composed of a Project Manager and an assistant.
would he attached to this Ministry under the direct supervision of the
Minister. In addition to coordinating various activities in the field
(including the SDAD Project component), its mission would be to propose
a strategy for the integration of the social dimensions into both
development policy and the regular activities of the Ministry. The
strategy is thus expected to propose modification of the Ministry's
structure, work program, and budget. The Secretariat is envisaged as a
temporary structure: when the strategy is implemented, no later than the
start of 1994, the Secretariat would be eliminated. During this interim
period the Secretariat would also assure support to the SDAD
Interministerial Committee, which has been established under the
chairmanship of the Minister of Plan to guide the implementation of the
SDAD program and to make necessary policy recommendations.
9.    The Project components would be implemented by existing
administrative units of the technical ministries. The Social Dolicy and
Planning component would be implemented by the Planning Ministry through
the Department of Statistics for the surveys, and the Social Development
Policy Unit (SDPU) for the other activities. The implementation
capacity of both agencies would be strengthened under the Project. The
Accelerated Teacher Training component would be coordinated by the
Pedagogy and Teacher Training Directorate of the Ministry of Education
and implemented through Regional Pedagogy Centers, which have the
capacity to carry out this program. The Women in Development (WID)
component would be implemented by the Department for the Promotion of
Women of the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs.  Technical
assistance would be provided to this department under the Project.
10.   Proiect Obiectives.  The Project would support the Government's
efforts to integrate the social dimensions into its adjustment and
development policies and to develop appropriate social sector strategies
through the establishment of an institutional system for socio-economic
policy formulation and coordination, supported by an information system
for monitoring the social impact of economic policy through the
collection of data on households. In addition, the Project would
increase the opportunities for women to participate fully in economic
development by facilitating the implementation of key elements of the
existing National Policy for the Promotion of Women, and would train
teachers to replace the substantial number of primary school teachers
who departed under the DVA.
11.   Proiect Design.  The SDAD Secretariat has been designed as a
temporary unitz a principal task of the Secretariat and staff would be



- 4 -
to facilitate the absorption of its functions into the regular structure
and activities of the Planning Ministry. The alternative of Immediate
integration into the Ministry was rejected due to the current weakness
of the Social Development Policy Unit, which would otherwise be the
logical locus for the Secretariat's activities, and because decisions on
the future reorganization of the Ministry should take into account the
results of the studies proposed under the Project. The establishment of
a permanent Secretariat was rejected as antithetical to the goal of
integration of the social dimensions into the Ministry's activities.
The accelerated teacher training program would be a short-term measure
designed to help CAR cope with its shortage of trained teachers while it
builds up the capacity of its pedagogical training system. The WID
component is designed to implement two key elements (enactment of a
family code and improvement of education) of the existing National
Policy for the Promotion of Women.
12.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement.  The proposed
Project draws on the experience of efforts to address the social
dimensions of adj"stment in other countries.  In particular, the
Project's size and structure have been modified to minimize the burdens
of project management. The proposed Project also draws on lessons from
evaluations of social sector lending in CAR. The PCR for the Second
Education Project recognizes a need to give more attention to systemic
factors (particularly with regard to resource allocations) and to the
promotion of community responsibility. The former concern would be
addressed through the Social Policy and Planning component of the SDAD
Project, which would develop means of better addressing social concerns
through Government policy. The latter concern would be addressed
through the development of a national capacity for beneficiary
assessment, which would provide the Government and donor community with
a mechanism for eliciting feedback from communities. In addition,
during the preparation of the proposed Project, a Social Dimensions of
Adjustment Country Assessment Paper was produced. This paper contains a
preliminary poverty profile (which would be updated under the Project on
the basis of the survey results), and identifies priority actions
reflected in the components both of this Project and of a parallel
social action program which has been proposed for African Development
Bank financing. It also suggestr a program of studies which has evolved
into the program of studies proposed under this Project.
13.   Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Government commitment to
incorporating social dimensions into adjustment and development policies
has been expressed as an integral part of its adjustment program through
its Declaration of Development Policy. The SDAD Project has been
designed to support these actions in parallel to: the third Structural
Adjustment Program; the IDA financed Education Rehabilitation and
Development and Enterprise Rehabilitation and Development Projects; a
health sector project now under preparation for possible IDA financing;
and a social action program, including agricultural training for youths
and community development activities, proposed for African Development
Bank financing. The social policy and planning component would provide
needed focus to these diverse activities by developing means of
integrating social concerns into coherent policy design.
14.   Agreed Actions.  The following actions were conditions of
negotiations: (i) publication of the arrQte establishing the National



- 5 -
:nformation System and its organization as well as the Statistical data
users' group; and (ii) transmission to IDA of the arrate formalizing the
establishment of the accelerated teacher training program. During
negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on project
objectives and design. Specific agreements included that the Government
shallt (i) submit for IDA's approval, no later than December 31, 1992, a
strategy for the integration of the social dimensions of adjustment and
development into the work program of the Planning Ministry and start to
implement this strategy not later than December 31, 1993; (ii) until
completion of the Project, maintain under terms of reference and with
membership acceptable to IDA, the Interministerial SDAD Committee;
(iii) take appropriate measures to enaure that the SDAD Secretariat is
staffed on a full-time basis by a Project Manager and an assistant whose
terms of reference, qualifications and experience would be acceptable to
IDA; (iv) by September 30 of each year submit to IDA for approval the
arnual program of socio-economic studies to be carried out during the
following calendar year, including terms of reference and schedules, and
promptly implement the results and recommendations of these studies as
they will have been agreed upon with IDA; (v) not later than September
30, 1993, complete drafting the Family Code and soon thereafter submit
the draft to IDA for review and comments prior to its enactment;
(vi) carry out by June 30, 1992, the studies under the VID component in
accordance with terms of reference acceptable to IDA; (vii) not later
than December 31, 1992, submit to IDA for review and comments an action
plan for improving women's and adult education, and not later than
December 31, 1993, implement this action plan taking into account IDA's
views; (viii) each year prepare Project-related work programs and
budgets (detailed by Project Components and implementing agencies),
submit them not later than September 30 of each year to IDA for review
and approval, and execute these work programs as approved by IDA; (ix)
carry out the accelerated teacher training program until June 30, 1992,
assess the results achieved in the execution of this program, and submit
the assessment to IDA by October 31, 1992 for its review and comments,
and employ the trainees certified under the program in accordance with
terms and conditions of employment satisfactory to IDA; and (x) by
October 31, 1993, carry out a mid-term review with IDA to assess the
progress achieved in the execution of the Project and promptly implement
any measures required as a result of this review to further the
objectives of the Project. The following would be a condition of
effectiveness: that the Government has submitted to IDA evidence
satisfactory to IDA showing that all members of the SDAD Secretariat,
with qualifications acceptable to IDA, have been appointed and have
taken up their posts.
15.   Environmental Aspects.  Project activities will have no adverse
environmental effects.
16.   Program Obiective Categories.  The Project would contribute to the
development of human resources by relieving the current deficit of
trained elementary school teachers, promoting the education of women,
and providing necessary data for the development of social sector
strategies. Recognizing that the sustainability of its Structural
Adjustment Program could be endangered by inadequate attention to the
social dimensions of adjustment and development, the Government
incorporated into its 1990 Statement of Development Policy for a Third
Structural Adjustment Loan, a far-reaching set of objectives in the



areas of human resource development, employment creation, and support
for the participation of underprivileged groups. The SDAD Project would
provide focus and a means of establishing priorit.es among these
objectives by establishing: (i) an information base on the nature and
incidence of poverty that would permit it to be effectively monitored;
and (ii) appropriate institutional and human capacity to fully
incorporate the social dimensions into macroeconomic and sectoral
policies, and to define and implement well-targeted programs and actions
that would address the needs of poor and vulnerable groups.
17.   Project Benefits.  The Project would materially strengthen the
Government's ability to design and carry out programs and policies that
address the social dimensions of the structural adjustment process and
alleviate poverty. It would focus Government policies and programs on
the special needs of women, and so enhance their opportunities to
participate more fully in economic development. Finally, it would help
overcome a crisis in primary education resulting from a shortage of
trained teachers.
18.   Risks.  The main risks to achievement of the Project objectives
arise from the weak institutional capacity of the Government and the
multi-sectoral nature of the Project. Measures to minimize these risks
include: (i) setting up an SDAD Secretariat within the Planning Ministry
with full-time staff to coordinate Project execution and provide
technical guidance on issues of Project finance and procurement; (ii)
delegating the actual implementation of Project tasks to line ministries
and departments and strengthening their implementation capacity; (iii)
including substantial training activities in each component of the
Project; and (iv) using medium- and short-term technical assistance to
support the Government in carrying out Project components.
19.   Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve it.
