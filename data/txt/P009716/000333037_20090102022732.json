The project was approved in February\n            1977 and was designed to improve the economic status of\n            smallholder farmers and the productivity of major foreign\n            exchange earning tree crops and pepper. Kerala state\n            accounts for most of India's production of coconut,\n            cashew, rubber, and pepper. The project was appraised in\n            1976 and comprised: (a) new planting, rehabilitating, and\n            improving intercropping, of both irrigated and non-irrigated\n            coconut over 35,000 ha.; (b) new planting and rehabilitation\n            of pepper, over 10,000 ha.; (c) establishing seed gardens\n            over 435 ha.; (d) new planting and rehabilitation of cashew\n            over 3,750 ha.; (e) establishing nine crumb rubber\n            factories, expanding an existing factory, and improving and\n            developing marketing infrastructure; (f) strengthening\n            agricultural research; and (g) providing improved extension\n            services and investment credit facilities. The project had\n            as its main objective to improve the productivity of major\n            foreign exchange earning tree crops and pepper with emphasis\n            on improving the economic status of some 75,000 farm\n            families, the majority of whom belonged to the poorest\n            segment of the population."}, "docdt": "1989-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
