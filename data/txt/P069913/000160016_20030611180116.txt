               MEMORANDUM         AND RECOMMENDATION            OF THE PRESIDENT
                                             OF THE
           INTERNATIONAL       BANK   FOR RECONSTRUCTION           AND DEVELOPMENT
                               TO THE EXECUTIVE         DIRECTORS
                      ON A PROPOSED      AMENDMENT         AND WAIVERS      TO
                                SECOND    AND THIRD      TRANCHES
                          AND RELEASE      OF THE SECOND       TRANCHE
         FOR ARGENTINA      - SANTA   FE PROVINCIAL        REFORM    ADJUSTMENT      LOAN
                                       (LOAN  NO. 4634-AR)


 1.      The Santa Fe Provincial Reform Adjustment Loan (Ln 4634-AR) for US$330 million
 was approved by the Board in August 2001 and became effective in September 2001. The loan
 comprises three tranches, payable at the Bank's standard interest rate for LIBOR-based dollar
 loan, with a grace period of 5 years, a final maturity in 15 years, and a level repayment of
 principal. The first tranche in the amount of US$153.3 million was released on September 20,
 2001. The accompanying Tranche Release Document for the second tranche of US$50 million
 sets forth the description of tranche conditions, status of compliance of the Borrower, and
proposed amendment/waivers to both the second and third tranches.
2.       The Loan is designed to support the implementation of a program by the Borrower Santa
Fe Province aimed at reforming its government so as to ensure an efficient and responsive
delivery of public services within fiscally sound policies. While the Province has largely been
able to successfully implement the program, due to the impact of the severe macroeconomic
developments in Argentina and the resulting deterioration in social conditions, the Loan is being
reformulated in terms of waivers/amendments to individual conditions.          In keeping with the
original development objective, the reformulated loan would continue to support the Province of
Santa Fe's reform efforts to achieve fiscal stability at the provincial level and promote structural
reforms to improve the efficiency, quality and equity of public spending, particularly in the
social sectors.
3.       The Santa Fe Provincial Reform Adjustment Loan is subject to the provisions of the
Bank's former disclosure policy.     As such, and after confirmation with the Province and the
Borrower, the accompanying Tranche ReleaseDocument will not be made publicly available.
4.       Recommendation.       In view    of the overall performance and progress with          the
implementation of the program supported by the Santa Fe Provincial reform Adjustment Loan, I
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed amendment/waiver and the
tranche release. Following approval by the Executive Directors and the entry into effect of a
letter of amendment to the Loan Agreement, the Bank will notify the Borrower of the availability
of the disbursement of the second tranche in the amount of US$50 million equivalent.

                               Tranche Release Document


 1.     This tranche release document seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to
amend the loan agreement for the Provincial Reform Adjustment Loan - Santa Fe (Ln
4634-AR) on the terms described in paragraphs 26-34 below. The proposed amendment
would adjust the conditionality previously agreed with the Province of Santa Fe to the
dramatic changes in the macroeconomic, investment, social and political environment in
Argentina following the abandonment of convertibility in January 2002, while ensuring
the permanence and relevance of the objectives of its reform program. Specifically, the
changes in the fiscal, debt, and investment conditions and the strong resurgence of social
conflict have substantially modified the priorities and conditions prevailing at the time
this Loan was approved. The Province has, on the other hand, effectively adapted its
short and medium term priorities within the context of the overall reform objectives, to
deal with the social and economic emergency. The proposed amendment remains firmly
grounded in the overall objectives of the program to achieve fiscal stability at the
provincial level and promote structural reforms to improve the efficiency, quality and
equity of public spending, particularly in the social sectors.

2.       The proposed reformulation would amend the original second and third tranches
of $50 million   and $126.7 million,   respectively.   It provides for the reframing of a
consistent program in response to the changes in the environment, with upfront and
formal agreement on new targets neededto achieve the agreed development goals. At the
same time, Santa Fe has continued to move forcefully          in implementing its reform
program.   Upon the Board's approval of the proposed reformulation, and signing and
effectiveness of the amendment, the second tranche would become available for
withdrawal.

Recent Economic Developments

3.      The Argentine economy is emerging from the deepest recession in generations,
with its GDP having fallen by 20 percent in the last four years and by 10.9 percent in
2002 alone. Per capita income at the end of 2002 stood at an estimated US$2,695, down

                                                   -2-

 from over 8,000 in the 1997/98 period'.              Poverty has increased to 58 percent, with
 indigence levels affecting 28 percent of the population or about 9 million.

 4.       The culmination of this crisis is associatedwith the collapse of the Convertibility
 Plan, which extracted an increasingly and finally unsustainable high social and economic
 cost2 Compounding this was the declaration of default on Argentina's public debt, the
 ill-prepared devaluation, and the asymmetric pesification of the financial system, all of
 which have had damaging effects on macroeconomic management, viability                          of the
 financial system, credibility of government action, and the rule of law.

 5.       After an initial period of heightened economic, social, and political uncertainty,
 the Argentine economy displayed signs of bottoming out around the middle of 2002.
 Since then indications of an incipient recovery based on improved consumer sentiment
 and import substitution have multiplied, with positive developments becoming clearer
 and stronger in recent months. These were reflected in the trend of the quarterly GDP in
 2002 which contracted by over 16 percent during the first quarter compared to the same
period of the previous year, but improved about equally, on a seasonally adjusted quarter
 to quarter basis, by 0.7 percent in each of the three subsequent quarters3. Consequently,
economic growth in 2002 declined by 10.9 percent. Industrial production also showed an
 accelerating positive monthly trend since the second quarter of 2002, with year on year
indicators signaling positive growth starting in the fourth quarter of 2002.

6.        The current Government has made important strides towards reverting some of
the negative impact of the crisis under very difficult social and political conditions. Key
to these achievements have been the controls over the fiscal situation as well as the
pursuit of a restrained monetary policy.             There is, however, a broad and substantial
agenda for structural reforms that remains to be tackled in order to insure that the recent
signs of economic improvement can be sustained and accelerated. Reforms in areassuch
as the financial sector, corporate restructuring,            public utilities services, public sector
management, reform in fiscal relations with the provinces, external debt restructuring,
and investment climate will have to wait until a new administration takes office.

7.        With regard to fiscal policy, the Government tightly controlled expenditures,
especially of wages and pensions, but relied on export taxes and the financial transaction
tax to collect more than 3 percent of GDP in revenues. Average monthly revenues rose
from Arg$ 3.2 billion in the first four months of 2002, coinciding with the depth of the
recession, to Arg$ 5.0 billion in the following eight months, marking an average increase
in revenues of 54 percent, which surpassed the rate of inflation, and reflects the gradual
improvement in economic activity and tax collection efforts. As a result, the primary
deficits of the first four months of 2002 turned into surpluses in the remainder of the year,


' According to the Bank's Atlas methodology,    per capita GNI in 2002 declined to $4,060 from $8,030 in
1998.

distributed to the Board in July 2002.
3Quarterly growth figures for 2002 were -16.3%, -13.5%, -9.8%, and -3.6%, in that order.

                                             -3-


 generating a primary     surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP for the year as a whole.
Nevertheless, the overall cash balance of the Federal Government remained in deficit (-
 1.6 percent of GDP), despite the non-payment of interest obligations because of the
 default conditions.

 8.      On provincial finances, the Central Government signed agreements with the
provinces on reducing the combined provincial deficit by 60 percent during 2002. The
 outcome of the agreement has been better than expected, with the combined provincial
deficit having been cut by 74 percent from Arg$6.8 billion in 2001 to Arg$l.8 billion by
eliminating a primary fiscal deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP during 2002. For 2003, it is
planned that the provincial deficits will be cut further to Arg$l.l billion. To this end, the
Government has already signed agreements with eleven provinces representing 95
percent of the overall 2002 provincial deficit. Further improvements in provincial fiscal
performance are needed to obtain fiscal sustainability of the consolidated public sector,
and reform of the federal-provincial fiscal agreement (coparticipacion) is a challenge for
the immediate future.

9.      Monetary policy     has contributed significantly     to the improvement      in the
macroeconomic situation. Key to this has been the change in rediscount policy, which
increasingly sterilized the liquidity support extended towards banks in response to the
judicial rulings in favor of liberalizing blocked deposits, so-called "amparos".         The
decline of international reserves during the first half of 2002 was another source of
monetary absorption. The fiscal and monetary policy stance have resulted in a significant
lowering of the monthly inflation rate from about 4 percent in the first half of 2002, to 1.3
percent during the second half year, to about 1 percent during the first quarter of 2003.
Interest rates have also fallen significantly since the middle of the year, with fixed term
deposit rates having declined from about 80 percent in July 2002 to 15 percent in January
2003 and the prime rate from 90 percent to 27 percent during the same period.

10.     Progress has been made in other areasas well. A flexible exchange rate has been
established following the temporary introduction of multiple exchange rates. The fiscal
and monetary policies together with capital controls that were re-introduced extensively
in 2002, supported an exchange rate policy that resulted in a relatively stable exchange
rate of Arg$ 3.66 per US$l from June through November 2002. Towards the end of
2002, the incipient recovery and the increasing international reserves position, in part due
to the accumulation of payment arrears and a large trade surplus started to exert
appreciating pressures on the exchange rate. To arrest a too quick of an appreciation, the
Central Bank has increasingly lifted capital controls since the end of last December. At
mid-April, the exchange rate stood at around Arg$2.9 to US$l, and foreign reserves had
reachedUS$10.5 billion.

11.     The external financing crisis and recession was reflected in the swift reversal in
the external accounts. With a precipitous decline in imports of 55.8 percent, and despite
a lackluster export performance, the trade balance in goods and services improved from a
US$3.5 billion surplus in 2001 to US$15.4 billion last year, helping generate a US$13.5
billion swing in the current account. The traded goods balance continued to be in large

                                             -4-

 surplus in January 2003, when it reached US$1.3 billion compared to US$970 million in
 the same month of 2002. A similar surplus was obtained in the month of February.

 12.     To summarize developments in the first months of 2003, the economy stayed on
 its recovery path. By March 2003, industrial production was 21.4 percent higher than a
 year ago, albeit from levels that characterized the trough of the economic crisis. Inflation
 remained moderate, and trade balances exhibited large surpluses. Fiscal performance
 improved further, principally    from improved income tax collections, with revenues
 coming better than expected in the Fund's program.        Exchange controls were further
eased, and banking deposits were liberalized.            Commitments    to improve      fiscal
performance in the provinces were reached, and the Government launched a program for
the monetary unification.     Between the beginning of the year and mid-April,     the peso
appreciated by 15 percent, and international reservescontinued to build up.

 13,     These impressive achievements however remain fragile         as long as important
issues have yet to be resolved. The Argentine banking system has been significantly
weakened, first by the massive withdrawal of deposits in 2001, and second by the loss of
confidence resulting from the partial freeze of bank accounts, the forced conversion of
dollar deposits, and associated policy decisions (asymmetric pesification, preferential
treatment of debtors, etc.). With about 50 percent of bank assets currently held in the
form of government bonds, the future viability of the banking system depends, among
other factors, on the outcome of the public debt workout, and valuation of such bonds.
Depositors have suffered significant losses, and access to the remaining deposits were
circumscribed.      Important economic dislocations occurred with the imposition           of
restrictions on access to banking deposits. Nevertheless, gradually, sight and savings
deposits and more recently time deposits have been liberalized. But, the financial
intermediation process has been severely disrupted.         No credible resolution to the
banking crisis has yet been defined, and the future of the banking system is uncertain.
Confidence on the banking system has plummeted, as banks suffered high operational
losses and a sharp increase in their non-performing loans. The weakening of the banking
system, and the continuous decline in credit associated with significant contraction of
investment, are limiting    factors to a sustained economic recovery.       While cautious
measures are being taken to strengthen the banking system, the redollarization of deposits
(ruled by the Supreme Court in one case only, but opening the door for more widespread
application) remains a risk to the banking system, as it could increase its losses, and
dependenceon public transfers.

14.      Private contracts have been breached - for example, all private contracts
denominated in dollars were pesified at the old exchange rate of one-to-one and mortgage
executions were suspended -, and the legal framework for their renegotiation has been
undermined through inopportune legislation (only recently new bankruptcy legislation
established a minimum acceptable legal framework for the protection of creditors and
debtors).   Utility  rates have been frozen, threatening the future provision of public
services (recent minimal price adjustment in utilities have been suspended by a court
decision). Property and creditor rights have been violated in a wholesale manner, and
unless such rights are credibly reestablished, economic recovery will be curtailed.

                                             -5-

 15.    The Government has defaulted on various domestic and most international
obligations.    Consequently, Argentina has no access to the international financial
markets.    Currently, the authorities have began the long process of reaching out to
international creditors. However, the process of debt renegotiation promises to be long
and arduous, and some creditors have initiated legal action to attach Argentine assets
abroad. In the process of pesification, massive wealth transfers from creditors to debtors
and, in particular, from the state to debtors have occurred. As a result of the
compensations to banks and depositors the state has already issued sizable amounts of
new debt, thereby increasing difficulties for the future servicing of debt in default.

16.     Argentina's prospects   for 2003 are for the continuation of the current recovery in
output and the maintenance of the fiscal and monetary stability reached over the second
half of 2002. The prospects for output recovery reflect the depth of the output decline of
the last four years, and the opportunities provided by the sharp devaluation of the
currency.   The recovery in consumption, and import substituting activities could be
leading the recovery, with real GDP growth projected to reach about 4 percent.
However, significant uncertainty accompanies any such expectations, given the need to
address urgently fundamental structural reforms.       In the absence of normalization of
relations with the international financial community, which would require both a debt
restructuring and a sustainable fiscal framework, the reestablishment of a functioning
financial system, and renewed credibility to public institutions, the ongoing economic
recovery is unlikely to translate into sustained economic growth.

17.     In the meantime, an interim economic and financing program has been agreed
with the IFIs, covering the January to August 2003 period. The Government estimates
that the total external financing gap during this period is in the order of US$l 1.6 billion.
This financing gap is expected to be met by new disbursements of the IMF of about
US$2.9 billion and the extension of repurchase expectations amounting to US$3.7 billion
as well as by disbursements from the World Bank and IDB in the order of US$2.2 billion
each.   In February 2003       the Paris Club agreed to a rescheduling of debt service
amounting to about US$O.7 billion.

The Social Situation

18.       The social impact of the crisis has been devastating. Using data from the official
household survey and recently compiled World Bank household survey (with greater
geographical coverage), this section documents the effects of the crisis on poverty, and
labor markets (see Figure 2 and Table 2).                                       During 2002, poverty trends worsened
dramatically. The share of population considered poor grew to approximately 58 percent
while the number of extreme poor nearly doubled.

 19.       The economic crisis has had a strong negative impact on the access and use of
 education and health services and there is growing evidence of the deterioration in
 service delivery and key indicators of well-being.                       Coverage and financing of formal
 health insurance has dropped significantly, following the destruction of jobs in the formal
 sector.       Roughly      12 percent of individuals                with    formal health insurance either
 discontinued (60 percent of the total), or reduced their coverage. The trend has
 contributed to an increase in the use of already financially strapped public hospitals, the
 traditional provider for the uninsured. The crisis has forced families to cut down on
 health services. More than one-third of households with children under the age of 12
 reported having reduced the frequency with which they take their children for medical
 checkups (roughly half of those households belong to the lowest quintile of the income
 distribution). There are concerns about the emergence of casesof child malnutrition. 4

 20.       In the education sector there are no indications of aggravated dropout and
 desertion rates due to the crisis, On the other hand, a large proportion of households
 report that they have reduced school and learning material purchases. The most serious
 negative effects of the crisis on the education sector are linked to the fiscal provincial
 crisis. The lack of financing experienced by several provinces has generated difficulties
 to comply with payments to their employees, including teachers. Delays in wage
 payments has had an impact on the continuity of classes. While experiences have
 differed within the country due in part to the higher or lower solvency in each state, the
 2002 school year was irreparably affected in some provinces (San Juan, Entre Rios), very
 seriously affected in others (Tucuman, Jujuy, Rio Negro), and had partial scope in a third
 group of provinces (Misiones, Formosa, Chubut). The difference among them is the
 number of school days lost, ranging from about a quarter to almost half of the school
 year.5

 21.       Many of the social problems have existed before in Argentina. What is different
is that 2002 has made the social situation even more difficult for the majority of the
population and the need for action more urgent. Discussions and reform proposals to
correct the underlying problems have been ongoing for several years without reaching a
conclusion as a result of insufficient                    political    support and social consensus. The
Government now faces a particularly difficult challenge: increasing demands for social
assistance in the context of falling fiscal resources and extremely limited administrative
capabilities to innovate and coordinate responses.




4 While thereis no updated aggregateofficial datathat would allow to determinethe extent to which therehas beena
deterioration in infant mortality and malnutrition, evidenceof seriouschild malnutrition (andafailure of existing
programs to identify thosecasesin time) has emergedrecently in severalprovincesraising the concernthat, if left
unattended,this could develop into agraverhealth emergency.
5The interruption of theeducationalprocesshas astrong impact on students'learning processes.Theabandonmentof
the "schoolroutine", thefewer school days,theimpossibility to consolidate andcorrectlearning, thetension in the
relationship of schoolswith families, areall factors that seriouslyaffect schooling attainments.The responsesto these

22.      Nevertheless, recognizing the seriousnessof the social situation, the Government
has moved decisively to expand key safety net programs, including the Heads of
Household program, prioritizing       spending on them and consolidating social programs
around a smaller number of key initiatives.          In addition, the recent creation of the
National Coordination Council for Social Policies constitutes an important step in the
direction of improving      the effectiveness of social policies as it allows for better
coordination    among the various actors at the national level           between different
jurisdictions.


Recent Flooding in Santa Fe Province

23.       The challenges faced by the Province were exacerbated in late April 2003, with
historical flooding affecting the north and east of Santa Fe, including the capital. Early
reports, as of May 7, 2003, indicate a death toll of at least 23 persons and evacuees
housed in official centers at almost 45,000, with un-official reports of perhaps more than
30,000 that have evacuated themselves to other locations. Two principal hospitals in
Santa Fe city had been evacuated; there now exists serious difficulties          with waste
residues in urban areas; as well as high risks for an epidemic and infectious diseases.
Losses in the agricultural sector-Santa Fe is a major producer and exporter of grains,
oilseeds, and beef-are     expected to be also substantial with estimates yet to be made.
There are currently no estimates for damage to infrastructure, but once the water recedes,
as expected during the next week, significant damage to roads and buildings is likely to
become visible.

24.       Through Bank-financed operations, Santa Fe has made important investments in
flood control measure since the major floods of 1992. However, much of this effort had
been directed at the Parana River, the traditional source of flooding in the Province. The
current episode, from the River Salado, is without precedent in recorded history.
National and bi-lateral support has been promised to as part of the relief effort.      The
Governor has specifically requested Bank support.           Several ongoing Bank-financed
investment operations, both in social assistance and infrastructure, are likely to also be
part of these relief and recovery efforts, as well as for flood control activities in the
future.


         Part II - Implementation     of the Program and Proposed Restructuring

25.     In support of Santa Fe's reform program, the Board approved in August 2001 a
US$330 million Provincial Reform Loan. The program was framed within a three-tranche
design, aimed at reforming and restructuring its government so as to ensure an efficient
and responsive delivery of public services within fiscally sound policies.         The Loan
Agreement became effective in September 2001 and the first tranche of US$153.3
million was disbursed. The proposed amendment would focus on changes to the second
and third tranches. They take into account the impact of the floating of the Peso and
associated policy measures, the poor prospects over the medium term for further
privatization of utilities and the fiscal constraints under which the provinces will need to

                                             - ll-


 operate, particularly as regards spending and reforms in health and education, and to
 respond to the aggravation of social and political conflicts.   In addition, several targets
 would be changed to reflect the effects of the historical flooding of the Province in late-
 April and measuresneeded for relief and recovery.

 FiscalPerformanceand Public SectorReform

 26.     Despite the macroeconomic downturn and resulting fall in revenues, the Province
 has been able to maintain a fiscal program and has met the second tranche target calling
 for a balance in current spending (Schedule 3.1). The third tranche condition currently
 calls for a four percent surplus in current spending. Given the developments at the macro
 level and the Federal Government's overall target of fiscal balance for the provinces
 under the Fund program, SantaFe hasagreedto a reformulation of the condition to
 require that it also achievesa fiscal balance,though not including extraordinary
 spendingassociatedwith theflood relief and recovery (Schedule4.1).

                             Table3: FiscalResultsfor SantaFe

 Current Expenditures              2,337                 2,422                 2,757

Overall Balance                    (246)                  99                     3


27.      Santa Fe has also been able to move towards improved              governance and
transparency by drafting a new law on financial management and procurement (Schedule
3.3), which is expected to be approved by the legislature for the third tranche (Schedule
4.3), and by providing an extensive array of revenue and expenditure data through its web
site (Schedule 3.4).     It is also actively sharing its social and tax data bases with the
Federal Government to reduce abuse and sharpen targeting (Schedule 3.8). In public
investment, it is now requiring economic analysis and environmental             assessment,
including the application of mitigating measures to all major public works (Schedule 3.5-
3.6), and spending in road infrastructure is being reoriented toward maintenance
(Schedule 3.7). Finally, it is pursuing the elimination of distortionary local payroll taxes
(Schedule 3.9). Many of these actions are expected to be reinforced by the time of the
third tranche.

28.     Nonetheless, the floating of the Peso has made it impossible for the Province to
achieve the second and third tranche conditionalities calling for a debt stock target equal
to 50 percent of revenues. In essence,the floating of the Peso, combined with the Federal
Government's decision not to assume the foreign exchange risk of on-lent funds from
multilateral  institutions  (essentially the Bank and the Inter-American      Development
Bank), has resulted in a tripling of the level of debt in peso terms with these institutions,
Santa Fe's current debt stock is estimated at the equivalent of 87 percent of total

                                             - 12-

 revenues. Assuming that the Peso had remained at one to one to the Dollar, the debt
 stock ratio would have been 47 percent.       Given these circumstances, it is proposed
 that the condition for the second tranche (Schedule 3.2) be waived.         For the third
 tranche, the condition would be amended to prohibit           the incurring of additional
 debt not directly associated with the flood relief and recovery effort (Schedule 4.2).

 29.     The floating of the Peso has also made unrealistic a number of the originally
 envisaged spending targets in terms of US Dollar amounts. When the Loan was first
 negotiated, Santa Fe had proposed a series of expenditure targets in US Dollar terms (at
 the time, Argentine Law prohibited the setting of goals in terms of real Pesos). With the
 floating of the Peso, these US Dollar spending levels are no longer within the fiscal
 possibilities of the Province, as the Peso/US Dollar exchange rate has increased to around
 3/l, whereas local inflation in 2002 was more in the 40 percent range.

 Infrastructure:   For the second tranche (Schedule 3.5) the Province has agreed to
 replace the existing amount of US$7.5 million         over which all public investment
 works would require acceptable economic analysis, as well as environmental         impact
assessments and mitigating       measures (Schedule 3.6), with Arg$7.5 million.        This
would potentially strengthen these particular conditions as more public works are likely
to be above this floor, given the change in relative prices noted above.

Road Maintenance: Second (Schedule 3.7) and third tranche (Schedule 4.4) targets were
designed to help promote increased spending in routine road maintenance. The US
Dollar targets of US$15 million        for the second and US$20 million      for the third
tranche would be changed to Arg$30 million.             This would allow the Province to
achieve the implicit physical target of maintaining 1,138km of paved roads previously
agreed for the third tranche. With the recent flooding, it is now likely that even more
funds would be directed toward road maintenance and rehabilitation,

Social Assistance:     Second (Schedule 3.12) and third tranche (Schedule 4.10) which
target spending by the Province's Secretariat for Community Promotion at US$50.9
million,   would now be set in Peso terms.      The Province has agreed to a target of
Arg$90 million to provide for expanding the coverage of social assistance during the
current crisis.

Utility Concession

30.      Under the program, Santa Fe had agreed to publicly tender its public electric
distribution company as a second tranche condition (Schedule 3.10).            Although a
privatization   law satisfactory to the Bank was approved by the Legislature and
appropriate bidding documents were prepared by late 2001, a lack of market demand has
led the Province not to publicly tender the company. With the objective of continuing
improved service and to pursue a privatization strategy until market conditions improve,
Santa Fe has agreed as a second tranche condition (Schedule 3.10) to an action plan
to avoid deterioration     in service and financial   status so that the enterprise itself
would remain attractive      for concessioning if and when market conditions permit.

                                             - 13 -

 The action plan specifically calls for increasing the autonomy of the company through
 corporatization, the development of a performance contract, and the creation of a
 regulatory    entity for   monitoring     of  the   performance     contract.      Satisfactory
 implementation     of the action plan would be a new condition of the third tranche
 (Schedule 4.7). A condition related to the use of privatization            receipts would be
 dropped as no longer relevant (Schedule 4.8). It is proposed that this condition be
 waived.

 Social Assistance

 31.      In responseto the social crisis, Santa Fe is shifting the focus of its efforts in social
 assistance and has agreed to a reformulation of the third tranche conditions. While the
 provincial social assistance program (Programa Provincial de Ayuda Social Solidaria
 Santa Fe) remains at the core of its efforts, and indeed is serving as a model for newer
 federal level program, with the social crisis important resources have been channeled into
 the Province's Emergency Feeding Program (Programa de Emergencia Alimentaria), and
 more is to be expected to support the flood relief effort now underway. The Province had
 agreed under the second tranche (Schedule 3.13) to evaluate at least two of its ongoing
 social assistance programs and to then prepare action plans for these programs for the
third tranche (Schedule 4.11). While it has completed these evaluations for its provincial
 social assistance program and for elderly care (Programas de Tercer Edad), it would
replace the latter with an evaluation and action plan for the increasingly important
Emergency Feeding Program. Finally, an additional             third tranche condition would
have required that the Province's beneficiary registry to include all beneficiaries of
the programs evaluated under the second tranche (Schedule 4.12). Given the shift
in priorities, the Province would like for this condition to be reformulated            to apply
only to the provincial    social assistance solidarity program and not the program for
elderly care. While it would work to also include beneficiaries of the emergency feeding
program in the registry, given the continuing expansion of the program it cannot commit
at this time to a specific target.

Education

32.      The program to support reforms in education to enhance quality and increase
efficiency and equity remains solidly on track and full compliance is expected for both
the second and third tranches.           Accomplishments       to date include:       the initial
implementation of computerized human resource management systems for teachers and
student; the proactive use of national student achievement tests to improve performance
at the school level; the rationalization of surplus teacher training institutes and the
implementation of an accrediting system to enhance quality; and the design of a system to
allocate public subsidies to private schools based on the number of students, quality, and
equity.

                                              - 14 -

 Health

 33.      Likewise, the program in health reform is expected to be fully implemented.
 Achievements to date include: the launching of a primary care program for the uninsured
 poor focusing on maternal and child care services, and those related to chronic diseases,
 where a successful pilot is being expanded into other areas with high levels of poverty; a
 program to enhance the performance of public hospitals through performance contracts to
 ensure quality and increase cost recovery; and strengthening of the financial performance
 of the HMO for public employees. At the same time, given the urgent needs to respond
 to the flooding situation, in particular as regards emergency public health services, Santa
 Fe has agreed to lower the third tranche target for incorporating       additional people
 in its primary     care program    for the uninsured poor (Schedule 4.21).        While the
 Province remains committed to this program and fully expects to meet this target during
 the year, some delays in implementation are likely to occur given the current health
 emergency in Santa Fe; it is therefore proposed to lower the target from 150,000 to
 100,000. Those not formally enrolled in this program would still have accessto public
 health services.

 Other modifications.

 34.     Apart from the restructuring, it is also proposed to extend the closing date and to
 lift the original requirement of a minimum time period between the release of second and
 third tranches. This restriction was initially included to help ensure that the institutional
 reforms being pursued had sufficient time in place to promote sustainability.         At this
 stage, these new systems have largely been in place for almost one year and the previous
limitations    are no longer warranted and might constitute an undue burden on the
Province. It is proposed that the closing date of the Project be extended to December
31,2003, and the limitation     on release of the Third Tranche (Section 2.02 (e)) of six
months after the Second Tranche be dropped.


                               Part III - Benefits and Risks


35.      The main benefit would be in maintaining and advancing reforms in public
finances, public administration, as well as in the social sectors, where 90 percent of
health and basic education are the responsibility of the Santa Fe government. It would
support the government's efforts to adapt to the changed macro-economic circumstances
and continue to improve the provision of social and infrastructure services, and meet the
pressing needs from the devastating floods. Moreover, the reforms under implementation
in the social sectors represent important steps toward strengthening the efficiency and
effectiveness of government interventions in those areas at a crucial time. Beyond Santa
Fe, this program will contribute to consolidate the incipient economic recovery and
enhance the conditions for the continuation of a longer-term reform program in
Argentina.

                                           - 15 -


36.     There are several substantial risks.    Even with the proposed amendment the
Province may fail to meet its reform goals, becauseof either a weakening in commitment
or a further deterioration in the macroeconomic and social environment. A related risk is
that, while a provincial government is able to meet its reform commitments, the Federal
Government may fail        to maintain    a satisfactory macroeconomic    framework      or
subsequently deviate from an agreedprogram. Third, uncertainties related to fiscal effect
and economic costs of the floods, and the upcoming change in the national administration
may pose a risk to the implementation of the program, Beyond these risks, a continued
economic slow down, including the impact of the general world economy, would also
present serious risks to the fragile macroeconomic situation. Mitigating these risks is the
commitment by the provinces including Santa Fe to reduce the overall provincial deficit
and produce sustained primary surpluses. The much better than anticipated performance
in 2002 by the provinces and their commitment to implement the 2003 targets are hopeful
signs that they will carry out the 2003 agreements.

 SocialAssistance

 8.      In responseto the socialcrisis, SantaFeis shifting thefocus of its efforts in social
 assistanceandhasagreedto a reformulation of thethird trancheconditions. While the provincial
 socialassistanceprogram(ProgramaProvincial deAyuda SocialSolidariaSantaFe) remainsa
key programfor us,important resourcesarenow beingchanneledinto the Province'sEmergency
FeedingProgram(ProgramadeEmergenciaAlimentaria). We havenow agreedto prepare
actionsplansfor theseprogramsfor the third tranche.While we havecompletedthese
evaluationsfor its provincial socialassistanceprogramandfor elderly care(ProgramasdeTercer
Edad),we would replacethe latter with anevaluationandactionplan for the increasingly
importantEmergencyFeedingProgram.

Education

9.       Our efforts at reform in educationto enhancequality andincreaseefficiency andequity
remainon track. We havebeenableto initiate theimplementationof computerizedhuman

Health

10.      Our efforts in healthreform arealsogoing well. We havebeenableto launch a primary

new andurgentdemandson the healthsector,theProvincewould like to slightly reducethe target
for the programto cover thepoor anduninsuredwith primary care,from 150,000to 100,000.We
remaincommittedto this program,andmanyof thesesamepeoplewould benefitfrom the flood
relief effort, reducingthis targetwould facilitate our ability to meetoverall third tranche
conditions andprovide us with the furtherfinancing requiredto meetthe challengeof rebuilding

Other modifications.

11.      Given the delaysin tranchereleasetherearealsoothermodificationsrequiredto extend
the closingdateof the Loan to December31,2003 andto lift a mandatorytime periodbetween

Conclusion

12.      Thechangeswe aremaking would takeinto accountthemajor changesin the
macroeconomic,investmentandsocialenvironment,following the floating of thePesoand
associatedFederalpolicy measuresin January2002,that occurredsubsequentto the initiation of
the reform programsagreedwith theBank. While the overall programobjectivesremainvalid
andfeasible,theserecentevents,beyondthecontrol of the Province,haverendereda limited
numberof specificconditionalitiesunattainablein themedium term asoriginally framed. In
addition, severalfurther modificationswould facilitate the Provincein meetingthechallengesof
therecentflooding andthe needsfor relief, recoveryandrebuilding of SantaFe. The proposed
amendmentremainsfirmly groundedin the overall objectivesof the program,aspreviously
approvedby the Board, to achievefiscal stability at the provincial level andpromotestructural
reforms to improve theefficiency, quality andequity of public spending,particularly in the social
sectors.
