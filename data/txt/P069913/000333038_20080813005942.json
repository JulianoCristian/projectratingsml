for the Santa Fe Provincial\n            Reform Adjustment Loan Project for Argentina were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory; and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: Provincial policy development\n            operations such as Santa Fe's Provincial Reform Loan\n            (PRL) are only appropriate under stable macroeconomic\n            conditions. Under stable macroeconomic conditions,\n            policy-based operations supporting a well defined set of\n            reforms can be effective tools in promoting structural\n            adjustment at the sub-national level. Provincial operations\n            can be effective complements of sector reforms and\n            operations at the national level. For reforms to be\n            successful, they have to follow the right sequence, take\n            into consideration interrelationship of intermediate steps,\n            and be supported by a sound incentive system. The\n            Bank's continuous engagement during critical periods\n            can help sustain ongoing reforms and protect previous\n            achievements. Uncertain macroeconomic conditions can\n            undermine reforms focusing on privatization and concession,\n            even when they have the full commitment of the authorities.\n            The success of any Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) depends\n            on a combination of factors, the most important of which is\n            strong political support. The scope and complexity of policy\n            conditionality needs to be in line with the implementation\n            capacity of the borrower. Cross-sector operations at the\n            provincial level require strong coordination during both\n            preparation and implementation."}, "docdt": "2007-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
