F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Program Development Objective was to help the province of Santa Fe to reform and
restructure its government so as to ensure efficiency, quality and equity in public
services, particularly in health, education and social protection, within fiscally sound
policies.


                                                 ii

  Specific objectives within each of the policy areas were:

  a. Public Finance and Administration: (i) Attaining a fiscal balance; (ii) modernizing
financial management and enhancing transparency; (iii) conducting economic evaluation
of public investments and environmental screening; (iv) reducing tax distortions; (v)
modernizing tax administration; and (vi) concession of electricity distribution to reduce
costs.

  b. Social Protection: (i) Protecting the social safety net; (ii) modernizing the provincial
registry of beneficiaries.

  c. Education: (i) Protecting education spending; (ii) improving human resource
management systems for teachers and students; (iii) enhancing the use of student/school
evaluations; (iv) strengthening teacher training; and (v) improving the efficiency and
equity of private school subsidies.

  d. Health Reform: (i) Strengthening primary care for the uninsured; (ii) improving
public hospitals; (iii) strengthening the regulatory role of the ministry of health; and (iv)
sustaining the financial balance of the public employee health insurance carrier.

  Key Indicators: In addition to the performance targets that were embedded in the Policy
Matrix and Letter of Development Policy (see Annex 7), a complementary set of fiscal
and poverty indicators was developed at appraisal. Fiscal indicators that reflected the
province's fiscal program were developed to monitor progress even in areas that were not
included in the Policy Matrix, such as increases in current revenues. Poverty indicators
that explicitly focused on outcomes expected to have a positive impact on poverty
reduction were developed to monitor the operation's impact on reducing poverty. In
addition, the province agreed to develop a more comprehensive set of process, outcome
and impact indicators with the support of the Bank's Millennium Development Goals
team. However, this process was interrupted by the economic collapse of December 2001
and, although the Bank continued to supervise this issue closely during 2002 (e.g., project
implementation was rated unsatisfactory pending completion of this task - see Project
Status Report, Sept. 2002), following the crisis, these indicators were never achieved.
Instead, a more succinct set of impact indicators was adopted, and output indicators were
taken directly from the policy conditionalities included in the Policy Matrix.

Revised Program Development Objectives (if any, as approved by original approving
authority)
PDO were not revised during implementation. However, output indicators, which
reflected the operation's policy conditionalities, were de facto modified in May 2003,
when a number of loan conditions corresponding to the second and third tranche
disbursements were amended as part of the operation's overall restructuring (see Section
1.6).

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal:

Following the flight of private capital flows to emerging markets in 1998 as a result of the Asian
and Russian crises and the devaluation of the Brazilian Real in early 1999, Argentina's economy
slipped into recession, as evidenced by negative growth rates and a sharp deterioration of social
indicators experienced from 1999 onward. As a result of the prolonged economic downturn
combined with weak fiscal discipline during a national election year, Argentina's fiscal program
went astray in 1999, resulting in a fiscal deficit of approximately 4.1 percent of GDP, 37 percent
of which was generated by provincial governments. In 2000, the incoming De la Rúa
administration initiated a set of economic reforms in an attempt to revitalize economic activity
and boost the confidence of foreign and domestic investors. In addition, the national government
negotiated an international financing package of US$39.7 billion (the so-called `blindaje') with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bank and other international and bilateral lenders to
cover most of Argentina's external financing needs for 2001 and part of 2002. With these new
reforms and the support package in place, financial variables improved substantially at the start of
2001. But these developments too were short lived and the initial positive reactions to the
blindaje by the international capital markets could not be sustained when early results for January
and February 2001 showed that the fiscal deficit was larger than the indicative targets agreed
upon with the Fund. In March 2001, after the rapid succession of two Ministers of Economy,
Domingo Cavallo, the architect of the Convertibility Plan under the Menem administration, was
appointed to the post. To fulfill the financial needs for the second semester of 2001, the new
economic team had to tap the domestic market, as access to international markets was virtually
closed, with country risk spreads reaching over 1000 basis points. However, to ensure the
sustainability of public sector financing in the medium term, the national government had to
succeed in containing the fiscal deficit while simultaneously fueling economic growth, for which
a new set of measures were adopted aimed at reengineering economic management. As reported
in the CAS Progress Report (July 2001, p. 32), while Argentina's economy was undoubtedly
undergoing a critical phase in the short term, the new economic package was considered to have
reasonable potential to restore growth and reduce the fiscal gap over the medium term.

At the sub-national level, the national government had adopted several measures since 2000 to
restore order in the fiscal accounts at the sub-national levels, including setting binding deficit
targets as part of the stand-by agreement with the IMF, limiting borrowing at the provincial level,
and implementing a debt relief effort to support small provinces willing to control their spending.
The Federal Agreement (Compromiso Federal) subscribed between the national government and
the provinces in November 2000 constituted another significant step toward addressing the fiscal
imbalances at the sub-national level, as it provided a roadmap geared toward balancing provincial
accounts by 2005. Under the Federal Agreement, the provinces committed to freezing total
primary expenditures until reaching fiscal balance in exchange for a fixed, guaranteed level of
revenue-sharing transfers to the provinces for the 2001-2002 period and a three-year moving
average for the 2003-2005 period. The 2000 Federal Agreement also provided the foundations for
medium-term reform of the revenue-sharing system, including a revision of the criteria
determining primary and secondary distributions. It also included provisions to improve
efficiency and reduce evasion in provincial taxation by promoting coordination and compatibility
between tax administration systems at national and provincial levels of government. Finally, the
Federal Agreement required the progressive implementation of measures aimed at enhancing
transparency and improving financial management among provincial governments.

To further its efforts at the sub-national level, the national government requested the Bank to
support a group of selected provinces in advancing second generation reforms at the provincial
level in a framework of fiscal prudence, replicating the model piloted by the Second Provincial
Reform Loans (PRL-II) in Tucumán, Salta, San Juan and Río Negro. As part of this new phase,
two operations were approved in 2000 for Catamarca (Loan No. 4578-AR) and Córdoba (Loan
No. 4585-AR), with Santa Fe being selected as the third province to participate in the so-called
Provincial Reform Projects III. These operations were designed to improve the quality, equity and
efficiency of key social services at the provincial level while instilling fiscal discipline. In the
case of Santa Fe, fiscal performance targets were set to support the Federal Agreement. The
choice of Santa Fe was based on its relative importance and its track record of reform. Santa Fe is
the second largest province in the country, with a population of 3.1 million (equivalent to 8.3
percent of Argentina's population) and a per capita income of about 85 percent of the national
average, reflecting high levels of unemployment compounded by gaps in the delivery of health,
education, and social protection services. The proposed reform program had the strong
commitment of the Santa Fe's governor, who, during a previous mandate, had set in motion
important reforms while exercising fiscal restrain.

Approved in July 2001, Santa Fe's PRL was consistent with the objectives of the Joint IBRD-IFC
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covering FY 2001-2004 (Report No. 20354-AR, dated
September 8, 2000), which was discussed by the Executive Directors on June 27, 2000, shortly
after the new administration had taken office. Specifically, the 2001-2004 CAS identified the
need to (i) enhance social development, including poverty alleviation and human resource
development; (ii) improve the performance of the state, particularly at the sub-national level; and
(iii) consolidate structural reforms. Together with continuing support for reform in revenue-
sharing, individual provincial reform programs were identified as the main pillars of the Bank's
continued support for provincial reform in Argentina. Likewise, the operation reflected the
recommendations from OED's Country Assistance Evaluation (July 2000), which emphasized the
need to concentrate lending in social sectors and provincial reform, without neglecting the reform
of federal institutions. As discussed in the Board Paper (R96-55) approved in April 1996, the
fiscal justification for sub-national reform lending rested on the link between fiscal deficits and
pressures on the current account of the balance of payments, as provincial fiscal deficits increased
country risks and added to Argentina's vulnerability to external shocks. In addition, provinces
were considered a an important focal point for achieving development objectives in social
development, as they accounted for almost all public spending in health and education, as well as
being responsible for providing basic infrastructure services (pp. 15-18, FY 2001-2004 CAS).

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved):

  financial balance of the public employee health insurance carrier.

Key Indicators: In addition to the performance targets that were embedded in the Policy Matrix
and Letter of Development Policy (see Annex 7.3), a complementary set of fiscal and poverty
indicators was developed at appraisal.       Fiscal indicators that reflected the province's fiscal
program were developed to monitor progress even in areas that were not included in the Policy
Matrix, such as increases in current revenues. Poverty indicators that explicitly focused on
outcomes expected to have a positive impact on poverty reduction were developed to monitor the
operation's impact on reducing poverty. In addition, the province agreed to develop a more
comprehensive set of process, outcome and impact indicators with the support of the Bank's
Millennium Development Goals team. However, this process was interrupted by the economic
collapse of December 2001 and, although the Bank continued to supervise this issue closely
during 2002 (e.g., project implementation was rated unsatisfactory pending completion of this
task - see Project Status Report, Sept. 2002), following the crisis, these indicators were never
achieved. Instead, a more succinct set of impact indicators was adopted, and output indicators
were taken directly from the policy conditionalities included in the Policy Matrix.


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification:

PDO were not revised during implementation. However, output indicators, which reflected the
operation's policy conditionalities, were de facto modified in May 2003, when a number of loan
conditions corresponding to the second and third tranche disbursements were amended as part of
the operation's overall restructuring (see Section 1.6).

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

Santa Fe's Provincial Reform Loan (PRL) provided support to the province's own reform
program in four policy areas (i) public finance and administration; (ii) social protection; (iii)
education; and (iv) health. The specific objectives within each of the policy areas were as follows:

Public Finance and Administration: Over the last decade, Santa Fe enjoyed one of the best and
most consistent fiscal performances among Argentine provinces. Many of the basic reforms and
measures to promote fiscal discipline were already implemented in the early and mid-1990s,
including the privatization of the water company and the provincial bank. After faltering in 1999
as a result of the economic slowdown and the dynamics of an election year, Santa Fe's
commitment toward reform and fiscal responsibility was renewed in 2000, when an
administration that had been responsible for implementing many of the early reforms during an
earlier mandate took office. The new administration succeeded in improving the fiscal situation
during 2000, despite the overall economic slow down. To do so, it secured legislative approval of
an emergency law that included a reduction in salaries of better-paid public employees, a
reduction in pension benefits, and a renegotiation of contracts with service providers. With the
support of the PRL, the provincial government also undertook several actions aimed at reaching a
sustainable fiscal situation, with a focus on:

· Sustaining fiscal responsibility, including attaining a fiscal balance by 2003 while maintaining
  the level of debt within reasonable bounds. The province's multi-year fiscal program was also


                                                   3

  geared toward complying with the Federal Agreement, including freezing total primary
  expenditures if a fiscal imbalance was present.
· Modernizing financial management and enhancing transparency, including the passage of a
  Fiscal and Administrative Law that would put in place new systems for financial and human
  resource management, as well as for public procurement. The operation also supported the
  implementation of a new financial administration system financed through the Second
  Provincial Development Program (PDP-II), and the regular publication of provincial accounts
  and procurement information on the web to enhance transparency.
· Economic evaluation of public investments and environmental screening was introduced for all
  public works costing over Arg$7.5 million--equivalent to about 70 percent of the total
  investment budget for 2001.
· Reducing tax distortions by eliminating local payroll taxes and other distortionary taxes, such
  as the stamp tax, that generated undue burdens on local businesses.
· Modernizing tax administration to more fully integrate tax collection efforts and to upgrade
  technology with the support of the PDP-II. In addition, the operation supported efforts to
  enhance coordination with the national tax authority and SINTyS (Sistema de Identificación
  Nacional Tributario y Social).
· Concessioning electricity distribution to improve the level of service and reduce tariffs. Santa
  Fe's electricity company (Empresa Pública de Electricidad de Santa Fe - EPESF) was the
  largest electricity company still being run by the public sector in Argentina at the time. The
  proceeds from the concession were to be use to finance investments to help reactivate the local
  economy and provide a fiscal cushion.

Social Protection: As in the rest of the country, social conditions in Santa Fe had deteriorated as
a result of the prolonged economic downturn which preceded the 2001 crisis. With roughly one-
quarter of the urban labor force either unemployed or underemployed, social unrest was mounting,
taking the form of protests, road blockages, and increased crime. The economic recession had
also exacerbated the plight of longer standing vulnerable groups, including children and the
elderly. With the national government having primary responsibilities for social protection, Santa
Fe's social protection strategy was focused on enhancing provincial programs, linking them with
national programs to improve targeting, and strengthening local institutions to assume greater
delivery responsibility. The province's ability to enhance social protection was undermined by
weaknesses in the design of key social assistance programs, and a lack of reliable statistics to
target social assistance interventions--data from the 1991 Census on Basic Needs was being used
to distribute resources across geographic regions. With the support of the PRL, the provincial
government undertook several actions aimed at:

· Protecting the social safety net by assigning adequate budgetary resources to the Secretariat of
  Communitarian Promotion (Secretaría de Promoción Comunitaria).
· Modernizing beneficiary registration by supporting the development of a provincial registry of
  beneficiaries of assistance programs that could be cross-checked with national databases
  through the SINTyS Project.
· Enhancing the quality of provincial social assistance programs by conducting evaluations and
  developing action plans to improve their effectiveness.

Education: With one of the country's highest test scores, Santa Fe sought to consolidate the gains
from the reforms carried out in previous years aimed at increasing coverage and improving the
quality of education, especially for the poorer sections of society. In order to meet these goals
within a tight fiscal constraint, the province focused on measures to improve the use of existing




                                                 4

resources, while continuing to improve quality of education. The province identified the
following activities to be supported under the PRL in the education sector:

· Protecting education spending by ensuring an adequate level of funding for education during
    the economic downturn.
· Improving human resource management for teachers and students by supporting the
    implementation of a comprehensive computerized human resources management system.
· Enhancing the use of student/school evaluations by capitalizing on the robust national testing
    system (Operativos Nacionales de Evaluaci6n de Calidad - ONE) to improvement
    pedagogical practices and management at the school level.
· Strengthening teacher training institutes (Institutos de Formación Docente ­ IFDs) by setting
    in place an accreditation system consistent with the norms of the Federal Education Council
    (Consejo Federal de Educación).
· Improving the efficiency and equity of private school subsidies by incorporating into the
    formula used to assigned public resources to private schools objective criteria reflecting
    number of students, quality, and equity.

Health Reform: Although health indicators in Santa Fe were reasonable relative to other
provinces, some of them exhibited significant variation across the province. Moreover, the
incidence and prevalence of infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, AIDS, and Mal de Chagas,
was much higher than those of other provinces of similar income levels, being even more
prevalent among the poor. With an annual per capita spending of roughly Arg$84 in 2001, Santa
Fe's health spending was relatively low compared to other provinces in the country. In terms of
the structure of the heath sector, Santa Fe faced issues similar to those of other provinces,
including a high segmentation with multiple cross-subsidies, important distributive inefficiencies,
poor public hospital performance, weak primary care delivery as well as little regulatory capacity
on the part of the provincial Ministry of Health. The province identified the following activities to
be supported under the PRL in the health sector:

· Strengthening primary care for the uninsured by providing a pre-determined package of
  benefits that focus on maternal and child care services.
· Improving performance of public hospitals through performance contracts to ensure quality and
  increase cost recovery capitalizing of the existing legal framework that established a cost-
  recovery mechanism for public hospitals.
· Strengthening the regulatory role of the Ministry of Health to play an active role in the
  licensing of health care establishments operating in the province.
· Sustaining the financial balance of the public employee's health insurance carrier, IAPOS
  (Instituto Autárquico Provincial de Obra Social).

N/A

1.6 Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
schedule, and funding allocations):

Restructuring: By restructuring the operation in May 2003, the Bank sought to address the
profound changes that followed the economic collapse of December 2001, while preserving the
overall objectives of the loan. The decision to restructure the operation instead of canceling the
two undisbursed tranches was based on Santa Fe's solid fiscal management, even in the face of



                                                  5

crisis, and the substantial progress it had made in the implementation of the reforms in the areas
of public administration, social protection, education and health. Restructuring provided the
opportunity to reframe the province's program in a manner that was feasible given the
macroeconomic uncertainties without deviating from the operation's original development
objectives.

Despite the macroeconomic downturn and resulting reduction in revenues, Santa Fe was able to
maintain a fiscal program consistent with the original fiscal conditionalities and to advance on the
implementation of its reform program largely as anticipated. However, the new fiscal and social
conditions resulting from Argentina's economic collapse in December 2001, as well as an
unprecedented flood that affected large part of the provincial territory in April 2003, required that
the operation be restructured. Overall, out of the 58 remaining conditions, two conditions were
waived and 12 were amended--with five and nine conditions corresponding to the second and
third tranches, respectively. These amendments introduced adjustments needed to reflect the post-
2001 conditions, including the devaluation of the peso, the poor prospects for further privatization
of utilities, and the deterioration of socio-economic conditions. Specifically, the second-tranche
condition calling for a debt stock of less than 50 percent of total revenues was waived, because
this target became unattainable as a result of the devaluation, which increased the stock of debt by
a factor of three. The condition calling for the privatization of the electricity company EPESF was
also waived, as the new environment had rendered such privatization largely infeasible. Instead,
the province agreed to develop and implement an action plan to avoid the financial and
operational deterioration of EPESF and to establish a regulatory entity. No amendments were
necessary in the education and health sectors, except for a reduction in the number of
beneficiaries for the primary care program targeted for the third tranche (see Table 7.1, Annex 7
for a detailed description of individual amendments). By restructuring the operation as opposed
to canceling it, the Bank offered the province its support, as well as substantial incentives to
continue with the implementation of the critical set of reforms supported by the operation despite
the heightened fiscal and social pressure.

Cancellation: The current Argentina CAS, which was discussed by the Board in June 2006,
proposes a US$3.3 billion lending program that, at the request of the authorities, is made up
exclusively of investment operations. In this context, in agreement with the national government,
the three provincial reform loans, including Santa Fe's PRL, which were approved prior to the
2004-2005 CAS, were closed on March 31 2006, and undisbursed tranches totaling US$226
million were cancelled. These loans are envisaged to be replaced with new investment operations
in the provinces concerned, including a US$125 million provincial investment project in Santa Fe
that is currently being prepared (pp. 44, 49, CY 2006-2008 CAS).

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

The timing of the operation was clearly unpropitious, as it was approved in July 2001 and
declared effective in September 2001, just three months before the economic collapse of
December 2001. Despite the unfavorable economic environment, the province continued with the
implementation of various reforms, reflecting the strong commitment on the part of the provincial
authorities, the thoroughness of the preparation process, and the overall effectiveness of the PRL
model. However, the rapid deterioration in Argentina's macroeconomic conditions that ultimately
led to a full-blown economic and political crisis in December 2001 ultimately affected the
operation's implementation. Most notably, it prevented the province to publicly tender its
electricity company in October 2001 as originally anticipated due to lack of market demand. On
top of the ensuing economic and institutional chaos, provincial authorities also had to face an
unprecedented flood in 2003 that covered a large part of the provincial territory. Despite these
adverse conditions, Santa Fe's authorities showed a strong determination and continued to made
progress with their reform program. In 2003, Argentina began to emerge from the depth of the
crisis. Economic growth rebounded, reaching 8.8 percent growth in GDP in 2003, as a result of
the country's improved competitiveness due to the currency depreciation of 2002, favorable
international market and financial conditions, and sound fiscal management. Given Santa Fe's
sound fiscal management, both before and during the crisis, and its continued progress in the
implementation of its health, education, social protection reforms, even throughout the difficult
2001-2002 period, the PRL was given a new lease on life in May 2003, when it was restructured
to adapt its policy conditionalities to the post-crisis environment. The restructured second tranche
was disbursed in May 2003. Although the third tranche was cancelled in March 2006, Santa Fe
continued to advance in the implementation of its reform program and the corresponding PRL
conditionalities, except for the implementation of the agreed action plan for the electricity
company, which lagged behind (see Section 2.1, Tranche Release Binding Conditions). The
various aspects affecting implementation can be summarized as follows:

Strong Borrower's Commitment at the Provincial Level: The operation benefited from a strong
commitment on the part of provincial authorities, both the executive and legislative branches. The
governor, who, during a previous mandate had been responsible for the implementation of first-
generation reforms in the province, was closely involved in preparation activities. He also
enjoyed support from the legislature, where his political party held a majority, which allowed him
to obtain approval of key pieces of legislation, such as the Emergency Law, the law authorizing
the privatization of EPESF, and the adherence to the Federal Agreement, thus setting fiscal
parameters for the 2001-2005 period. The policy actions supported by the operation reflected the
province's own reform program as outlined in its Letter of Development Policy (May 28, 2001),
thus enhancing the province's ownership of the operation. Key cabinet ministers also provided
their strong backing of the reforms within the various sectors. The provincial Minister of
Education, who won the political battle to modify the criteria for allocating public subsidies



                                                     9

among private schools, eventually had to resign to post as a result of the loss of political capital
resulting from the confrontation. Santa Fe's reform program also benefited from the support of
the new administration that took office in December 2003, particularly in health and education.
Support wavered, however, in the reforms to the electricity sector.

Uneven Support from the National Government: The PRL program was designed to support
reform efforts in selected provinces in a manner consistent with national sector policy. Indeed, in
many cases national government saw the reforms efforts spearheaded by provincial governments
as cutting-edge, and hoped they would have a demonstration effect on more hesitant provincial
governments. As such, the reform programs were vetted by the national ministries and, in some
cases, with promises of technical assistance and political support. With the change in the national
administration in late 2001, the level of support was less forthcoming in some areas, such as
education, but became even stronger in other areas, such as health. It is also important to note that
the devaluation had an adverse impact in those provinces engaged in reform and investment
operations with the World Bank and IADB vis-à-vis those provinces who had borrowed from
commercial banks. Specifically, the provinces that had borrowed from development banks saw
the burden of IFI (International Financial Institution) loans triple overnight, as the loans had been
passed on them in U.S. dollars and they had to bear the exchange risk.

Natural Disaster: The challenges faced by the province were exacerbated in late April 2003, with
historical flooding affecting the north and east of Santa Fe, including the capital, which resulted
in massive evacuations, loss of property and extensive damage to infrastructure. The flooding
also had severe impact on revenue generation, as a result in the losses in the agricultural sector,
including grains, oilseeds, and beef exports.1

Thorough Preparation Process: The Bank dedicated a significant amount of resources to the
preparation of this operation, which resulted in the technical soundness and wide acceptance of
the policy actions it supported. Specifically:

· Internal consistency with the Bank's overall strategy: As mentioned above, the operation
  reflected the objectives of the overall Bank's strategy as outlined in FY 2001-2004 and OED's
  Country Assistance Evaluation (July 2000).
· Synergies with other sector operations: The Bank's team effectively capitalized on the
  experience and know-how developed by national-level sector operations, including IADB's
  PRISE, the Secondary Education Decentralization Project (PRODYMES-I) in education
  reforms, the National Program for Maternal and Child Nutrition and Health Project (PROMIN),
  the Provincial Health Development Project (PRESSAL) and the Health Insurance Reform and
  Technical Assistance Projects in health reforms, the Water Sector Reform and the Provincial
  Roads Projects for water and transport sectors, and the Second Provincial Development (PPD-
  II) and the Provincial Bank Privatization Loan in public sector reform.
· Technical soundness: A series of sector studies were conducted as part of the preparation,
  including an expenditure review in the health and education sectors, a financial management
  assessment, a tax administration assessment, a review of the province's contracting procedures,
  and an overview of the structure of the electricity sector. These studies, which involved the




1Through Bank-financed operations, Santa Fe had made important investments in flood control measures
since the major floods of 1992. However, much of this effort had been directed at the Paraná River, the
traditional source of flooding in the province. The 2003 flood was caused by the River Salado, an event
without precedent in recorded history.


                                                   10

  main actors within each sector, contributed to expanding the operation's base of support and
  enhancing the technical soundness of the overall reform program.
· Sensitivity toward gender issues: A gender assessment was conducted as part of loan
  preparation, which concluded that the reforms supported by the operation could potentially
  have important effects on reducing inter-gender disparities in accessing social services (both
  health and education), as well as enhancing professional opportunities for achieving gender
  equity in public sector management. In the case of the health reforms, reproductive health was
  given a central focus within the provincial health insurance program.
· Participatory process with a strong focus on equity and social issues: Building upon the lessons
  learned during previous PRL operations, the Bank's team and provincial authorities gave
  particular importance to public input during the design process, which significantly enhanced
  the legitimacy of the reform program. A social impact assessment was implemented to assess
  socioeconomic conditions affecting the poor and eliciting the views of local actors about social
  risks to be taken into account in the operation's design. As a result of this initiative, specific
  actions were identify as part of a social development strategy to achieve a more pro-equity
  approach in the education and sector reforms, and mitigation measures were identified to
  address the potential social impacts associated with some of the reforms, such as the
  privatization of EPESF. As mentioned earlier, although poverty indicators were identified at
  appraisal to better measure the operation's impact of low-income population, they were not
  systematically monitored as a result of the overall disarray that ensued after the December 2001
  crisis.

Operation's Design: Overall, the operation effectively built upon the PRL model and effectively
incorporated the lessons learned during the previous PRL-II and III operations. Specifically, the
operation benefited from a robust design, with specific strengths that can be summarized as
follows:

· Effectiveness of the PRL model: The operation replicated the PRL model previously piloted
  under the four preceding PRL-II operations. Actors at all levels, including national and
  provincial authorities and professional staff, as well as the Bank's task managers and sector
  specialists, noted the particular strengths of the PRL's cross-sector approach to public sector
  reform, which simultaneously addressed the need to enhance efficiency and service delivery in
  the social sectors while maintaining a sustainable fiscal framework, thus, enhancing the
  medium- and long-term sustainability of the development process. Likewise, by lending
  directly to provincial governments, operations such as Santa Fe's PRL can tailor policy actions
  to the specific needs of the provinces, as well as coordinate at the provincial level the various
  sector operations being sponsored at the national level.
· Incorporation of lessons learned: Santa Fe's PRL effectively incorporated the lessons learned
  from the previous four PRL-II loans, including, among others: (i) the need to ensure the
  appropriate sequencing of social sector reforms, thus selecting provinces such as Santa Fe that
  have already achieved a level of control in their fiscal and debt situations; (ii) the need to
  extend the life of the operation beyond 12 to 18 months to adapt more realistically to the time
  needed to implement reforms and show initial results; (iii) the need to have broad political
  support for the reform program, including not only the executive power and legislative branch,
  but also larger civil society; (iv) the benefits from including social assessment and participatory
  mechanisms as a part of the project's preparation to help ensure the implementation and
  sustainability of reforms; (v) the importance of capitalizing on ongoing sector operations to
  provide the needed know-how to implement sector reforms; and (vi) ensuring that most
  legislation required for the program, including those involving privatization and hospital
  decentralization, were already in place. In addition, the institutional capacities of the ministries



                                                   11

  of health, education, and social protection were explicitly assessed during project preparation
  and institutional strengthening plans were prepared detailing specific technical assistance inputs
  from other operations and the provincial government.
· Sound policy conditionalities: The Policy Matrix reflected a very ambitious reform program, as
  reflected by the 29 conditions corresponding to the second tranche and another 29 conditions to
  the third tranche. Despite the large number and complex nature of the policy conditionality, it
  was in line with the implementation capacity of the province. These conditions provided a
  sound operationalization of the reform program being supported under the PRL, including key
  policy actions (such as the public tender of the electricity company) and agreed performance
  targets for the various policy areas (such as attaining fiscal balance). Moreover, it is important
  to note that Santa Fe's Policy Matrix did not include technical inputs (such as requirements to
  conduct technical studies on specific topics or adopting action plans) that generally do not
  reflect any substantial achievement. Except for the concession of the electricity company, the
  rest of the conditions proved to be feasible despite their ambitiousness. In retrospect, however,
  the policy condition regarding the financial stability of the provincial health insurance carrier
  IAPOS could have been supported with specific actions aimed at further strengthening its
  financial position and operation.

Risk Assessment: Although at the time of appraisal it was expected that the measures taken by the
De la Rúa administration would succeed in averting a major economic crisis, in retrospect it is
now clear that the risk of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions was underestimated by the
markets, governments, and international financial institutions, particularly when considering that
the operation was approved and declared effective just a few months prior to the 2001 debacle.
However, it is important to consider that Santa Fe's PRL was just one component of a larger
country strategy, as underscored by the fact that the operation was presented to the Board together
with the CAS Progress Report (July 11, 2001). Not surprisingly, the Board discussion focused
mainly on the overall country strategy and the level of risk posed by the macroeconomic and
political fragility rather than on Santa Fe's PRL. Moreover, the Report and Recommendation of
the President (Report No. P7462-AR) clearly identifies the deterioration in the macroeconomic
environment as a key risk factor affecting the operation and presents a clear portrait of
Argentina's macroeconomic and political environment. Specifically, the report points to the
systematic replacement of key cabinet positions, including the vice-president in 2002 and a
succession of three ministers of economy in early 2001; the deterioration of fiscal indicators; and
the staggering country risk spreads signaling the lack of investor confidence. In addition, the
Bank's team conducted a thorough analysis of the potential impact of a macroeconomic crisis on
Santa Fe's public finances, including the consequences of a fall in revenues and the national
government not honoring existing agreements such as the compensation payments for provincial
pension funds. The sensitivity analysis included scenarios with various degrees of severity, the
worst of which considered the impact of a potential two percent drop in GDP. Later events
proved that this scenario was exceedingly optimistic, as the actual drop in Argentina's DGP was
11 percent in 2002. Nevertheless, despite the difficulties associated with predicting the ensuing
crisis and its severity, the risk assessment should have identified that the concession of EPESF, a
key second-tranche condition, was infeasible given the existing macroeconomic conditions.

Economic and Political Collapse 2001-2002: When the project was declared effective in
September 2001, the political and social situation was deteriorating rapidly. By the end of the
year, capital flight led to the imposition of banking controls, a policy that proved highly
unpopular and the cause of massive protests. In December 2001, President de la Rúa resigned and
was succeeded by several interim presidents in the month after his resignation until President
Duhalde was appointed by the national congress to complete the existing presidential term
through May 2003. During the interim presidencies, the parity between the peso and the dollar


                                                 12

was abandoned, and the national government announced that it would not service its external debt
(except for that with the IFIs). The social costs of the crisis were profound, with poverty gripping
more than 50 percent of the population by July 2002. While Santa Fe was better prepared than
other provinces, managing the effects of the economic and political debacle as well as the 2003
flood absorbed much attention on the part of provincial authorities. Given the highly unfavorable
implementation environment, the achievements of Santa Fe's PRL and the unwavering support of
provincial authorities are particularly noteworthy.

Post-Crisis Economic Environment: Despite the very difficult macroeconomic context, the
national and provincial governments took extraordinary measures to contain the fiscal situation
during 2002, which led to the eventual stabilization of federal-provincial fiscal relations. The
national government entered into bilateral agreements (Programa de Financiamiento Ordenado
de las Finanzas Provinciales - PFO) with 17 of the 24 provinces, including Santa Fe, agreeing to
support debt restructuring and servicing in exchange for the provinces meeting specific fiscal and
debt targets. The national government also agreed on a transition program with the IMF, covering
the period January through August 2003. In view of the more promising macroeconomic
prospects, the original closing date of March 2003 was extended to December 2003 to allow for
the operation's restructuring, which was completed in May 2003 together with the disbursement
of the second tranche. After two additional extensions, the operation was finally closed on March
31, 2006, and the US$126.7 million corresponding to the third tranche were cancelled, due to
insufficient progress in the implementation of EPESF's action plan as well as uncertainties in the
country's macro framework over the medium term, including concerns regarding the lack of
engagement on the part of national authorities on structural issues affecting investment climate
and private sector participation. As noted below under lessons learned, the experience of Santa
Fe's PRL shows that failings or uncertainties at the macro level that are beyond the sphere of
influence of provincial governments can override substantial achievements at the provincial level.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

(a)      M&E Design: As mentioned earlier, the Policy Matrix effectively made operational the
major aspects of Santa Fe's reform strategy and the main project outputs associated with the
operation. To bring the operation to current design standards, a logical framework was
subsequently retrofitted in July 2005, which has been partly used to measure impact as part of this
ICR. However, baseline values were not identified and the province was not made responsible for
reporting them, which has severely limited their usefulness.

(b)      M&E Implementation: The operation's implementation as well as the continuity and
fluidity of supervision efforts were disrupted during 2002, as chaos ensued and Argentina entered
in default (it is important to note, however, that PSRs were still completed periodically). Full-
fledged supervision efforts resumed in early 2003 to determine the viability of restructuring the
operation and assess the progress made toward the accomplishment of second tranche policy
conditions. During supervision, the Policy Matrix and the corresponding sections in the legal
agreement (Schedules 3 and 4) functioned as the main M&E tool for the operation given that lack
of provincial follow-up on other sets of indicators.

(c)      M&E Utilization: Particularly noteworthy are the monitoring systems adopted in relation
to the provincial health insurance program, and the performance contracts between public
hospitals and the Ministry of Health, which constituted useful M&E tools designed as part of the
health component. Specifically, the monitoring system for the provincial health insurance
program provides instruments for detailed monitoring of the profile of the beneficiary population,
the services they receive, and the level of achievement of performance contracts of individual


                                                 13

medical teams. Likewise, the performance contracts between public hospitals and the province
clearly specify performance targets on an annual basis, which are formally agreed on by the
hospital directors and the provincial Ministry of Health. These performance contracts have been
very useful in monitoring progress and assessing the performance of public hospitals.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

The current CAS reflects a significant shift from development policy lending to an investment-led
strategy. As a result, policy-based operations like Santa Fe's PRL are not envisioned in the near
future despite a potentially substantial demand at the provincial level. Nevertheless, there are
several operations within the current CAS that can support Santa Fe's efforts to further strengthen
public sector management and the delivery of basic infrastructure and social services. Specifically,
the Sub-National Governments Modernization Loan (Loan No. 7352-AR, approved December
2005) is designed to support provincial governments in their efforts to improve their institutional
capabilities and those of their municipalities to effectively manage their resources and improve
the quality of government administrative services. Based on a set of eligibility conditions
designed to gauge progress in the core areas of public sector management--i.e., financial
administration, tax administration, cadastres, and property registries--provincial governments
can participate in a Basic Module to complete and consolidate the modernization of these core
areas, and those that are more advanced in their modernization efforts can also participate in the
Advanced Module to focus on the modernization of other areas in their provincial or municipal
administrations. Santa Fe has presented a reform program amounting to almost US$17 million to
be supported under this operation, focusing on important second-generation reforms, such as the
modernization of the judicial system and the strengthening of public management at the
municipal level.

In the health sector, the ongoing Maternal-Child Health Insurance APL (Loan No. 7225-AR;
approved October 2003), which supports the implementation of the country's flagship maternal-
child health program (Plan Nacer), is currently being implemented in the nine poorest provinces.
Santa Fe would be eligible to participate in the nation-wide rollout of this project (APL 2; Loan
No. 7409 -AR; approved November 2006), to continue the expansion of its provincial health
insurance program, which has similar characteristics to the Plan Nacer program. The province
could also be potentially eligible to participate in the Essential Health Services Program (Loan No.
7412-AR; approved November 2006), which will replicate the incentive and governance
structures introduced under the Plan Nacer in public health functions at the provincial level,
including vaccination, as well as implementation of provincial health prevention and promotion
activities for HIV/AIDS, infectious diseases, and health monitoring. In the education sector,
Santa Fe is currently participating in the ongoing Rural Education Improvement Project (Loan No.
7353-AR, approved December 2005), which aims to increase school attendance among children
in rural areas.

Sector operations focusing on basic infrastructure include Santa Fe's Provincial Investment
project--currently under preparation--which will support upgrading Santa Fe's road network,
building upon the PRL's efforts to improve economic evaluation of public investments and
environmental screening. The province is also participating in the Provincial Roads Infrastructure
Project (Loan No. 7301-AR, approved June 2005), which aims to support the use of CREMA
contracts in participating provinces and strengthen the provincial road agencies. In addition, Santa
Fe announced its intention to participate in the Basic Municipal Services 2 (Loan No. 7385-AR,
approved June 2006), which provides support to provincial authorities' efforts to implement
strategies to expand water, and especially sewage coverage, including subsidies to low income
people living in areas of high sanitary or environmental vulnerability.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global priorities,
and Bank assistance strategy):

As a result of the uncertainties regarding the medium-term macroeconomic framework, together
with the Bank's limited dialogue with the national government in key policy areas, the current
CAS does not include policy-based lending operations. Consequently, policy-based lending
operations directed at provincial governments such as Santa Fe's PRL are not included in the CY
2006-2008 CAS. However, the objectives of this operation are still consistent with those
established under the current as well as the 2004-2005 CAS. Specifically, by focusing on
advancing reforms in the social sectors while maintaining fiscal responsibility, Santa Fe's PRL is
fully consistent with the current CAS objectives of promoting sustained growth with equity,
social inclusion, and improved governance (p. 30, CY 2006-2008 CAS).

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives (including brief discussion of causal
linkages between policy actions supported by operations and outcomes):

In retrospect, the macroeconomic framework that existed at the time of Board approval proved to
be unsustainable in light of the traumatic events of late 2001 and the first half of 2002. In
particular, the vulnerability of the economy to the volatility of private capital flows and the
imbalance in relative factor prices seem to have been underestimated. Also, in retrospect, the debt
situation at the national level turned out to be more one of insolvency than illiquidity, as believed
at the time the international financing package was put together. As a result, despite Santa Fe's
fiscal adjustment during 2000 and 2001, the operation's general objective of supporting macro
stability and, implicitly, the convertibility of the exchange rate was thus not met. However, with
its emphasis on fiscal responsibility, Santa Fe's PRL has contributed to restoring macroeconomic
stability during the post-crisis period.

The operation has largely met its specific development objective of helping Santa Fe reform and
restructure its public sector to ensure efficiency, quality and equity in public services within
fiscally sound policies. With the support of the PRL, Santa Fe succeeded in advancing critical
reforms in the areas of health, education and social protection, ensuring a more efficient and
responsive delivery of these key social services. These accomplishments have been done in the
framework of fiscally sound policies and despite the economic, political and social upheaval that
ensued after the 2001 crisis and the added challenge posed by the 2003 flood. The concession of
the electricity company EPESF was the only development objective that fell short of expectations,
as privatization plans were stalled by the unfavorable macroeconomic conditions. Unfortunately,
substantial steps were not taken to prevent the financial and operational deterioration of EPESF or
establish a regulatory entity for the electric sector. Achievements under the various policy areas
can be summarized as follows:

Public Finances: Moderately Satisfactory Performance. Santa Fe was one of the few provinces
that took preemptive fiscal measures to respond to the deterioration of macroeconomic conditions
in early 2000, almost two years before the crisis of 2001. With the full support of the incoming
governor, the new economic team adopted strict adjustment measures aimed at reducing
provincial expenditures, obtaining legislative approval for an Emergency Law that included a
reduction in salaries and pension benefits, and a set of complementary measures aimed at
improving efficiency and rationality in the use of public funds. The PRL was seen as a key
component of the overall reform strategy, which helped maintain focus on fiscal targets and key
reforms in social protection, health and education.


                                                  15

As a result of its preventive adjustment and the actions taken under the PRL, Santa Fe was better
prepared to weather the crisis than other provinces. The province succeeded in maintaining solid
fiscal performance without major social and political disruptions, thereby meeting its payroll
obligations without resorting to the issuing of quasi-money.2 The province was able to meet the
second tranche condition calling for a current surplus, and, although the third tranche was
cancelled, it would have met the corresponding fiscal targets regarding current account balance
and level of indebtedness (see Annex 7.3). In March 2005, Santa Fe subscribed to the national
Fiscal Responsibility Law (Ley Federal de Responsabilidad Fiscal ­ LRF; No.25.917), which
sets general rules in terms of fiscal performance and public debt sustainability for the Argentinean
public sector, including the provincial governments. Santa Fe met the performance targets
corresponding to 2005, including having a debt service of 8.4 percent of net current revenues,
which is below the 15 percent maximum level allowed under the FRL. Moreover, under the PRL,
the province has made significant strides toward modernizing its administration, including the
enactment of a Financial Administration Law and the implementation of an integrated financial
management system. As a result of its strong fiscal discipline, Santa Fe is one of the best
performing provinces in Argentina.

The electricity company, however, remains in the hands of the province, as its concession became
unrealistic in the face of the existing macroeconomic environment. While the second- and third-
tranche conditions regarding EPESF's concession were waived, the province has failed to
implement its action plan aimed at preventing the further deterioration of the EPESF, as required
by the amendment. Recently enacted legislation has rescinded the previous privatization law and
returned EPESF to provincial ownership. Most importantly, despite some corrective measures
taken by the province, the electricity company has continued to generate operational deficits,
requiring the transfer of Arg$40 million from the provincial treasury in 2006.




2Fifteen provincial governments resorted to issuing quasi-money amounting to over US$5 billion to meet
their payroll obligations.

    The accomplishment of the specific objectives under public finances and administration can be
    summarized as follows:

    · Sustaining fiscal responsibility: Accomplished. Despite the macroeconomic crisis, the province
      succeeded in achieving a current account surplus and an overall surplus from 2002 onward, as a
      result of its strong fiscal discipline. As of December 2005, Santa Fe's current account surplus
      represented 20.7 percent of current revenues, compared to 14.7 percent for the provinces as a
      whole (see Table 1). Likewise, overall surplus represented 10.6 percent of current revenues for
      the same period, compared to 2.2 percent for provinces as a whole. The second tranche
      condition, calling for the debt stock to be equal or less than 50 percent of current revenues, was
      waived when the operation was restructured, as the devaluation of the peso in early 2002
      resulted in roughly a three-fold increase in the stock of debt held by international financial
      institutions--i.e., the Bank and IADB. At the time of the disbursement of the second tranche,
      Santa Fe's debt stock was estimated at 87 percent of current revenues, well beyond the original
      50 percent target. However, had the peso remained pegged to the US dollar, such ratio would
      have been 47 percent, below the original target. Both the original third-tranche condition (i.e.,
      stock of debt equal to or less than 50 percent of current revenues) and the amended condition
      (i.e., the stock of debt to remain constant since the disbursement of the second tranche) have
      been met. In fact, Santa Fe's stock of debt represented 31 percent of current revenues as of
      December 2005, compared to 115 percent for all provinces as a whole. Santa Fe's stock of debt
      increased by a factor of 0.85 between 1999 and 2005, compared to 1.5 for the provinces as a
      whole. Moreover, despite the devaluation of the peso, the province's stock of debt in U.S.
      dollars has decreased in absolute terms since 1999, reflecting the province's sound financial
      management before, during, and after the crisis. Santa Fe's current debt profile is characterized
      by relatively long terms and lower interest rates.

· Financial management and transparency: Accomplished. All conditions corresponding to the
  second and third tranches have been met. A Financial Administration Law (Ley de
  Administración, Eficiencia y Control del Estado; Law No. 12.510) was approved by the
  legislature in late 2005 and enacted in February 2006. It provides the legal framework for the
  establishment of a provincial financial administration and public procurement system. An
  integrated financial management system (Sistema Informático Provincial de Administración
  Financiera - SIPAF) consistent with the law has been implemented with support of the PDP-II.
  It consists of the core financial management modules of budget, accounting, treasury, and
  public debt as well as procurement. The system, which is fully implemented in the central
  administration of the provincial public sector, allows for real-time controls and reports, as well
  as substantial reductions in operation costs and enhanced transparency. The province regularly
  publishes information on budgetary execution, treasury balance, human resources, debt
  obligations, and procurement on its website (http://www.portal.santafe.gov.ar).
· Public investments: Accomplished. As required by second-tranche conditionality, public
  investments estimated to cost Arg$75 million or more were subject to an economic analysis and
  an environmental impact analysis. Provincial budgets for 2003, 2004 and 2005 included at least
  Arg$30 million for routine road maintenance. Moreover, financing from the Provincial Roads
  Project provided substantial financing for road maintenance, helping the province exceed its
  road maintenance goals by an ample margin (for example, in 2004 the province allocated
  Arg$36.3 million to the Provincial Road Agency, with an additional Arg$86.4 million being
  provided by the Bank's Provincial Road Project).
· Reducing tax distortions: Accomplished. The province has complied with the provisions set
  forth in Article 30 of the province's Law No. 11.876 of December 28, 2000 with respect to the
  gradual elimination of the payroll tax rate on the industrial sector. The payroll tax was reduced
  by one-third as of January 1, 2001, an additional one-third percent as of January 1, 2002, and
  the remaining one-third as of January 1, 2003.This reduction carried an annual fiscal cost of
  Arg$15 million. In addition, the province eliminated the stamp tax on transactions involving the
  registration, expansion, or creation of new companies.
· Tax administration: Accomplished. The province and the national government are sharing
  information with respect to tax reporting, tax audits and tax collection regarding federal and
  provincial taxes, in accordance with the provisions of the agreement (Acuerdo Marco de
  Adhesión al Sistema de Identificacion Nacional Tributario y Social- SINTyS) subscribed by the
  national government and the province on May 23, 2000. In addition, the province is working
  closely with the federal tax authority (AFIP) to detect undeclared constructions using satellite
  imaging to improve property tax collections. It has also subscribed cooperation agreements
  with municipalities to facilitate the regular update of cadastral data. Santa Fe has also
  subscribed to an agreement with AFIP to cross tax data through the OSIRIS system, which
  provides the province additional information on taxpayers and declarations for the major taxes.
  Finally, electronic tax forms can be downloaded from the province's website, not only for the
  gross receipts tax as required by the PRL, but also property tax, vehicle registration, and payroll
  tax.3

· Concession of the electricity company: Not Accomplished. Under the program, Santa Fe had
  agreed to publicly tender its public electric distribution company (EPESF) as a second tranche
  condition and, after the concession was in place, to set up a regulatory agency and regulate the
  use of the proceeds from the privatization. Although a privatization law satisfactory to the Bank
  was approved by the Legislature and appropriate bidding documents were prepared, a lack of
  market demand caused the province not to publicly tender the company for bidding in October

  2001, as originally anticipated. The governor formally announced his decision to temporarily
  suspend the privatization process in May 2002 in view of the continuing macroeconomic
  uncertainties. During restructuring, the conditions calling for privatization were waived due to
  their infeasibility at the time. As a second-tranche condition, Santa Fe instead agreed to an
  action plan to avoid deterioration in service and financial status, so that the enterprise itself
  would remain attractive for concession in the future. Specifically, the action plan called for: (i)
  increasing the financial and political autonomy of EPESF; (ii) creating a regulatory entity; (iii)
  regulating the participation of cooperatives providing electricity; and, (iv) implementing a
  series of policy actions to be undertaken by EPESF in staffing; tariffs, quality; investment, non-
  technical losses; environmental cleanup, and debt renegotiation, with associated technical and
  financial efficiency targets throughout 2005.

  The implementation of the action plan, however, has been stalled under the current
  administration, and no progress has been made in relation to the first three actions and only
  partial progress has been made on the fourth action. The frequent and extensive blackouts
  experienced during this past summer point to little if any improvements in EPESF's
  performance. In addition, the financial status of EPESF has deteriorated steadily since 2000, the
  last year in which an operational balance was achieved. Initially, this deterioration was
  primarily the result of the crisis and the ensuing fall in revenues. More recently, however, it
  has been the result of the growing gap between expenditures and revenues. On the expenditure
  side, EPESF, as all electricity companies in the country, has faced a sustained rise in costs,
  including wholesale electricity, construction materials such as copper and siliceous iron,
  personnel, and services provided by third parties, such as security, cleaning and real estate
  leasing. On the revenue side, tariffs have not been increased since 2001, in line with the
  position adopted at the national level.      While there has been some success in reducing
  electricity theft as a result of a systematic campaign initiated in January 2005, the
  corresponding gains have not been enough to offset rising costs. In 2005, EPESF's operational
  deficit (resultado operativo) amounted to Arg$55 million. In July 2006, a decree (Decree No.
  1.336) was approved to provide EPESF a grant of Arg$40 million from the provincial treasury
  to cover the financial gap for the current year, which is expected to be significantly larger than
  in 2005. This action constitutes a worrisome precedent of provincial bail-outs, particularly as
  the province has recently opted to regain control of the water company. As further discussed in
  Section 4, a law has been recently passed that rescinds the privatization law and returns EPESF
  to provincial ownership.

Social Protection: Satisfactory Performance. With the support of the PRL, the province protected
the budgetary resources allocated to social programs even during the worst of the crisis. It also
succeeded in improving targeting of provincial social programs and their effectiveness. As the
rest of the country, Santa Fe was hit hard by the 2001 crisis, particularly in the Gran Rosario
metropolitan area, where the percentage of the population below poverty increased by 20.4
percentage points compared to other urban areas in the country (see Table 2). However, the
province was able to recover more swiftly that the rest of country, as illustrated by the 24
percentage points reduction in the number of people living below poverty in the Gran Rosario
area between 2002 and 2005, compared to 14.5 for the country as a whole. As a result, Santa Fe's
current levels of urban poverty are below those before the crisis, while urban areas in Argentina
as a whole have been unable to reach pre-crisis poverty levels. Although the level of poverty is
determined by a myriad of factors, the level of funding that Santa Fe assigned to provincial social
protection programs and its efforts to increase their effectiveness undoubtedly provided an
important safety net during the crisis and subsequent recovery.

The main achievements of Santa Fe's PRL in the area of social protection can be summarized as
follows:

· Protection of budgetary resources for social protection programs: Accomplished. The
  budgetary resources assigned to the Secretariat for Communitarian Promotion for 2003 were
  above the specified target of Arg$90 million. This level of funding allowed the province to
  expand ongoing programs to meet the social challenges associated with the economic crisis,
  giving special emphasis to a provincial Emergency Food Program (Programa de Emergencia
  Alimentaria). Santa Fe's efforts in social protection are above those of other provinces, as
  illustrated by the 8.6 percent of its 2004 budget for social protection compared to 6.1 percent
  for the provinces as a whole.
· Enhanced quality of social provincial social protection programs: Accomplished. Evaluations
  acceptable to the Bank were undertaken for the Social Solidarity Program (Programa
  Provincial de Ayuda Solidaria Santa Fe - PPASS) and the Old Age (Tercera Edad) programs
  of the Secretariat for Community Promotion. In addition, the province conducted an evaluation
  and implemented action plan to improve the Emergency Food Program. The PPASS, a
  provincial program based on cash transfer in exchange for work, remained at the core of the
  provincial efforts to attend the mounting social needs and served as a model for the federal-
  level program Heads of Households, which eventually replaced it. The Food Emergency
  Program has played a key role not only in the aftermath of the crisis but also in providing
  assistance to those affected by the 2003 flood. Since its inception in 2001, the program has

        experienced a process of gradual decentralization according to the recommendations of the
        evaluation study that has resulted in substantial gains in efficiency and targeting.
     · Improved targeting of social assistance: Accomplished. Since the first steps to systematically
        register PPASS beneficiaries in early 2000, the province has consistently improved its registry
        of beneficiaries of social programs. The province regularly integrates its databases with those
        databases at the national level, including those under the national Ministry of Social
        Development (e.g., SIEMPRO and SISFAM information systems)4 and the Ministry of Labor
        (e.g., Program Head of Households). SINTyS plays a key role in the integration of the various
        databases, with Santa Fe being one of the four provinces that are interconnected online with the
        system. By crossing its databases against those of SINTyS, in January 2006 alone, Santa Fe was
        able to detect Arg$32,000 in duplicated or incompatible benefits under the province's social
        assistance programs.

     Education: Satisfactory Achievement. The PRL effectively supported reforms in education to
     enhance quality and increase efficiency and equity, achieving full compliance for both the second
     and third tranches. The main accomplishment include (i) the implementation of computerized
     human resource management systems for teachers and students; (ii) the proactive use of national
     student achievement tests to improve performance at the school level; (iii) the closure of surplus
     teacher training institutes and the implementation of an accrediting system to enhance their
     quality; and (iv) the design of a system to allocate public subsidies to private schools based on
     objective criteria reflecting efficiency, quality, and equity considerations.

Santa Fe ranks consistently better than the average for all provinces on major indicators reflecting
education coverage, efficiency and quality, including illiteracy rates, student/teacher ratio, and
repetition and drop-out rates. Between 1998 and 2003, Santa Fe improved its performance
relative to other provinces in terms of the percentage of over-age students, repetition rates and
student/teacher ratio. Moreover, provincial data for 2005 shows increased coverage for preschool,
with 98.3 percent, 72 percent, and 25 percent for five, four, and three-year olds, respectively (no
data is available for provinces as a whole). In addition, schools with high percentage of minority
native groups with a total of almost 1,500 students now offer bilingual education. Santa Fe is one
of the provinces of the Central Region, which has the highest test scores of all the regions in the
country. Unfortunately, the lack of data at the provincial level on standardized test scores (results
at the provincial level were last made public in 1999) prevents inter-year comparison for
individual provinces.

· Protecting education spending: Accomplished. The PRL effectively protected the level of
  education spending during the economic downturn. Specifically, provincial budgets for
  education in 2002 and 2003 were higher than that of 2001. As a result, the savings arising from
  the educational reforms were reinvested in priority educational programs and other measures
  aimed at enhancing quality, efficiency, and equity in the educational sector. Santa Fe continues
  to assign more resources to education relative to other provinces, as illustrated by the 31.3
  percent of its 2004 budget assigned to education and culture compared to 27.2 percent for the
  provinces as a whole.
· Improving human resource management: Accomplished. With PRL support, Santa Fe has
  implemented a state-of-the art, comprehensive human resources management system for the
  education sector. The system is constituted by three main elements: (i) a human resources
  management system for education personnel (Sistema de Administraci6n de Recursos Humanos
  - SARH); (ii) a system of school management and administration (Sistema de Gesti6n y
  Administración Escolar ­ SIGAE); and (iii) an executive management system for the Ministry
  of Education that integrates the other two other systems (Sistema de Información Ejecutiva del
  Ministerio de Educación ­ iSIEME).
  a) SAHR: Based on a single teacher file (Legajo Único), the implementation of the SAHR
      system represents an important tool for human resource management. All 80,000
      employees corresponding to the 2750 public schools are registered in the system. The
      SAHR has also incorporated the totality of 771 private schools that receive public subsidies
      for teachers' salaries.    The SAHR has led to an improvement in the efficiency of
      educational expenditures, as it provides a match between staff positions (cargos) and the
      people who occupy them, thus enhancing transparency of payroll expenditures. The SAHR
      system also offers a true representation of the employment of teaching and non-teaching
      staff in individual schools, thus making it possible to identify deviations from established
      staffing norms.
  b) SIGAE: The system now has full coverage, and contains information on the 615,963
      students who are enrolled in the 2,750 public schools and on the 229,651 students who are
      enrolled in the 771 private schools. The electronic record corresponding to each individual
      student (Legajo Único de Alumnos) contains basic information such as name, surname, date
      of birth, residential address, enrolment trajectory, grade passing and grade repetition.
      Through an agreement with SINTyS subscribed to on October 2005, information has also
      been added on the student's identification, family relationships, and socio-economic data of
      the parents. In this way, the province is now able to design, implement and monitor more
      sophisticated policy measures aimed at improving the quality of population, enhance
      targeting of the most vulnerable student population, and systematically track the evolution
      of score tests, as well as drop-out and repetition rates.



                                                 22

 c) iSIEME: This system, the first to be implemented among Argentina's provinces, is a
       critical tool to enhance the allocation of human resources and to focus on education quality
       at the school level. It has four modules: (i) school infrastructure; (ii) enrollment; (iii)
       teaching staff and positions; and (iv) educational indicators. The system has already been
       used to enhance the allocation of resources among individual schools. For example, 308
       teachers were reallocated to meet the changing demands of secondary schools in 2002. In
       2006, the iSIEME was the key tool used to determine the best allocation of newly created
       posts amounting to Arg$10 million in annual expenditures.
· Enhancing the use of student/school evaluations. Accomplished. The Federal Ministry of
 Education has established a series of national standardized achievement tests for different grade
 levels (Operativos Nacionales de Evaluaci6n de Calidad - ONE). The tests and the
  administering process are of high quality, and the Federal Ministry disseminates test results as
  well as the analysis of those results. It also distributes guides for teachers and school principals
  for improving teaching practices based on the weaknesses in student achievement revealed by
  the test scores. While potentially a valuable tool, the utilization of the test scores at the
  provincial level and the schools themselves is undermined by a lack of local ownership and
  institutional processes. In order to improve the quality of teaching and learning, the province is
  implementing a strategic plan to ensure the utilization of the results of the ONE, and the related
  data on educational statistics collected from schools. The program is already in place in all
  secondary schools and is now in the process of being implemented in basic education. The
  school improvement program includes the use of information regarding students' test scores
  from the ONE test as well as internal efficiency measures derived from the iSIEME system.
  The program seeks to incorporate school principals and teachers in a critical assessment of the
  performance of individual schools, diagnosing problems and identifying corrective measures.
  Leadership in monitoring and evaluation is provided by the provincial Ministry of Education,
  with supervisors who participate actively in training and follow-up. The implementation of a
  new program focusing on 132 public schools with particularly high repetition rates is one of the
  spin-offs of the program. However, the sustainability of this initiative is endangered by the
  delays at the national level to publish ONE's results. The latest ones, published in 2003, show
  test scores aggregated at the regional level rather than for individual provinces (see Section 4).
· Strengthening teacher training: Accomplished. With the support of the PRL, the province is
  currently implementing the accreditation of private and public teaching institutes operating in
  the province according to the norms of the Federal Education Council with the ultimate purpose
  of balancing the supply and demand for teacher training and research, and ensuring their quality
  and relevance. Of a total of 145 teaching institutes in Santa Fe at the level of non-university
  tertiary education, 65 received full accreditation, 70 received conditional accreditation and 10
  were not accredited. As part of this process, there is now tighter overseeing of admission and
  course offerings, thereby reducing by 25 percent and 18 percent the admissions corresponding
  to elementary and intermediate education, respectively, between 2002 and 2003. In addition,
  there has been an increase in enrollment in those areas for which there is high demand in the
  province.
· Improving the efficiency and equity of private school subsidies: Accomplished. Amounting to
  nearly 20 percent of the provincial education budget, public subsidies to private schools were
  originally conceived as a redistribution tool to support students from families who could not
  afford the full cost of private school tuition. In practice, however, the allocation of subsidies
  was the result of marginal modifications over time, with no systematic follow-up to ensure
  equity objectives were being met. Despite facing significant opposition, the province moved
  decisively to implement a system whereby the control and monitoring of the distribution of
  subsidies is based on objective criteria--i.e., the number of students, their socio-economic
  status, and school performance in terms of quality. Formally adopted in 2003, the new norms
  establish strict criteria to improve the targeting of public subsidies toward low-income families.


                                                  23

  Of the 771 private schools in the province, only those that request voluntary payments of less
  than Arg$25 a month are eligible to receive a full subsidy, with a sliding scale as payments
  increase. The norms also distinguish clearly between required tuition and voluntary
  contributions, closing the loophole previously used by some schools of charging a low tuition
  but requiring additional payments. The administration of the subsidies has also improved
  significantly as a result of the incorporation of teacher information into the SAHR for those
  schools receiving subsidies, as subsidies are only to be used for teachers' salaries. In addition,
  external audits are being conducted on an annual basis, covering roughly 100 schools per year.
  The implementation of the new subsidy system has been very successful, not only by enhancing
  targeting, but also reducing the cost of private education in general, as several schools have
  voluntarily reduced tuitions to increase their levels of subsidies.

Health reform: Satisfactory Performance. Under the PRL, Santa Fe made substantial progress in
the reforms of the health sector. The actual achievements are equal or higher than the levels
anticipated during the project's design, which were not substantially modified by the 2003
amendment. The PRL provided the framework for the province to define a comprehensive policy
framework for the health sector and to provide continuity throughout the 1999-2005 period. The
most notable achievement in the health sector has been the launching of a primary care program
for the uninsured poor focusing on maternal and child care services, which has been an important
precedent for Plan Nacer, the flagship health initiative of the Kirchner administration. The
province also implemented a program to enhance the performance of public hospitals through
performance contracts to ensure quality and increase cost recovery, and strengthened its own
regulatory capacity. While IAPOS, the provincial health insurance agency for public employees,
succeeded in achieving a financial balance by the time of disbursement of the second tranche, it
has struggled since then, as a result of rocketing medical costs due to the devaluation without a
corresponding increase in revenues. The prospects for IAPOS regaining financial balance are
more promising for 2006.

Santa Fe's performance in the health sector remains above average relative to other provinces,
with the change in main health indicators being similar to that of the country as a whole between
1998 and 2003. Specifically, infant mortality in Santa Fe was reduced from 16.2 to 12 deaths per
1,000 births between 1998 and 2004, remaining below the national average of 14.4 deaths per
1,000 births (see Table 4). Likewise, the percentage of births taking place in health facilities has
increased by 1.3 percent between 1998 and 2003, now covering almost the totality of births.
However, the percentage of population without health insurance or a medical plan has increased
by 13.3 percent (from 28.7 to 42 percent) between 1998 and 2001, reflecting a slightly worse
performance than nation as whole, where roughly 12 percent of individuals with formal health
insurance either discontinued, or reduced their coverage due to rising unemployment and falling
real wages during the crisis. This reflects the fact that Santa Fe's largest metropolitan areas,
Rosario in particular, were hit particularly hard by the economic crisis and, in the case of the
capital city, also the 2003 flood.

These statistics, which are aggregated at the provincial level, hide significant improvements in
health indicators within the province. Although direct causality cannot be determined, some
particularly startling improvements are associated with the primary health care insurance
supported under the PRL. With over 269,000 beneficiaries, the provincial health insurance
program provides coverage for approximately 21 percent of the uninsured population, effectively
reducing the percentage of population without insurance coverage to 33 percent, well under the
48 percent for provinces as a whole. Moreover, the reduction in infant mortality in the area where
the pilot program was implemented (i.e., Zone III) was significantly higher than for the province
as a whole. As a result, infant mortality rates corresponding to Zone III, one of the poorest areas


                                                  24

  in the province, are now better than the province as whole. In 1998, the infant mortality rate of
  Zone III was significantly higher than for the province as a whole (20.5 deaths per 1,000 births
  compared to 16.9). After a sharp deterioration as a result of the crisis, the infant mortality rate of
  Zone III decreased drastically in 2004, approaching that of the province as a whole (13.9 deaths
  per 1,000 births compared to 11.6). In 2005, the infant mortality rate for Zone III decreased even
  further, to reach 9 deaths per 1,000 births (there are no official provincial statistics available for
  2005). Other indications pointing to the success of this program include reductions in birth rates
  as a result of a family planning component and reductions in neonatal deaths as a result of
  enhanced prenatal care. However, the true benefits of this program will only become evident
  over the medium and longer terms.

  The specific accomplishments within the health sector include the following:

  · Expanding and Improving Primary Care: Accomplished. With the support of the PRL, Santa
     Fe conducted a pilot program to improve access to basic health services in one of the poorest
     areas in the northeastern region. This experience, which was later expanded to other areas of
     the province, was based on the provision of a basic health `insurance-like' package, with a
     specified package of services to benefit uninsured poor beneficiaries through a contracted
     network of primary care providers and reimbursed through a payment mechanism. The benefit
     package prioritized basic maternal and child care as well as other selected highly cost-effective
     interventions, including reproductive health. The pilot health insurance initiative was first
     implemented in Health Zone III, which is comprised by the Departments of Garay and San
     Javier. With a total population of 50,000, this area is characterized by one of the highest
     incidence of poverty within the province. As of March 2006, the beneficiaries of the program
     amounted to 30,362, representing 61 percent of the overall population. Health services were
     delivered through 34 primary health care teams contracted by the province. Comprised of a
     family doctor, a nurse and a sanitary worker, each team was provided with intensive training in
     key areas of primary care, including basic OB-GYN controls, neonatal screening, health
     promotion and disease prevention. The program was later expanded and, as of March 2006, 132
     ambulatory teams provided primary care for over 269,000 beneficiaries, more than double the
     specified target of 100,000 beneficiaries beyond those in Zone III. Targets regarding services
     provided to beneficiaries were also exceeded, including 100 percent of all children between 0
     and 5-years old being covered under the program compared to the 60 percent original target.



                                                               25

  Currently, 99 percent of women being in the 16th week of pregnancy or longer have been
  submitted to at least two out of the five controls included in the benefit package. Service
  contracts are subscribed with third-party providers, such as public hospitals (biochemical labs,
  dental attention, pharmacy, imaging technology, etc.) and private pharmacies to secure service
  delivery for specialized, high-complexity services and diagnosis procedures and prescription
  drugs. Strict norms have been established determining the level of services to be rendered by
  these service providers, and field audits (auditorías in-situ) are routinely done to ensure their
  compliance.
· Improving Public Hospital Performance: Accomplished. The biggest share of the Santa Fe's
  health budget is tied to the largest public hospitals and, although they received a significant
  degree of managerial and financial autonomy in 1990, management and cost recovery
  continued to be weak. With the support of the PRL, the provincial ministry of health
  constructed a performance baseline for all 55 provincial hospitals, which is used to monitor
  their performance on a regular basis. All 55 hospitals are currently implementing cost recovery
  mechanisms. As required by third-tranche conditionality, seven of these hospitals have adopted
  a system to admit and discharge patients that required the identification of the patients' health
  coverage. As of December 2005, these hospitals were billing on average 92.1 percent of
  insured patients, with billing by individual hospitals ranging from 82 to 100 percent of all
  insurance patients. It is important to note that the provincial health insurance for public
  employees (IAPOS), which provides coverage for 18 percent of the population, pays public
  hospitals regularly for their services. In addition, the minister of health has signed performance
  agreements with eleven of the most important public hospitals in the province, exceeding the
  original target of seven hospitals corresponding to the second-tranche conditionality. These
  agreements included well-defined goals in terms of service production, cost recovery, improved
  quality through better clinical management including clinical records, clinical audits,
  satisfaction surveys, and implementation of incentive mechanisms partially financed through
  enhanced cost recovery. As of March 2006, four of these hospitals are reportedly complying
  with the agreed performance goals at the levels specified by third-tranche conditionality, thus
  meeting such condition.
· Strengthening the Regulatory Capacity of the Ministry of Health: Accomplished. With the
  support of the PRL, the province has adopted several measures to properly regulate supply-side
  variables that greatly impact costs and quality of the health services. In particular, provincial
  Office for Medical Auditing (Dirección de Auditoria Médica) carried out a census of the
  licensing status of all medical professionals performing medical services in public medical
  facilities. This census has provided an inventory of the areas of specializations of these
  professionals. New norms have been approved that create incentives for re-licensing of
  physicians working in the areas of general medicine, family medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics
  and re-licensing requirements are being developed jointly with the provincial physician
  associations. In addition, the Ministry of Health has increased efforts to enforce accreditation,
  which have resulted in a significant reduction of private health facilities operating without
  accreditation, dropping from 45 percent of all private facilities to 28.6 percent between 2000
  and 2005. Field audits of health care providers are conducted routinely, representing 9.6 percent
  of all registered health care facilities compared to the 5 percent target required by the third-
  tranche conditionality.
· Maintaining the Financial Stability of IAPOS: Partially Accomplished. In contrast with most
  of the provincially run health insurance services (obras sociales provinciales) in Argentina, at
  appraisal IAPOS exhibited financial equilibrium and no lags in payments to providers.
  Therefore, the PRL focused on maintaining such equilibrium and developing a solid financial
  monitoring system. By the second tranche, IAPOS was able to reach a financial balance, but
  has struggled thereafter due to the drastic increase in medical costs that has occurred during the
  economic recovery. While IAPOS was not able to achieve financial balance in 2004 and 2005,


                                                  26

  the prospects for 2006 are better, as the recent increases in salaries granted to provincial
  employees will be automatically reflected in IAPOS' receipts. In addition, municipal
  governments that were in arrears have regularized their situation.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs):

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Except with regard to electricity, Santa Fe's PRL has largely achieved its development
objectives--i.e., to promote an efficient and responsive delivery of public services within fiscally
sound policies. As some of the key outcome targets as reflected in the loan's policy conditionalies
were formally revised at restructuring, the operation's overall outcome rating has been assessed
against both the original and revised key outcome targets, in accordance with the Harmonized
Evaluation Criteria for ICR and IEG Evaluations and the new ICR guidelines issued in August
2006.

The operation is rated `Moderately Satisfactory' with respect to both the original and revised key
outcomes (see Table 7.2, Annex 7 for specific calculations weighing original and revised key
outcomes). The operation achieved or exceeded both original and revised key targets in the areas
of public administration and social sector reforms, including health, education and social
protection. As noted earlier, the one exception is the electricity company, which remains in the
hands of the province, as its concession became unrealistic in the face of the existing
macroeconomic environment. While the second- and third- tranche conditions regarding EPESF's
concession were waived, the province has also failed to implement its action plan aimed at
preventing the further deterioration of the EPESF, as required by the amendment. Thus, in this
one area, the operation has fallen short of its development objectives. In addition, IAPOS, the
provincial health insurance carrier, succeeded in achieving a financial balance for the second
tranche, but not in 2004 or 2005. However, IAPOS appears to be likely to achieve a balance in
2006.

In summary, although the operation fell short of achieving the concession of the electricity
company or establishing the conditions for improving its performance, it was successful in
enhancing social protection as well as health and education services in Santa Fe in a framework
of fiscal responsibility. The operation has also resulted in significant institutional strengthening
by supporting the adoption of sound management tools and legislation. In this regard, it is
important to point out that the operation's DO rating was downgraded from `Satisfactory' to
`Moderately Unsatisfactory' in June 2005, due, in large part, to the delays in the passage of the
Financial Administration Law, which provided legal support for the newly implemented financial
administration system (see Section G ­ Data Sheet). However, this law was approved by the
provincial legislature in late 2005 and enacted in February 2006. In addition, Santa Fe's PRL
helped protect the public safety net that provided support to the poor during the social and
economic crisis that unfolded in December 2001. The objectives pursued by the operation are
still highly relevant vis-à-vis the current priorities of both the Kirchner administration and the
Bank's current CAS. Moreover, although the third tranche was cancelled, the majority of the
corresponding conditionalities were met. Thus, the operation is considered `Moderately
Satisfactory.'

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered or
to amplify discussion above):

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

As mentioned earlier, Santa Fe's largest metropolitan areas were hit particularly hard by the 2001
crisis and the 2003 flood. As a result, Rosario and Santa Fe had higher incidences of poverty than
other urban areas in the country (see Table 2). However, the province was able to recover more
swiftly than the rest of country and, by 2005, the level of poverty in both urban areas was lower
than in 2001 with respect to both the number of households and the percentage of population,
while urban areas for the country as a whole were still above their pre-crisis poverty levels.
Although the level of poverty is determined by a myriad of factors, the level of funding that Santa
Fe assigned to provincial social protection programs and its efforts to increase their effectiveness
undoubtedly provided an important safety net during the crisis and subsequent recovery.
Moreover, Santa Fe's relatively swifter recovery is likely to be linked to the sustained
commitment of provincial authorities toward fiscal discipline from the early 1990s onward and, in
2000, their ability to anticipate the impending economic crisis and take the necessary steps to
ameliorate its impact. In this way, the province was able to continue to pay salaries and provide
social services regularly even through the worst of the crisis.

As explicitly intended by the operation, education and health reforms supported under the PRL
will also contribute toward enhancing equity over the medium and long term. As noted earlier,
the new system to allocate public subsidies among private schools has effectively enhanced
targeting of students from less affluent families. It has also helped reduce the cost of private
education in general, as some schools have voluntarily reduced their tuitions to qualify for higher
levels of subsidy. In addition, the new program focusing on public schools with particularly high
repetition rates that is currently being implemented by the provincial Ministry of Education is one
of the spin-offs of the reform program supported under the PRL, benefiting primarily schools
serving low-income populations. Similarly, Santa Fe's provincial health insurance initiative was
explicitly designed to target the uninsured poor, by providing them with a predetermined package
of benefits with a strong focus on maternal and infant care. The pilot program, which was
implemented in one of the poorest areas in the province, was very successful, resulting in drastic
reductions in mortality rates. Coverage has continued to expand, currently covering over 269,000
beneficiaries, equivalent to 20 percent of Santa Fe's uninsured population.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term
capacity and institutional development)

Santa Fe's PRL has introduced innovative management practices and tools that are likely to
enhance public management and institutional development over the medium and long term in the
areas of financial management, health, education, and social protection. Some of the specific
advancements are:

· Financial management: The recently enacted Financial Administration Law constitutes an
  essential step toward enhancing the management of provincial resources. While the
  implementation of the financial management system had been making steady progress since
  1996, the approval of the law by the legislature took over 12 years. The new law not only sets
  the foundation for the orderly and integrated management of public resources, but also
  establishes safeguards for prudent fiscal management, such as barring the used of budgeted
  capital expenditures for current expenditures.



                                                 28

· Human resource administration and school management in education: The iSIEME and its two
  main sub-components, the SARH and the SIGAE, have put Santa Fe at the forefront in terms of
  its ability to manage resources to ultimately enhance quality of education in an efficient and
  equitable manner. Already fully deployed, it is emerging as a powerful management tool that is
  being increasingly used not only by the central administrators but also by administrators at the
  school level, with over 15,000 online consultations per month.
· Cost recovery mechanisms by individual hospitals: In this regard, it is important to bring
  attention to the sequencing of the reforms and the creation of a sound system of incentives. In
  terms of sequencing, the PRL capitalized on the existence of an enabling legal framework and
  subsequently, its actual implementation and actual results. Likewise, it benefited from the
  progress achieved under other operations, such as the creation of a national registry of
  beneficiaries of all national insurance carriers that is currently maintained by the SNSS.
  Without this database, the implementation of cost recovery mechanisms would be infeasible.
  The financial viability of IAPOS is another key component for the long-terms success of the
  strategy. In terms of incentives, cost-recovery proceeds from individual hospitals are used to
  fund salary bonuses, creating a clear link between performance and rewards. Awards are
  distributed uniformly among all personnel within each hospital and, although not theoretically
  perfect, this approach has helped overcome resistance and gain support among the staff.
· Integration with national databases: Santa Fe's PRL fostered the exchange of information
  between the province and national agencies (e.g., AFIP and SINTyS), helping enhance tax
  administration and the targeting of social programs.
· EPESF's billing campaign: Although the component involving EPESF did not succeed, its
  programs to reduce electricity theft deserve attention, given its initial success and its innovative
  approach. Between January 2005 and April 2006, these programs succeeded in reducing losses
  by 1.2 percent, resulting in total cumulative savings of approximately Arg$9 million.
  Conceived in a decentralized manner, each of 12 service areas is responsible for contributing its
  fair share towards the overall target of reducing theft of electricity by 4 percent. Their
  performance is being tracked on a weekly basis based on objective indicators such as the
  number of Fraud Acts (actas de fraude) that are recorded and the payment bills (notas de
  débito) that are issued. Despite severe understaffing in terms of field inspectors, the results have
  been significant, with Fraud Acts and payments issued more than doubling in 2005. In
  collaboration with the National Technical University (UTN), EPESF has also set in motion a
  program to systematically target field inspections based on the results of `energy balances,' a
  systematic comparison between the energy that is provided by an electric sub-station into a
  specific geographic area and the energy that is actually billed in the same area. Finally, EPESF
  is also conducting an innovative pilot program to reduce illegal connections in informal
  settlements that, during the first 18 months of implementation, has resulted in a 70 percent
  payment rate among clients without legal ownership of the properties.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The PRL has helped the province maintain its focus on fiscal performance as well as on key
reforms despite highly unfavorable macroeconomic conditions prior to, during, and after the 2001
crisis. It has also provided continuity throughout changes in administration within the various
ministries and appears to have played a significant role in coordinating the reform efforts across
ministers under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance. While it is clearly not desirable that
such a role is played by a lending operation--rather, mechanisms should be embedded within the
province's organizational structure--it is nevertheless positive that the operation served to fill
such a critical purpose.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops:

N/A
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

Presently, the risk that development outcomes will not be maintained is considered moderate in
most respects. In general, policy actions undertaken under the PRL were implemented during the
traumatic 2001-2002 period and have remained in place thereafter, which is a good indicator of
their sustainability. Other factors contributing to the sustainability of the operation's development
outcomes include the favorable macroeconomic conditions prevailing in Argentina since 2003
and a robust flow of public revenues due to increases, in both automatic transfers from the
national government (coparticipación) and own-source revenues. At the national level, the Fiscal
Responsibility Law establishes fiscal performance indicators and provides for the monitoring
over time of fiscal results as well as for possible sanctions in the case of deviations from the
provisions of the law. While the high level of discretion and the consensual approach under the
Fiscal Responsibility Law create a potential risk that fiscal discipline will not be sustained, such
an approach may also increase provincial ownership, which is critical given Argentina's strong
federal character. It remains to be seen whether the Fiscal Responsibility Law will be more
successful in improving provincial and national fiscal performance than the many national and
provincial fiscal responsibility laws that preceded it, despite its relatively less stringent provisions
when compared to similar pieces of legislation adopted in other countries in Latin America, such
as Brazil.

Except for the privatization of EPESF, the current provincial administration has demonstrated its
support for the PRL reforms and, in some cases, such as in the case of the provincial health
insurance, has deepened them further. Specific observations regarding the degree of sustainability
of the reforms pursued under the various policy areas can be summarized as follows:

Public Finances and Administration: The sustainability of reforms in the area of public finances
and administration is considered to be likely, with the exception of those related to EPESF. The
passage of the Financial Administration Law provides the legal framework for the financial
management system, which is a well-established management tool within Santa Fe's public
administration. The advances in tax administration and structure are also well established,
including the regular exchange of information between the province and AFIP and SINTyS at the
national level. Provincial accounts have been regularly published online for over five years, and
the province's web portal has become an important interface between the provincial government
and the citizenry. The progress achieved under the PRL toward strengthening economic and
environment soundness of large public investment project will be continued under the new
investment operations currently under preparation. Finally, Santa Fe's financial situation is
among the best in the country, in terms of both fiscal balance and debt. The province has
capitalized on the favorable economic conditions to create a Arg$400 million reserve fund
(Fondo de Estabilidad Fiscal y de Inversión Pública) using the 2004 fiscal surplus. However,
despite the overall soundness of Santa Fe's finances, there are two factors that could potentially
burden the province's finances and limit its room for maneuver during future economic
downturns:

· Contingent liabilities arising from non-performing provincial enterprises: The privatization law
  of 1999 was reversed in December 26, 2006, when a new law was approved, which returned the



                                                  30

  EPESF to provincial ownership and the prospects for its concessions in the near or medium
  term are very low. As mentioned above, in 2006 the province transferred Arg$40 million to
  EPESF to help it bridge its operational deficit. Although efforts to improve billing and to
  reduce non-technical losses continue, few other improvements have been made to its
  operational and financial performance, as illustrated by the company's continued operational
  deficits. EPESF now operates under the legal framework Law No. 10.014, enacted in 1987,
  which does not contemplate the establishment of a regulatory framework or control entities.
  The provincial government is also proposing the creation of an Energy Secretariat (Secretaría
  de Estado de Energía), a centralized organism to be responsible for all aspects related to
  exploration, exploitation, transport, storage, commercialization and distribution of renewable
  and non-renewable energy sources within the provincial sphere.
  The risk of contingent liabilities posed by non-performing provincial enterprises is all the more
  relevant when considering that Santa Fe has recently regained control of the water company. In
  private hands for the past ten years (Suez-Lyonnaise des Eaux was the majority owner), Aguas
  Provinciales de Santa Fe was dissolved in early 2006, after the province and the stockholders
  failed to reach agreement on mutually acceptable terms regarding tariff increases and the
  investment requirements. The province has since formed a new joint-stock company, Aguas
  Santafesinas S.A. (ASSA), to provide for water services in 15 cities in the province. With 51
  percent of the stock, the province controls ownership in the new company. Municipal
  governments that are served by ASSA own 39 percent of the stock, with the remaining 10
  percent being in the hands of the personnel.
· Deficit from the provincial pension system: Santa Fe was one of the provinces that chose not to
  transfer its pension fund to the national system as part of the 1992 Fiscal Pact. As part of the
  1999 Emergency Law, the province temporarily reduced benefits to reduce its deficit, which at
  the time reached Arg$130 million. To address the deficit over the longer term, the provincial
  government reached an agreement with the federal government, by which the province
  gradually enacted measures that harmonize the provincial employee's pension system rules
  with the national pension system in return for the federal government agreeing to finance the
  provincial pension deficit. The deficit has remained stable, with the 2006 budget predicting a
  deficit of Arg$135 million, of which Arg$90 million are financed by the federal government as
  part of the compensation agreement. However, over the long term, it is uncertain how long the
  subsidy from the federal government will continue.

Social Protection: The sustainability of the advances in social protection programs is likely. With
social pressure gradually lessening, the province is continuing to enhance the design of its own
programs and their articulation with those at the national level. The continuing consolidation of
SINTyS and the its ongoing decentralization at the provincial level will continue to strengthen
Santa Fe's capacity to enhance the targeting of its social programs, allowing for the systematic
detection of incompatibilities and duplicate benefits under the various provincial and national
programs.

Education: The sustainability of the education reforms is likely. The current administration has
not only maintained a steady course for the reforms supported under the PRL, but has also moved
forward, taking important steps such as ensuring that the designation of teachers and school
administrators is done on a competitive basis (concursos). There are two observations regarding
the sustainability of the education reforms:

· Updating mechanisms of SIGAE: Given the decentralized nature of the SIGAE--one of the
  iSIEME's main components, it is important to set in place an adequate system of incentives to
  ensure its periodic updating. School administrators, who are responsible for updating the
  system, often face disincentives to provide the central administration with current information


                                                31

  (for example, in the case of a decrease in student enrollment). Thus, it is important to create a
  system of incentives that would ensure periodic updating.
· National testing system: The national government has not published the provincial test scores
  corresponding to ONE standardized evaluations since 1999 (the 2003 results have only been
  published at the regional level). This constitutes a significant drawback, as it deprives
  provincial governments of a valuable tool to systematically measure performance within each
  province and relative to other provinces. Perhaps more importantly, by not making provincial
  test scores public, the national government is eliminating an important element of
  accountability that could play a major role in enhancing the quality of education in the long run.
  It is appropriate to note that one of the main arguments in favor of the decentralization of
  education to the provincial level in the early 1990s was the expectation that increasing the
  proximity between citizens and those officials responsible for education would enhance
  accountability and, consequently, performance. The performance information provided by
  systematic testing scores is an important element toward building this accountability and,
  consequently, an important element in the ultimate success of the decentralization process.

Health: The sustainability of the reforms implemented in the health sector is considered likely.
Expanding the public insurance successfully tested under the PRL was one of the pillars of the
current administration's electoral platform and has been given its full support. The national health
program Plan Nacer builds on the experience of Santa Fe's innovative provincial health
insurance program. Cost recovery by provincial hospitals is also considered to be sustainable over
time, as all provincial hospitals are actively implementing it under the legal framework provided
by a provincial law. The cost recovery mechanism provides sound incentives among hospital
workers through salary increases, thus supporting its sustainability. One element threatening the
sustainability of the health reforms is the financial deterioration of IAPOS. Ensuring its financial
viability is important to ensure that the provincial treasury does not subsidize the health insurance
scheme for public employees at the expense of other programs targeting the poor, such as the
provincial health insurance. Likewise, the sustainability of cost recovery mechanisms by public
hospitals is also dependent of the financial health of IAPOS, given the large portion of the
population to which it provides coverage.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance:

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance in identifying, preparing and appraising the operation was satisfactory.
The Bank devised an effective strategy towards public sector reform at the sub-national level by
focusing resources on select provinces with demonstrated willingness and ability to implement
reforms, thus capitalizing on the window of opportunity provided by the presence of reform-
minded administrations at the provincial levels. Likewise, the Bank's strategy correctly identified
the need to promote reforms in the social sectors--social assistance, education and health--in a
framework of fiscal soundness. Enhancing social assistance programs was particularly relevant
given the social pressures in the province, both structural and those resulting from the 2001 crisis
and the flood. The health and education sectors are central to the medium and long-term success
of any provincial reform strategy, as they represent a significant share of provincial budgets in



                                                 32

Argentina. Moreover, the services in these two sectors are critical in determining the level of
human capital development in the medium and long term.

The Bank embarked on a thorough preparation process, including in-depth technical analysis
within the various sectors as well as participatory mechanisms to gather input from key
stakeholders and the civil society in general. The Bank's staff helped identify and prepare an
operation consistent with both the Borrower's interests and the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy. The Policy Matrix effectively made operational key aspects of Santa Fe's reform
strategy supported by the operation that were ambitious but still feasible, except for the
concession of EPESF. A gender assessment was performed as part of the loan preparation to
ensure that the reforms would not pose negative gender impacts but, rather, reduce inter-gender
disparities. A social assessment and the resulting social development policy contributed toward
fine-tuning actions aimed at having an impact on poverty. The Bank worked in close
collaboration with the provincial government and maintained a high degree of coordination
between the PRL and other Bank operations, both provincial and sector loans.

Santa Fe proved to be a sound choice for participating in the PRL. The province had
demonstrated a commitment toward reform, strong political support from the legislative branch,
and a fiscal situation that, although in need of improvement, was not structurally flawed. Despite
the unprecedented difficulties posed by the 2001-2002 environment, Santa Fe's performance
under the PRL successfully demonstrated that difficult reforms can be advanced even in difficult
implementation environments when there is substantial political will.

Santa Fe's PRL fully capitalized on the lessons learned during the pilot PRL-II operations and the
preceding PRL-III operations. It also had the most thorough preparation process of all the PRLs.
Had the operation been prepared in a less extreme environment, preparation would have deserved
a Highly Satisfactory rating, as the operation supported a conceptually sound reform program
with a well formulated policy matrix in a province with a proven record of reform. In this case,
however, preparation is rated Satisfactory, as the risk assessment failed to identify the
infeasibility of the concession of the electricity company in the short and medium term.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements)

Rating: Satisfactory

Even under normal circumstances, policy development operations pose a challenge in terms of
supervision, as they require both precision and agility. In the case of Santa Fe's PRL, this
challenge was more complex given the extraordinary circumstances under which the operation
was implemented during 2001 and 2002. Once the macroeconomic environment improved, the
Bank moved quickly to restructure the operation as to adapt it to the new realities. The
supervision team that was constituted by staff from various networks succeeded in supporting the
implementation of reforms in multiple sectors while maintaining internal cohesiveness. In this
regard, PREM provided overall coordination and encouraged the other networks to take
responsibility for supervising their sector reform programs; in turn, the Infrastructure and Human
Development networks were fully cooperative and gave the operation their full support. Thus,
the experience of Santa Fe's PRL--as well as those in Córdoba and Catamarca--could be
considered an example of successful cross-sector coordination between multiple networks--
PREM, Infrastructure, and Human Development. In turn, the supervision team forged a close
relationship with provincial authorities through periodic visits and fluid communication. At times
when relations were tense between the government and IFIs, the task manager and the PRL team
succeeded in maintaining the channels of communication open with provincial authorities and the


                                                   33

professional staff working in the various sectors covered under the operation. During the
interviews conducted as part of the ICR preparation, professional staff and authorities repeatedly
praised the input of their Bank counterparts in terms of policy making and rigorous monitoring,
reporting it as an important value-added benefit of the operation. The project was very well
documented, as all official records, communications, e-mails and reports presented by the
borrower and sector task managers during the life of the project were archived in the Bank's IRIS
(Integrated Records Information System). This reflects a substantial effort, as many of the lengthy
reports produced by the borrower were presented as hard copies, which required their manual
scanning.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Given the severity of the economic collapse of December 2001, it is, of course, relevant to
question whether the Bank should have predicted such an outcome. However, given the many
different views on the causes of the crisis and whether it might have been avoided, this question
can be more adequately addressed as part of the evaluation of the overall Bank strategy toward
Argentina than as part of this ICR, which focuses on the specific reforms supported by the
operation. Although the debate over what was the appropriate strategy under the conditions
prevailing at the time is likely to continue, the implementation of Santa Fe's PRL indicates that
adjustment operations can help ensure the sustainability of ongoing reforms during difficult
periods. Moreover, the specific reforms supported by the operation were necessary in any event,
as illustrated by their impact on provincial management and service delivery as well as the
sustained momentum for their continuing implementation--with the exception of the electricity
company. For the reasons outlined above, the Bank's performance is considered `Satisfactory'
with regard to the preparation and implementation of this particular operation.

5.2 Borrower Performance:

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Not Applicable

During preparation, the province provided full collaboration. Staff from the various provincial
ministries and agencies participated in the preparatory work, ensuring that the proposed actions
were consistent with the province's reform program. Santa Fe had a strong ownership of the
reform program, illustrating the ideal case in which a Bank operation fully supports provincial
objectives. The highly transparent approach used by Santa Fe's authorities, by which key reforms
were subjected to the legislature's scrutiny, was critical in developing support for the program
being supported under the PRL.

The supervision of the program was entrusted to an Executing Unit located in the province's
Ministry of Finance. While the Ministry of Finance took the lead in implementing the reform
program, the Ministries of Education and Public Health participated actively as well. The
performance of the Executing Unit was highly satisfactory, serving as an effective interface
between the different actors, including the governor, the provincial ministries, the Bank, and the
executing units of other related projects. The supervision team was kept well informed of all
relevant developments--both of progress and occasional difficulties--that took place during the
implementation of the program. Adequate documentation was made available to support the
request for disbursement of the second tranche and the Bank was kept informed of the progress


                                                 34

being made in the various areas after its disbursement. The province demonstrated a strong
internal cohesiveness during the implementation of the operation, articulating political support
from the top with a strong ability for implementation. Despite their complexity, the province
succeeded in implementing the various reforms efforts with a uniting vision. From 2004 onwards,
the level of political support for the concession of the electricity company dropped substantially,
and no significant progress has been made on this front. More sustained effort on the part of
provincial authorities would have been required to advance with the implementation of EPESF's
action plan. Reforms in other areas, including public finances, health and education continued to
move forward with several noteworthy achievements, including the passage of the Financial
Administration Law and the expansion of the provincial health insurance.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Not Applicable

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The lack of fiscal resources and the mounting social tensions that resulted from the country's
economic collapse posed a difficult test for provincial authorities and their commitment toward
reform. However, as opposed to abandoning their reform program, they continued with their
efforts, pushing for difficult reforms on various fronts, except with respect to the energy company,
EPESF. At the national level, the operation benefited from the clearly defined framework
established by the national government for managing the fiscal situation of the provinces in the
aftermath of the 2001 crisis, using the orderly financing agreements first, and subsequently the
Fiscal Responsibility Law. For these reasons and the ones noted above, the Borrower's overall
performance is considered `Satisfactory.'

6. Lessons Learned (both operation-specific and of wide general application)

Provincial policy development operations such as Santa Fe's PRL are only appropriate
under stable macroeconomic conditions. While this type of operation requires an overall
satisfactory macroeconomic policy framework, such framework is the responsibility of the
national government and beyond the sphere of action of provincial authorities. As illustrated by
the experience of Argentina's last series of PRLs, including that of Santa Fe, failings or
uncertainties at the macroeconomic level can override substantial achievements at the provincial
level, leading to loan cancellation.

Under stable macroeconomic conditions, policy-based operations supporting a well-defined
set of reforms can be effective tools in promoting structural adjustment at the sub-national
level. Direct provincial lending using fast-disbursing operations have the advantages of (i)
addressing the needs of individual provinces more specifically; and (ii) introducing a critical mass
of financial incentives and technical support that can effectively accelerate the pace of the reform
process within individual provinces. In addition, operations such as Santa Fe's PRL foster
provincial ownership, internal consistency of provincial sector policies, and cross-sector
coordination during their implementation. As reported by provincial authorities, the direct
relationship with the Bank also brings added legitimacy and credibility to the province's reform
program, as well as valuable technical assistance in the development of sector policies and
methodological rigor in implementation, monitoring and evaluation.



                                                 35

Provincial operations can be effective complements of sector reforms and operations at the
national level. While sector-specific investment operations targeting provincial governments
provide for a sharper sector focus and longer term engagement, multi-sector provincial-level
operations such as Santa Fe's PRL can help promote sector objectives by boosting political will
to take key policy actions at the provincial level. This is particularly important in the case of
Argentina, where highly autonomous provinces play a predominant role in providing critical
public services, such as education and health.        On the downside, direct provincial lending
concentrates risk on specific provinces--as opposed to national sector operations that diversify
risk among multiple participating provinces.

For reforms to be successful, they have to follow the right sequence, take into consideration
interrelationship of intermediate steps, and be supported by a sound incentive system. The
successful implementation of the cost-recovery mechanisms by public hospitals underlines the
importance of having in place not only an adequate legal framework but also the tools needed for
implementation--in this case, the national register of beneficiaries of national insurance carriers.
Likewise, consolidating the financial viability of the IAPOS is an important factor determining
the overall success of the cost recovery system, given that it provides health insurance to over 18
percent of the population. In addition, the rewards system tying cost recovery to salary bonuses
for hospital workers ensures that there are strong incentives ensuring its sustainability.
For provinces to be fiscally responsible over the long term, a consistent system of incentives must
be in place at the national level. A clear strategy of the national government towards the
provinces is a prerequisite for broader fiscal adjustment among sub-national governments, such as
the determination to avoid bailouts of fiscally irresponsible provincial governments. In this regard,
the operation has benefited from the clearly defined framework established by the national
government for managing the fiscal situation of the provinces in the post-2001 period, using the
orderly financing agreements first, and subsequently the Fiscal Responsibility Law. It is
important to note, however, that the high level of discretion and political nature of bilateral
financing arrangements under the Financial Responsibility Law generates uncertainties as to
whether the law will ultimately lead to sustained fiscal discipline.

The Bank's continuous engagement during critical periods can help sustain ongoing
reforms and protect previous achievements. The experience of Santa Fe's PRL indicates it was
beneficial to have an operation in place providing a clear roadmap for enhancing service delivery
in key social sectors during times of economic, political and institutional chaos. The substantial
financial resources attached to the PRL became even more attractive in face of the overall lack of
liquidity in the country in 2001-2002, providing the province additional incentives to sustain the
ongoing reforms in the short and medium term. The experience of Santa Fe's PRL also shows
that sector reforms are possible even when the overriding priority is fiscal adjustment; however,
sector budgets need to be protected, in particular to ensure that cost savings from efficiency gains
can be reinvested into the sector.

Uncertain macroeconomic conditions can undermine reforms focusing on privatization and
concession, even when they have the full commitment of the authorities. The experience of
Santa Fe and the concession of its electricity company shows that lack of market demand can
undermine privatization efforts, even when there is full commitment on the part of the provincial
government. Likewise, the will of the government is sometimes not enough to achieve the reform
of public utilities when they are strong vested interest against reform within these utilities.

The success of SAL loans depends on a combination of factors, the most important of which
is strong political support. In the case of Santa Fe, the ambitious set of reforms supported under



                                                 36

the PRL succeeded as a result of a unique combination of strong political support from the
governor and the provincial legislature, as well as a solid leadership in the individual sectors.

Well formulated policy conditionalities help maintain the focus on key aspects of the reform
program. Santa Fe's PRL offers a good illustration of a well formulated Policy Matrix that
focused primarily on major policy actions and the achievement of specific targets, rather than
including technical inputs, such as studies and action plans, as policy conditions.

The scope and complexity of policy conditionality needs to be in line with the
implementation capacity of the borrower. Although the conditionality for Santa Fe's PRL was
very ambitious, the province succeeded in implementing the agreed reform program almost in its
totality. However, while more advanced provincial administrations such as Santa Fe are capable
of implementing complex programs, other, other, less well prepared provincial administration
might lack the required implementation capacity.

Cross-sector operations at the provincial level require strong coordination during both
preparation and implementation. On the side of the borrower, this type of operation requires
strong coordination efforts, both horizontal (i.e., across multiple government agencies at the
provincial level) and vertical (i.e., between ministries at the national and provincial levels). On
the Bank side, operations such as Santa Fe's PRL demand strong cooperation and coordination
between the various sector teams. While successfully achieved in this case, the need for effective
coordination could pose risks to other operations of similar complexity.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

The Borrower's comments can be summarized as follows (see Annex 4 for full text):

1. The province agrees that substantial achievements were attained under the operation,
    particularly when considering implementation coincided with the December 2001 crisis.
2. In relation to the conditions for disbursement of the third tranche, the province notes that it
    considers that it has met the pending conditions, i.e., the sanction of the Law of Financial
    Administration (as noted in section 3.2 above) and the implementation of the plan of action
    for EPESF. With regard to the actions regarding EPESF, the enactment of the Normalization
    Law in 2006 brings the process to a satisfactory conclusion in the opinion of the province.
3. It should be noted that the transfer of $40 million from the Provincial Treasury to EPESF in
    2006 was due to several factors, among them: a) the lack of investment during the period
    when the decision to privatize EPESF was made in 2001 and until the subsequent reversal of
    that decision due to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions; b) the sustained increases in
    electricity demand during the period 2003-2006 which strained the company's capacity; 3)
    the freeze on tariffs imposed by the national government under the framework of its anti-
    inflationary policies.
4. It is important to emphasize the success attained in reducing non-technical losses, as
    described in this document.
5. The Province continues in its efforts to improve technical aspects of EPESF operations,
    quality of service, and financial performance. The recently enacted Law Nº 12.700 (Decree
    3693/06) approves the new statute for the company, effectively setting in motion its
    normalization process. At the same time, the provincial legislature will consider the creation

El documento de Evaluación del Programa de Reforma Provincial (PRL) [preparado por el Banco
Mundial] enuncia las principales acciones emprendidas en el marco del mismo y detalla los
logros obtenidos como así también el grado de cumplimiento de las metas establecidas
oportunamente. Su lectura denota el esfuerzo realizado por el Gobierno Provincial en el marco
del Programa formulado con la colaboración de expertos de ese organismo.

El informe recoge las visiones e inquietudes formuladas durante las entrevistas realizadas y
formula comentarios sobre las causas que confluyeron en el logro, pleno o relativo, de las metas
propuestas. Atendiendo a vuestra solicitud se realizan algunos comentarios al respecto, a saber:

1. Se comparte la valoración realizada respecto de de los logros alcanzados a través del programa,
mas aún si se considera que su implementación fue contemporánea de la crisis iniciada en
diciembre 2001.

2. Con relación a los principales compromisos asumidos por la provincia de Santa Fe, para la
efectivización del desembolso correspondiente al tercer tramo,            (Sanción de la Ley de
Administración Financiera y puesta en práctica del plan de acción de la Empresa Provincial de la
Energía) es de notar que ambos fueron satisfechos, el primero de ellos en fecha 2 de Enero de
2006 y el segundo concluye con la sanción de la ley de normalización de la Empresa a fines del
año anterior.

3. Respecto de la transferencia de $ 40 millones del Tesoro Provincial a la empresa de energía, en
el 2006, cabe señalar la convergencia de varios factores, entre ellos: a) el proceso de desinversión
que transcurre entre la decisión de privatización 2001 y el abandono de la misma por haber
cambiado las condiciones macroeconómicas, generó un atraso en la inversión de reposición e
inversión neta; b) el incremento sostenido de la demanda en el periodo 2003-2006 que puso al
borde de la capacidad instalada a todo el sistema de oferta energética argentina y 3) Este
incremento de la demanda fue sostenido con mejoras en la eficiencia e inversión adicional dado el
congelamiento de tarifas dispuesto por el Gobierno Nacional, en el marco de su política
antiinflacionaria.

4. Cabe destacar que entre las acciones que permitieron mejorar la eficiencia se encuentra el
Programa de Reducción de Pérdidas no Técnicas, implementándose con buen suceso, tal como se
destaca en el documento de marras.

5. Las acciones específicas para mejorar las condiciones técnicas, la calidad del servicio y
mejorar el desempeño financiero continúan en la actualidad. En ese marco se inscribe la Ley Nº
12700, promulgada mediante Decreto 3693 / 06, que aprueba el estatuto de la Empresa,
iniciándose así el etapa de normalización de la misma. En el mismo sentido se señala que, por
decreto 157 del 1 de febrero de 2007, se incluye en el temario de Sesiones Extraordinarias de la H.
Legislatura de la Provincia, el Proyecto de creación de la Secretaría de Estado de Energía, como

                                  Annex 7. Additional Annexes

7.1. Restructuring

By restructuring the operation in May 2003, the Bank sought to address the drastic changes that
followed the economic collapse of December 2001 while preserving the overall objectives of the
loan. The decision to restructure the operation instead of canceling the two undisbursed tranches
was based on Santa Fe's solid fiscal management, even in the face of crisis, and the substantial
progress it had made in the implementation of the reforms in the areas of public administration,
social protection, education and health. Restructuring provided the opportunity to reframe the
province's program in a manner that was feasible given the macroeconomic uncertainties without
deviating from the operation's original development objectives.

Despite the macroeconomic downturn and resulting constriction on revenues, Santa Fe was able
to maintain a fiscal program consistent with the original fiscal conditionalities and to advance on
the implementation of its reform program largely as anticipated. However, the new fiscal and
social conditions resulting from Argentina's economic collapse in December 2001 as well as an
unprecedented flood that affected large part of the provincial territory in April 2003 required that
the operation be restructured. Overall, out of the 58 remaining conditions, two conditions were
waived and 12 were amended--with five and nine conditions corresponding to the second and
third tranches, respectively. These amendments introduced adjustments needed to reflect the post-
2001 conditions, including the devaluation of the peso, the poor prospects for further privatization
of utilities, and the deterioration of socio-economic conditions. Specifically, the second-tranche
condition calling for a debt stock of less than 50 percent of total revenues was waived, as such
target became unattainable as a result of the devaluation, which increased the stock of debt by
three. The condition calling for the privatization of the electricity company EPESF was also
waived, as the new environment had rendered such privatization largely infeasible. Instead, the
province agreed to develop and implement an action plan to avoid the financial and operational
deterioration of EPESF and to establish a regulatory entity. No amendments were necessary in the
education and health sectors, except for a reduction in the number of beneficiaries for the primary
care program targeted for the third tranche (Table 7.1 provides a detailed description of individual
amendments). By restructuring the operation as opposed to canceling it, the Bank offered the
province its support as well as substantial incentives to continue with the implementation of the
critical set of reforms supported by the operation despite the heightened fiscal and social pressure.

7.2 Rating the Outcome of Projects with Formally Revised Objectives

Santa Fe's PRL is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Although the operation fell short of achieving
the concession of the electricity company or significantly improving its performance, it has
effectively supported the province of Santa Fe in its efforts to reform and restructure its public
sector so as to ensure efficiency, quality and equity in public services in the areas of health,
education and social protection within fiscally sound policies. As some of the key outcome
targets as reflected in the loan's policy conditionalies were formally revised at restructuring to
reflect the macroeconomic and social changes that resulted from the economic collapse of
December 2001, the operation's overall outcome rating has been assessed against both the
original and revised key outcome targets, in accordance with the Harmonized Evaluation Criteria
for ICR and IEG Evaluations and the new ICR guidelines issued in August 2006.

Assessment of outcome with respect to original key outcome targets: Moderately Satisfactory.
Santa Fe has exhibited sound fiscal management before, during and after the 2001 crisis.
Moreover, the province has made remarkable progress toward its reform agenda in the areas of
public management, social protection, health, and education, often exceeding the original targets.
The failure to concession EPESF or significantly improve its performance stands out as the only
shortcoming in an otherwise remarkably successful record of achievement under the PRL, despite
particularly negative implementation conditions.

A. Public Finances: Santa Fe has attained or exceeded all original key fiscal outcomes, except
for the concession of its electricity company EPESF. Although the province was ready to offer


                                                      47

EPESF for sale in October 2001, it had to desist due to the lack of market demand as a result of
the rapidly deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. EPESF is now back in the hands of the
province and the prospects for its concessioning in the short or medium term are nil. Moreover,
no significant improvements have been made to its operational and financial performance, as
illustrated by EPESF's expected Arg$40 million operational deficit for 2006.


B. Social Protection: All original outcomes were achieved or exceeded.

C. Health: All original key outcomes were achieved or exceeded, except for maintaining a
financial balance in IAPOS, the provincial health insurance agency. While IAPOS was able to
reach a financial balance for the second-tranche disbursement, it has struggled after the
devaluation of the peso due to drastic increase in medical costs, not achieving financial balance in
either 2004 or 2005. However, the prospects for 2006 are better, as the recent increases in salaries
granted to provincial employees will be automatically reflected in IAPOS' receipts and municipal
governments that were in arrears have regularized their situation.

D. Education: All original key outcomes were achieved or exceeded.

Assessment of outcome with respect to revised key outcome targets: Moderately Satisfactory.
All conditions of the restructured second tranche were met, which triggered its disbursement. In
addition, all but two of the third-tranche conditions were met, although this tranche was cancelled
in agreement with the government as part of the negotiations of the new CAS envelope.
Specifically:

· Electricity company EPESF: At restructuring, the province agreed to prepare and implement
    an Action Plan aimed at enhancing financial and operational performance of EPESP and
    establish a regulatory entity for the electric sector. The Action Plan was prepared but has not
    been implemented, and the regulatory entity has not been set up. In 2006, the province had to
    transfer Arg.$40 million to EPESF from its treasury to help EPESF meet its anticipated
    expenses.
· IAPOS's financial balance: As explained above, the condition regarding IAPOS's financial
    performance was not met during 2004 and 2005, but it can expected for 2006.

Weighted Overall Project Outcome: Moderately Satisfactory. Weighing the operation's ratings
with respect to original and revised objectives based on the share of actual disbursements before
and after the revision took place renders an overall outcome of Moderately Satisfactory, as shown
on Table 7.2.
