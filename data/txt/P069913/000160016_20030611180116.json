"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Santa Fe Provincial Reform\n            Adjustment Loan (Ln 4634-AR) for US$330 million was approved\n            by the Board in August 2001 and became effective in\n            September 2001. The loan comprises three tranches, payable\n            at the Bank's standard interest rate for LIBOR-based\n            dollar loan, with a grace period of 5 years, a final\n            maturity in 15 years, and a level repayment of principal.\n            The first tranche in the amount of US$153.3 million was\n            released on September 20, 2001. The accompanying Tranche\n            Release Document for the second tranche of US$50 million\n            sets forth the description of tranche conditions, status of\n            compliance of the Borrower, and proposed amendment/waivers\n            to both the second and third tranches. The Loan is designed\n            to support the implementation of a program by the Borrower\n            Santa Fe Province aimed at reforming its government so as to\n            ensure an efficient and responsive delivery of public\n            services within fiscally sound policies. While the Province\n            has largely been able to successfully implement the program,\n            due to the impact of the severe macroeconomic developments\n            in Argentina and the resulting deterioration in social\n            conditions, the Loan is being reformulated in terms of\n            waivers/amendments to individual conditions. In keeping with\n            the original development objective, the reformulated loan\n            would continue to support the Province of Santa Fe's\n            reform efforts to achieve fiscal stability at the provincial\n            level and promote structural reforms to improve the\n            efficiency, quality and equity of public spending,\n            particularly in the social sectors.      This Supplemental\n            Credit will be used to return the investment program for the\n            Road Maintenance Project for Albania to its original size,\n            improving about 1,000 km of the national road network and\n            about 1,000 km o f the rural road network. No changes to the\n            originally negotiated Credit are proposed. The Project is\n            expected to be completed by the original Closing Date."}, "docdt": "2003-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
