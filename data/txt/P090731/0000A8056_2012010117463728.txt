                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to support efforts by Dominica, Saint Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines to implement specific (integrated) pilot
                         adaptation measures addressing primarily, the impacts of climate change on their natural resource base, focused on biodiversity and land degradation along
                         coastal and near-coastal areas. This will be achieved through: (i) the detailed design of pilot adaptation measures to reduce expected negative impacts of
                         climate change on marine and terrestrial biodiversity and land degradation; and (ii) the implementation of pilot daptation investments. Reducing these impacts
                         will primarily result in protection of biodiversity and prevention of land degradation but will also induce economic benefits in the tourism, fisheries, agriculture
                         and forestry sectors, help maintain the resource base upon which these economic activities rely and promote climate resilient sustainable development. More
                         importantly, the experience gained through these local level activities will assist and inform the policy decision making process and is expected to influence the
                         enactment of climate resilient sustainable development policies.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         During this period the Implementing Agency (CCCCC) has made a substantial effort to advance the implementation of the project which is closing in December 31, 2011. Overall,
                         funds committed to date amount 1.891 Million dollars (90.09% of TF proceeds), and the disbursement totals 1.865 million (89%). In Component 1, the design phase of the five pilots
                         has been completed. In Component 2, the two pilot projects in St. Lucia have been completed. The pilot for water harvesting and recycling to protect natural areas in Vieux Fort was
                         officially handed over on October 23.
                         The pilot on reinforcement of critical coastal infrastructure in Castries has been completed in early December. In St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the pilot for decreasing pressure on
                         coastal aquifers in Bequia is almost completed. The activities envisioned to be fulfilled by the project have been completed, and include a fully operational desalination plant that is
                         already producing fresh water in the Paget Farm community; a renewable energy system that is currently producing the electricity needed to feed the desalination system; and the
                         procurement of two tanks for water storage. There remain some activities linked to the completion of the water distribution system, which is a local Government responsibility.

                         In Dominica, the updating of the management plans of two national parks is also finalized and is currently being submitted to Cabinet for consideration. The contract for the purchase
                         of two meteorological stations has recently been signed, final delivery is expected before end of the year. The designs of the pilot to improve livelihood of farmers of Milton State have
                         been revised and approved, and a contract for the procurement of an irrigation distribution system has been signed. The project will finance activities until end of the year, and the
                         rest of the costs will be covered by the implementing agency, CCCCC. Considering these two contracts in Dominica and outstanding payments in other ongoing contracts, the
                         disbursement is expected to reach 98.7% of TF proceeds by Project closing date
