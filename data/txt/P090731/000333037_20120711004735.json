Some lessons\n            learned included: early engagement of the user community\n            during the preparation of the pilot projects had a\n            significant and positive effect on the execution of the\n            pilot scale activities. This participation served to\n            maintain the visibility of the projects from the government\n            perspective and their early inputs aided in the design and\n            execution of effective pilot designs. This was particularly\n            effective in the case of the Bequia desalination plant and\n            the irrigation works in Dominica. In the pilot rainwater\n            harvesting effort on St. Lucia, the identification and\n            engagement of a motivated private sector partner was\n            critical to the success of the demonstration project. Hotel\n            participation was robust and their contribution both in\n            support for the pilot as well as their willingness to engage\n            other hotel owners provided for the successful\n            implementation of the conservation strategy, and turned into\n            a vehicle for educating others in the hotel sector about the\n            benefits of rain-water harvesting. Saint Lucia has used both\n            pilots to shape regulations and include new requirements\n            when building infrastructure in the country. The experience\n            they have gained through Special Program for Adaptation to\n            Climate Change (SPACC) has been critical in informing the\n            higher level decisions that have been taken; Saint Vincent\n            has also used the experience gained with SPACC to promote\n            solar energy in the island and gain insights on how to make\n            this process more efficient, and they have started the\n            supply of fresh water to the Grenadines. One of the lessons\n            they have extracted is the necessity to have clear\n            regulation on power purchase agreements for the electricity\n            utility to buy energy off from private producers. In\n            Dominica, the irrigation pilot has generated lessons on how\n            to implement infrastructure for a community of water users,\n            since this has been one of the first projects of its kind\n            developed by the Agriculture Ministry in consultation with\n            communities. Although SPACC is a regional project, there are\n            lessons from adaptation to each national context and\n            dissemination to the wider Caribbean. As such, a lesson\n            learnt is the need to provide more funding and efforts\n            towards knowledge management of the activities performed,\n            and a coherent, integrated monitoring system with\n            appropriate funding."}, "docdt": "2012-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
