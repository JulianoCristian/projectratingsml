                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to support efforts by Dominica, Saint Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines to implement specific (integrated) pilot
                         adaptation measures addressing primarily, the impacts of climate change on their natural resource base, focused on biodiversity and land degradation along
                         coastal and near-coastal areas. This will be achieved through: (i) the detailed design of pilot adaptation measures to reduce expected negative impacts of
                         climate change on marine and terrestrial biodiversity and land degradation; and (ii) the implementation of pilot daptation investments. Reducing these impacts
                         will primarily result in protection of biodiversity and prevention of land degradation but will also induce economic benefits in the tourism, fisheries, agriculture
                         and forestry sectors, help maintain the resource base upon which these economic activities rely and promote climate resilient sustainable development. More
                         importantly, the experience gained through these local level activities will assist and inform the policy decision making process and is expected to influence the
                         enactment of climate resilient sustainable development policies.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The restructuring of the Project in October 2010 provided the resources and instruments for achieving the objectives of supporting the implementation of adaptation measures to
                         address impacts of climate change. In the last 6 months the project has made a substantial progress in all components. In Component 1, the design of all pilots has been completed.
                         In Dominica the Report of the National Parks Management Plans has been reviewed by the Bank and submitted to the Borrower for approval; the design of the irrigation pilot in Milton
                         State and Bidding docs have been submitted to the Bank for clearance, and the implementation is estimated to be completed before project closing date. The procurement of services
                         and works for Saint Lucia have been completed. Procurement of desalination plant and photovoltaic system for Saint Vincent has been completed, only pending the purchase of two
                         plastic water tanks.. Contracts are under implementation in both countries. The Hurricane Thomas has caused delays in the implementation and restrictions in the availability of
                         counter parts funds. However, the improvement of project management and support by country teams indicate that successful completion of the project is likely before project closing
                         date.
