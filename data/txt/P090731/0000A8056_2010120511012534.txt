                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to support efforts by Dominica, Saint Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines to implement specific (integrated) pilot
                         adaptation measures addressing primarily, the impacts of climate change on their natural resource base, focused on biodiversity and land degradation along
                         coastal and near-coastal areas. This will be achieved through: (i) the detailed design of pilot adaptation measures to reduce expected negative impacts of
                         climate change on marine and terrestrial biodiversity and land degradation; and (ii) the implementation of pilot daptation investments. Reducing these impacts
                         will primarily result in protection of biodiversity and prevention of land degradation but will also induce economic benefits in the tourism, fisheries, agriculture
                         and forestry sectors, help maintain the resource base upon which these economic activities rely and promote climate resilient sustainable development. More
                         importantly, the experience gained through these local level activities will assist and inform the policy decision making process and is expected to influence the
                         enactment of climate resilient sustainable development policies.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Projects objetives of supporting Goverments of Dominica, St Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to implement adaptation measures to address impacts of Climate change
                         are extremelly relevant. In spite of initial slow start reflected in a low disbursement, in the last 6 months the project has achieved a substantial progress in all components. In
                         Component 1, the design phase of three out of the seven pilots has been completed: both pilots in St. Lucia (i.e., water harvesting and recycling to protect natural areas inVieux Fort,
                         and reinforcement of critical coastal infrastructure in Castries), and one of three pilots in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (i.e., decreasing pressure on coastal aquifers in Bequia). The
                         final draft report of one pilot in Dominica (upgrade national Parks ManagementPlans) has been submitted for approval; the design of the pilot in Milton State will begin in November
                         2010, and is estimated to be completed next February. The procurement of services and works in three of the five pilots is very well advanced. Thereadiness of several activities, the
                         improvement of project management and support by country teams indicate that successful completion of the project, as it has been restructured, is likely. A six-month extension of
                         project closing date has been granted to account for possible delays.
