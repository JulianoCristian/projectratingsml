7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The project development objective is to support efforts by Dominica, Saint Lucia and St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines to implement specific (integrated) pilot adaptation measures addressing primarily, the impacts 
of
climate change on their natural resource base, focused on biodiversity and land degradation along 
coastal and near-coastal areas. This will be achieved through: (i) the detailed design of pilot adaptation 
measures to reduce expected negative impacts of climate change on marine and terrestrial biodiversity and 
land degradation; and (ii) the implementation of pilot daptation investments. Reducing these impacts will 
primarily result in protection of biodiversity and prevention of land degradation but will also induce 
economic benefits in the tourism, fisheries, agriculture and forestry sectors, help maintain the resource base 
upon which these economic activities rely and promote climate resilient sustainable development. More 
importantly, the experience gained through these local level activities will assist and inform the policy 
decision making process and is expected to influence the enactment of climate resilient sustainable 
development policies.
