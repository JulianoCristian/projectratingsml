The main reasons for the restructuring are:\n            first, it is proposed to scale down the component and remove\n            two of the three pilots in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\n            This change results in a reduction of two pilot activities\n            out of the initial seven. The main reasons for the\n            government's decision not to implement the two pilots\n            are: (a) the high anthropological pressure on aquifers and\n            surface waters, increased by a generalized water scarcity\n            situation; and (b) the two other pilots have effectively\n            stalled due to land related issues. No portion of the Global\n            Environment Facility (GEF) grant has been used to finance\n            these two pilots. Second, there is a need to adjust the\n            project's outcome indicators to better reflect the\n            nature of the interventions. Intermediate outcome indicators\n            will also be changed accordingly. Third, some adjustments\n            need to be made in the disbursement categories to allow for\n            workshops and operating costs. Finally, the proceeds of the\n            grant must be reallocated to compensate for the financial\n            constraints that the participant countries have recently suffered."}, "docdt": "2010-10-05T00:00:00Z"}
