These adaptation measures will address\n            the impacts of climate change on the natural resource base\n            of the region, focused on biodiversity and land degradation\n            along coastal and near-coastal areas. Negative measures\n            include: dust, air quality, water quality, ecology, soil\n            erosion, natural habitat, waste management, and pest\n            management. Mitigation measures include: a) the water intake\n            will be submerged to 7m below the surface and is therefore\n            not expected to interfere with commercial and leisure\n            navigation;  b) prior consent from land-holders must be\n            obtained before accessing private property; c) excavation\n            surveys and analysis was conducted as required with the\n            results indicating that the site was in fact suitable for\n            construction of the 90,000 liters capacity tank recommended\n            for water storage; d) the salinity increase caused by plant\n            discharges can effectively be alleviated by pre?dilution\n            with other wastewater streams. However, the discharge\n            location has generally good mixing characteristics due to\n            strong wave action and currents. Hence, dispersion should be\n            rapid and impacts minimal even without pre-dilution; and e)\n            quality control procedures and personnel training shall be\n            implemented to avoid accidental discharges of hazardous chemicals."}, "docdt": "2011-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
