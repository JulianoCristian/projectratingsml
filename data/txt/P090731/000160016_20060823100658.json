The project also seeks to produce\n            knowledge o f global value on how to implement adaptation\n            measures in small island states that can be applied in other\n            countries in the region, not participating in the project\n            and even for islands in other regions o f the world. The\n            project would support four components, three of which will\n            be prioritized in national adaptation strategies and refined\n            through a series of regional and national consultations:\n            Component one identifies, evaluates, selects and designs\n            priority adaptation measures addressing impacts of climate\n            change on biodiversity and land degradation. Component two\n            implements selected adaptation measures designed to address\n            climate impacts on biodiversity and land degradation. The\n            project supports the coordination and implementation, of\n            pilot adaptation measures in seven sites in the\n            participating countries thereby enhancing the resilience o f\n            insular ecosystems with biodiversity assets under threat\n            from climate change. Component three strengthens the\n            national capacity to implement multiple multi-lateral\n            environmental agreements.
