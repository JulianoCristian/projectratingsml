           CROATIA -- EDUCATION SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

                            LOAN NO. 7332 HR

                                  Restructuring Paper



1. The closing date for Croatia Education Sector Development Project, Loan Number
   7332 HR, P086671 will be extended by six months from March 31, 2011 until
   September 30, 2011.

2. Implementation of the project-supported activities has been progressing satisfactorily.
   A State Matura secondary external school-leaving exam has been successfully
   introduced for the first time in 2010 after many years of preparation. A National
   Curriculum Framework focused on competencies and learning outcomes has been
   finalized and approved after more than three years of development, setting the ground
   for the preparation of subject curriculums. Implementation of the school construction
   program accelerated significantly, with construction/renovation of 30 schools
   completed and another 8 ongoing. Bank financing share in jointly financed activities
   increased from 40 to 100 percent in February 2010, which allowed for a rapid
   increase in loan funds utilization. Consequently, 2010 recorded the highest
   disbursement level since the project effectiveness, resulting in 87.8 percent of loan
   disbursed today. The action plan for Tendering/Contracting of remaining five
   contracts for Civil Works and nine contracts for School Furniture and equipment has
   been successfully implemented by December 2010. There are no outstanding audits
   for the loan.

3. The proposed extension is necessary to provide sufficient time to complete the civil
   works and school furniture and equipment contracts from the action plan, as well as
   several ongoing civil works contracts, which would enable full absorption of the
   remaining loan funds.

4. This will be the second extension of the project.
