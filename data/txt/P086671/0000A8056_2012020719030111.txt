                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project closed on September 30, 2011 after the loan's Closing Date was extended by six months to September 30, 2011 following the implementation of an Action Plan for
                         tendering/contracting the remaining 14 civil works/school furniture contracts earlier in 2011. Of these, all but five had been completed/delivered before the Closing Date. The State
                         Secretary of Science, Education and Sports sent a letter to the Bank confirming that the Ministry has secured other sources of financing for the five contracts that have not been
                         completed/delivered, either through the budgets of the local government and self-government units (co-financiers) or by means of obtaining an approval of the Government for multi-

                         remaining loan funds. The Government has the normal four-month grace period until January 31, 2012 to document expenditures incurred before the Closing Date, which has not

                         which reduced the number of pupils attending three-shift schools and drastically increased the number of pupils attending single-shift schools. Nevertheless, the Project’s outcomes
                         in terms of increasing net enrollment rates and improving learning outcomes measured by the PISA results were lower than expected. For that reason and due to issues with the
