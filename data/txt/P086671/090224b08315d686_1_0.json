Croatia\u2019s overarching priority was to enter the\n            EU with a competitive and growing economy and the\n            institutional capacity to meet the demands of EU membership.\n            To achieve this, several challenges needed to be overcome,\n            including completing Croatia\u2019s transition to a market\n            economy with a focus on private sector growth. International\n            Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has been\n            focusing its assistance on helping Croatia prepare for\n            successful EU integration by, raising the competitiveness of\n            the economy through long-term investments in major trading\n            routes such as the Ports of Rijeka and Ploce. IBRD has been\n            extensively engaged in providing financial support,\n            technical assistance, policy advice, and analytical services\n            to Croatia. The Agriculture Acquis Cohesion Project has\n            helped the country meet the EU accession requirements in the\n            agriculture and rural development areas. About 1,270 new\n            jobs have been created in underdeveloped and war-affected\n            areas across the country, rebuilding lives and livelihoods\n            through activities under the Social and Economic Recovery\n            Project. Energy Efficiency Project helped introduce energy\n            efficient lighting, heating and thermal insulation in more\n            than 50 schools across the country. Throughout its\n            engagement in Croatia, IBRD has developed and maintained\n            excellent partnerships with key international institutions\n            active in the country.Croatia\u2019s per capita income reached\n            about 63 percent of the EU average."}, "docdt": "2010-10-15T09:01:05Z"}
