The closing date for project\n            will be extended by six months from March 31, 2011 until\n            September 30, 2011. This extension is necessary to provide\n            sufficient time to complete the civil works and school\n            furniture and equipment contracts from the action plan, as\n            well as several ongoing civil works contracts, which would\n            enable full absorption of the remaining loan funds.
