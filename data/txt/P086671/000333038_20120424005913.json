to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            within the framework of an agreed program, it was possible\n            to avoid 'over preparation' of the Project,\n            focusing only on putting in place the fundamentals of a\n            clear, succinct framework for implementation of the program,\n            and hence for the Bank to respond in a timely manner to the\n            Government's request for financial assistance to\n            support it. The flexibility that the Bank applied in\n            incorporating fiduciary actions in the Project's early\n            implementation was also positive, and although the\n            Project's fiduciary risks had been rated substantial,\n            none of these materialized. Particular care should be\n            devoted to defining the expected outcomes of Projects that\n            support major reforms. This was mentioned in several places\n            in this report, but it is worth reiterating. It is highly\n            unlikely that a Project that supports curriculum reform,\n            teacher training, education Management Information System\n            (MIS) development, external assessment, etc., each of which\n            is to be implemented under the Project (and possibly subject\n            to delays), by institutions that are to be strengthened, can\n            produce notable results on learning outcomes in four years.\n            Also, in defining indicators, especially in the short term,\n            the use of relative indicators (e.g., Croatia's\n            performance relative to other EU countries) should probably\n            be avoided, since a country's relative position may be\n            impacted by the improving (or possibly deteriorating)\n            performance of other countries in the group. Finally, in\n            selecting indicators, it is best to select those that will\n            provide a yearly gauge of progress as opposed to those with\n            infrequent data."}, "docdt": "2012-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
