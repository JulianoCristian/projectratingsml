Conversely, on assessing the Basic Education Project\n            (PROMEB), the audit concurs with the ICR's ratings of\n            satisfactory outcomes, substantial institutional development\n            impacts, likely sustainability, and satisfactory Bank and\n            Borrower performances. Experience with the assessed\n            projects, confirm a number of the Operations Evaluation\n            Department - OED - lessons in the education sector: Despite\n            considerable quality-oriented investments by both the\n            assessed projects, progress in student performance has been\n            limited, confirming that educational project inputs, and\n            rising education budgets do not translate automatically into\n            increased student performance; rather, to increase\n            performance, teachers and students must use inputs\n            effectively, maximizing the instructional time students are\n            engaged in learning. While both assessed projects developed\n            action plans, their implementation was limited. Such actions\n            must be feasible within the budget, and human resources\n            available, and, Government officials must also clearly\n            perceive the need for plans, and the subsequent actions.\n            Notwithstanding, the PROMEB and its follow-up project\n            successfully involved the communities in the management of\n            rural schools, which suggests that decentralization of\n            school management to the community level, may mobilize local\n            support for the schools, thus increasing pride in\n            achievement by students, and teachers. However, although the\n            achievement tests developed through PROMEB provided valuable\n            monitoring information to the government, such outcomes were\n            not widely disseminated, and its use was limited: to be\n            valuable, however, the information must be disseminated\n            widely at the school level if possible, and actions must be\n            carried out based on the feedback it provides."}, "docdt": "2004-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
