Primary Education Management\n            Project (ADEPRIR) in Honduras. The specific objectives were\n            to (a) enhance the institutional capacity of SEP in the\n            areas of inter-ministerial coordination, sector policy\n            formulation, planning of education development, allocation\n            of expenditures (including coordination of development\n            assistance), and internal administration; and (b) assist the\n            Govemment to prepare and test an effective system for\n            administering rural primary schools, which would economize\n            on recurrent expenditures, improve cost-effectiveness, and\n            establish the basis for raising student achievement. Some\n            lessons learned included: Government policy changes and\n            original project objectives do not coincide. Project success\n            and ultimate sustainability require that during\n            implementation top-level ministerial authorities closely\n            monitor and provide support, and coordinate with other\n            sector development projects. The innovative rural primary\n            school management network scheme appears to viable, worth\n            strengthening and expanding. Close coordination among donor\n            agencies is needed in part to ensure that project management\n            capacity not be overloaded. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR)\n            pointed out that the major risk was State Secretariat of\n            Public Education (SEP's) limited managerial capacity."}, "docdt": "1996-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
