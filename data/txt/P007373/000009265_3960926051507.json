quality and\n            effectiveness of education while economizing on\n            expenditures.  It seeks to alleviate key constraints to the\n            Ministry of Public Education's (SEP) capacity to\n            effectively plan and carry out needed investments and\n            administer the educational system.  On this basis, the\n            project seeks to strengthen the structure and management\n            capacity of SEP and to decentralize the management of rural\n            primary education.  To this end, the Rural Primary Education\n            Management Project for Honduras aims to enhance the\n            management capacity and performance of SEP through technical\n            assistance.  It also seeks to assist SEP in developing and\n            testing an effective management and development planning\n            system for rural primary education which is designed to\n            economize on expenditures, improve cost-effectiveness and\n            establish the basis for raising student achievement.  In\n            line with this, the project provides technical assistance\n            and a micro-planning effort for rural schools in the project area."}, "docdt": "1987-04-06T00:00:00Z"}
