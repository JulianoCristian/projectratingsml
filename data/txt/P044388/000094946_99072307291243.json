specific measures were carried\n            out, and the major objectives of the projects were achieved\n            and assessed to be sustained. Key lessons learned are: a)\n            patience with slow developing components can pay off; b)\n            counterpart quality - a high level ally backed by a solid\n            team of dedicated counterparts can overcome serious\n            obstacles; c) consultants transfer skills - it is important\n            to make skills transfer an important part of the\n            consultant's terms of reference so that the consultant\n            knows they are being judged on this goal; d) adequate\n            supervision - intensive supervision is a key success factor\n            for projects in new member countries; and e) implementation\n            flexibility to maximize effectiveness of loan / credit proceeds."}, "docdt": "1999-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
