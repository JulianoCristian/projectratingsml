operations of the NFC Group, including: (i)\n            employment of expatriates to assist in managing the Multan\n            plant, (ii) a program to institute improved operations\n            management systems and controls and to provide overseas\n            training for local managers and technicians, and (iii) the\n            establishment of a technical training center.
