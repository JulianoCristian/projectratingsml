MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT AND THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA FOR
AN IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE INTENSIFICATION PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan for US$147.1 million and a proposed credit for SDR 139 million
(US$187.9 million equivalent) to the People's Republic of China. The loan would be
for a term of 20 years, including five years grace, at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate. The credit would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity.
The proposed loan and credit would help finance agricultural development in Anhui,
Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces. It is expected that the loan and credit would be
onlent by the Ministry of Finance to the Provinces for 15 years including 5 years of
grace with interest at 5 percent per annum. The provincial governments will onlend
to prefecture and county governments at the same terms. The foreign exchange risk
would be borne by the provincial governments.
2.          Background.  Agriculture in China provides sustenance for over 1.1
billion people; it is an important source of income for some 190 million farm
families and accounts for about 30% of the Gross Domestic Product. Only about 137
million ha of the country's 960 million ha of :and is arable. Nearly half of the
cropped area is irrigated. Farming systems are intensive, requiring heavy inputs of
labor, fertilizers, small machinery and water. Intensive farming has allowed China
to meet her basic food requirements and to produce an increasingly sophisticated mix
of cash and commercial crops. Food grains occupy about 70% of the total cropped
land and account for about one-third of agriculture output. China's rural reform
introduced in 1978 has also produced impressive growth and structural changes by
introducing the& Noduction responsibility system, increasing producer prices, and
expanding the role of the market. The gross value of agricultural output increased
by about 5% annually between 1978 and 1988. Despite this growth, the Government's
main concern has been the stagnating grain production of about 400 million tons per
year since 1984 excerE  for the two successive bumper harvests in 1989 (408 million
tons) and 1990 (435 . 'lion tons), due in part to favorable weather.
3.          Constraints in Irriaated Agriculture.  Since irrigation allows both
higher cropping intensity and yields, the productivity of irrigated land in China is
about twice that of rainfed land. Irrigated agriculture accounts for about two
thirds of total grain production and three quarters of commercial crops production.
The area of irrigated farmland more than doubled from about 20 million ha in 1952 to
45 millon ha in 1976. Despite past success, China now fames numerous problems in
the irrigation sub-sector. Many of the large irrigation schemes, constructed in the
1950e and 1960e with poor quality materials and equipment, are deteriorating and
aging, requiring major upgrading and rehabilitation to sustain production. Many
schemes still lack drainage and irrigation networks at the tertiary and farm
levels -- that local governments were to construct -- for efficient water
management. Operation and maintenance have been inadequate in many areas. Large
tracts of cultivated land have been affected by waterlogging and salinity as a
result of excessive irrigation without effective drainage to control the rise of
water table level. Groundwater resources have been over-exploited, leading to
serious drawdown of water level and land subsidence, especially in the North China
Plain. Resources allocated by central and provincial governments frequently have
not been matched by funding from county and township governments. Measures to
alleviate some of these problems were curtailed by cuts in the government budget for
irrigation beginning in 1980. State capital investments in irrigation have
rebounded somewhat since 1985, but still fall short of pre-1980 levels.



2
4.          Agricultural support services for irrigated farming still leave much
room for improvement. The national extension services, seed production system and
the agro-machinery services need strengthening and expansion to serve a wider
coverage of farming communities and to provide better quality of services.
Additional investments in facilities, equipment, research and staff training are
needed.
5.          ontiong for Grain Production.  The Government plans to increase annual
grain production to meet demands resulting from population and income growth.
Although changes in the incentive system have brought about large one-time increases
in yields, there is little room for effective additional increases through new
policy reforms alone. Most of the available land has been cultivated, and newly
developed lands are generally offset by the conversion of cultivated land to non-
agricultural use. Therefore, increases in grain production would have to come
largely from increased yields from existing cultivated land. Because bringing new
land under irrigation entails high capital costs and takes time to reach full
development, the Government is giving priority to upgrading and rehabilitating
existing irrigation facilities. The North China Plain (NCP), with its good
transportation links, favorable soils and climatic conditions, has the greatest
potential for yield increases and is given top priority for development.
6.          lessong Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement.  Of the 26
operations involving a total assistance of about Us$2.8 billion in the agricultural
sector, the Bank has supported eight lending operations totalling US$820 million for
irrigated agriculture which focuses on land development, irrigation and drainage,
and upgrading of agricultural support services. The first two projects have been
successfully completed and implementation of the remaining projects is on schedule.
7           Some of the highly successful project features of the completed North
China Plain Agriculture Project (Credit 1261-CHA) have been adopted, with
appropriate modifications, in the planning and design of this proposed project.
These includes (i) engineering techniques to reclaim land affected by waterlogging
and salinity; (ii) development of cropping patterns best suited to local soil and
climatic conditions; (iii) establishment of windbreaks, tree borders and rows to
improve agro-environment; (iv) early establishment of a highly decentralized project
management structure with the main thrust at county and township levels; and (v)
active participation by project farmers in project implementation by carrying out
earthwork construction and O0) works with contribution labor. The Heilongjiang Land
Reclamation Project (Ln.2261/Cr.1347-CHA) has successfully introduced modern
drainage machinery for construction of drainage works and high-powered imported
agro-mchinery for large-scale farming.
8.          Rationale fog BankilDA Involvement.  In contrast to the Bank's past
support for crop production and peasant agriculture on a provincial basis, the
present project would address crop production over a large geographical area
spanning three provinces. This makes it possible to introduce an integrated package
of investments and inputs throughout the relevant agro-climatic zones. In
particular, the project would improve irrigation efficiency through the technical
assistance, staff training and O&M equipment provided. By increasing the
productivity of large tracts of low- and medium-yield lands, the project also would
ameliorate poverty among some 2.8 million farm families, and thereby address the
rural income imbalance in the three provinces. 
9.          Proiect Objectives. The maln objective is to ameliorate poverty and
support efforts to increase production of staple food in the NCP by improving and
expanding irrigation schemes to permit greater productivity on low- and medium-yield
areas. In particular, project investments in irrigation and drainage systems would
overcome drought, waterloggin, soil salinity an.. flooding that currently constrain



3
yields. The complementary agricultural support services would ensure sustainability
of the projected productivity.
10.         Protect Descriltion.  The project has three main componentes (a)
irgication and Drainace would be improved and expanded on about 1.14 million ha
covering sections of 73 counties in the three provinces with improvement, new
construction and completion of canals and drains; irrigation pumping stations;
tubewells, sub-surface pipe systems, control structures, culverts, bridges, access
roads, and construction of on-farm works; (b) Acricultural Supoort Services which
includes (i) land leveling (333,000 ha) and deep plowing (470,000 ha) to improve
soil texture; (ii) provision of fertilizers, agro-chemicals and plastic sheeting;
(iii) strengthening of 73 county seed centers through provision of facilities,
machinery and equipment; (iv) construction of 18 new county agro-technical extension
centers (CATECs), expansion and upgrading of 55 existing CATECs and 688 township
stations; (v) improvement and upgrading of 500 township agro-machinery service
stations wlth facilities and equipment; (vi) establishment of field border rows,
windbreaks, and shelter belts to increase forest cover; and (vii) construction of
2,165 km of rural roads in Anhui to link 776 villag-,s to existing roads; and (c)
Institutional Revelopment including: (i) training of farmer technicians and
demonstration households in agricultural practices, and project staff in irrigated
agricultural technology, project management, monitoring and evaluation; (ii) 23
person-months of engineering-related technical assistance to upgrade technical
skills; and (iii) provision of equipment and facilities to support a range of
operation and applied research programs in irrigation and drainage, and agricultural
practices.
11.         Environment.  Project activities would have no adverse effect on the
environment. On the contrary, drainage improvement, eliminating the incidence of
waterlogging and soil salinity, tree planting and more efficient use of surface and
groundwater would enhance the environments of the project areas. However, to
sustain the projected agricultural productivity, environmental management programs
have been included under the project to monitor the water and agricultural
resources. To implement the programs, each province has established an
environmental unit. The project would provide equipment, facilities and training of
staff.
12.         Pjoect Coste and Imolementation.  The project, to be implemented over
five years, provides funds for civil works, land improvement, afforestation,
vehicles, machinery, equipment, construction and agricultural production materials,
training, research and technical assistance. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$593 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$334.7 willion
(56.4%). To take advantage of the non-irrigation season and idling period of
farming activities during the 1990-91 winter, retroactive financing totalling US$15
million has been recommended for expenditures on earthworks, small structures, land
improvement and small quantitios of equipment and materials Lncurred after November
1, 1990. A sunmary of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and
the status of lank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The relevant project maps are attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 9290-CHA, dated April 25, 1991, is being distributed separately.
13.         Aareed Actlong.  To enaure effective implementation of the project, the
central and provincial governments have agreed that each province would: (a) carry
out training according to programs reviewed in advance by the Bank/IDA; (b) only
procure pesticides approved by the Bank/IDA and follow the Bank Group and, where
applicable, the Ministry of Agriculture guidelines on their storage, handling,
distribution and use; (c) furnish results of the annual environmental management



4
programs to the Dank/IDA; (d) prepare and implement a Plan of Operation and
Maintenance for each large surface water irrigation scheme; (e) collect water
charges at rates to be revilsed periodically to meet at least the full annual O0&M
costs; and (f) furnish to the Bank/IDA annual reviews and analyses of quantities and
prices of grain procured under government contracts and those sold by farmers at
negotiated and free market prices, and the annual price and production incentives
for cotton provided ,.y governments to farmers for the preceding year and recommended
for the current year. In addition, Shandong and Anhui would furnish to the Bank/IDA
results of annual monitoring and assessment of groundwater resources and quality in
tubewell irrigation areas.
14.         senefilt.  At full development, the project would produce incremental
annual production of 2.5 million tons of grain valued (net of on-farm coats) at
US$422.3 million, 56,300 tons of lint cotton valued at US$80.5 million, 82,600 tons
of oilseeds valued at US$15.5 million, and 65,100 tons of other crops valued at
US$9.4 million. The total value of incremental crop output is valued at US$527.7
million. The incremental production of grain and oilseeds under the project would
not be subject to comrulsory state procurement and farmers would be allowed to sell
them freely. Afforestation investments would produce annually 609,000 cubic meters
of timber and 40,500 tons of fuelwood valued at US$34 million. The economic rate of
return for the project as a whole is 26.50. Per capita incomes would increase by
40% in Anhui, from Y511 (US$97.9) to Y713 (US$137), by 42% in Jiangsu, from Y424
(US$81.2) to Y603 (US$116), and by 24% in Shandong, from Y553 (US$105.9) to Y684
(US$131). The project would also create employment for about 450,000 person-years
during the construction period and 232,000 person-years of regular employment after
project completion.
15.         Raiks.  Project risks have been identified and measures have been taken
to mitigate their effects as follows: (i) on institutional capability to implement
the project, the three provinces have experience with implementation of Bank Group
projects and management organizatione are in place with qualified staff whose skills
would be further upgraded with training provided under the project; (ii) the
probability of declining water availability in the Yellow River for diversion to
Nansi Lake occurring beyond the year 2000 has been reflected in the economic
analysis; (iii) a contingency plan has been provided under the project to minimize
effect of water shortage during drought years for the Jiangsu project area; (iv)
the risk of depleting groundwater resources in Shandong would be minimizeo through
the water-saving irrigation techniques introduced under the project; (v) the
enhanced O&ff and raising of water fees to meet full annual O&M costs would ensure
adequate maintenance of facilities and irrigation efficiency; and (vi) the expected
productivity will be sustained as the expected crop yields are realistic and have
been actually achieved by large-scale extension efforts in similar areas in the
North China Plain.
16.         *egg=ggation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Associatlon and recomend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan and credit.

original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
